Alright- As a San Diegan, its time for my obligatory Phil's BBQ review. I am enamored with their service, food and simply the way they run their business. Phil's is a superb example of a successful restaurant that takes care of their customers and offers consistently awesome food thats always piping hot and so fresh, you can almost smell the grass in the meat (not really, that would be gross- its just hyperbole, DUH). Seriously, though, the meat is excellent. Phils is probably the only restaurant where I hope they mess up my order, because they overcompensate for it. For example, if they forget to give you a side with something, they will either give you an extra side or deduct from the price of your meal. I always hope for the extra side, because there really are no words to express what getting their food for free feels like. This having been said, its not the best BBQ joint i have been to. Its up there for sure, but its not the best, and Im sorry to admit it. However, all things considered, and the awesome service I have some to expect from this establishment, you really shouldn't give Phil's BBQ less than five stars.

Best ribs I've ever had! Not that I've eaten that many ribs though... Got here around 11:30am on a Tuesday and the place was pretty empty. There was a small line to order food though. Tons of parking! We got our first timer noob stickers and asked the lady for recommendations. She suggested the half plate of baby-back ribs for each of the members of my college male party and we agreed. I got the macaroni salad and fries as the side since she said the fries were the greatest thing since the Phil's BBQ ribs. Grabbed a big table for our group and our pagers went off pretty quickly to get our food. It's a huge plate loaded with 6-7 ribs, fries, and a ton of macaroni. Once I got my knife and fork, I seasoned the entire plate with some spicy powder of some sort. I'd gotten the ribs before as takeout and they were as soft and slid off the bone like I remember. Mine were a little salty today though, but it wasn't a deal breaker. $15.07 for the price conscience! Overall, I'd say you have to try this place given the hype and I doubt you'd be disappointed.

Phil, O' Phil.. You will kill me. When I first stepped foot here, there was a line. When I say a line.. I mean A LINE. I felt like I was waiting at Six Flags trying to get on a ride. There's signs on there telling you 15 min wait. With a BIG menu outside and TV for your entertainment while you wait in line. So you go in, they give you a 'newbie' sticker if it's your first time.   Order your food, pay and find a sit with a buzzer. Wait for the buzzer to go off so you can get your stomach filled and taste buds in heaven. I tried their baby back pork ribs, beef ribs and bone-in chicken.  All smothered in BBQ sauce. Their baby back ribs are just awesome.. they are just AWESOME.   Beef Ribs are a little tough, but has big chunks of meat.   Chicken was very tender as well. Their sauce is a bit too tangy for my taste, but it is very very flavorful. So why only 4 stars ? This place has a large seating area, but the outside waiting line is just too crazy. And I can't take too much of the sauce, it can get too rich. And I ended up hating myself and find myself full after 8 hours of consuming all the meats. The salads (potato salad or macaroni salad) are given in a bowl-size scoop as well.  Very heavy, GREAT for comfort food, but a little too heavy for me. I highly recommend coming if you haven't been before.   Plan to come hungry and a huge appetite.

Believe all the 5-star reviews. I can't add much more than what has been reviewed here in detail time after time. There's always a line but it is most definitely worth the wait. The meatiest, most tender, tastiest baby back ribs I've ever had. And the sauce...WOW. The BBQ sauce here is tangy with a hint of heat and I absolutely loved it, which was a surprise since I normally prefer a sweet sauce. If you love BBQ you absolutely must go here when you find yourself in San Diego.

You know when food is so good and you wish that it had no calories and you could just stuff your face?  Well, I am convinced that if you eat Phil's often enough, this wish will come true. I LOVE this place. It is so amazing. I never leave disappointed. Baby back ribs, cole slaw, fries are my go to menu items.   You may or may not have to wait in a long line...I'd tell you my secret, but then it wouldn't be a secret now, would it? San Diegans and visitors rejoice in the majesty that is Phil's BBQ.

I drove all the way from LA, so seeing this place as the most popular resto in San Diego meant I had to give it a try. The lines! It's insane, it just opened and the lines reach all the way to the parking lot. Service was exceptional, this guy named Alfredo made us feel very welcome at Phil's, and made sure everything was okay on our first visit to Phil's. A lot of value for money but I can't say they're the best ribs I've had. The ribs are tasty, but not "fall off the bone" tender (which i actually prefer, to have a bit of a bite to the ribs) and delicious. The servings are HUGE, I'm shocked at how people can finish one order on their own! 3 people can share a full rack of ribs, or 2 on a best of both worlds plate. But there is nothing too special to make me really come back for it on my next visit to San Diego.

I can't go to Phil's without stuffing myself, licking all the barbecue sauce off my plate, licking everyone else at my table's plate clean, and getting into a shoving match with some strangers in order to lick their plates.  I can't help it, happens every time. The barbecue sauce is sweeter than most which makes everything almost dessert-like.  The onion rings are killer, the perfect way to start at Phil's.  I usually order one of the rib dinners with potato salad and beans.  Everything is delicious, you really can't go wrong.  Thank god there is always a line out the door, otherwise I would be there a lot more often, and I would be much heavier. The only reason for 4 starts instead of 5 is that there is no tri-tip dinner, only the sandwich.  I usually order one to go for lunch the next day (unless it gets eaten as dessert), but would be much happier if I could get some tri-tip with my meal.

3.5 Stars It's taken me a couple of times eating here to realize that the focus isn't really upon the meat. Yes, I still enjoy Phil's BBQ  because it's fun to sit in a busy restaurant with a nice plate of ribs and sides, gnawing porky bites, and licking sauce off your fingers. Anyone who would like to focus on the natural flavors and juices of the meat, will find this isn't the place - much of the flavor is from the tasty sauce drowning the meat. I think I could buy the a bottle of their sauce, slather it on grilled meats, and end up with much the same taste at home. The macaroni salad, potato salad, and cole slaw are also heavy with the a well-doused sweet mayonnaise taste.

It's hard to argue against this place having the best ribs in San Diego. If you want to find better ribs, you'll need to travel to the South, some place like Tennessee or Texas. They are really that good and worth the wait in the long line. The average wait is usually around 30 minutes to get your order in. After you order, you can just find a spot to sit while you wait for your food. If you don't want to wait in line, you can try and find a place in the bar. If you're not into ribs, they also have good BBQ chicken. I love their corn on the cob. The parking here can be a pain in the butt, so bring your patience. Everyone that works here goes out of their way to be super friendly. It's probably a requirement to work here. :)

This place is AMAZING!!!! I am not much of a BBQ er but Ive been going to this place for a few years because once I had it I just cant get enough!!! If your ever in the area just roll down the car window and POW the aroma!! My favorite are the BBQ BEEF Rib's! the only bummer is they are always busy with a line wrapping around the building.....but that's just how great their BBQ is! Ive never seen a business with a continuous line like this place has. But totally worth the wait!

Man oh Man.. Beef ribs is all you will need. Three ribs that were the size of my forearms with potato salad and fries for $13? Why yes please. Oh you have beer and sangria as well?... Sure, I don't mind if I do haha Huge portions, my fiancee had 5 pork ribs and they were to die for as well.  We arrived at 10:30pm on a saturday night and there was no line to order food or drinks. Service was prompt, tables were clean but benches were a bit messy. TV's everywhere.  It was a pretty nice spot. They didn't have brisket though; I heard that it was pretty good too according to other reviews. Guess I'll have to go back, Darn! haha If haven't tried it, you definitely must. The sauce was spicy, tangy, and right on the money. It's a shame if your around and don't swing by

Good baby back ribs and chicken. Baked bean has been too much pepper. It's good. They provide no side bread or biscuit. It would make it even better. Fast service but crowded. Potato salad taste a bit plain. It's missing something.

The service was fast and SUPER friendly! Customer service at it's finest! We came about 1/2 hour after it opened and it had a line out the door but our wait was no longer than 20 minutes people know to get in and get out... I had their trio beef sandwich I believe it was called - very saucy and yummy and the bread it was between was also tasty We also got a platter with bbq chicken, pork ribs both were very tender and yummy and the coleslaw and potato salad were also good onion rings were delicious too The chocolate moon pie was a nice sweet ending to our meal.

I definitely agree with all the positive reviews of the place! I love ribs cooked in such a way that it falls off the bone and the ribs here are exactly that. The beef ribs here are spectacular and so delicious and the portions are big. You get what you pay for at Phil's BBQ. I didn't think their BBQ chicken was that great but the ribs take the cake. Every time I'm in San Diego I try to make it to Phil's. I know the wait can get quite long on the weekends so be prepared for that. Definitely recommend this place to all!

Everything here is amazing! The food, the service, the atmosphere all superb!  I have never been disappointed eating here.  I will warn you there is most likely going to be a very long wait.  But the wait is nothing compared to how bad it could be.  The fantastic customer service and employe attitudes make the process smooth and painful.   I always get a rib platter, and my boyfriend loves their sandwiches.  No matter what you get it is fresh and extremely tasty.  I highly recommend the onion rings.  They are perfectly crisp and flavorful.   For what you are getting it is extremely well priced.  Go to Phil's you won;t be sorry and you will go back.

I LOVE BBQ! I ate at one of the top rated BBQ houses in the Country a few years ago. I dream of it still to this day. The BBQ sauce at that place I would use as a sexual lubricant if possible. Why can't this happen? Get on this science! I also would like Benihana mustard sauce given similar treatment, just putting it out there. Let's get back to Phil's which is good BBQ especially in a town not known for great BBQ. We are known for Mexican food and sunshine. I had the brisket sandwich which is incredibly good and filling. The prices are reasonable and the ribs are great. If you are a tad drunk this food tastes a thousand times better and you will swear that it is the best food you've ever eaten. You will then sober up and come to you senses but still feel satisfied.

Honestly the food isn't bad but I've had way better bbq at random crap shack places in LA. From the 4000+ reviews of 4 & 5 stars I wasn't expecting to be blow away, but I was expecting something good. The Wood Ranch bbq chain has better tasting food & they're just a slightly above average BBQ place. I'm not sure how they actually make their food here at Phil's but its pretty much ready when you order it so that might explain the underwhelming taste. When you get here there's a line outside the door & around the first corner of the building. It may seem really long which it is but the way they operate it pretty much makes up for it with the amount of time you'd spend waiting at a regular restaurant. The wait to get in was about 40 mins, once you're inside you order at the counter, they give you a pager, & by the time you fine somewhere to sit your food is ready to be picked up. That 40 minute line is kind of like being on a 20 minute waiting list somewhere else, being seated, waiting to order, then waiting for your food to arrive. You're almost waiting the same amount of time, but here you're standing the entire time. Outside while you're waiting they have menus posted so you can go over what you want before you get inside, they also have a self seating bar area where you can go eat if you don't want to wait in the line. Overall it's a nice place, it runs pretty smoothly but I wouldn't bother coming back a second time for the food. It was decent but decent BBQ isn't good bbq. I tried the beef & pork ribs, & the brisket sandwich. The portions are big & worth the price but like I said before the taste isn't there. None of the food taste like it was grilled or smoked, probably cooked in an over & covered with BBQ sauce.

I've always enjoyed their ribs, and for those, I think they are very good.  But recently I popped in for a lunch with a friend and we just wanted a sandwich - we were disappointed. We ordered the "El Toro" which is "Char-grilled deli sliced tri-tip topped with BBQ sauce".  Essentially we thought we were getting slices of tri-tip from a bbq, but instead it was more like a hash of bits and pieces, all chopped up like carne asada.  It wasn't very tasty, unless you smothered it in bbq sauce, which seemed to defeat the purpose of the char-grilling flavor.  I would just stick to ribs if you want the best they offer.

5 Stars easily! Customer Service was exceptional.  If you are visiting for the first time, they give you a sticker on your shirt.  This makes it known so that the workers can treat you like VIP.  I definitely felt the love from all of Phil's BBQ employees El Toro Sandwich So hot and overfilling with tri-tip.  This sandwich in itself is worth waiting in line for.  So tender and juicy and you can easily get filled up with this sandwich alone. Beef Ribs Get the meal with 3 ribs.  You will definitely not finish as the helpings are huge!  The ribs are very tender with the right amount of fat on it.  It's like having 3 pieces of steak with the amount of meat on each bone. Onion Rings These onion rings are colossal and cooked to perfection.  The onion doesn't slip out which makes for the perfect onion ring. The batter is much like a tempura batter.  These rings are so good when you dip them in the ranch.  Buy a large order and share with your buddies.  3 rings will leave you satisfied. Definitely a must go to if you're in the San Diego area.

There is really no need to restate what 4000+ other people have said, so I'll sum it up as follows: Awesome food (beef ribs were spectacular), great service (gal working our section stopped by every 5 minutes to see how we're doing), and very affordable ($28 fed 2x adults and 2x kids -- with food to spare). The only issue I have with this place is that it is over 1-hour away from my house.

After living in London for many years, the Brits don't quite understand why I crave BBQ so often. There really is nothing like it in London for the atmosphere or the price! There is Bodean's, but it just feels too fancy to be good ol' BBQ. Firstly, Phil's has tons of real estate, which is a major bonus! It really can house hundreds of people. I love that seating is so low-key, but you have to strategic about it! Suck up to a table that's almost finished and swoop in. These are the baby back ribs I've had in a long time. And though I'm not in SD often, I think I'll be coming back here every time I'm here to satisfy my BBQ cravings!

Baby back ribs bursting with BBQ sauce with the meat falling off the bones. Ginormous onion rings fried to a perfect crisp paired with the buttermilk ranch. Mac salad with the tangy sauce that was just right. OH MY GOODNESS. I just drooled as I typed the description of those finger licking good food that I got last time. It's one of the places that has received many positive reviews and truly deserve it. Phil's is the epitome of heaven.

BABY BACK RIBS!! YUMMMMMM. Can't say much about their other meats since I'm addicted to their baby back's like a crack whore - so I tend not to stray from what gives my tummy the most satisfaction. The full dinner with two sides is more than enough to feed two, especially if you are dinning here (I swear they give you more of the side dishes when you eat here) but sometimes the wait is something that my stomach will not tolerate so we order to-go, which is great because you get to walk past the HUGE line of starving addicts and right up to the pickup register while everyone looks on with envy. We normally get the ribs dry with sauce on the side, sadly, their bbq sauce is a little too sweet for my taste. With the sauce on the side, you can find your perfect ratio of meat to sauce, it's also pretty good with the fries! Their onion rings are also quite tasty, but the killer is their whoopie pies! Man those things are so soft and you know that is just going straight to your arteries...but, alas, you are an addict and there is no self control.

Okay, I am now a fanboy in the 5-star-awarding fan club of Phil's BBQ! I was only staying 3 miles from here attending a conference so it was a no brainer coming back here. To avoid the Valentine's Day dinner crowd, we arrived here early, around 6pm. There was barely any parking and the line was already forming. Had we gotten here 10 minutes later, I think the wait would've been at least 40 minutes, but we got in within 20 minutes! Let me say something about my first visit that I didn't mention in my previous review. While waiting in line for an hour, I made the mistake of getting... intoxicated which prevented me from fully appreciating the food. I say this because I stayed sober this time and the food was so much better. The baby back ribs, fries, onion rings, cole slaw, all tasted great. The BBQ sauce, which I felt was too tangy on my first visit was perfect this time. The meat was falling off the bones and I was falling in love... And we had so much onion rings because the table next to us gave us their left overs while we waited for ours! The workers going around the tables were so nice. I don't remember them from before, but we totally worked this guy. Extra BBQ sauces, ranch, towels, etc., he was so cool about all our demands! I had such a good time at Phil's BBQ that I would end up eating Phil's for dinner 3 nights in a row... LOL!

i cannot believe i haven't written a review for phils yet... OMGOODNESS where do i start. BEEFY RIBS = YES MAC SALAD = YES ONION RINGS = YES BAKED BEANS = YES PORK RIBS = YES only downside is no cornbread.. BUT EVERYONE MUST COME HERE i always get the beefy ribs and chickless dinner, and of course i always have leftovers. but i LOVE the leftovers.. the onion rings are massive and sooooo crispy and you can taste the beer. I usually love coleslaw and i do get it here, but the mac salad is the best side. The potato salad is decent too, but trust me on the mac salad. the baked beans are also a yum, but if you had to choose one... go with the mac salad.. Also, first timers: get the beefy rib... you will not regret it. i get the chicken, but sometimes the pieces can be dry. theyre still good, but yeah.. its funny. i recommend this place to everyone that visits sd.. yet i dont even come here as often as i think of bbq.. i dont know why, but i still love it. its probs the wait... honestly, order it to go... its so much faster!

Be prepared for a long wait if you want to eat here, but know that it is well worth it. Juicy, scrumptious, finger-licking food BBQ. Best BBQ in San Diego by far. I'm currently drooling while thinking of some BBQ. We opted to do the take out line since the dine in line was at least an hour and a half wait. We ordered, 15 minutes later we had our food. BBQ chicken, beans, ribs, french fries. All the goodness in two little Styrofoam boxes. Customer service was exceptional. This is a must try in San Diego. Don't think about, just drive there now!

The food was a little mixed, but we had excellent service and enjoyed our experience.  We tried a number of things: - Chicken - cooked fairly well, still relatively moist inside.  The bbq sauce was tangy, and not too sweet; I liked it better than the generic bbq sauce at most restaurants, though I prefer something a little smokier. - Ribs - fairly tender and moist.  Same bbq sauce. - Pulled pork sandwich - I wasn't a huge fan of this, the pork was on the dry side. - Onion rings - these were good.  Big rings, tasty batter.  Greasy, but that's to be expected. - Corn on the cob - usually I wouldn't include a description of the corn, but we really liked this.  The corn was cooked well, so that the kernels were cooked through but still taut.  The corn itself was very sweet, and I was glad that it wasn't drowning in butter and salt. The service was fantastic, and the restaurant is set up very well.  You order at the front, and then can sit anywhere available.  IDespite the large volume of diners steadily moving through, the staff is quick to clean up, so that pretty much all the available tables are clean and ready.  They are also very attentive.

Just had lunch at Phil's BBQ in Midway.  Had the Tri-Tip sandwish.  It was good but I took 1 star away because it was swimming in sauce.  The sauce overpowered the meat.  Onion Rings were very good and also the corn on the cob.  Next time I'll order the sauce on the side.  I know there was a good sandwish in there somewhere. I took another star off due to their stupid tip policy.  My wife paid at the order counter and added a tip to the bill.  Later I told the server we added the tip when I ordered, so he didn't think we stiffed him.  And he told me they did not share tips.  He only kept the tips left on the table.  Only the order staff and cooks got the tips that were added to the bill.  And how does the customer (without asking directly) find this out?  So, we left another tip at the table. Another employee was going around asking everyone how was their meal, and she confirmed this was the Phil's policy.  I told her I thought It was unfair to the employees and suggested they provide their tip policy on a sign at the order counter.  Just so all the customers are aware of it when ordering.

Made a special trip to San Diego when I saw that Phil's BBQ was one of the top rated restaurants in America. There was a line outside but it moved fast and they had people to help first-timers with the menu before you ordered. I had the Baby Back Ribs and the boneless BBQ chicken and they were so good; delicious and fell off of the bone. My friend had the beef ribs and he just loved them. Portions are large. The people taking care of you at the restaurant were very friendly and provided great service to everyone. I have a feeling that my car will be making more trips down this way soon. Definitely worth it!

This BBQ joint is a legend in San Diego, but I'm guessing most people who eat there have never had real BBQ in Texas or Kansas. The food was okay, but having lived in Texas for a few years, I'm surprised a BBQ place didn't have brisket on the menu. The closest thing they had was a tri tip sandwich, which I ordered and enjoyed. (Think sandwich is called El Toro.) The best part about this place is that they let us drink the sangria we ordered from the bar in line while we waited for our table. Don't go to this place if you have to eat right this second.

First timer! I didn't give this place 5 stars because people definitely hyped it up for me. Don't get me wrong, my baby back ribs were amazing. I got the best of both worlds: ribs, chicken, and 2 sides (potato salad and macaroni salad). I thought the potato salad was bland but my best friend loved it. I wish I got what my best friend got, Phil's tickler. I got a bite of her onion rings.... Best onion rings I've ever had!!! TIP: Don't get chicken. It's not worth it! But their service does deserve 5 stars. Their set up is awesome. Although the line was ridiculously long, the 25-30 minute was okay cause once I ordered, I literally sat down half a butt cheek and my buzzer immediately lit up. This place is good for large groups cause you pay up front when you order :) Everyone is super friendly too, which is always a plus. I'm going to go eat my leftovers now, hahaha!

The boy and I got a full baby back rib dinner, with potato salad and french fries. IT WAS SO GOOD. The meat was so soft, it melted off the bone. The sauce had a light smokiness to it and was just delicious. The thing that is ridiculous here? THE WAIT. We came for lunch and left because the wait was going to be about an hour. We came back for dinner, and ended up waiting for over an hour and a half to get food. Next time I'm down in San Diego, I'm going to try the takeout option because waiting for sit down is not quite worth it.

Their meat is good but the 2nd ingredient in their bbq sauce is high fructose corn syrup.  It reflects poorly on the "foundation of quality" that they describe on their website.

I think this place is most definitely Over-hyped...! Came here with my best friend and boyfriend after an amazing day at the San Diego Zoo.. We called ahead to ask if there was a wait and sure enough there was.. So we decided to just place an order for pick-up and eat in the car HAHA.. Walking past that HUGE line I was reassured we made the right decision. I don't think any food is worth waiting that long in the cold. We got baby back ribs, beef ribs, bbq chicken, steamed veggies, onion rings, macaroni salad, coleslaw and baked beans. Out of all of that I would say my favorite dish was the beef..beefy? ribs haha those things were huge and pretty tender.. Everything else was just average to me. I would have been angry if I waited in a 2 hour line for that. Or maybe that's why everyone thinks Phil's is so tasty...??? Because by the time you actually get to eat your food ANYTHING & everything would taste amazing? hmmmm LOL Any who.. I'm not saying Phil's BBQ doesn't taste good.. It just didn't meet my expectations from all these rave reviews. HOP TIP: I highly recommend ordering take out and eating in your car haha it actually was not as difficult as we had imagined. Nothing extra wet naps and plastic bags can't handle ;]]]

With onion rings that would make a baker at dunkin donuts feel insecure and a sauce that could put a smile on the face of one of the farmers in the Dodge Ram Super Bowl commercial Phil's is def holding all the chips in the BBQ game here in SD.   Had the trio plate and each piece of flesh was fall off the bone good.  I have no one to impress so I bibbed up and got weird.  Phil's is solid but only getting 4 stars because I have had BBQ in Texas and c'mon ya'll, we aint in Texas.

I had been hearing about this place forever.  On a recent visit to SD I made it a point to stop here to eat.  The anticipation was building as we waited in the loooong line.  Well...I guess I was just hungry for some good, old fashioned, delicious, BBQ.  I mean 4000+ people couldn't be wrong, right?  Right?!?!   I lost my faith in humanity....ok maybe not.  Just maybe the culinary intellect of people in Southern California.   This place should be called "Phil's Oven Baked Ribs".  THIS IS NOT BBQ!!!!  They don't smoke their meats!!!!  Seriously, to call Phil's "BBQ" is blasphemy!!!  BBQ is meat cooked low and slow involving charcoal and wood smoking. And Phil's does not deliver BBQ.   Let me ask you...when you eat at Phil's do you taste any smoke flavor in any of their meats?  I thought so.  IT'S NOT BBQ PEOPLE!!!!!  WAKE UP!!   I would have no problem if Phil's was called "Phil's Grill" or  anything other than BBQ.  The food is decent.  Just don't call it BBQ!!!  People in the BBQ hubs of the US would laugh at this place calling itself a BBQ joint.  Just because you use BBQ sauce doesn't mean it's BBQ.  Ok I'm done with my rant.   1 star for misrepresentation of the sacred ART of BBQ-ing.  Lucille's is more BBQ than this place.  At least they smoke their meats.

Holy Cow. (literally) Probably the best BBQ I have had for years, and I am not much of a meat eater. I was full after sharing the ribs plate with my girlfriend, and yet was STILL able to stomach an entire tri-tip sandwich. The BBQ was that damn good. We had the El Toro ($6.95 Char-grilled deli sliced tri-tip topped with BBQ sauce) and the Full Beef Rib Dinner (5 Bones $19.95) The sauce was amazing, I regret not buying 5 bottles to take home with me. The beef literally fell of f the bone when I picked it up and was cooked to perfection. Worth the money? YES Worth traveling to San Diego for? YES Would I come here again? YES Serious case of the itis after a meal here? YES Had to have girlfriend drive back because of food coma? YES The only drawback which was not worth taking off a star for was the fact that the line was out the door on a Wednesday night. We waited for about 25 minutes. Food: 5 Service: 4 Ambience: 4

After my previous post, the manager contacted me and apologized for the slip up on our side orders on our to-go order and offered to make it right on our 'next visit'. Being we weren't from there, I thanked him but told him I wasn't sure when we would be in town next. Once I realized we would be in town again, I contacted him again and his offer to make good the prior wrong still stood. I thanked him and let him know when we would be coming. We showed up on a Friday night around 6:30pm. As expected, the line was around the building. The manager allowed me to enter through the side and bypassed the line (probably an hour or more wait) to order. That was extremely nice of him. He made nice by offering service recovery of the items (plus some) of what they forgot on our prior order. He was super nice and so were his cashiers after they found out what had happened prior (they were appalled in fact). What we swallowed: FRENCH FRIES: Hot and crispy. ONION RINGS: Ha! I'm glad we came back for these as these were really tasty. All people say they are cracked up to be! BABY BACK RIBS: Fall off the bone delicious! We loved them before so we came back for more... TRI-TIP: Very smokey and tangy flavor but very delicious! I'm glad that the manager reached out to make right our experience from before. I know that everyone has their 'off' days so it was big of him to make sure our experience was nothing short of perfect. He's a nice guy and so were the people that took our order to make sure our experience made up for anything negative from before. Thanks for making it a fun night and for the great customer service.

This place has really become a must-eat in SD. The wait on a Saturday at noon was actually not that bad. You wait on the line, order at the counter, get a buzzer, find seats, get your own food. The staff is attentive even though they don't wait on you. The baby back ribs are the best! So soft and for the full dinner, you get about 10-12 ribs ($20 with 2 sides). The macaroni salad is good, but nothing healthy. They give you way too much fries but are bit sparing with the onion rings. Coleslaw would probably be a bit healthier option. Honestly, it's not vegetarian friendly. Just a great rib place with comfortable outdoor seating and lots of paper towels to go around. Oh and parking could be hectic here.

We were referred to this place by the hotel desk staff.  Luckily, we were across the street and they let us know that the later it gets, the more people are waiting to get in.  I didn't realize what they meant until we actually were sitting down to eat.  We got in around 4 pm on a Friday night, were served by 4:15 and eating by 4:25.  By 5:30, the line was out the door.  By 6, the line weaved around the building. SERIOUSLY. But for good reason.  Yes, it is THAT good!! We had the baby back ribs plate, which come with two "small" sides.  Yeah right, we had enough coleslaw and macaroni salad to last a second meal.  I guess they have their own definition of "small".  We also got a "small" order of onion rings that could feed a "small" army.  Another reason to love this place?  The 8-10 Coke machine selections, which included Fresca and my personal fave, Cherry Coke!!! Fall off the bone ribs, good beer, and Cherry Coke equals 5 stars!!!

This place is popular in San Diego for a reason, their BBQ is top-notch and their servers are ultra friendly. It reminds me of Famous Daves, a tasty place with the same menu I used to eat back home. The only down side is finding a seat and the line, which usually is about 30+ people deep. My suggestion is to go in the early afternoon and slip in the side for a seat at the bar. Also, they are closed on Mondays.

There is a big line to get into the restaurant which certainly increased my anticipation for the food. The Staff are supper friendly and they try to entertain you while you are waiting in the line. Over all it is a very nice atmosphere but the food was not as good as I though it is going to be. My BBQ Chicken was a bit Dry but still good. I am not sure if I will make a trip just for Phil's but I would certainly step by if I am in the area :)

I don't get it, this place IS NOT real BBQ. They don't smoke anything and just drench the meat in tons of sauce .... you can't even get the sauce on the side because they know if you tasted just the meat you would figure out it's just boiled and grilled meat with liquid smoke. You might like the taste of cheap meat drenched in sauce, that's fine, but don't call it BBQ, because it's not! The hardest cut of meat to smoke is brisket, it's a real art and Phil's doesn't offer brisket ... they substitute tri-tip because they can grill it. No BBQ joint worth it's salt leaves brisket off the menu ... that should be a dead give away that this place isn't smoking anything! The fries are good and you get a huge amount of food per serving. The onion rings lack flavor and the other sides are OK.

I had to see what the fuss was about. Other than my oncoming heart attack, pretty darn good. Things to note: -Portions are huge. -Macaroni salad is okay, not too mayo-y. -Onion rings are overrated, not crispy enough, and batter too doughy. -Corn is overrated, not sweet, small kernels. -Baked beans are good, not as sweet as some reviewers have said. Not as sweet as the bbq sauce, not as sweet as el pollo loco's baked beans. -Beer is cheap (ish)  for a restaurant. I guess I'd prefer a healthier restaurant overall, but I'd be willing to make another stop. For sides, I'd stick to the cole slaw and baked beans. The fries were good as well (they're more soft than crispy for the curious).

I've eaten at Phil's several times over the 7 years I've lived in San Diego, I always get the best of both meal with baby back ribs and chicken and can honestly say that they are one of the most consistently satisfying meals in town. Having said that....the line there is TERRIBLE - to the point that I'd probably eat there a lot more regularly than I do now if waiting in the line wasn't such a deterrent.  My wife and I went there for "lunch" recently and by the time we actually made it to the front of the line to order and eat, it actually turned out to be an early dinner.  So I guess the point is if you're going to go there, you'll enjoy your meal, just make sure you budget a couple of hours for the trip

I've been here many times because I used to work near here and my coworkers would order and do take out so we can eat at the office together. I'm not a big BBQ person to begin with but I've had the Texas BBQ in Texas and it's not quite there yet. Each and every time, I'm not impressed, in fact, I'm not even sure why there's always a long wait here, but to each their own. And what place calls themselves a BBQ place without brisket?! What is wrong with you people?! I'm not a fan of the ribs here, had it twice and each time, it seems too greasy or too fatty for me. The pulled pork sandwich was good, I will give it that and I like the macaroni salad a lot. Then again, I wouldn't make my way to come here for just macaroni salad, so at least I can say I tried it and didn't care for it.

The best damn BBQ in San Diego, the Chickless dinner with a large fries is where it's at (no slaw)! Drinks are TINY, so go to 711 or anywhere else for a larger, cheaper soda. 4 stars for AWESOMELY GOOD BBQ.... Remaining star is reserved for a drink size that is appropriate for the heat in the sauce, and the size of the food (when purchased TO-GO)... Seriously, if you have not made it here, or have avoided it for some reason - get it over with and go there now. Your taste buds and stomach will thank you.

Just thinking about what to write for this review is making me drool. I would drive 2 hours just to have some Phil's. The ribs are so incredibly tender and the taste is heavenly. Usually get a full rack of ribs and is easily sharable with the boyfriend. They also tease you in line by giving you a free sample of their onion ring, which is so freaking colossal and that ranch pairs so nicely with it. The sides are good--my favorite is the macaroni salad. The fries are good, but not the best I've tasted. I have tried some of their Mesquite Chicken and can say I wasn't impressed. It was good, but if you have the choice, I'd go with their RIBS! This place is really busy, so be prepared for a long line, but in the end, it's that warm, tender meat that is going to make your stomach really happy.

I could smell this place around the corner. Yummy! Big parking lot. And on Thursday night at 9PM, only 10 minute wait. This is an  interesting restaurant. One side is a bar, which serves alcohol and you get waiter service. The other side is no waiter service. You go to the cash register, order, get a seat, and pick up your order. Two highlights before ordering, the attendant at the waiting line was super nice. Answered our questions about the menu and entertained us with his magic trick. What a delightful person! And then they gave us a sticker with a piggy on it because it was our first time a Phil's. This way, the attendants were aware it was our first time at the restaurant. How clever! Our order was: * Half Rib Dinner (6 to 7 Bones) $13.95 includes 2 small sides (4 of 5) - pork ribs were delicious. So meaty and so fall off the bone goodness. The two small sides we ordered were beans and fries. And it was not a small portion eventhough it was small sides. It was huge, it filled the whole tray. Yes, I said tray. They don't use dishes, they use trays. * Beefy Rib & Chicken Dinner $12.95 includes 1 large side (4 of 5) - beef ribs were huge, like dinosaur bones. There was so much meat. I could have eaten just one beef rib because I think there was about 6 oz of meat on that one bone. The meat was soft and very easy to eat. The one large side I ordered was vegetable. I loved the portion, but it was super undercooked. It was eating super raw broccoli and cauliflower. Too bad, cause I really loved the vegetable choices and the portion. I was too full to eat the chicken portion, so I had to wrap it up. Their BBQ sauce was tasty, but too much for me. When ordering, they asked, if I wanted it on the side, I should have said YES. There was too much sauce on all the ribs. The sauce was strong. It was very sweet, but equally vinegary. I like it, but I really need it on the side. Overall, I really liked this place. It was easy to order, portion was huge, and most of the BBQ food was tasty. Definitely, great place for big groups and I recommend sharing.

LOVE Phil's. It is sooooo worth the wait. Make sure you don't come too hungry because the smell alone will drive you crazy while you wait. Their beefy back ribs are my favorite and the portions are huge and meaty. It's about the size of my forearm for one rib. Too bad the sandwiches didn't impress me much. The prices are very reasonable and you get a lot for your your money. I can never finish my meal so I always bring my leftovers home. A southern girl like me loves a good BBQ spot.

We've lived here for years and finally tried Phil's BBQ. We came on a Friday night at 8pm and waited in line for an hour. They have heaters outside so it's not bad if the night is cold. Once you get inside, you order at the counter and then find a table. People in our group ordered a half rack pork rib dinner with a large side for $14. Another person got the quarter rack with one large side for $10. Sodas are $2 with free refills. The pork ribs are meaty, charred, and tasty, but we don't think the hour wait is worth it. The service is great. There are a lot of people working fast in clearing tables and wiping things down.

Ok im not a big fan of bbq sauce so i didnt think i would enjoy it even with all the hype and ridiculous line. Well first of all the line was the craziest thing i have seen, close to black friday lines at best buys. Idc how good it is, im starving & cold. So we to-go'd it, great idea. Took about 15 minutes top. It was great. Their sauce isnt too heavy, tangy, & finger-slobbering-good. We got their beef ribs & babyback ribs. The rack was so soft. I think 1 order is around $15? Comes w fries. Next time ill ask for corn on the cob as a side. Saw our other companions eat it all =(

Long lines for food can tell you one of two things, either people are starving or the food is really good. In this case it was probably both! We went on a Tuesday night, there was a moderate line (compared to our expectation of a huge swirling line) it took us around 20 mins to get inside. Once we were there and told the staff that it's our first time here they took their time to explain the menu and how things work in there, they were very courteous and welcoming. We placed our order for 2 and helped ourselves to the table and drinks. The food was ready in less than 5 mins. Beefy ribs were cooked to perfection, and the sauce was perfect for my taste. El Toro sandwich was heavenly good and the onion rings were perfectly dipped in the batter albeit slightly dry for my taste. All in all it was a great experience and definitely worth it!

Ah, the famous Phil's BBQ. I've been to San Diego many times, but I've never made the journey here. I finally stopped by last night for dinner. What did I see upon arrival? A super long line that extended around the corner. My thought? This better be worth it. I got there around 5pm and I didn't get in to order until about 6pm. So, it was about an hour wait. When I finally got in, I got the quarter baby back ribs with baked beans and coleslaw. So, was it worth the wait? I thought it was good, but it was not mind-blowing. The ribs were good. They were tender, but still had some chew to them. The barbeque sauce on them was super strong though. Even before digging in, the smell was very pungent. The sauce was a little on the strong side for me, but I still enjoyed my ribs. The baked beans and coleslaw were just decent, nothing special. The coleslaw was actually on the bland side for me. Service was good. There were a lot of people, so it was quite hectic. I didn't really like the windows surrounding the place though. When my fingers and mouth are covered in barbeque sauce, I don't want people waiting in line staring. It can get awkward. Of course, when I was in line, I was staring in, too. Hey, I had to pass the time somehow! So, would I stand in line for this? No, I don't think so. If the wait was shorter, then yes. One hour for this is too long. I'm also not that patient when it comes to food. If you have never been to Phil's, definitely check it out though. It was a good experience.

I used to LOVE Phil's when they had one restaurant in Banker's Hill and they genuinely SMOKED their meats.  I remember driving there just to have their food, and smelling the food  cooking blocks away.  In those days, Phil's was to die for.  Now that they have moved to Sports Arena and open up several locations, its not the same.  Phil's is still tasty, but its not the same  because they do not smoke their meats like they did when they were over in Banker's Hill. Plus the lines are rediculus.  It seems like a lot of the people who rave about Phil's today didn't know the old Phil's, and think that the way to get a good bar-be-que is to smother the meat in bar-be-que sauce.   I really miss the old Phil's

If you haven't been, DO IT!!! Beware of long lines, good thing is once you get to the front you have your food in about 10 min. And it's self seating in the bar.

Wow! I love Bbq, and this place is the place! My mom loves the onion rings, and I love everything!   Line is LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG. But that means it is worth the wait if everybody is staying in line and waiting for 30 minutes, right?  I recommend this place! You should come!

This is such good bbq; it just falls right off the bone regardless of what kind of meat it is. I believe it truly is comparable to the stuff you'd find at bbq contests in the South. You'd be hard pressed to find food made with as much love and care or as tasty this side of Texas. Take out or dine in are both viable options, finding a place to sit inside can be a bit difficult if you decide to stick around. I definitely suggest doing so because I like my food hot from the oven and it is worth it.

*TIP*  If you don't want to wait in line, you can seat yourself at the bar and order from the full menu! I've by passed the line several times using this method, but if you're trying to eat with a group of friends, it's best to go for an early/late lunch or linner. The only place I wait in line for is Pink's Hot Dogs ;D The best BBQ I've ever had is the BF's dad's who lives in Oklahoma. You can eat his stuff without even using sauce, it's that good. I can't quite say that about Phil's. I will admit that the aroma fills the streets of the Point Loma community and it's intoxicating! The interior is charming- long wooden benches and tables.... Kind of like a picnic at Knott's Berry Farm! I didn't want to give this place a 2 star because I know Guy has dropped by raving about their stuff, for good reasons I suppose. I feel that the sauce is a little too sweet for my taste. I've ordered the staples and could care less for the beef ribs bc they are a waste of time IMO- so much work for tough pieces of little meat. Everything comes with too much sauce, ahhhhh! If you ask for the sauce on the side, the meat tastes a little too plain jane, so you'll need to add seasoning or something to the meat. I enjoy their cole slaw and the bread is not half bad either! If you're the type of person who loves their BBQ sauced up, then I suggest you try Phil's. Otherwise, come to Oklahoma and we'll either hit up a good place in town OR drive to Kansas City where the REAL deal is!

Texture? Good Flavor? Full Service? GREAT Wait? wow.. holy CRAP that line is long. I can honestly say we did enjoy dining here. The service was good. Food was hearty and filling. However, for me it just didn't live up to the hype. Maybe it's cause I've been tainted by the bbq in Texas? I duno what it is.. but I felt that they smothered their BBQ in far too much sauce. I probably would have enjoyed it more with the sauce on the side.. probably won't be coming back for a while because the 1.5 hour wait just wasn't worth it for us.

Being pretty new to Yelp, I find myself cruising around and checking out places I happily frequent; I tend to scroll and stop on negative reviews to test the validity. Many times, I see how the reviewer arrives at their low-star review... Many times, I just cannot believe that people find themselves credible! Phil's BBQ on Sports Arena/Point Loma is a HUGE part of our lives! At least twice a month, I will call in a pretty massive order of chicken and/or ribs and tons of sides and loads of their house-made buttermilk ranch dressing. Their to-go system is brilliant b/c they recognize your telephone number and know your history and you talk to the same people over and over and even though they are insanely busy, I have never felt rushed once. Then my husband drives from downtown, round trip probably averages 45 minutes, and we either have food for a ton of guests or food to sprinkle over an entire weekend.  You see, they don't fire your food until you show up so you can take ten minutes or two hours - we feel it's a great system - your food is piping hot and fresh as you dash out the door for home. We've read some nasty reviews here about people not being accommodated when something went awry which will happen when monstrously popular places like this are feeding this many people. Here is our true testimonial and how Phil's BBQ fell over backwards until their spine snapped in two apologizing to us for a wee mistake... I would say that we have ordered to-go at least 24 to 30 times. ONCE, they forgot our two loaded baked potatoes. Of course, when you order enough to feed a small army and it fills three or four bags and there's never been a problem, you just smile and pay and leave and drive home. I was upset when I undid the bags and discovered the missing baked potatoes. Being a sulky wife for a moment, I made my husband call because I have never once been inside of Phil's BBQ and I felt it was his "fault." (I know, I know, terrible wife!) They immediately wanted to dispatch a driver with the two missing baked potatoes! Being that I am all bark and no bite, I got "all shook up" and begged him to say that we could just get two free baked potatoes next time.  I will not speak for all women but every once in a while, I tend to overact but their baked potatoes are darned good and I seldom have this gluttonous opportunity! The next time I called in, the total came to right under $70.  I mentioned that I was supposed to have a credit on my telephone number for two baked potatoes and I was informed that both dinners tied to the forgotten baked potatoes were credited for our previous inconvenience.  So, instead of just giving us two free $2.25 baked potatoes, we were comped two entire "Chick-Less Dinners" that retail for $10.95 each.  Wow!  And the next time I called in, I was asked if I felt that Phil's had satisfactorily made up for the incident which was now three orders old... We were totally blown away by how they took ownership of such a small situation! So please consider how unnecessarily kind Phil's BBQ was to us before being swayed by some of the weird stuff on here. And we are from The South. This ain't The South and people need to quit trying to make California something it isn't.  BBQ means something different to everyone.  After all, The South is full of sushi restaurants selling California rolls and people gobble them up not knowing or caring how authentic they are!

Best BBQ place you can go to. I don't like pork (yes you can yell at me) but the chicken here is amazing...and the fries..and the beans. Don't be intimidated by the long line that wraps around the corner, it usually goes by fast...and if it doesn't..well the wait is worth it! If you want to avoid it though, I suggest going after 8pm, especially after 9 pm.

Phil's has some of the best BBQ in San Diego. The secret to this place is to skip the line and go sit at the bar, where you can also eat, or call in your order and take it to go. Seriously, you won't have to wait at all if you do either of these. Everything is good here, even the Turkey Burger. I've had the whole menu, and everything is consistently delicious. Don't sit in the "amateur line" for 45 minutes, unless you enjoy being tortured by the smell of delicious BBQ while you're stomach is rumbling, which is probably where half of these 2 star reviews are being written from.

I went to Phil's just to ask them for some nicey treats for my dogs. I did not have to stand in line. Went over to the corner of the counter and asked a young man if they had any bones for my dogs. The manager Zack B was passing by and took over assisting me. He went immediately into the kitchen and came back with a bag of bones for my babies. See folks it is places that have awesome customer service skills that always come out on top.

I've been meaning to do this review for quite some time. Are all you people getting paid? Free ribs? Please, tell me, because there sure isn't any reason to give Phil's a 5 star review otherwise. The meats are bland and plain, the sauce tastes *exactly* like Arby's sauce, you wait 2 hours to eat, you can get better sides from a deli counter at vons, and you can't hear yourself think. I just don't get it. Perhaps its my southern upbringing, but I'd rather save my time and money and cook some ribs at home. At least there I can put a good dry rub on my ribs and make some bbq sauce with some flavor. Go to Phil's. Wait a billion years for some crappy bbq, and then post a 5 star yelp review...after all, all the cool yelpers are doing it.

I know I'm going against the tide here, however, I had to write my own review, especially after reading all the great remarks from Yelp (boy were you people wrong). What a disappointment!!! We waited for over an hour only to get okay meats and overcooked sides. Service sucks and they can't wait for you to get out of there.   Never, ever going to come back again. Costco's KC Style BBQ Ribs are better. Lather Kinder's bbq sauce onto them and they are delicious. Here's a challenge: cook Costco's ribs and then go wait a hundred years in line at this place and taste the difference.

What? How have I never reviewed this place? I used to live in SD until 5 years ago, and Phils BBQ was just MONEY. My friends and I ate here again and again, never getting tired of those melt-off-the-bone ribs and that spicy-and-tangy signature sauce. I finally made a return visit a couple of months ago, and inhaled some ribs. Just as good as ever! Their onion rings are also probably my favorite onion rings of all time! It's crazy how fancy this place got in the past few years that I hadn't visited.. they even have a kid who entertains you with magic tricks while you wait in line! How awesome is that??

BOMB-BAY BBQ. There's really nothing left to say about the ribs here. They are fantastic. If you want a meatier, heartier rib, go with the beef. If you want something lighter (as light as BBQ can be) and more of a grill taste, go with the baby back ribs (pork). The El Toro is a cool option if you have someone in the group that isn't feeling BBQ. Its sliced tri-tip, so its almost like a deli sandwich, but still got that slightly grilled and BBQ-ed flavor. Not too smoke-y. One random note i wanna give is that the baked beans are absolutely awesome. I hate beans. I refused to get the beans here for over 3 years and I finally caved when I lost a bet because my friend wanted to prove that they were good. He was absolutely right. They don't taste anything like the beans you've tried before. They are sweet, tender and creamy. They are amazing. Get them in the future. Its kind of weird that I'm writing more about the beans than the ribs, but thats only because everyone already knows that the ribs are amazing. Fall of the bone tender and packed with flavor. My only food complaint about Phils is the pulled pork. I've had it twice and both times I found it dry and too smoke-y. It kind of gave me a headache. I think they need to put more sauce on that sucka. That and the line keeps Phils from being perfect. But the ribs and beans are indeed perfect. TIP: If you have a relatively small group (like 6 or less), try going to the bar area. Its open seating so you can just wait and try to vulture a seat/table. Great way to avoid the ridiculous lines.

Yummmmm! We probably waited 30 minutes in line. But a magician came to entertain us while we're waiting. Smartttttttttttt Phil's. Very smart. Onto the food: Their mac salad is sooo goodd. Probably the best side. The onion rings are freaking delicious. Best onion rings I've ever eaten. Get this when you come here ! You won't regret it. They give a lot so you probably can share with three people. And of course, the ribs. I would say it's pretty good. But the BBQ sauce was too strong for my taste. You could ask for the sauce on the side. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… But not only is the food good, the service is amazing.

My boyfriend took me here for the first time 2 years ago on our first date.  It was probably an unsual choice to take a girl on a first date because messy is inevitable when chowin' down on BBQ, but holy cow. Best. First. Date. Ever. This place is literally finger-lickin' good. I'm the kinda girl that appreciates a romantic candle-light dinner for special occasions & what not, but we make our way here for our anniversary. Lol. We usually just come for lunch because the dinner time line is outrageous- though, in my opinion, well worth the wait. Their BBQ is meaty, juicy, and tender to the bite. I order the all white half chicken dinner for about $10, & he orders the half rib dinner for about $14. Good prices+good food=WIN!

It was so good I went again today, February 9, 2013 because I wanted to try what I didn't have a big enough stomach for the day before.

After living in San Diego for 4-years, I finally tried THE Phil's BB-Q.   Some may question, "Why the 2-stars?  This place is craptastically delicious, the best in this universe, and  you only rated it 2-stars?  It's been on Man Vs. Food, the place is as legit as they come."  Sorry, peeps, it's good but I wasn't impressed. 1. I got a pulled pork sandwich with a side of macaroni salad.  Was it good?  Yes.  But I've made pulled pork sandwiches at home that are just as good, but the BB-Q sauce was different.  It's a generous portion for both, the sauce is good and tangy, but I'm not daydreaming about it and wanting more all the time. 2.  The service.  Are you kidding me?  My aunt went to ask a question about it being her birthday (they send an email about being able to reserve a table) and if she was able to get a table.  The response from the little squatty hostess was, "You have to wait in line like everyone else."  I get it.  I'm sure a lot of people complain about the hour-long line, but she was asking purely because of an email she received, not because she thought she deserved special service.  The attitude from the hostess was unwarranted and just set off a sour note.  Too bad the chick wore a hoodie sweatshirt over her work shirt and name tag; otherwise, I could identify her by name--but she thinks she's punk rock and wears a way cool studded belt. 3.  After waiting in line for an hour, you order at a cash register.  Really?  I waited all this time to get to the cash register?  You also have to get your own drink, not just get your Coke on your own, but if you want an adult beverage, you have to take yourself to the bar and order it--I started laughing because I thought they were joking.  They weren't.  They also just set a vibrating remote on your table for when your food is ready--we were assuming that meant we had to get our own food too, which caused great anxiety until the "server" who brings silverware and hot sauce takes it, causing some relief.  By the way, are you supposed to tip the person that just brings the food you waited 1-hour to order and only brings you silverware and hot sauce?  I hope not, because I wouldn't (I wasn't paying). Overall, would I come here again?  No, unless it was a pick up order.  Bad service, ridiculous wait time, and stupid concept.  Maybe Phil's wants to keep the line so everyone can keep believing the hype of, "The line is so long, it must be good."  No, it's for us idiots that didn't know any better and waited for their food because it was on Man vs. Food.

While in SD my friends really wanted to eat here again. and since im a SD virgin might as well :P Food: the food here is exceptional. the meat is cooked just right. and everything is made when you order it so you know its fresh. since i was new here and probably not gonna come here anytime soon i ordered quite a lot. i ordered the half rack of ribs and the BBQ Broham. with fries and potatoe salad on the side. the ribs were so tender and juicy it was darn right mouth watering. it was sort of fall off the bone. i mean i can tear it apart easily but my definition of fall off the bone is when i can cut the meat with a spoon. it was close though so no complaints here. and the BBQ Broham was good. not great. i mean to me it was just a sandwich with meat in the middle. the meat to me tasted kind of like a "banh mi thit nuong" so i found nothing special about it. One major complaint that i would have to point out is that they use an excessive amount of sauce on all of their meats. im a fan of bbq sauce but not when all i can taste is bbq sauce. and the sauce was ok. it was a bit too tangy for me. but dont take my word for it :D Service: i like the service here. everyone is super friendly. everyone was super helpfull. all questions were answered. it was good. Location: i like the location. not bad. its in this small plaza which kind of looks like it is owned my "phil" himself. enough parking to accomodate everyone. this place can get crowded but the line is quick so no worries :D

SUCH. GOOD. FOOD. There WILL be a line, so be prepared to wait. But if you can survive the agonizing, and sometimes unbelievably long line, then you will be rewarded with San Diego's best bbq. If you don't want to eat there, call in your food and bring it home. The service is pretty straightforward. You wait in line, make an order, get a number, find a table, receive your food, consume, and leave and make room for someone else to do the same. They sell the bbq sauce in bottles too. So you can take some of their deliciousness home with you. The sides are also delicious. They also give good portions. One star knocked off because of the ridiculous lines, and the tough seating situation, but the prices are good, the food is AMAZING, and the portions are big. So yeno, you get your money's worth.

Worth the hype. We lucked out too because despite the hype, if you go early enough like we did at 11 am then there isn't much of a wait like there normally is. Reasonably priced, huge portions, and delicious food! The pork ribs are my favorite. Tender fall off the bone meat and has a hint of that nice smokey flavor that we all appreciate in good BBQ. Even if you're not hungry or you're on a diet, don't skip out on the sides! For a place that is always crowded and as big as they were, service was top notch. Every few minutes someone come by to see if we were doing okay or if we needed anything else. They were quick to check on our take-out orders, quick to get us to-go containers, and accommodating in making our party fit at the table as well as calling us a few cabs. One bookmark you definitely need to make on Yelp!

I've been going to Phil's since they were the neighborhood outcasts of Mission Hills. I have family in Kansas City and Chicago and I used to live in Texas. Phil's is pretty good barbecue, but they are not great. They ARE, however, the best barbecue in San Diego. The only thing I ever order anymore is also the best thing on the menu:  El Toro sandwich. Slow-cooked tri-tip served sliced and piled atop a big toasted bun. Tip for the masses: get the sauce on the side and order an extra bun (50 cents).  Then you have enough for two people, since they load that sucker with so much meat. Avoid at all costs any Sunday during football season and basically lunch hours 12-2 and dinner hours 5-7, else you like to wait in line for 45 minutes to an hour outside. Enjoy!

It's been ages since I've been able to find good beef bbq ribs.  And having to wait till I finish a rib eye just to get to the bone isn't the same either.   So when I saw that Phil's had it on the menu, I had to fall suit with the other foodie tourists out there and attempt to fight the crowds for a spot where almost everyone claims is a great bbq place.   Since it was between this and another authentic mexican spot, I opted for this and am glad I did.  For my compadre and I, we split the following: -Beefy Ribbs (3) with a side of Mac Salad Large - amazing.  truly some meaty goodness right there. -Baby Back Ribs (6-7) - delicious but tastes almost like every other spot. -Half Chicken - super moist but bbq chicken doesn't quite do it enough for me.   -Onion rings small (6-7) - can't go wrong with these deliciousness The spot itself looks true to a bbq joint and fortunately, we were able to get seated at the bar area on the left upon entering.  Their sauce is tangy and sweet which pretty much fits everyone's liking.  The smokiness is mild, but I'm just glad they got beef ribs.

Probably the most bang for your buck when it comes down to ribs. If you're ever just visiting San Diego and you're looking looking for a place to eat Phil's is a classic.  They have a variety of barbeque and sides which will cater to anyone's needs. I went for dinner and split 2 dinner plates with a friend. We had an order of beef ribs and a full rack of baby back ribs with the coleslaw/macaroni salad/baked beans for the sides. The baby back ribs are the most popular. The meat is very tender and falls right off the bone. The sauce is a bit too tangy but to each their own. The beef ribs are huge! The meat is very tender and goes really well with the barbeque sauce. The only thing about the beef ribs is that they were quite fatty. As for the sides my favorites are the baked beans, and cole slaw. Everything other side is pretty standard. Recommend: Baby back ribs Beef ribs Cole slaw Baked beans Macaroni salad Things to pass: Chicken (Dry) Onion rings (extremely greasy) French fries (nothing special) Tips: The wait is always long, but generally moves fairly fast. So be prepared to wait at least an hour.

I'm conflicted.... Do I give it 5 stars because the ribs fall of the bone in just the right way? Because I find myself licking my fingers while everyone stares? Because I smother the already-eaten bones with more sauce? I'm an animal, I tell you. An animal. But then...do I give Phil's 1 star for the terribly long lines? For the occasional visit where the meat is overcooked, burnt, and too saucy? For the way-too-loud atmosphere? I think I'm sticking with 4 stars. The food is knuckle-licking (because you'll be licking your whole hand) good, although occasionally a disappointment. The service is pretty fantastic. I have had one or two bad experiences, but for the most part, all the waiters and waitresses are extremely friendly and helpful. I've been smart and avoided the long lines mostly by using take-out or going early, but when I've faced the monster that is the line, I've waited up to 2 hours before. Bill Tip: On the weekends, either go to the nearby Kobey's Swap Meet in the morning and then hit up Phil's right as it opens, or go to Phil's first and then head over to the swap meet. Either way, you avoid the lines, and work off that belly! Bill Tip #2: The sweet tea is diabetic-ally delicious. You won't be disappointed! Bill Tip #3: They charge extra for a side of ranch. Sometimes, if you get a great waiter, they'll hook it up. Or you can try to charm the person you get the food from with your million-dollar-smile. The latter works for me every time.

Ribs fall off the bone and the chicken is moist and juicy.  The sauce has a tangy, sweet, smoky flavor and quite perfect for dipping everything in. While this is not the best BBQ I've ever had, this is certainly good.  I highly recommend grabbing a seat at the bar and ordering from there...would never line up for this regardless of how tasty it is.

Way too much sauce (and sauce is way too tangy) on anything that has sauce in their barbecue. 2.) Customer Service: OK, very friendly service -- always good 3.) Ambiance/Decor: OK 4.) Cost: OK

Mmmmmmm goooooood!  The wait was so worth it!  The BBQ sauce is spicy with a hint of sweetness.  I ordered the baby back ribs and they were so tender and delicious.  The onion rings were pretty good too.  As my sides I got the potato salad and the cold slaw and both were good.

I love that the portions are big here. I usually can't finish all of the half size of baby back ribs. I usually get macaroni salad and fries as sides! Prefer the macaroni over potato salad. The cashiers are really friendly here, too. Don't get too intimidated by the line that wraps around the restaurant, it moves by pretty quickly. I would say it is a bit over-hyped. By all means I'm never let down after eating here, but I'll usually only come when my friends are visiting San Diego and they want to try it.

Wow! What a excellent dinner I had with my family tonight! Soon after checking out the restaurants in San Diego on Yelp, we decided to attempt some real southern food and headed to Phil's Bbq. It was among the best family meals we've had! My brother ordered the half chicken all white meat with huge fries, and I ordered the massive back rib dinner with sauce around the side, potato salad and beans and a piece of corn around the cob to share just so I could try it. The ribs are so meaty, and fell off the bone yummy! They advised sauce on the side simply because they believed it might be spicy; which it would wasn't really hot. The potato salad and beans have been outstanding, and my brother enjoyed his chicken dinner. The service right here is incredible, from the time you stroll inside the door! Should you be heading to Sports Arena area, you will be glad you did if you eat here.

The BBQ ribs (both beef and pork) are good but the onion rings was the wow factor for me. Good size portions and fast and friendly service (once you place your order). The crazy part is the line. We waited an hr to get in. Overall the experience is pretty cool but not good enough for the long lines. The good news is they are opening up a few more locations and hope that will help.

NOM NOM NOM!!! The BEST BBQ in town! If you know friends who are going, you can watch the webcam and see them standing in line. It's nice if you're a people watcher as well  :)  The line moves a LOT faster than you think.  But I highly recommend that you get there before the "dinner" rush so that you are not standing out in the cold in the line.  BEWARE that the line does tend to wrap around the ENTIRE building.  But once, you taste the food, you will know why!

Had to wait at least an hour. According to regular customers the wait was much longer than usual   Food was great and worth the wait. Had the all beef ribs and the baby back rib Tickler. Since I'm not an onion ring fan, the onion rings didn't impress me. Fries with ranch sauce was good. Too much sauce on ribs and too messy. Recommend that you get ribs with sauce on the side. You can always add more sauce, but its hard too take it off. Took food home.

I still don't understand what all the hype is about. The wait was extremely long and I wasn't a fan of their service model. If I'm waiting in line for 30 minutes, I shouldn't have to find my own seat. The food was fair but I wasn't wowed by it or the BBQ sauce. One plus is that the portion sizes are HUGE.

Eating Phil's BBQ can be likened to the sensation of scoring with some mindblowingly hot girl you never thought you could score in a billion years. Upon eating their ribs, I felt as though I'd committed 10 different sins simultaneously. Not too sweet (an issue I have often when I eat bbq), not too tangy (but quite tangy), and PERFECTLY smoky. So. Smoky. I don't remember the last time a place absolutely lived up to its hype, but this place certainly did. I got the ribs with a side of fries and potato salad, but next time I'd opt for macaroni salad or baked beans instead of the potato salad. The fries are like fatter versions of in n out. In other words... bomb. Moms got the 'Best of Both' ribs+chicken, sauce on the side 'cause bbq sauce is usually too sweet for her. So you have the option of getting the sauce on the side, but the sauce is so perfect I really wouldn't go for that. Wait was about 35 mins; line moves fast. BBQ this good should be illegal.

This place has, bar none, the best barbeque food in all of San Diego.  The atmosphere is really cool too.  You can sit at the bar and get a beer while you wait for a table.  The parking kind of sucks and there is NEVER a table open when you get there but you'll forget all about that when you put that first rib in your mouth.  Seriously, if you like barbeque, check this place out.  It will become your new favorite.

I sometimes feel unsure about over-reviewing places such as Phil's that are obviously well-established and widely known. Phil's deserves a round up to five stars not just because they have great ribs but because their sides were phenomenal. Too often I eat BBQ that excels in the meat department but delivers overly mayonnaisey potato and macaroni salads. Not Phil's, the macaroni salad was the perfect compliment to the ribs and was the best way to start off my night before a Socker's Game right down the street. SOCKKKKERRRRRRRSSSSS

Over 4000+ reviews this place speaks for itself. Phil's BBQ lives up to the hype and is worth the wait! My top reason when visiting San Diego is to try this place and I am glad I finally did. I came here early before they opened since I know there is always a long wait. There was already a big line once we arrived. Overall it was about a 30 min wait from before they opened until I was able to order food. I had the El Toro which was DELICIOUS! The sandwich is packed with so much meat and sauce that you are bound to get it all over yourself. The onion rings were also amazing. This place was so good my gf and I had to order some ribs to-go just because we don't live in the area and want more of their amazing BBQ. This place does live up to the hype and is worth the wait as you won't be disappointed!

Okay... Phil's BBQ Lovers don't kill me but I think this is place is over hyped. It's good but it's not A M A Z I N G L Y awesome to wait one hour or more. We got there at 2 on a Saturday  and only had to wait 20 minutes. The service is great and all the employees are attentive. The food was just alright. I like my ribs to fall off the bone and have that juicy hmph... Phil's didn't have that. Their onion rings are ginormous, so one order is enough to share with the whole table. I am not going to try eat here again, it's not worth the wait.

Best BBQ in SD by far!! Everything is delicious but I'm a fan of the baby back ribs, mac salad, and their fries The meat falls off the bone. Dip the fries in the bbq sauce. Their Pulled pork and Tri-Tip sandwiches are also a big favorite of mine. Line can be long sometimes. Best time is 11am-4pm and after 8pm. The line dies down or isn't too bad. You can also order to go.

I know a lot of people hate on Phil's BBQ.  But you know what?? I'm California born and raised so what I know about BBQ is that Phil's is pretty darn good. I've heard good things about the beef ribs but every time I come, my eyes go straight to the pork ribs.  I would say the best thing to do is to split a full rack.  On a hungry day I can eat half a rack and then proceed to stuff my self over the top with the sides.  But if I wanted to seem more modest, haha, I'll go for maybe 4 or so bones (depending on the size).  So I guess it depends how much you eat.  I say guys can eat on average half a rack and girls a little less than that. Side notes: Ask for BBQ sauce on the side Wear a bib..you never know what will happen.  Plus, they make for good pictures Arrive by 6pm latest for less than an hour wait, especially Thurs-Sat

Pardon my grossness, but I wouldn't be surprised if they had their own slaughterhouse on site.  This place must got through a TON of ribs every 10 minutes! After thousands of great reviews, I'll keep this one short. There is a line that wraps around the building.  My husband and I thought "no thanks", so I pushed my way to the entrance and went to the "to go" line which was empty.  Nice.. It took about 10 minutes to get my order.  BTW, the service here is stellar!!!!  They helped me to carry my stuff to the car and lots of other little things that didn't go unnoticed. The ribs were ginormous.  They were absolutely delicious..  I'd definitely recommend the beef and the babybacks.  We ate them for days..... Yes, Phil's is worth a stop!

There is really nothing else that can be said about Phil's.  I just had to write something cause I love it so much.  It would literally be my last meal on earth.  I day dream throughout the week about the next time I will get to go.  Anyone that doesn't like Phil's is just Hating on the fact that so many people like it.  It is too damn good to say otherwise.  My meal of choice is the "Rib and Chickless Dinner" with 2-3 Onion Rings, Macaroni Salad, Veggies, a Broham Sandwich and I like to wash it down with some Sweet Tea or a Beer.  Yes ladies and gentleman, I always eat at least that much.  Sometimes I'll order a full rack of ribs with a Chickless Tickler instead of the combo meal and still eat the Broham and sides with it.  There is no time to mess around when dining on some Phil's.  I feel Like the Duck Dynasty boys at a donut shop if you know what I mean.  All in all, Damn good eats.

Having had BBQ from a variety of places, I can tell you that Phil's is OK, but not 5 star worthy. Line is too long and the price is too high for what you get.  The few times I have been here, I could not see the smoke ring - an indicator of fine bbq.   Lots of sauce though.   Good place to take a large group to hoot n holar!

The line was 40 minutes long on a Tuesday at 7pm. Since this was highly recommended I decided to wait. I had a beef rib and a half baby back dinner. The beef rib was better than the pork. They use the same sauce on everything, which I think is absurd considering beef and pork are totally unique. The sauce wasn't cooked onto the meat, but rather dumped on like a hot wing. The sauce was not good, maybe it would have been better if it was caramelized. It was too sweet and too tangy, it really wasn't good at all. The onion rings were okay, but they didn't live up to the hype either. The potato salad was just okay, but the baked beans were good. The wait staff was extremely friendly and the prices were fairly cheap. As I was walking in the hostess told me they serve 4000 people a day. I found that hilarious because the bathroom only had 1 urinal- epic fail. I would consider going back for the beef ribs (no sauce) if the line wasn't so long, but it wasn't worth the wait.

Came here for the first time after living in San Diego all my life for my parents' b-day. Food was good quality. We tried the chicken and the baby back ribs. The chicken was bland. I wouldn't recommend ordering chicken when coming here. It's definitely all about the ribs. The baby back ribs were well marinated and well cooked. They were tender and weren't chewy at all. The plates can be a bit meat intensive. You can order sides with your meat portions, but they would be rather small. So I recommend in addition to getting sides with your ribs/chicken, that you order a salad as well. The place is a self-serve restaurant. You order and pick-up at the front. Then you can sit anywhere you want. They did have staff coming throughout our lunch to make sure everything was ok. As for the wait time, I came 30 minutes before they opened to avoid the lines. I must say I did not regret it. There was a huge line that wrapped around the other side of the restaurant by the time they opened. Luckily, for those that were further behind us, the line moves quickly and the orders come out fast.

We went Sunday, got there at 11:45, place was already packed with a line. The line moved fast though.   I saw this place on Adam Richman's "Best Sandwich in America"  So, i got the sandwich they featured on the show.   Since I was already there I wanted to try the ribs as well.  So I ordered the El Toro (tri-tip) sandwich and the baby back rib tickler plate. First disappointment was, I noticed they were not BBQ'ing.  It was cooked in the oven, then slathered with BBQ sauce, and finished on the grill (there is a difference for those who don't know).  So, not a real BBQ place.   The trip tip meat was sliced Deli thin and was pretty good, the bbq sauce was a little much for my taste.  The bun they served it on was awesome.   The Ribs were tender and falling of the bone, but again, they were not smoked or BBQ'd. The sides- well i didn't come for the sides but no complaint there, they were as expected. The portions are pretty big, I had enough for 2 more meals, I did order 2 entrees, but I couldnt of finished 1 entree. Over all - Service was excellent, the food was average.

You walk in and the atmosphere is proper. Loud voices all mashed together over about a dozen football teams on two dozen TVs competing to clinch their BCS bowls.  The safe kind of rowdy you would come to expect from any self respecting BBQ joint. The prices are reasonable enough. And the BBQ and sauce were good I'd even venture to say 'very good.'   What was disappointing about Phil's is that it failed to live up to some VERY high expectations. I saw a sign that made my eyes light up. TOP TEN yelped locations in the ENTIRE COUNTRY! WHOA! That's a tall order ma'am! My response in the best gruff disgruntled cowboy voice you can imagine : "ITS A TALL TALE IS WHAT IT IS !?!?!" Some YELPers are claiming that its BBQ is BETTER than ANYWHERE in the South. NOW, That's just CRAZY TALK! Look Phil's is pretty darn good. But It doesn't fall off the bone when you go to touch it. Its not nearly as tender, juicy, or flavorful as a real Nashville or Texas BBQ place, Hell Johnny Rebs in Long Beach CA has MUCH better BBQ than this. And they outsourced their BBQ sauce not to a local commissary but to Kraft Foods.  Freaking KRAFT! I understand that a high volume place might need to outsource some of the labor intensive process, but KRAFT? come on now! Phil's a great business man and a superb marketer, Which makes the entrepreneur inside me root him on but the foodie inside cries tears of disappointment. I guess it was all 'smoke' and mirrors. LOL I'd start by giving this 3 - 3 and a half stars. But it loses a full star to a star and half for not even coming close to all the hype.     I can't be that mad though. If I were in his shoes I would conceivably do the same thing.I would have signed the Kraft contract too.       If I were 'Phil' I would  have done the same thing. signing http://www.youtube.com/w… All the way to the bank! Again take it with a grain of salt its only one mans opinion, I guess 5000 yelpers cant be wrong. ::shrugg::

Wow... 4000 reviews plus... 4.5 stars... on Yelp... this place should be a homerun... my foodie friend even recommended  it... when we got here there was a line out the door down and around the building!... I was really excited... curiously enough the smell of wood burning was really faint... then when I got the ribs... beautiful glaze on the ribs... great sauce... but no smoke ring on the rib... hmmmmm... bit into it... no smokey flavor, my criteria for a rib has to have that slow smoked flavor infused into the rib.... OMG... I read the menu again... "grilled over mesquite wood fire...:  it's not smoked... it's grilled.... IT'S NOT BBQ!  LOW and SLOW IS BBQ... Lucille's is better then this... at least they smoke their ribs... I really need to read the fine print next time... That being said... for being non-smoked it reminded me of Houston's ribs in Irvine and Mogul's ribs in Mammoth Lakes... but they did not call their place a BBQ restaurant that was known for their ribs and just sell them on the menu only like this place does... Ribs: 0 stars... it's grilled not smoked Sides: excellant Service: excellant Wait: Too long... don't bother Suggestion: Get the sides and the sauce to go and take it somewhere else for the ribs... just make sure it's smoked...

This isn't the location to be at because it's damn packed every weekend. Don't believe the reviews where they say it's not packed because it is. The line was about 100 deep when I came at 3pm today. I didn't get to eat here today because there is no way in hell I would wait in that line. I'm a little mad about some of the reviews saying it's not as packed since theirs 2 other locations. I would rather go to San Marcos location or the Santee one. Both of those locations aren't nearly as packed and you get seated in a heartbeat.

I have touched the face of the BBQ Gods and lived! I have tasted the food of kings! I have reveled in the ambrosia of the Gods and it is called "The El Torro Sandwich!" Mercy! My brother-in-law was watching "Man verses Food" when the show talked about some of the best BBQ sandwiches on the west coast. Now, I'm in San Diego vacationing and enjoying the beach and hot weather in November when he tells me "We must find Phil's and eat this sandwich." So, I loaded up the truck with my family and in-laws and headed to Phil's! It opened at 11 a.m. and let be clear: The place was packed by 11 a.m.! Naturally, I ordered the El Torro which seemed reasonable in price for $6.95.  I about fell off my seat when my order came up and this sandwich appeared....holy cow, Batman!  This thing had enough meat for almost three sandwiches!  And more than being a glutenous mass of meat, it was smokey, flavorful, moist, and extremely delicious.  The bun they serve it on in some ways is a joke: I tried to use it and the bun just disintegrated!  Thank God I wore a bib and had a whole roll of paper towels! In fact, there was so much food, my mother-in-law grew sick at the sight and couldn't believe we stuffed our faces as much as we did!  Here's a tip about Phil's: No one leaves hungry! As I left I shed a tear...both because I was leaving and because I ate far more than I should have. The host who greeted me asked how I liked it. I told her that I already was missing the sandwich I just ate.  She replied: "Honey, you'll have dreams about that sandwich." Hot damn, the lady was right!

I have been hearing a lot of buzz about Phil's BBQ, so I had to come here during my trip to the San Diego. So I came here with my friends about 11:30 AM and I was quite surprised that there was no waiting line at all. We ordered our food at the front counter and it took about 10 minutes to get our food. Full Baby Back Rib Dinner (10-12 bones) with Macaroni Salad and Cole Slaw ($19.95) - Decent ribs, but not as tender as I thought; however, I really like how they already cut up the ribs. Macaroni Salad tasted a bit crunchy (I think they add a bit of celery). Cole slaw was definitely the best one I've ever had - great texture and very flavorful. Overall it's a great restaurant, but I've had a better baby back ribs at St.Louis. If you are debating which sides to order, I highly recommend the cole slaw.

Hands down my FAVORITE place to eat in San Diego. Not the kind of place you'd go to eat if youre looking for a quick bite or a quiet relaxing meal. The line is usually outrageous, especially on weekends. A lot of people don't know this, but if you have a small party (1-4 people) you can just wait for open seating at the bar so I usually only wait like 10 minutes tops. The ribs are never disappointing; very tender and extremely meaty! They definitely do not cheat you on portions. I've had all their sides, and I dont know which one is my favorite because they're all pretty good. If you're really hungry I'd order the fries because they give you ALOT (enough to share witha  few friends and still be stuffed). Always a good time here with good vibes. All the hosts and bartenders are pretty entertaining too(:

First of all, I don't think there's a single meal I would ever wait in line an hour or more for. That being said, I do love Phil's. I like to order the quarter order of baby back ribs (portions are large!), sauce on the side. If you have a small party (as in 4 or less), try going straight into the bar if the line is long. My boyfriend and I are often able to get a seat immediately by going directly into the bar. At least you can have a beer if you are forced to wait a few minutes!

This was good not great. Definitely over-rated. The wait is on average a half hour to get in. If you want to see the line size, check out the Phil's online webcam. The ribs were tasty and tender and the sauce has a bit of a kick. But the overall quality of the BBQ is no better than an average BBQ anywhere in the Southern US. One annoying feature is the ordering process where you have to go to a separate bar just to get a beer with your food.

Wowza!  The portions are BIG and prices SMALL.  I was taken to Phil's by a friend who said that it was a staple in San Diego's cuisine.  I've had better BBQ but probably not in San Diego... I appreciated their pulled pork sandwich complete with coleslaw smothered in the bun and their onion rings are a complete surprise.  The biggest greasiest rings I've ever had, you can really taste the dough they are fried in!  One of those experiences where it is totally delicious but if you think about what you're eating, you might feel a bit sick as you slowly feel the cholesterol lining the sides of your heart.  Totally worth every attack.

Okay, top 3 craziest lines I've ever experienced - 2.5 hour wait by the time we sat down (what makes it feel long is you have to stand OUTSIDE and slowly inch your way forward in a line that wraps all the way around the building...also there seems to be a lot of tourists every time I come). Fortunately, at Phil's, I pig out so much that I only need to endure this line about once a year. Here's a list of what my friend and I ordered (for 2 people....1 meal): - BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich - Best pulled pork sandwich ever. Melt in your mouth pork and just the right amount of BBQ sauce. I added some macaroni salad to every bite to add a bit of creaminess. - BBQ Tri Tip Sandwich - not so good. Too smoky for me, although the meat was very tender. It needed some variety or something. - Baby Back Rib Dinner - Best ribs. Ever. Must try the ribs here because they are fall off the bone, melt in your mouth goodness. - Macaroni Salad - My favorite side - we were fighting over this one and we finished this first out of everything - Baked Beans - Second favorite side - goes well with all the BBQ! - Potato Salad - Pretty good, but macaroni salad is way better. - Onion Rings - Super greasy, super crispy, and HUGE. I normally don't love onion rings but I ate about 3 or 4 huge ones because I couldn't stop. - Side Salad - Pretty much just green lettuce and like a wedge of a tomato with dressing on the side - we ate it to feel less guilty about the rest of our meal Needless to say, people were gaping and staring at our table full of food. But like I said, I'm only willing to face this insane line every so often, so I have to make it worth my while. You should too!

Yes, I was one of those people who stood in line for two hours to get my fill of Phil's!  If you're visiting from out of town and you have the time, you gotta try this for the experience alone.  Its kinda like waiting in a line at Disneyland.   You know once its your turn, it'll go fast.  But you'll love every second of the actual ride. I've had the baby back ribs, beef ribs, BBQ chicken and the El Toro (on separate occasions)... All were delicious so I have no favorite.  The onion rings are gi-normous so if you order it as a side you can make some easy friends by sharing them.   For locals - if you have a place close by or have some time to picnic, I recommend take-out.  You get you're food without standing in the monstrosity of a line... Get there early.  If you arrive 15-30 minutes BEFORE they open, you will get seated and served rather quickly.   The service staff (you actually serve yourself but they have staff that comes and supplies extra plates and clears the table) is very quick and accommodating.   You won't be disappointed if you can stomach the wait.

Reallllly long wait to get a seat, of course it was a Saturday, so it comes with the territory. I ordered the pulled pork and got some ribs too. The sauce was really good, but I have had better pulled pork. The ribs were slightly overcooked, but still tasted pretty good. The onion rings were on point. I have had better BBQ in my life, even in San Diego, but Phil's is pretty legit.  Maybe I should try it again and get another experience.

Phil's BBQ.  To be honest with you, if you want good food, large portion sizes and something that is easy on the wallet, I would suggest coming here.  I have only waited in line once, and I only remember this because they were filming the Real World San Diego on MTV and there were camera people all over the place and everyone in line was confused as to why they were there. Anyway, after waiting for 15 minutes we realized that there was a bar and that avoided the long line and since figuring that out, it is the only way to go. The food here is really good.  I have tried the beef ribs, baby back ribs and chicken (not in one sitting).  Everything I have had I have enjoyed.  You could probably split everything on the menu since the portions are HUGE.  My favorite side is the pasta salad and my boyfriend loves their fries.  The service is on point and you cant go wrong when you come here, they are quick to take your order and the food does not take long to come out. My boyfriends company has also used Phil's for Catering and they were great.  I had to go pick up the food and they were running a little behind but they were super nice and kept offering me a drink when I was waiting.  The food was also just as good and everyone at my boyfriends company loved the baby back ribs and chicken. Definitely make Phil's a place you check out at least once to get your BBQ fix!

The Lakers were in town pre-season playing the Sacramento Queens, so my buddies and I hit up Phil's post-game.  It was a Thursday night.  We beat the crowd leaving the Sports Arena to Phil's.  I have never heard of anyone walking right into Phil's and not having to wait in a ridiculously long line.  We ordered within a couple minutes.  So far, so good. We filled up our cups at the drink machine, found a table and then proceeded to wait.  A really looooooooooooooong time.  This is bbq.  This stuff should be cooked already.  What, do they butcher Wilbur on the spot when you order some baby back ribs?  I typically avoid this place like the French avoid deodorant because of the ridiculous line that snakes around the outside.  I thought that I was going to have a good evening when I saw that we walked right in.  Boy was I wrong. We waited, and waited, and waited...  I did not run a stop-watch, so I may be off by a few minutes, but we were pushing the 30-minute mark on our meal.  I drank so much water waiting that I hit the restroom twice before our food was ready. And the food...it is good enough.  This is not mind-blowing bbq.  It is good, but it is not worth the wait.  At all.  First off, it is hard to qualify a place as "great bbq" when there is a complete absence of brisket.  Second, where the heck is the tri-tip meal?  My friend said he wanted tri-tip. The pleasant girl behind the register said, "You mean the tri-tip sandwich?"  "No" my friend explained, he wanted a tri-tip meal.  No can do apparently.  You want tri-tip, you gotta order a friggin' sandwich. I had the baby back ribs, veggies and fries.  Fries are really hard to screw up, and Phil's did a good job with them.  They are thick-cut with the skins on.  The veggies are veggies.  And the baby back ribs are slathered in a really sweet sauce.  If you like a dry, vinegar or mustard-based bbq, you are not gonna like this place.  Heck, how about giving the customers a sauce option?  What do I know though?  This place does gang-busters business. There are other options around town that do not involve committing hours of your life.  Go forth and explore!

**** As one can hopefully see below, Fred, from Phil's wrote me back to tell me there's more than one way to BBQ.  Yes, I know that.   Maybe I wasn't explicit enough for him to understand, so I will be clearer here... I didn't like Phil's style of BBQ.  I found the pork and beef flavorless and the chicken dry.  I won't be back because I've had it twice and was underwhelmed. Apparently the Yelp masses disagree and they love it.  Good for Phil's.  I can't believe he actually took the time to respond to my review when they have such an obvious positive following, but thanks for your opinion Fred.  Remember, that's all my review is too.  You surely won't be missing my patronage. ***** Shoot...I've been putting off this review for awhile...It's like voting...does my opinion make a difference? Everyone else seems to go ape-sheit for this joint, so obviously the masses have spoken.   I write then, not for the screaming masses, but for the BBQ snobs.  On Chowhound this place is panned pretty universally.  I didn't believe it at first (they really ARE BBQ snobs there). Anyway, finally got to try Phil's twice in one week.  Randomly went at an off time after hearing about how great this place was from all the locals.  My work then catered free Phil's a few days later.   No line at 930 pm on a Tuesday. Ordered chicken and beef ribs as a combo and also the baby back ribs (cuz BBQ ain't BBQ without baby backs). Anyway, universally disappointed. Here's the thing, the meat is pretty much unflavored and unmarinated and then just slathered with their too tangy sauce afterwards.  I wonder if they have a smoker at all? I'm going to go ahead and sound like a douche here and say,"Real BBQ is dry rubbed and smoked, enhancing the flavor of the meat.  True BBQ'ed meat stands on it's own and needs no sauce." Anyway, this meat was tender, but really had no flavor of it's own.  The beef and pork was juicy and tender.  The chicken was dry. So yeah, I'm one of the few detractors of this place.  Like Gehre M though, I've been the the BBQ mecca in the South and I have tasted much, much better. Sorry Phil's I shan't be back.

The go-to place for ribs. Every time someone visits me in San Diego, this is a must come place just for the experience. Line can be long if you come during prime dinner hours but after 8PM it should be no problem. I've been here numerous times. Ribs are very consistent but occasionally they either burn the ribs too much that it's charred or put too much sauce. Still love the place though.

If not for the service, I would have scored it lower. The staff were great-- pleasant, polite and efficient-- what more could you ask for?? There also were generous helpings of everything ordered-- had to take home about a third. I ordered  a beef rib & chicken combo, hubby ordered a pork rib dinner, both of us had cole slaw and fries as sides, and shared a "small" onion ring order. Both the beef and pork were well cooked and tender, but not much flavor was in the meat; the chicken had obviously been brined-- salty all the way through, but despite this was somewhat dry and "tough". Fries were OK when they were hot, but inedible once they cooled down; onion rings were also really good hot, but too greasy to eat when cooled. Cole slaw-- meh. The teas (both the "black tea" and the whatever fruity flavored tea-- tasted like water that had passed over leaves already used a couple of times, not like "tea". The sauce-- obviously a lot of people DO like it, but it definitely was NOT to my taste-- thin and VERY vinegary... couldn't really taste anything in it except the vinegar. The worst part of being there, though, was the noise level. I could hardly hear my husband speak from just across the table from me, and I had the start of a headache by the time we left. We arrived early, on a Tues-- ~ 5PM-- so didn't really have to wait to order or for a table, but there was a stalled line wrapping around the side of the building by the time we left, so be aware of that if you chose to go at a more usual "dinner time". Also SOMETHING about the dinner kept me up most of the night with "heartburn".

Phil's BBQ definitely tasted infinitely better in memory than in fact, but it's still one of the only meats I'll eat since I'm not a big fan of meat. + GET THE BABY BACK RIBS! The meat falls right off the bone! If you are able to eat a whole chipotle burrito in one go, you will probably want the full plate + 2 sides here. + Can ask for extra complimentary BBQ sauce + GET Sweet baked beans as side! - Mac salad, onion rings and fries were ordinary really - The sauce is a bit too tangy for my taste, but each to their own - Ranch is $0.50. I'm cheap, yeah yeah yeah - Buffy ribs were more bone than meat, at least in my experience. - Look at the webcam on their website for how long the line is I went at 630pm once and waited in line for 2 hours. The next time I went at 9:30pm and there was absolutely no line. I felt kind of cheated. Unless you are dying to eat inside, get to-go because that line goes fast!

I have never had much luck with popular spots that have made television appearances.   Usually they end up being overpriced spots that simply rely on over rated  word of mouth or advertising "As seen on TV".    That is possibly why I put off for so long visiting Phil's BBQ and ended up having me missing out on some really incredible food. The beef sandwich was possibly some of the best BBQ that I have ever ate in my life!  I'm not going to get into the north/south or east/west BBQ arguement, this stuff is simply fantastic!   I ate two sandwiches, one without extra sauce and one with.   The one with was a little overpowering, but either way the meat still melted in my mouth.   The smoky after taste was possibly the best part of the taste bud experience. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is the less than friendly staff.    I would possibly expect that from the restaurant staff because the place was packed and overrun with customers.  I attended a catered event in the event hall behind the main restaurant.   The three servers had the distant and impersonal attitude of bouncers that you find at the entrance of clubs.   They seemed more as if they were there to protect the food rather than serve and attend to the guests.

Phil's BBQ is absolutely delicious.  Whenever I come here, I order their ribs.  Boom. Done deal. You need the BBQ baby back ribs!  I don't wait in line for over an hour and NOT get it.  The servings are huge and you definitely get your money and time's worth.  As you have probably read from a majority of the reviews, the lines get long.  One time we waited an hour an twenty minutes before we even got inside the restaurant and seated.  The line goes around all the way out the door and around the establishment and time goes by so slow as you wait because you can smell the aroma of the BBQ inside.  But let me tell you, IT IS SO WORTH IT.  Go here if you have the chance.  Be patient, grasshopper, your food is waiting for you.  Only four stars instead of five because the line gets too long. Btw, if you are a Costco member, you can go to the Costco in SD and buy Phil's BBQ sauce!!

Really, really good beef ribs! I'm usually not a fan of beef ribs. Most of the time, they are too fatty, tasteless, and overcooked...and I much prefer pork baby back ribs. However, the beef ribs at Phil's BBQ are freaking awesome! The corn bread and slaw compliment the ribs perfectly. The line for Phil's is usually long, so call in and take them home...that way you can truly chow down and pig out!

In a nutshell, this place changed my life! You see, prior to my visit to this San Diego mecca for foodies, I just thought food was food. There was good food, and there was bad food. Everything was just a gradient of grey. But this place - nay, this SHRINE - added color to not only my pallet, but also to my life! This restaurant, with their finger-licking good BBQ sauce and rips-off-the-bone strips of meat, turned me into an avid food hunter: the Indiana Jones of the culinary world! Ahem... But onto the actual view of the restaurant. Right off the bat: there's a long line. First timers beware: you have seldom waited THIS long in a line for food. Bring some forms of entertainment: games, a fully charged phone, a 60" TV on a trolley... Or, if you're a people person, bring some good company! I should also mention that by the time you reach the front to order, you'll be starving, no matter how "not hungry" you may seem when you reserved your spot at the end. For those who do not wish to experience the "dine-in" fun, I recommend calling in and ordering to-go. Heck, some people eat in their cars in the parking lot (way to go, you selfish jerks... now I have to park next to THAT guy who took up one and a half spots...). After your trial of will-power is over, you'll finally get your food. The sauce is simply amazing - a sweet, tangy, BBQ sauce with a light kick (not exactly spicy, but one that keeps the taste-buds begging on their bud-knees for more), and the meat is cooked to perfection*. Here's what you HAVE to try: their beefy ribs AND their baby-back ribs. You - not anyone here on Yelp, not your friends, not your mother, but YOU - have to decide which one is your favorite. There have been some mutinous debates between the integrity of the two among my friends, and like Monopoly and Risk, caused our friends to tether along the fine brink of termination! *Their chicken varies every time. Sometimes, they're cooked quite tenderly, with just the right amount of juiciness, but other times, the chicken is rather dry. I suppose it depends on how much of a gambler you feel like that day. Note: Try their Broham and Tri-Tip sandwiches. You won't regret it. And one more thing: the portions are HUGE and sharing is highly recommended!

I was really excited to go to Phil's BBQ for my birthday and was very disappointed with the service I received. This establishment is well known and should have workers that treat their customers well. Staff here is rude, especially the manager.  I printed out a front in the line pass for my birthday and showed my id. Because the name on my ID says my legal name and the name on the print out says my alias, they said they cannot honor the front of the line pass. I said that's ridiculous, my id shows my date of birth. Manager replies back and says "We cannot honor so do you want to take your fucking paper back or what?" Are you kidding me? Management...cussing at customers? Wow Phil's BBQ. Nice training you have there. I will never go here again especially with the service I received.

Alright, this is my first review. Hate to say it, but it's not starting off well. I came here for my friend's birthday (there were a lot of us) and was looking forward to trying it for the first time. Came in with our front of the line birthday pass and was rejected by the hostess, a second employee, and then the manager. This is where the female manager became hostile. We explained what happened with the front of the line pass. My friend's birthday name didn't match his ID (the name on the line was his other name that he went by). They thought we were lying. We kept trying to explain our story but to no avail. We were extremely frustrated with the situation and left. AS WE LEFT, THE FEMALE MANAGER SWORE AT US!! Who does that??? Really? "Take your fucking paper with you too" Word for word. That's what she said. It's been a week and a half since the incident. We even emailed and didn't even get an apology or understanding of the matter. This is telling me that there is a problem with leadership among this business.

The service we received at Phil's was bad enough, but their response when we voiced our complaint has been a complete joke. Not only had I barely received a response from a letter I wrote to the company about a recent visit in which their manager told us to take our "f@#$ing" paper and take it somewhere else," but they have the audacity to MOCK and not even explain themselves on my boyfriend's Yelp review (see Pierre N.'s review below). Really, Phil's!? Is this how you treat your  customers? Now not only are we not going to return, but we're going to make sure everyone knows how little you value your customers. I penned an extensive letter to Phil's about the poor service we received after being told by one of the other managers to do so. I did this almost 2 weeks ago on Tuesday. The only response I received was late Sunday night in which no apology was issued but rather the following:   "Kim T., Is there a good time to contact you tomorrow in regards to your visit to Phil's BBQ? Please advise." There was no "We're sorry about your recent experience and would like to discuss the matter with you." Just a "please advise."  I responded kindly and gave him my number and availability to speak, but have heard nothing back. First we get cursed out by by one manager and now I'm being basically ignored/treated as if I did something wrong by another. I rather take my business elsewhere where it is valued and I already know 8 people who will be doing the same. I hope more will join us. ------------------------------------- Update in response to Fred below: Yes, I'm the person the GM spoke to but he only called me the day after we posted all these Yelp reviews. Coincidence? I doubt it. Apparently if you have a problem, skip corporate and go to Yelp because Phil's doesn't care when you have a problem unless other people know about it. I don't appreciate Fred misrepresenting what happened. We were not trying to scam their front of the line birthday pass program. I really don't know anyone who would go through the trouble of producing a fake CA driver's license with their photo and birthday on there just to avoid waiting in line at Phil's. Also, we had already said we were leaving when the manager started swearing at us so no, they did not initially ask us to leave politely and then not so politely. And from his comment, I take it that Phil's is taking the position that there comes a time when it is okay to use inappropriate language with their guests.

This is the 2nd time I've been to Phil's and it's been great both times.  The wait is the only detriment, but there is a little bar on the sidewalk that you can get a beer from while you wait in line - just don't let them know you're at the back of the line or else they won't let you leave with it.   I got the BBQ chicken dinner and I will tell you that there was so much food it was crazy.  No matter what the wait is, it's worth it!  You could go on the bar side and try to get in more quickly, but that side was even packed this night.   This is the perfect place if you have a larger group, because you can entertain each other in line.  While we were waiting, a server came outside and brought onion rings for everyone in line to enjoy! Great place for an evening - just don't go if you are in a hurry.

THE BBQ SAUCE!!!!!!!!!!!! Phil's has the most delicious, dream-worthy sauce on their baby back ribs! MORE BBQ SAUCE PLEASE! Not too sweet, perfectly tangy, with a bit of spice to it. I loved their bbq sauce so much that I used it on my fries too! We ordered the baby back ribs and the beef bone tickler which came with these 2 GIGANTIC onion rings. The baby back ribs were super tender and the sauce was finger-lickin' good. Everything else--sides and onion rings were decent. The sides we had were good, but nothing spectacular--cole slaw and baked beans. If I went back to Phil's, I'd get just the baby back ribs! Definitely worth a stop if you're in the SD area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to just eat there. Service was friendly and food came out fast! Go there early to avoid the line!

To be honest, Phil's is just kind of average... the meat's really nothing special, it's not really even bbq. The sauce is pretty good though, but it's like they just cover up the fact by pouring it on. The prices are reasonable, but the bar's always packed so it's kind of a pain to find a seat. I don't see how anyone could wanna wait in line for 45+ minutes. Slightly hyped up but decent.

DISAPPOINTING. I don't know if I was all hyped up from all the positive reviews that I read about this place but it truly was a let down. The food was meh and their 'magical' sauce was salty and boring. It's a sit down place but not really, it's cafeteria style with assigned seating. A place with long lines with food that's meh?  Not down.

Ah the original, wait was long and expected, but it moved along quite fast. Waitress sat us in the bar room and we ordered at the table, I got the chicken and pork ribs combo which were delicious, destroyed them both, so tender. They have side sauces you can add and the waiter drops off wet naps for you. This location is bigger than the San marcos location, tasted a little bit better. Also they have a photobooth outside as you wait in line and one of the workers perform magic, yep random.

I have been a loyal fan of Phil's since I lived in Mission Hills eons ago. The food was wonderful then. I moved to the upstate of  South Carolina for a couple of years, and returned to San Diego. Had BBQ in the South. Real BBQ -  slow smoked in smokers....had 'em in rual and urban cities.  All were wonderful. Came back to San Diego, craved BBQ and realized..this is GRILLING.  Pre cooked ribs, slathered with BBQ sauce at the end.  So...I still give it three stars. Phil's is still good, but....the South has the best BBQ  hands down. The downside is the line.  It can be round the blg. Now, I just order take out and take it to a park or home. Yeah, it's grilling, but it's the closest thing here in San Diego. I would recommend Phil's to first timers and out of towners.  Suggestion? If you're in a hurry, order take out and enjoy it elsewhere.  It can be a long wait, then order, try to find an open table....a bit much. Maybe another arrangement for this system can be made to smooth it out.  But, with a wildly successful business, ain't gonna happen. So, if you want to dine in, come on the off times - when they open between rush hours....you may still have to wait, but not as long. They also have a full liquor bar and you can eat at the bar area. The noise level can be really, really loud  and boisterous.

Does Phil's have the best BBQ in San Diego? The answer to that question almost aways incites a rigorous debate, one in which I have no interest in participating in. What I do know is that what Phil's serves up is downright delicious. When we arrived a little after 7pm last night, the line to get in was out to the parking lot. A helpful employee approached us and recommended that we go to the bar area and try and snag some seats. That little nugget of advice proved to be very helpful, and we were immediately able to grab two stools at a table upon entry. In the bar area, the employees actually come to your seat, take your order, and then serve the goodies to you. I was starving and opted for the full rack of baby back ribs with sides of macaroni salad and french fries. My partner in crime had the full rack of beef ribs with cole slaw and baked beans. My baby backs were tender as can be, and the bbq sauce they were smothered in was heavenly. I couldn't finish all of my ribs, nor did my dining companion put a dent in his massive portion. Needless to say, we were both stuffed to the gills and hauled a giant container of pork and beef home with us. I never cease to be amazed by Phil's. The operation is impressive, and I've never had a bad meal. Unfortunately, after having a one year hiatus from Phil's location in San Marcos, my latest trip to the Sports Arena location has placed the Phil's bug back in me; I'm craving it, daily.

Got here at 8pm on a Saturday night. The line was 1.5 hours in the rain! I was pissed but my friend said it would be worth it. We drove from Newport Beach to stay in SD for the weekend so my friend took us on a food tour of SD. I felt like I was in Knott's Berry Farm, waiting in line for a ride. We finally got in and ordered. The three of us ordered: 2 Baby Back Rib and Chicken dinner, Baby Back Rib Tickler, and an order of the Onion Rings. We each got some beer as well, Fat Tire of course! I was starving so I started shoveling my mouth with those Onion Rings. I was in heaven! I love Onion rings and these were by far, the best I have ever had! Not greasy, super crunchy, and with a side of homemade buttermilk ranch dressing! I probably ate most of the order myself! The Baby Back Ribs were really tender and good. Unfortunately I wasn't really digging the tangy bbq sauce. Next time I will just get it on the side. I tried the Macaroni Salad, Coleslaw, and Baked Beans. The Baked Beans were really good and had a nice sweetness to them. The Coleslaw was good and I don't even like Coleslaw! The Macaroni Salad was ok, I had better. I loved that they had a roll of paper towels on the table because I used a lot! Service was good. Food was a bit pricey. I will definitely return for the amazing Onion rings!!!!!! Definitely worth the wait. Beware the ultimate food coma that arises after eating! I slept like a baby!

The amount of meat on the ribs makes it one of the best in town. Dave's in North County is also good and a 5 star because the better sauce is worth a extra star.

Went for the second time yesterday (December 19), ordered the Broham sandwich (pulled pork) with the cole slaw inside. Lots of meat and sauce, had to eat it with a fork first. Tip: Take it off the paper or else the paper will stick to the sauce. Pretty yummy! The meat wasn't as juicy as I would have liked but still a tasty sandwich. And I was really full afterwards.. Had some of my friends' fries (average), baked beans (okay), and beefy ribs (yum!) as well.

Based on reviews and recommendations from friends and family, my son insisted on going to Phil's.  My sister-in-law lives in San Diego, so we met her and her kids there on a Sunday evening (following a painful Chargers loss).  They were in line when we got there, so our wait wasn't terribly long.  The time in line went quickly as we had a chance to catch up.  Obviously the line doesn't phase patrons, and once you eat there you will understand why. I have been all over the US and Canada, and this was the best bbq i have ever had.  As my son said, you wouldn't think of San Diego for ultimate bbq.  Memphis, Kansas City, or Texas perhaps, but San Diego???  I got the "broham" sandwich, and you need to be prepared to eat it with a knife and fork.  I defy you to pick up this monster and eat it as a sandwich, unless you are prepared to wear it!  Son got the full rack and couldn't eat it all.  Sides of macaroni salad and beans were so tasty.  And the sauce, wow, absolutely incredible, just the right mix of smoke, flavor, and spice.  The portions are huge, so be prepared to get a container to go and have leftovers later.  And the kicker is the prices are very reasonable. Chances are there will be a line, but trust me, it is SO worth the wait.  And the staff there was top notch too.

In San Diego, looking for great places to eat, so I of course I turned to yelp.  Found Phil's, and then I find out it's been featured on DDD?  Sold! The line wasn't anywhere near as long as we feared, and the service was excellent.  Of course, the food was amazing.  I had ribs and the husband had pulled pork.  We split an order of fries and an order of onion rings, which meant with the total amount of food we ordered we could have fed a small country, but we kept it all for ourselves. There's a reason it has that many great reviews on yelp.  You have to go if you're in San Diego.

Again, my college friend, transplanted from LA to SD, took me here.  Twice. I love good bbq.  I thought it was good, but not great.  It should have been succulent.  It was too dry.  The bbq sauce was just like any other.  Sure, it was a filling meal, but I don't remember it as being as compelling as he made it out to be. Also, this isn't the Mission breakfast joint on University up in North Park with a North Park crowd.  I don't know where this place gets its crowd from.  I felt as if I was in the Midwest.  It was a lot of "jarines," the women who have their children, and their noisy rug rats ... or it was pocket protector dudes in defense with similar family constellations.  Sure, it looks like a pot luck on picnic tables, so, why wouldn't it pull in this crowd? A-ok ... take it or leave it .... or why not if in San Diego and don't want to eat at chain places.

I came here for the first time around 12 on Sunday and surprisingly the wait was only 20 minutes. Ordered: Baby backribs: super delicious El Toro (sliced tri-tip char-grilled and topped with BBQ sauce):the beef was good but too much BBQ sauce made the bun soggy Potato salad and macaroni salad: just okay ... i think it's favorless I would come back for the baby backribs only ...

Phil's, Schmil's - I've heard college kids and adults both babble on about this place. "THE RIBS!" they would say. "THE RIBS!!!" Followed by some hyperventilation and/or drooling. At which point I would slowly back away.   I never expected hunks of meat and bone to elicit such a reaction from ordinarily mild-mannered people. But after a trip here, it's not hard to see why Phil's has so many fans throughout Southern California. The barbecue sauce is the perfect combination of sweet, smoky, and tangy - and the meat is nicely smothered with it. The sauce forms a gentle glaze over each rib, ensuring that each moist and tender morsel is packed with maximum flavor. I like how the sauce isn't burnt or hardened to a tooth-shattering crisp - it's just right.   I'd recommend going for the baby back ribs (pork) - the meat glides right off the bone and onto your hips. I mean, into your mouth. The beefy ribs (funnily enough, beef) are humongous, but a bit tough and a little too smoky. Stick with the porky original. In terms of portions, I split a half rack of ribs and two sides with a petite friend, and both of us were left wanting more. If you don't live in the area, just go for a full rack and take home the leftovers. That is, if you even have any. The sides are blandly decent on their own, but when accompanied by the stellar ribs, they become necessities. Get some coleslaw to offset the meaty cholesterol-y joy, as well as some fries to sop up the leftover sauce you've dribbled all over your plate. The meals here are bound to get messy, but they've mercifully supplied each table with a roll of paper towels and moist napkin wipes. If you're a baby like me, they have bibs, too.   Also, bonus points for their efficient line system - they have a timepoint sign (like at Disneyland: "20 minutes from this point", or something like that), a free photobooth to keep you entertained, and a friendly hostess up near the front that takes your order early. Waiting in line sucks. Phil's acknowledges this, and unlike other restaurants, actually tries to make it better. And every single server/manager/hostess we encountered was genuinely friendly and eager to make our experience wonderful. Guess what, Phil's? It was.

By far some of the worst barbq I have ever had in my life.  Being from Texas, my California friends have long told me I HAD to go here because it was so good.  We went to the one on Sports Arena and I ordered a Tri Tip sandwich and fries.  I ate one bite, put the sandwich down and then only ate my fries.  I couldn't take it.  The meat wasn't cooked well, the sauce was awful, nothing about the meal was good.  I'll make the drive out to Coop's any time I need good BBQ in SD, thanks.

I think this place is a bit overrated. Service is great but the food isn't blow-you-out-of-this-universe amazing. I do have to admit the sauce is pretty good. And everything's decently priced. To be fair, I'd give them 3.5 stars overall but I don't have that option on Yelp...

Do I really need to write a long review on why this place is sooooooo gooooood and describe the orgasmic explosion that it creates in my mouth with every bite I get!... Don't really need to after seeing that they have 4,000+ reviews, that should say enough! The only thing I do wanna say is this... I never was a BBQ fan or even wanted to try ribs till I came and tried this place last year. BIG MISTAKE!!.. I should of started from the bottom of mediocre ribs because now everywhere I go and try ribs I compare it to this place and of course they don't compare at all!.. This will always be my favorite place unless I travel to the south where they are big on ribs, but till then.. PHILS IT IS!!

Been coming here a lot from Orange County. I normally order the full rack of ribs plus fries on the side. The portions are pretty good. The ribs are very very meaty.. Not ordinary ribs u find a chilis or captain jacks. Full rack of pork ribs are around $20 and half rack would be around $15. As the meat melted in my mouth all I can think of was...DAMN!! WHERE HAVE U BEEN ALL MY LIFE MY LOVE!!!!! Lmao. I drive around almost 2 hrs to them and wait in their lines that normally wrap around the building then feast like a beast then drive home...so worth the trip @_@ The sauce was tangy and sweet at the same time. The meat falls off the bones. Omg *drools It's so worth it..trust me because I drive here once or twice a month :D

Not only is his food good, but Phil himself is a very nice person, who has so many customers I often wonder how he remembers you when you visit. He has great employees and that makes his food even more wonderful, good food and great service. For the years i have only smiled and and have been satisfied with my food, for that Phil gets the Big fat "A" in my book!!!

Good if you have never had real BBQ...you know...BBQ from Texas.  I have.  This is not it.  It's Okay for California BBQ. Since BBQ roots are from the cheapest cuts of meat cooked in such a way it was edible, the prices they charge makes you think they are Mortons Steakhouse.  They're not.

The food is pretty good, though I prefer smoked meats (not available at Phil's).  Favorites are the Brougham pulled pork sandwich, and the tickler's (ribs or chicken).  Turn-offs include the ridiculously long lines (really, the food is good, but not worth lining up hours for).  Also, they nickle and dime you for things like a small side of ranch dressing, as busy and successful as this place is, you'd think they wouldn't charge extra for things like some ranch to dip your fries/onion rings in...food for thought Phil...

I had to take a couple friends visiting from London out to dinner last Wednesday. They wanted something that they don't get to eat in London, options narrowed down to fresh sashimi from Sushi Ota and good barbeque from Phil's BBQ. They ended up choosing meat so here we were at Phil's. The line that night (Wed) wasn't bad at all, we waited for about 30 minutes only. Three of us ordered: -Full Beefy Ribs: Delish! Good sauce and not dry -Full Baby Back Ribs: Delish! Flavorful and very tender meat. -Caesar salad: Decent, can't go wrong with fresh veggies -Large Onion Rings: Average -Large Fried: Average -Baked Potato: Tasty, topped with cheese -Corn-on-the-Cob: Average, no toppings -Cole Slaw: Decent Three of us left with happy stomachs and it was only $60!

This place has got a lot of reviews! I stumbled upon it on yelp as we were planning a trip down to SD and I noticed this place had a stellar average review. We came just before the lunch rush and there was no wait, I was concerned as I've read about lines around the building. It was raining when we visited so that may have been a factor although the line had started to grow by the time we were done. It's not super big inside, almost like a Famous Dave's feel to it. You go to the register and order the food you want, having just arrived we didn't have a chance to review the menu extensively. We asked what was good and the friendly guy behind the register gave us his preference. We duly ordered that and found a table. We didn't have to wait long (suggesting that they just keep cranking out ribs) for our rib full plate with mac salad and fries and onion rings. We were sharing due to the ridiculous amount of food we had last night in El Cajon (see review). The onion rings were massive, crispy and up there with the best onion rings I've had. A little too greasy if I'm being picky. Fries were a little dry, not the best fries (I do love fries) but by no means the worst. I'm not commenting on how they make the ribs but the ribs and sauce went down a treat. It's quite tangy and like so many things is down to personal preference. We both liked it and the ribs fell off the bone which is important. No one wants dry ribs that stick to the bone, that's nasty. Clearly this place is popular, it's not quite 5 stars to me but a good effort nonetheless.

I LOVE Phil's! My first visit here I got the pork ribs... I thought they were OK. Good, but I wasn't over the moon.  My second visit I got the beef and WOW my life changed. They're succulent, juicy, tender, but still with a chew and have that fatty goodness that is so quintessential in a good beef rib!  Their macaroni salad makes me want to bury myself in 6 ft of it and eat my way out. Go to Phil's, wait In line, go early, call in an order, or sit in the bar. Do whatever you have to and ill see you there!!!

Yum! For any LA people, think of it as San Diego's version of Lucille's. The ribs are delicious, especially the baby back ribs. They practically fall off the bone.

Obviously this is my personal feeling with their crowds and long lines. Ribs are likely the least forgiving meat when it comes to petty cooking mistakes while they need to be cooked over 13 hours. Kudos here for decent ribs. After reading reviews of beef ribs in Memphis, I realized that their satisfaction rate is mostly low. Phil's bbq sauce has the highest proportion of sugar to molasses of any place I tried in town. My favorite rib or bbq joint here is Bull's on Morena. They have a vinegar base sauce that may or may not be the standard. Phil and his staff are nice so there are no complaints about service.

How do you know when barbecue good? Is it the meat? The sauce? They way they cook it?  California is not really know for BBQ, so you kinda just have to go with word of mouth and see where it leads ya. You know it's good when everyone tell's you that it's real good, and constantly have a waiting line that wraps around the Restaurant! I may not be a BBQ connoisseur, but I think I would know a thing or two about what taste good! That sweet, tangy, and smokey flavors of Phil's is a triple scoop of YUM! Dollar for dollar, your best bet for bang for the buck deal for lunch or dinner in SD. A healthy portion of delicious meat and sides for less than $13-15 a person. =The Food= Beef ribs, gotta have the ribs! Brisket, gotta try the brisket! Baby back ribs, so tender Chicken, even the chicken was good I've realized that no matter how good their sides are, it's just not worth it. If you want my advice, skip the sides, grab a beer and order more meat!

Excellent bbq.  You really need those napkins lol.  Sauce tasted good but my ribs were a little burned.  Decent prices, depending on what you get you can spread it out over 2 meals.  Tasty baked beans and fries.  Haven't tried any other side dishes.  If it's your first time, I would try both the chicken and beef.  Dishes are also very hot so be careful.

Think of Famous Dave's, Dave & Busters, Tony Roma's, and Black Angus...but a ton better.  When I had co-workers from out of town, always took them here. I usually get the beef ribs and chicken combo. You can't go wrong with that mix. Food here is so good that it's tough to understand why it's also so cheap. You definitely get more for what you pay for. This places is always busy and the lines usually wrap around the building. However, the lines are faster than you think. Located in the sports arena area. You get a mix between tourist and locals. Don't let the lines intimidate you to go elsewhere. Believe me, never more than 30 minutes wait for me.  Sometimes as quick as 5 minutes. If you're in SD and looking for some good BBQ, don't mess around with other establishments. Got to come here.

Oh wow! People were not kidding about the line at this place. After hearing how great Phil's BBQ was I wanted to try it for myself. So I went with some friends while visiting San Diego. We were able to get the Full Rib set (12 pieces of ribs with 2 small sides). After looking at how long the line was we decided to take Phil's BBQ as take out. The ribs were quite delicious, I only wish I had more because I ate 3 pieces. :) I would definitely check Phil's out, but I am unsure how long I would want to wait to eat their BBQ. If your time is limited it will be best to check out the take out line which is way shorter!

My parents are visiting from out of town, and to my delight, my Dad asked if there was anywhere we could get good barbecue. Heh. Well, 4,000+ reviewers can't be wrong.  I've been to the location in San Marcos for lunch, and I was sure that this experience would be even better, because in SM i chickened out and got pulled pork and fries and maybe cole slaw.  This time, I really went for it and got beef ribs.  So did my Pops.  My stepmom was sensible and went with the baby back quarter rack, so she was actually able to finish HER meal. Those ribs were SO good, just falling off the bone!  Not too much sauce, but enough to get some finger lickin' in.  My Dad and I, on the other hand, made it through about one or two ribs each before throwing in the towel and boxing it up for another meal.  In fact, between the two of us, we were able to save enough ribs for the three of us to eat a second meal and I STILL have a couple of bones left over.  (Note to the wise: re-heat those bad boys low and slow in a Crockpot with a couple TBSPs of water for like 6 hours, and you will reach nirvana again.) As for the line, well, I read enough reviews to be forewarned, so I told my folks that we'd better get there before we thought we'd be starving.  It's a good thing we did, because it was about an hour from the time we hit the parking lot to when our buzzer went off for food.  That line ain't no joke, but it actually does move rather steadily. The only reason why I'm knocking off a star is because I'm pretty particular about my barbecue side dishes, and while the sides that I did get were quite good (bbq baked beans and slaw), they don't serve my favorites: cornbread and macaroni and cheese.     Those onion rings are a-MAY-zing, btw!

Lucille's BBQ really has NOTHING on this place. The last time I went to Lucille's was over 2 years ago and I don't remember a thing from there except that they have different sauces and it was overpriced food. I know I will DEFINITELY remember Phil's. Environment: YES, there is always a line but don't be afraid of waiting or standing in it. It's part of the experience--if it's your first time, stand in line and smell the food cooking--it'll make your food eating THAT much better! The restaurant itself is crowded but a nice kind of crowded. It's hustling and bustling, but there's ample space to sit, eat, and walk! Smells divine and has a nice vibe to it. Food: THIS IS THE BEST PART! Whoever says this isn't authentic BBQ or claims to be a BBQ expert.. get off your high horse. If it can get this many awesome overall reviews, then something's wrong with your taste buds or you just have a different taste. The sauce is AWESOME and the ribs are drool-worthy. I split the full rib dinner (the actual big rib, not the baby back) with my brother and we were splitting at the seams at the end. We got 2 small sides (not really small.. quite large actually) of fries and macaroni salad--YUM! The meat isn't fall off the bone, and that's how it's supposed to be! (fall off the bone is actually cheater bbq... that means it's been boiled and over done) We also ordered the small (again.. not really small) onion rings--OH MY GOSH... I've never tasted onion rings that good. Crispy but not too oily with an awesome ranch sauce. Not to mention they're gigantic too. The portions are HUGE so split a full dinner with someone else to lessen the cost! Everything else: Service is great! After you place your order, they give you a mini buzzer that will buzz and light up when your food is ready. They'll even help you take it over if you ordered a lot or have your hands full! Take-out boxes and bags are also sitting there for you to take--no need to ask the workers.. A+ for that one! More restaurants should do this! Overall a great experience and I'm even willing to drive 2 hours (b/c I'm in LA) to eat this at least twice a year--might even go for my birthday in 2 months! YOU ROCK PHIL'S!

Long line which we all know but I wish they would just be honest dont say 21 min ans 14 second. Wait say and hour please. Just be honest. The best thing about this place was gabe and magic mat. Good workers very friendly I enjoyed them. The food was okay kinda burnt. Just go to the bar to drink then it would be a goodtime.

Went to the Santee Phil's that just opened up. Still a crazy long line sometimes but it's Phil's so what else is new. I ordered the pulled pork one time and a second time I ordered the ribless plate. Both were really good, alot better than my first experience. Still think the best thing to do is order to go if you don't want to wait for a seat.

Best BBQ that you will find anywhere in California. I love every dish that they have, including my favorites: - Broham: pulled pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw and that sauce that Phil's is famous for. - Baby Back Ribs: finger-licking baby back ribs smothered in BBQ sauce, I always get the full rack because half is never enough. - Beefy Ribs: HUGE ribs with tons of meat, two beefy ribs are enough for me! I also love the fresh cut fries, baked beans and macaroni salad as sides. YUM! Phil's wasn't shown on tv shows such as Man vs. Food for no reason - it's because it is just that good! Try it for yourself and remember to get extra wipes for the way home. FRIENDLY TIP: If you see that the line is too long and don't want to wait, just call in (from the parking lot) and order togo. You can pick up your order usually within ~15 minutes.

Phil's is awesome! We phoned our order in because we didn't want to wait in a crazy long line and were intending to bring our food eat @ the Sunset Cliffs anyway. We called around 10-15 mins before and saw a decent sized line when we got there. Waited another 5-10 mins for our food once we were inside. Not too bad of a wait if you get it to go. We probably would have been waiting for 30-40 mins in that line. We ordered the El Toro sandwich, Baby back ribs half-rack dinner w/ cole slaw and fries, and an order of "small" onion rings. The tri-tip in the El Toro was probably the smokiest tri-tip I've ever had - it was so good! My wife doesn't really like anything too smoky, including food haha, so it didn't tickle her fancy. But I love smoky-flavored food, and this did not disappoint one bit. The BBQ sauce just put it over the top. So good. The ribs were really good too - the meat was so tender and fell right off the bone. There definitely wasn't as smoky a flavor as with the tri-tip so I think my wife may have enjoyed this more than I did. The fries were really good and the onion rings were nicely battered and HUGE. Think "small order of fries from The Hat" when ordering their onion rings. They are *very* generous ;). The cole slaw was, well, cole slaw haha it didn't blow my mind or anything. I think if I had to wait for more than 30 minutes I wouldn't have been as impressed. Also, if you get your food to go, especially the fries and onion rings, make sure you open up and start eating them! Otherwise you'll probably be eating soggy fries and onion rings from all the steam from the heat. I still enjoyed my soggy onion rings and fries though :D

I actually never got to try phils bbq. Last year at this time I checked their website to make sure they were open, said so on the site. Drove down there and they were closed. This year I decided to try again. Checked their website, says they are open. Drove down there and they are under construction. I've heard this place is good but I just keep having bad luck mixed with Phil's bbq incompetence to keep their website up to date. Make sure to call first.

My group of 10 decided to stop by here before heading back to L.A. and the wait was about 30-40 minutes. I'm personally not a big fan of meat eating so I just ordered a bunch of side dishes to keep me full (corn on the cob, steamed veggies, cole slaw, baked potato) while the rest of the group ordered their famous ribs. Once we were all seated, only two out of the bunch raved about how good it was while the others just said it was good but they had better. Just from the sides, I can tell you it is very bland and simple. KFC serves better cole slaw than Phil's B.B.Q! Towards the end of our meal, I had the chance to taste a piece of rib and it was indeed too tangy for me.

Love the food specifically the baby back ribs. I usually get  full baby back rib dinner. I would give them 5 stars if I could eat there with out the SUPER LONG lines but I found a way around that SUPER LONG LINE.  Take-out: the greatest invention ever. Call ahead, and if I leave right after I call, then I will be there just in time and not very long wait (unfortunately there is a little bit of wait even at the phone order line) and then I grab my food and then eat at home with my preferred  TV channel.  I LOVE ONION RINGS and I LOVE their onion ring. You should definitely get the baby back ribs and the onion rings.  I generally do not like baked beans but I am happy to say I like their beans too.  OH, i also tried Whoopie pies and was not a fan.

Going to school in San Luis Obispo I feel like I get the best BBQ up there at Firestone, Jocko's, AJ Spurs, etc. With that being said I think this food is overrated. All the hype about this food set me up for a huge WOW factor. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, just not AMAZING for the amount of time I have to wait for my food. When people come to visit and they want Phil's, I don't look forward to it excited, I dread the line that takes forever... I'm a fan of their onion rings and beans for sides.

Extremely long wait that wraps around outside the building, but you better smile because you'll be on camera. Absolutely the most magnificent bbq I have ever had.  Lucille's has nothing on this place.  Definitely a unique restaurant with great food.  Can't go wrong with any of their items, they're all good.  I ended up spending $50+ because I ordered everything just to try them out. I'm not from SD, but whenever I go, I'll be sure to hit this place again...and again...and again.

LOL I think I would've rated Phil's 5 stars if the following things did not happen... So I got in a fight with my boyfriend over something stupid, so we argued, got our food (we ordered to go), left the restaurant and got to our hotel, continued to argue and had our food set aside until the fries were no longer crispy and the ribs got a little cold..... sigh. I wish I thought about the food first. So, after all that was over... I dug in to my fries. Hm. Cold. The ribs... still warm towards the center of the meat... but kinda cold around the edges. Mac salad was fine, and the chicken we ordered was fine. Thank goodness the onion rings were still crispy! But the ribs and fries :( Well despite all that, they did taste good! The sauce had a good tangy, barbecue flavor and even though the ribs weren't as hot and fresh as I anticipated, I still enjoyed it. The meat was fall off the bone, which was PERFECT. I love it when my meat falls off the bone, that means it's super tender. Sooo tender. Onion rings were also delicious, so happy they lasted longer than the fries. The ranch dip was perfect with it. The bbq chicken was fine, nothing too special about that in my opinion. Wish I didn't let my ribs and fries get cold. So stupid of me. Well, next time I know not to argue before enjoying my food.

I have been a fan of Phil's BBQ ever since the original one in Mission Hills. It's a real "have to try" place for all of those who fancy great bbq flavor and food that makes you wish you knew someone who would top this off! I personally love the ribless dinner. That's my usual since day one. I've heard plenty of good things from my family and friends who enjoy this place just much as I do, so hands down on the list of place to visit! If you are ever in San Diego, you need to taste Phil's BBQ at least once.

Once again, Phil's BBQ ALWAYS impresses... On bringing my niece and her best friend to San Diego for a weekend of beach (specifically Ocean Beach), big fun (SeaWorld), Newport Avenue, the tidepools and and Dog Beach, where dogs and frogs can both have the same amount of fun, Phil's was a must. Friday evening, after a day of beachcombing and playing in the surf, we called in our order...3 burgers, 1 medium, 1 medium-well and 1 well-done...along with sides of fries, onion rings and coleslaw.  We arrived 10 minutes after calling in the order.  After we stepped beyond the 50 minute line of folks waiting to order in, it was 20 minutes from making the call to enjoying our meal. When our number was called, we asked for a container of barbeque sauce to go with the ranch dressing accompanying the onion rings.  Our waitress made sure this went into the bag.  In and out in under 10 minutes with the order, we headed to OB and the park at the corner of Soto and Greene.   As we unpacked our dinner on the picnic table, friends of many years arrived at the park to exercise their dogs.  Once again, to oohs and ahhs, my dining companions fell to their Phil's BBQ, expressing themselves frequently with their pleasure. A FANTASTIC introduction to San Diego, once again.

3 stars cuz called in, got here... they didn't have order.  Then they said they don't even start making it until u pay so what's the point if taking the order over the phone.  Just say "we don't do take out orders over the phone."  So i re-ordered..... blah... As I was writing this review, I got a call on my phone, cuz I called them up asking who takes orders over the phone and how did they mess up.  They said that anyone can take a call so they wouldn't know who took the call.  anyways... short story long... they said my order was in a "special" place in the system that only managers can see.  So, obviously, it was a manager that took my order.  So, I was able to go back in and pick up my already made order.  Funny thing is, why did the blue eyed dirty blonde prob teenage girl lie to me?  why did she say they never start making it until you pay for it?  why lie?  just to make me feel better since I'll have to wait twenty mins?  not cool... Tip: If getting take out for two peeps, a small fry or onion rings is good for two.  A large is freaking MASSIVE!!!!! Changing my stars on the review because they got back to me and the food ROCKS!!!!

Full rack pork ribs fell off the bone, half chicken fell of the bone, El Toro tri-tip (super smoky flavor) was thinly sliced and doused with their signature BBQ sauce. Get your drink on at the bar (order separately from the kitchen), and you are set for an tasty BBQ experience. Others that may have bagged on this place are probably comparing it to other places not in the area.  That might be true, but this place has it hands down in SD.

I read about Phil's BBQ on Alvin C's Yelp page.  I ventured to Phil's BBQ's Yelp site to learn that it had over 4,000 reviews.  Well, my bf and I were on our way to San Diego, so I bookmarked it to see what the commotion was about. The line was about 35-45 minutes long, and this was at 4:30 p.m. on a Saturday.  As it neared dinner time, the line doubled.  We were standing in high 90 degrees like the rest of the crowd.  Phil's BBQ had water coolers on each end of the lines with paper cups.  I must have had 10 servings of the cold water. I didn't like the bbq sauce so I'm glad I had it on the side for the baby back ribs.  I forgot to do this for the El Toro sandwich, so it wasn't as enjoyable as it could have been. The baby back ribs were amazing.  They were tender, juicy and tasty.  Perfect would be the descriptive word.

Went here on our way out of SD. My girlfriend mentioned this is the most reviewed place with the best ratings on yelp. And its bbq, couldn't possibly pass that up now could we? We got there early, about 20 minutes before opening. The staff was wonderful, very polite and professional despite working at a place that has bibs and wet naps. Since we were the one of the first to line up we got in quickly and ordered. Sat down and our food was ready within maybe 7 minutes. I got the chicken and beef ribs, with sweet beans and coleslaw. My girlfriend got the baby back and chicken with fries and mac salad. Also got a side of onion rings to go along with the order. The meat came out lukewarm and dry, except the baby back ribs which were still the same temp but juicy at the very least. the bbq sauce that came with is tangy, and strongly infused with smokey flavor. Not my ideal sauce but I did like the rub that was already present on the meat. The sides were delicious, ridiculously good actually. For a place that serves BBQ its not that great, nor hot. With being the first few in line, about 5 people in front, I was expecting the meat to the piping hot, or at least steamy. Only giving 3 solely because of the staff and sides, 2 off for sub par main dishes.

My love for BBQ knows no bounds. Besides my wife and my dog, there is nothing I love more in life than BBQ. Taking my first bite of Phil's "El Toro" sandwich, my heart stopped for a few beats, so damn good, is this real life? I started doing the Gangnam style dance, did the invisible horse ride on the stool. Having a bite of this sandwich was pure heaven. The lines to get into Phil's are long but as long as you have patience and a craving for the best damn BBQ on the west coast, the few minutes you spend outside will only enhance the pure bliss you will have when you take the first bite of an El Toro. A quick tip, avoid the lines by finding a seat at the bar. Definitely a shorter wait and they serve the full menu.

Clearly the Best BBQ in town.  We came here with a large group for a friend's birthday.  Phil's is a great setting for groups and families. They have a small bar outside so you can have a cold one while you wait in line; of course there is always a line to get in.  I was so thrilled that they have cans of Big Swell IPA out there.  Yes; the same one I'm holding in my profile picture from when I was vacationing in Maui!  This definitely quenched my thirst while waiting in the BBQueue. The ribs we ordered were delicious!  All of the food was tasty and we received it in a reasonable amount of time.  The wait staff was pleasant and efficient.  They came to checked on our party many times and were very helpful. We will definitely be returning here again soon to get another taste of their mouthwatering ribs.

This place is WAAAAAYYYYYYYYY too over-priced and their food is just OK. Their sweet potato fries are pretty delicious and other than that not much else stands out. Pulled pork sandwiches aren't that good, and the ribs aren't anything special. There are DEFINITELY plenty of other BBQ restaurants I would choose over Phil's. The ambiance is loud, the lines are incredibly long and completely not worth the wait. I have eaten here probably 8 or 9 times because everyone kept raving about how awesome this place was, and each time it has been a disappointment. A couple of times the meat was overcooked and the sauce drowned out any flavor from the actual meat rub. The meat definitely does NOT fall right off the bone, you want meat so tender that it falls right off the bone and melts in your mouth the way good smoked ribs should? Go to another restaurant.

This is for the take out service. I wanted Phil's, but didn't want to wait in a long ass line, so we ordered take out. I called in my order and was told that it wouldn't be ready until after I paid for it, which means it'd be fresh! Now this was great news because my husband lost my keys and I was delayed an hour after having made the call. It took about 10min to get the food after I paid for it. It was fast, easy and the portion size wasn't lacking simply because it was take out, like most other restaurants do. Try it and save time without having to wait in line :)

With already over four thousand reviews, is it really necessary to add another? Yes, because I just want to put my two cents in and to cross it off my review list. So here are my top 5 "useful" tips/comments/whatever. 1. Yeah, the line is absurd. You see it from the parking lot, wrapping around but what you don't see is that it wraps around the building, into the hallway. But really, it's not that bad at ALL. There's some shady areas of the line, water available, menus everywhere, and TV screens that show you delicious foodporno shots of their BBQ. You will be entertained, and the line will pass by quickly. 2. No, this place is not a hype, clearly. Look at their reviews. You will come, you will try it, and you will leave happily with their delicious bbq sauce on your stained shirts and fingers. 3. Yes the pork really does slide off the bone, and the sides are all delicious, it's true!  A small side IS enough though, unless you plan to share with the rest of your group. Trust! Also, a small side of fries is already a lot. 4. Gotta be feisty for parking. 5. There is SO MUCH seating inside. You'd think the number of customers they have each day, they wouldn't have enough pigs to feed everyone.

I love eating here all the time. The food is fantastic. I always get the white chicken dinner with the bbq sauce on the side. They always get it right. The steamed veggies are pretty decent tasting. The onion rings are really good. I think the wait is definitely worth your time. Great place for families and friend gatherings.

Man, this place is popular. Almost 99% of the times I've been here, there have been long lines. To avoid long lines, don't eat there. Phone in an order. Then go to Phil's. Pass all the hungry people waiting to eat there. Pick up order. Take it somewhere else and eat. Repeat. =) If you're taking someone who's never been, it's nice to eat there for the experience. Everybody there is pretty friendly. Now onto the food...I want my baby back ribs. I love my meat as anyone reading my posts on meat would know. The meat is usually if not always fall off the bone tender. I like that. I'm not that big of a fan of their sauce, which is why I tend to get it on the side. They do have that option and they usually tell you so if you're new to their establishment. Kudos to them. I really like their sides and their portions are pretty large. I always have to pick and choose which ones I get each time. My favorite two are the potato salad and fries. FRIES. I swear I have an addition to them. Anyway, I digress. It's a great place to take people who've never been. Just a warning though, they are closed on Mondays. I made that mistake once. Was craving Phil's on a Monday, drove allll the way there, and was sooo disappointed when I saw no line and a closed sign.

Note:  only basing this on the El Toro.  Didn't want to/couldn't stand in line to sit and eat BBQ, but it all looked and smelled delicious.  Generally, I  don't think I'm a fan of BBQ sandwiches...why put bread in the way of delicious bbq..the whole point of BBQ is the meat, right?  So all in all, I wasn't that thrilled with the sandwich, but I could tell the flavor of the meat was there...just nothing spectacular about the sandwich experience itself (damn you, Adam Richman).  Anyway, I'd like to come back next time I'm in SD for some ribs or something.

I'VE HAD BETTER Huge line. Mega reviews. What could go wrong?   BBQ was ok but not great by any means. Had the Tri tip sandwich and should have asked for the BBQ sauce in the side. My sandwich was drowned in it so it completely overpowered any other flavor. The BBQ itself is very tangy and potent...which is ok...but if I had known that up front I would have handled my order differently. When all is said and done, the food was ok. But I've had much better BBQ in my time.

So being here last week for the AFC marathon, I thought I would give Phil's another shot since the first time, I got it to go. When my buddy and I arrived, of course there was a line. We were part of the group that got asked to be seated in the patio and ordered through the back.  That was nice, I think it saved us 30 minutes. What I didn't get was why they started almost towards the end of the line? We never saw the hostess ask the people way in the front of the line, not that I was complaining. I do give Phil's props in doing all they can to accommodate all. Giving people sample foods while in line, having a take out line separately, and having a big sink towards the back for customers. We ordered the dinner beef and pork ribs. I have to say, the beef ribs were great! Until......I saw a black HAIR that was encrusted in the back, on the skin side of the rib. I wasn't a deal killer, I just ate around it but it sure wasn't expected. The sides that accommodated were great. The beans had a heavy sugary taste to it, the potatoes were awesome, cole slaw was not heavy mayo like some places, and the fries were crispy. The bad thing about sitting at the patio was the service you get there was limited partially because the walkway tends to be blocked by big families. It's still not a bad place to go, but I don't think I would wait more than 30 minutes for this place.

The BROHAM sandwich keeps me coming back! Oh did I mention the HUGE delicious onion rings? Ya, even the side orders are enough to keep me wanting more. I prefer the San Marcos location because it isn't as long of a wait to be seated. I have tried so many other BBQ places in San Diego, and nowhere has the best of everything there. I have tried to make the same onion rings and have searched for any location that makes them just as good, but failure every time. Phill's has the BEST onion rings in the world and of course BEST BBQ on this planet.

Best BBQ I've had so far.  Really long line when I was there.  Ended up taking it to go and eating it at my hotel restaurant with a bottle of wine.  Going back to get more.  I got the beef and baby back ribs.  Both were amazing.  Ordered a pulled pork sandwich that is an award winner.  When I got to the hotel it wasn't in the bag!  Double check your order before you leave.

If you were to go to Texas I think you would find this is not necessarily authentic BBQ. It's California BBQ. Which is actually just as good!! I love this place and it's food and service are great. The only reason I give it 3 stars is the line is always so long. And this place is always packed. So I dunno, I only go here occasionally because it requires too much time, it's too loud and it's just too much work. If you have the time then it's definitely worth it. Otherwise just get take out and enjoy it under your own roof or at the beach or nearby park. Dealing with the line and the people will make your stomach wait too long for something so well deserved.

Moving back to Cali from the South, all my friends wanted to "expose" me to good BBQ. I was very excited after hearing all the great reviews. When we came, the line was wrapped around the building and extended into the parking lot. Luckily, they have a kiosk selling beer and wine in front of the door so we passed the time with a cold lager. Over an hour went by before it was our turn to order. Options are limited so we ordered one of everything. I found the chicken dry, the beef ribs under done, the pork ribs fatty, and the sides forgettable.  The sauce is too thin for my liking and definitely not flavorful enough. Unlike other places, they do not have a spicy option and everything tastes the same.  I have definitely had better...but it was deep in the South and not readily available here in California.

This place is fantastic. The portions are huge...no skimping here. The service was great. They even has a wash station by the soda fountains to hose all the sauce off your face! My wife and I went with our 3 kids. We tried the Broham (pulled pork sandwich), the El Toro (thin sliced tri-tip sandwich), the ribs and a salad (wife...). The sandwiches were out of this world. Tasty, HUGE, lots of BBQ sauce (a bit tangy, awesome!) and they were $6.95 each. A total steal. The onion rings were super crispy and fantastic. We all thought the Broham was the best, but it was all great. This place is a must-try when in the Pt. Loma area.

Oh, Phil's. Such love and hate. Love because it's some of the best BBQ in the region. Hate because I can't have it every day. Hate because if I get there at the wrong time, the line is already around the building. Get anything. Anything at all with meat in it. Bite. Chew. Enjoy the high. Appreciate life. Remember you're eating, bite again. Between the chicken and any beef item, stick with the beef. Nothing is wrong with the chicken, but the beef is what you're there for. Oh, get there before they open. There might be a line but it is deceptive. The place is empty and you'll get through in no time.

IMO, this is the absolute best place to eat ribs. No matter what I get here, it's always delicious. Drawback is that everyone else thinks so too, so there's always a line here. The lines can range from 30 minutes to 2 hours. Everyone in line are all in the same mentality in which you are all about to gorge on some delicious fall-off-the-bone ribs. -=-Get it Quicker-=- The only way to, aside from being a canine begging for scraps at the back door.....order to go. There is an express line for those that choose not to dine-in, so call in your order and within 20 minutes, your food will be waiting for you. With that said, most people still seem to want to wait for dine in. It's not like there's extra sauce on the table to dump on your ribs. Maybe people don't want to risk spilling BBQ sauce on their carpets...I dunno. -=-Large Groups-=- For a super busy place, Phil's handles large groups in an excellent manner. Let the line herder in front know that you have a large group ahead of time. As space clears up the employees will reserve it for you and will ask that a representative of the group squats the table. Even for groups of 15+, this has never failed. We've always found a space to eat by the time we get all our orders in. Phil's has the group parties down to a science. -=-Beef or Baby Back-=- Oh the long hard debate. So how to pick? They both fall seamlessly off the bone and both have that same great balanced BBQ sauce smothered all over. Beef ribs often look daunting being all humongous. They are a bit tougher to chew, but not by much. Baby Back is still softer. There is more cutting involved with Baby Back since there are more bones. Also, more bones means more effort to eat. So who wins....definitely NOT your waistline.

The line was not bad at all, but even if we had waited one more hour, it was absolutely worth the wait. My husband and I tried all the different sides and loved all of them. I had the beefy ribs they were excellent! My husband ordered the tri-tip sandwich and he said he loved it, but stole some of my beefy ribs. My favorite sides were the onion rings and macaroni.

With 4452 reviews and still 4.5 stars, you know it's good. Don't need my 4453rd review to tell you how good it is. Get the niblet platter and combine it with some a la carte items. Much cheaper and the portions are so big that you won't know anyway!

I just don't get why people say this is the best BBQ in SD. I went in with no expectations like every person should do when reviewing a place. I also wasn't going to compare it to other BBQ places. I ordered the chicken, pulled pork sandwich and ribs and shared with the girlfriend. Pricing is about what is to be expected for BBQ, it's not cheap no matter where you go. The meat was actually pretty tender. That's a big plus 1 for them. However the taste was just horrible. I don't know what is wrong with their seasoning, but it not edible. We both couldn't finish our meal. I tried with the sauce and without and both were horrible. What a complete let down because the butchering of the meat was done very well. Also the cooking process seems to have been done correctly as well. Good cuts of tender meat that taste horrible. I wanted to scream and cry at the same time. Their selection was a bit small, that can help or hurt you. Look at In-N-Out, their small menu lets them focus on the few products they do provide and they do a great job at it. It didn't help Phils. Very few sides and no brisket. Seriously, no brisket? How does that happen? They're a bit better than Smokin Joes but that doesn't say much. Many of other places are much better. I know I said I wasn't going to compare and I'm not, the evaluation was done simply on my meal. But if you want some good BBQ go to Abby's in Clairemont (make sure it's not the one in Miramar, that one is worse than Phil's! The two are not related.) If you like Phil's good for you. Continue to eat it. Everyone has their own preference and I wish their business nothing for the best. It just wasn't a right fit for me.

Overhyped. I'm no BBQ expert, but I've had much better BBQ where they actually char and caramelize the sauce on the meat. Here, its like they dunk the meat into the sauce and serve it to you. Not bad and generous portions, but not worth the wait.

This is probably the only rib place that I will always be willing to go.  I'm not a huge fan of ribs but I can set aside our differences and be in love for an hour. I've been here before and I always get the half baby back ribs (6-7 bones) with onion rings and macaroni salad.  Husband always gets the full rack with Baked potato and corn-on-the-cob.  We usually end up sharing our sides.   One word:  YUM!

There are TONS of references to Yelp at Phil's BBQ, and even a designated "Tweet Spot" as captured on my phone in the attached pic.  Maybe I didn't look around enough, but I didn't see any Instagram banners telling me that's where I should take pics, or Tout zones where I could record videos and Tout them out.  I was tempted to take a picture of a guy taking a bunch of pictures (instead of eating), but what if someone else decided to take a pic of me doing that? Yes, there is some absurdity to this all, but it's really part of the one of a kind experience that Phil's BBQ has pulled off.  Seriously, more people probably go here than the Valley View Casino Center (formerly the Sports Arena) just down the street, even though it doesn't hold nearly the same capacity. I got in line at about 10:45a and there were only a handful of people in front of me.  While I stood outside, I was bombarded with messages  directed at Yelpers.  I admit it, I kind of liked it, even though it'd be overkill elsewhere. There was even a welcoming suggestion to talk to them about any issues you had, before posting your review.  Wonder if you get to talk to an assigned person, or if you can have an actual roundtable discussion with everyone you encountered there?  Lucky for me, I didn't have any "issues." Once I got inside I checked-in on Yelp.  I hope I did it at the correctly designated Yelp check-in checkpoint.  If not, I apologize because I was anxious to order! After I ordered at the counter I took the pager they gave me and sat in the bar area (where you can order from a server instead if you'd like).  When my pager went off, I thought:  why couldn't they send me a Yelp compliment to alert me instead?  Or, take a pic of my food and tag me in it on Instagram?  They could also put hashtags next to the items I ordered on my receipt. These ideas and suggestions are all free, if they use them I'll ask for nothing in return (other than a RT or perhaps a #FF). There are over 4,000 other reviews that talk about the food, so I'll refrain from joining in (am surprised that @JRsBBQ hasn't posted one yet though).   I'll just say that I got the baby back ribs & chicken dinner for $12.95, and there were plenty of options even cheaper!  I have plenty of more to say, but I texted that to the person sitting next to me.

When I get my nails and hands all dirty for some meat, particularly baby back ribs, it has to be Phil's BBQ. Nowhere else would I use both my hands to eat some meat. This place isn't a romantic dinner with a beautiful view. Instead, it's a lick-the-bone clean type of joint. Phil's BBQ really knows how to cook and marinade their meat! On weekends, the wait is about an hour. It's outdoor waiting, too. parking is compact but you'll find one eventually. There is lots of tables inside so bring your family and friends. The staff is great! They'll find you seats to accommodate for your whole group and pass out Popsicle when you're in line on hot days. They have conversations with you, make recommendations, the whole package. They got a bar on the outside and the inside. You order first then get seated and wait for your food. The Pork Baby Back Ribs is what everyone comes here for. Deliciously cooked to tenderness and watch it glide smoothly off the bone. The Beefy Ribs is another popular item. It's a bigger image of the baby back ribs but beef instead of pork. The sandwiches are huge! Expect to order and share, because you're a real fatty if you can finish a whole order by yourself. Free refills on soda which is good for me because all the food makes me thirsty. I love their corn on the cob, but at the same time, I love any corn. The potato salad is a good side to order. if you like onion rings, order the Colossal Onion Rings. It's a big pricey but you get good quality food and really good service. I cannot give them the perfect score because despite the great BBQ food they serve, the menu in actuality is pretty limited. One of my biggest pet peeves about this place is that every time I come here, I have a discussion with the hostess at the front about how Phil's should have Mac and Cheese. The hostess always tells me they feel the same way. It only makes sense for me to have my mac and cheese with my BBQ!

I've been here 2x. I must say I know why people loves this place. The baby back ribs!! The smell and the taste of it .... so mouth-watering. My favorite sides are the veggie and potato salad. Macaroni salad and slaw were pretty good too. I would have given 5 stars but minus one because of the waiting. The first time we came here, we had to wait for hours. We were prepared but we didn't expect it to be that long. So, I ended up starving for a few hours. Some people said the wait was worth it, I agree. But the pain I felt, wasn't :( The second trip was much better tho; short line, good food, no starving. Definitely come back. Stop by if you are in the neighborhood !

Good. Not great.  I actually thought Brazen BBQ in Hillcrest was better.  This place definitely does not live up to the hype. As I said in the Brazen review - as a girl who did her undergrad in South Carolina (aka the place where BBQ reigns supreme right after God himself) - I'm going to go ahead and say I know good BBQ. That or I've just had the "best of the best" and everything else falls short. I had to try the El Toro sandwich after seeing it on Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America - and I have to say....disappointment.  For the being on that show I was expecting more.  The meat was rather dry.  It did have a great smoky flavor that I loved but my boyfriend hated - which was ironic considering the fact he is the one that talks this place up and thought my past experience was just bad because I had Phil's catered - he was wrong.  I think I also told him that USC's campus cafeteria food BBQ (shout out to the USC Russel House Campus Dining!  GO COCKS! woot-woot!) is better than this. The portions are massive - and the prices are low.  So you do get a great deal.  I'm a poor grad student -- if there's enough for leftovers you have my vote.  So for that: 3 stars. Edited to Add: I'd also like to give major props to their marketing team.  You couldn't look anywhere in this place without seeing a "Review us on Yelp!" or "Tweet About it Here!" sign.  THAT'S why this place has such great reviews - not because the food is all that special.  Sorry.  A+ to the Marketing Team.

Everytime I come here, I drool....and you know what...you will too. The ribs here melt off the bones. It's not like Lucille's; over-priced and mediocre. Sweet, succulent, tangy, and tasty! Portions are HUUUUUGE. I was stuffed like a fat cat. I had the pulled pork burger for dessert. My tip for this place: Practice Patience. No matter what time you come, you'll be waiting in line. I came here on a busy Saturday evening and also on a Thursday early evening and the line was horrendous. Their site has a camera, so you can scout the line before you come. If you bring a date here, and he/she digs it (not expecting $150 omakase and fancy doo-da shit), you've got yourself a good mate!

Holy line! So it definitely is great barbecue, and a fantastic meal, but can't necessarily say that it's worth a 60-90 minute wait.  If you want the experience and have a group of people, excellent.  Offer to sit at the bar and you'll get seated much faster. But if you're in from out of town and on a limited timetable, it's probably not worth the time.

Good food but definitely overrated. There are at least 2 or 3 other BBQ places in SD that are just as good or better than this spot, but without the insane line. I don't bother trying to eat here, it's not worth the wait, I just order for pick-up.

Don't go to San Diego for Sea World. Don't go for the weather. Don't even go there the beaches. Go to San Diego for Phil's. The "el toro" sandwich is the best sandwich in creation. I was in San Diego for a week and my biggest regret is that I only ate four of these sandwiches. And while it took me approximately 2 hours, on separate visits to procure them, and only about a total of ten minutes to eat them collectively, it was the best time spent in my life ever. Ever. The only problem with the establishment is that there were not enough people patronizing it. I only counted seventy three people there... Waiting in line.

Phil's BBQ, a carnivore's dream come true .. oh wait, that's me! Full baby back rib dinner (10 to 12 ribs for $19.95) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… - THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD, period. So delicious, I can't even describe it but tell you it's the best. Beef rib dinner (3 ribs & 2 small sides for $13.95) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… - Yummy, but I'd prefer the baby back ribs. BBQ broham ($6.95) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… - Packed with meat, delicious. The downside is the wait is 1 hour + long on weekends & it's far from home for me :(

3.5 This place is WAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too hyped up. Sadly, it didn't meet my expectations because I wanted the best damn barbecue baby-back ribs. When I got my ribs, it was mostly fat and not that much meat... and maybe it was a rare occasion that my order was like this but hey, I'm just reporting on my personal experience there. The BBQ sauce was really sweet and it goes well with everything. I tried the BBQ chicken and onion rings as well and it's nothing spectacular. I felt like I've had better chicken and definitely had better onion rings elsewhere. The wait was like 40 minutes (which isn't a big issue... I've waited 2 hours for a donut once) and in the end, it wasn't really worth it for me. I probably wouldn't drive out to San Diego to try this again.

My friends and I ended up at Phil's BBQ after a long day at Sea World. We were starving and ordered a BBQ Turkey Burger, several Baby Back Rib & Chicken Dinners, the Colossal Onion Rings, Baked Potato, Corn-on-the-Cob, Steamed Veggies, Fresh Cut Fries, Sweet Baked Beans, Fresh Cole Slaw, Potato Salad, and a Macaroni Salad. The BBQ and sides were fantastic. I loved the Turkey Burger, Onion RIngs, and Fresh Cut Fries. The next time I am in San Diego I will make it a point to visit.

Ok, let me just say, this place is a bit overrated. The baby back ribs: a bit dry and kind of lacking in flavor. Sure, it's flavorful when you drench BBQ sauce all over it, but I ordered mine on the side so I could taste the meat on its own, and I wasn't impressed. The baked beans were terrible. Too sweet and actually had a really awkward smell/taste to it. The beans were too soft and sandy. The potato salad and slaw were better, but still pretty ordinary. The only good part is that the potatoes were in big chunks, reassuring me that they were homemade. Otherwise, nothing special. The chicken was terrible as well. Incredibly dry and tasteless. We didn't even eat 1/3 of this. The only thing I'd say lived up to the hype was the beef ribs. The meat was incredibly tender, sweet and peppery, and lip-smacking good because the grilling had caramelized the fat and collagen in the meat. Yum. Food minus the beef ribs get 2 stars at most. Beef ribs get 5. I averaged it out, and inflated it a bit because of the friendly service. The wait was long but not too bad.

Better than Lucille's. Better than ANY BBQ joint I have ever sank my teeth into. There's a reason why people will wait 2 hours outside, in line to eat Phil's BBQ. We came on a Sunday at 11:30 (they open at 11am) and there was a line...luckily we only had to wait 40mins. We actually came here the night before at peak dinner hour and we were way too hungry to wait 2 hours. Next time, order to go, surpass the line, and enjoy the ribs at home, at a park, or on the beach.

Who hasn't heard of Phil's. I mean everyone talks about Phil's and San Diego in the same sentence. I hear things over the years but I've never been tempted to try it. I mean how good can BBQ get right? I had some buddies kidnap me and take me here for lunch on a Saturday. I hear crazy stories about the lines being out the door and wrapping around the parking lot. It wasn't so bad when I was there. It was out the door but it took only 20 minutes. It moved pretty fast. They had the menu posted all over so you can plan out your route of attack and conquer. Once we got in, we ordered and received a vibrating pager. The food took like 5 minutes before the pager rang and we carried platters of meat back to our seats. My first thought was everything was so cheap for good quality BBQ. My second thought was how am I going to finish all this. I ordered the Beefy Rib and Chicken Dinner for about $13. There was plenty of meat and sides to feed a family of 3. The BBQ sauce was addicting. The ribs fell off the bones and melted in your mouth. The corn was sweet. I liked the condiments they had at the table. On top of everything, we ordered a large Colossal Onion Rings which we could be a meal in itself. I didn't eat again for about 12 hours! Next time let's pace ourselves shall we? There are 2 wash stations on opposite sides of the restaurant to get all the grease out of your fingernails. Next time you come here, make sure you wait because it was worth it. Don't flake out and eat at Red Lobster next door, that would be pathetic and you will regret it.

Fantastic BBQ food for a very good price! I've been here twice now in my life and I will testify that this is one of the best BBQ restaurants I have ever been too. I ordered the Baby Back Rib & Chicken Dinner with a side of Macaroni and fries and it was what I imagined AWESOME BBQ would taste like! The baby back ribs meat was very soft and came off the bone easily. The chicken leg was tender, meat was soft and the leg was huge! The Macaroni was well made, cheesy, but not overly so that you get the moist taste of the actual macaroni. The fries seemed like they were freshly cut and they were just the way I liked them, oily. In addition, I loved phil's bbq sauce on the ribs. It has a spicy tangy taste, but it definitely compliments the ribs very well. I've come here on a weekend night and a weekday night before and it definitely is a contrast. On the weekend night, it was extremely crowded with a line rounding the restaurant with no seats. However, the take out line was non-existent so definitely do take-out if the wait is extremely long. On the weekday night (Thursday), it was about only 3/5 full and plenty of seating. Either way, I LOVE THIS PLACE and definitely will come back when I visit San Diego because I love large servings of food for a good pirce!

The best ever?  Of all time?  Across the US?  World?  Universe?  Who knows.  But we do enjoy Phils.  There's a lot to choose from and all of it tasty.  Personally, I'm not a huge red meat kinda guy anymore, so I usually eat the chicken or the chicken tickler, which are chicken chunks.  I do love that sauce too...and the beans...and the extras...  A couple of things to remember when going to Phils: -  Calling in your order is a good thing.  You can go, pick it up, wait 10 min and you are out of there. -  If you must dine in, be prepared for a long line.   -  If you must dine in, you will have to change your clothes after because you'll stank like bbq!  If you are a lonely person and like stray dogs and cats following you around, this is a bonus. Other than that, give it a whirl!  We've been eating here since they were at their tiny joint in Mission Hills, which I kinda miss, but when you are popular, you are popular and you gotta go bigger, better, faster, more!

Took advice from fellow yelper and bypassed the long line to sit at the bar, great advice. Got the ribs, boneless chicken, fries and macaroni salad. Next time I'd skip ordering the chicken and fries and get more ribs. They were amazing! Chicken was on the dry side and the fries weren't too good. The staff was super friendly and the prices were VERY reasonable. Now I understand the reasoning behind the 4.5 rating :)

For the longest time, I was dying to try Phil's BBQ! I had heard about it from friends, family, and even on television. I was completely convinced that this place would go above and beyond in satisfying my mouth-watering cravings for BBQ. This past year, I was at UCSD for my first year of college, and I didn't go to Phil's BBQ until the near end of the year. What a disappointment.. but as they say, better late than never! haha. As I approached the parking lot of the restaurant, I already saw the long line along one side of the restaurant, and I was extremely hungry that day so I really wanted to eat already.. However, my family had been waiting there for about 45 minutes already so they were already inside at a table. So as soon as I got there, I was able to walk right in, get seated, and wait for the food that my family had already ordered for me. I had told them prior to arriving to order me a half rib dinner with two small sides, but that was not what I received. I was provided with a full rib dinner with a side of potato salad and a side of fresh cut fries. This looked completely overwhelming to begin with, but I went to eating right away as I was very hungry! My first bite of the baby back ribs was out of this world! It was extremely saucy, just the way I like my baby back ribs, and the meat fell off the bones very easily. Very easy to eat, but of course it was very messy. Eating these ribs with the side of potato salad and fresh cut fries was a perfect combination! The fries were hot and fresh while the potato salad had a great taste. NOW, THIS IS BBQ! I think I could have finished the entire full rib dinner, but I decided to save some for my brother so he can have a go at Phil's BBQ. I finished both my sides along with 10 of the 12 bones I got, and my craving was overly satisfied! I couldn't believe that I had finished almost an entire rack of baby back ribs, but that's what happens when you're really hungry and when the food is so so good! I don't think there's any way someone can leave hungry if they order a full rib dinner.. I mean I didn't eat anything all day prior to coming to Phil's BBQ. The experience of eating at Phil's BBQ was wonderful! Can't go wrong with the BBQ here. This place has surpassed any other BBQ place I've ever been to in my life! IT'S JUST THAT GOOD! Please please please come here to eat if you are ever in San Diego. This is one thing San Diego is truly known for so don't miss out on the BBQ. Trust me. You won't regret it one bit!

I wanted to like this place. I honestly did. Although I have no real complaints about this place-- the wait wasn't horrendous, the service was good, but the bbq... that got over 4000 reviews was just.... dare I say it? Just OK. The meat was not tough, but the sauce was obviously what they depend on to make the dish and my sandwich and ribs were swimming in it. For me it was too much on the tangy side. In my opinion if you need to drench something in a sauce or condiment, it can't be that spectacular... its almost as though you are trying to mask the true flavors of the meat or dish. I did not dislike this place, but I don't think its worth the long waits I've read about or the very big hype its made. This would not be a place I would crave and definitely not a place I would wait in a long line for.

This place serves Kansas style bbq -- so the sauce is sweet. Like everyone mentioned, expect a wait ... even on an off peak hour. We waited 1/2 hr. You order at the counter, pick up at the side when you're buzzed. Seating is free for all minus the seats with "for groups" sign. Despite the wait, the order was fast and efficient. We got their combo ... half baby back ribs with chicken. It comes with two small sides so we opted for the sweet beans and macaroni salad. Since everyone touts their onion rings, we got a small order of that too. SMALL is an understatement ... we could NOT finish the onion rings. It was definitely good though. I liked how tender the meats were but wasn't a fan of the drenched sweetness of the sauce -- next time I'll have to order with it on the side. The sides weren't too memorable. Overall, a good experience. Tender, moist meat with deliciously deep fried onion rings are always a winner in my book. But, hold the sauce please. ;) ... btw... free re-fills!! We got to - go cups and filled it up before leaving. :)

@PhilsBBQSD finally! After sitting in 3+ hours of traffic, all my friends and I wanted to do was get to Phil's BBQ as fast as we can. Traffic from LA to SD was horrendous since it was Comic-con weekend and I was expecting that the craziness would extend to the very popular Phil's BBQ. I was a bit worried about the parking and how long the wait would be. Luck seemed to be at our side when we scored parking right up at the front. The wait to get in wasn't even long! 15 minutes, yay! Waiting in line to Phil's BBQ reminds me of Disneyland. It's like that Big Thunder Mountain ride with all the wooden panels and signs. I guess I wasn't the only one who felt that way since I overheard the folks in front of us say something similar :). I was tempted to get one of the rib or chicken plates but my friends and I had a whole day of SD foodie adventures planned out and I wasn't sure if it would be wise to eat so much so early. This was only stop one of of our foodie adventure Saturday! I ended up getting the El Toro sandwich ($6.95) and a small side of fresh cole slaw ($1.50). So much for a small first meal because this sandwich was huge. The sandwich was overflowing with char-grilled tri-tip and oozing with BBQ sauce. It was one messy and tasty sandwich and I got through about half of it before deciding to box the other half. The cole slaw was just OK for me. It was fresh, light and crispy. Thought the cole slaw was OK, I will be choosing to get another side next time I am here. I also ended up taking half of this home. Lastly, I was debating about getting a dessert to take home but I had heard great things about the red velvet whoopie pie. The red velvet fanatic inside of me convinced me to not walk away without getting one and I am so glad. It was such a yummy huge treat. It was big, sweet and wonderful :). The red velvet itself was nice and moist and the filling inside was delightful. Heaven in a little red pie :). People reading this review, get this! You won't regret it :) I am review #4101 of Phil's BBQ. All my Yelp friends love this place and this place was listed before as one of the top ten places to try in California. After my trip here, I can see why :).

I wanted to give this place a 4 simply for the value.  For about $19, you can get yourself a full size baby back ribs rack.  Near the same price you can get even more quantity with the beef ribs.  That is cheaper than many other places you will find such as Lucille's.  Still, at the end of the day, I could not give 4 stars because the taste was so-so.  Forgive me guys but I think Lucille's might even taste better.   I am a sauce man.  I drench everything in sauce.  Here though, I wanted to be as objective as I can be and determine taste from both sauce and flavor from the meat itself.  The texture is spot on; very easy to eat, though not exactly fall off the bone-type.  It is a no-effort bite and tear with your mouth affair (This applies to both beef and baby back ribs).  Fun!  As for the sauce, it is not overwhelming in that it does not try to mask every flavor.  You would still be able to taste everything, which is always good.  Still, I found myself wanting more flavor, especially from the meat.  The beef ribs were my favorite, but maybe it is all the hype of this place that got me expecting out of this world flavor.  Though it is above average for sure, it was not extremely satisfying with every bite. The sandwiches (We got tri tip and pulled pork) was even more underwhelming.  It was good because it had an extraordinary amount of meat, but it was so much that as my friend Michael L. stated, it did not seem like it should be a sandwich.   Needless to say, I was in a food coma at the end of the meal.  I was satisfied, but when coupled with the long wait, I cannot say that the next time I visit San Diego, the first place I would visit is Phil's.  I would rather try out a different Yelp-approved place.  I guess the hype and all the great things I have heard about this restaurant made me expect too much, and all of those expectations sadly, were not met.

Let me start by saying that I like the food here. It's great, I leave every time satisfied and STUFFED. I've been here many times with no complaints....until my visit this afternoon. Everything was going great. The line was long (as expected) but a hostess found my small party (3) in line and offered us a seat at the bar. Once we were seated, our orders for food were taken by the bar tender and our food came out rather promptly. So far, so good. The problem that pushed me to write this review came when we were ready to pay our check and leave. After 5 minutes or so without getting my card back, we flagged the bar tender down and asked what was taking so long. He just put his hands up and pointed at the register (a MICROS, standard for restaurants/ bars) and said its broken. Before we could say anything, he just left and moved on to the other side of the bar to serve a different customer. We didn't think too much of it until another 20 minutes passed by without so much as a glance from him or the manager who was now involved and on the phone, I assume, talking to someone about fixing the machine.     We flagged a server who happened to walk by and asked if there was anything that could be done to speed up the process of us simply paying our tab. She said "No" and pretty much shrugged the request off. By this time, we weren't the only ones who had been WAITING LONGER TO PAY THAN WE DID EATING and other patrons were getting upset and raising questions. The bartender was getting visibly more and more annoyed with the problem as well as the customers. From this point on, there was no acknowledgment that there was anything wrong with this situation from a single staff member. Finally after we had voiced concern of being late for my shift at work, the bartender finally solved the puzzle of us paying by taking an imprint of my card and sending us on our way.     Long story short, this place has some serious customer service issues. Technology has a way of failing at the most opportune times. I get that. It's happened to me plenty of times. There is nothing anyone could have done to fix that quickly. That's not my beef here. The problem I have is the lack of professionalism in this situation showed by the staff/ managers. We got our bill 40 minutes after we were ready to leave and it wasn't even mentioned. No apology. No compensation. Not even a second glance. The receipt was just tossed at me over the bar and I was told to sign while the (generous) tip was snatched up before I could say anything.     I will not be returning to Phil's BBQ for a while because of how poorly we were treated. From reading some of the other less-than-stellar reviews, it doesn't sound like we have been the only ones. This place needs a serious customer service tune-up.

Below is a copy of an email I sent to Phil's BBQrew recently.  Not only do I love everything about Phil's BBQ and regularly go there for my ribs fix, I think the below story embodies what Phil and his crew stand for and strive to provide their customers on a daily basis. "I pulled into a parking spot just in front of the employee lounge.  Since I am in a lower leg cast, I had to hop from the front door of my car to the back door to take out my crutches.  As I started making my way to the sidewalk, a man in a Phil's polo shirt asked if I was, "...picking up an order?"  I told him I was hoping to find a seat at the bar to dine in.  Without flinching or hesitating, the man told me, "Come with me, I'm the head chef/cook."  (I don't recall exactly if he said chef or cook.)  Then man proceeded to lead me into the bar area all the while smiling and making conversation.  Then he asked me to wait just inside the door (so I wouldn't have to crutch around the other guests) so that he could "take care of me."  Sure enough, he found a manager and asked that he find a seat for me right away.  Zach, the manager, took all of 10 to 15 seconds to identify two ladies getting ready to leave the handicap seating by the bar.  Zach personally walked me over and made sure I was taken care of by the bartender, Gabriel.  Just before following Zach to the handicap seating, I asked for the man\'s name and he said, "My name is Archie Lee."  I shook his hand, thanked him for his kind attention, told him that I am a regular diner with Phil\'s and he and his kitchen crew do "fabulous work."  He thanked me for the comment and made his way back to the employee lounge for remainder of his break.  Yes, I do believe he took some of his break time to look out for me.  Completely amazing for me since I was about 28 hours into my first ever cast experience.  I was totally blown away by how Archie Lee totally and without hesitating went out of his way to look after me.  I will always remember this and I'll even ask for him the next time I'm in for my rib fix so I can say hi and thank him again. I also want to add that Gabriel the bartender and even Magic Mat (that is what his name tag read and it totally cracked me up) were very attentive to me and my crutches situation throughout my visit, even though it was a Saturday night and the place was jam packed with guests.  So please pass my sincere thanks to Archie Lee, Zach, Gabriel and Magic Mat for the "above and beyond" hospitality.  I believe the each deserve recognition from Phil himself for this.  Mind you, I have been a Phil's loyalist since my first ever visit to the Point Loma store many years ago, but I want you to know I will always remember my last visit and tell all my friends about it.   Please do not hesitate to phone or email me if you have any questions for me about this comment.  I\'d be happy to discuss my awesome experience with any Phil\'s management staff. I will most definitely be seeing your crew soon." All the above being said, Phil's on Sports Arena Blvd is always a rockin' good time for it's ambiance, attentive service and KILLER food.   My thanks again to Phil's BBQrew.

Lucky me, first time trying it and NO LINE. After trying it I'm glad that I didn't have to wait in line for this place.  The bbq is good but definitely not so good that I'd wait more than thirty minutes for it. The good: 1. Yes, the ribs are indeed "fall of the bones" tender.  I can't stand places that claim that they are fall off the bone when they really are not. 2. Generous with the sauce.  I love sauce, and when it comes to bbq... I need a whole bottle's worth. 3. AMAZING onion rings.  Fried so perfectly!  Great batter and good bite to it! The not so good: 1. The sauce.  I think a good sauce is just as crucial as the meat for bbq.  I'm not a big fan of this sauce.  It's too tangy/sour/tart whatever you want to call it.  Too many parts vinegar for my liking.   2. The party of 6 or larger to sit at the bigger tables rule.  I think that needs to change to a party of 5 or bigger.  There is no comfortable way that a group of 5 adults can sit anywhere else at Phils other than at the large tables.  My party sat the bigger table anyway even though we were 5, but I don't want to feel like I'm committing some cardinal sin while doing it.   Phils is a decent bbq joint.  Tasty bbq that I'd come back for, but wouldn't wait in line for.

I was lucky enough to be able to visit San Diego on the week of my birthday, so I was able to use the Front of the Line Birthday Pass. This means no waiting in any sort of line, just wait for the food after ordering, and sit down and FEAST! I ordered the half rack beef rib dinner and a quarter rack baby back ribs dinner for two people. Each dinner set comes with two small sides or a large side. I was surprised to see the beef ribs because they were humongous!!! Unfortunately the beef ribs were not fall of the bone tender. It took some chewing and gnawing to get the meat off the rib. It was a little too fatty for my taste, but great bbq and beef flavors though! The baby back ribs were a grand slam in my book. The meat was so delicate and one little touch with the fork made the meat fall off the bone. The bbq, smoky flavors were a lot better on these ribs. Sides were not super impressive, but that's not what you come here for. You wait hours in line for the bbq and not potato salad, so I'm not complaining. I enjoyed the baked beans and the macaroni salad though. I wish I had gotten more of the baby back ribs instead of so many beef ribs. Delicious! Especially more delicious since I didn't have to wait!

There's not much more I can add to all the reviews of this place so I'll just leave you with a couple tips: 1) Order take out fosho if you can! The wait will be 2 hours otherwise. 2) Get the ribs. They are fall-off-the-bone tender with that delicious bbq sauce.

Very good BBQ.  First taste is salty, but it gets finger lickin' good right after.  The sauce mellows out and has great flavors.   3 hour wait - not worth it To go - extremely worth it Macaroni salad - yes Potato salad - no They give extra sauce on the side for free too!

Why is the line always so long? I was lucky enough to come with a big group of people who started lining up before some of us arrived, so the wait was no more than 20 minutes. My friend and I shared the quarter baby back ribs dinner and also the pulled pork sandwich. a properly made pulled pork sandwich is realllllly good, and the one at Phil's is realllllly good! The pork was super soft and melted in my mouth. With the slaw, it is heavenly. The ribs were also delicious, the meat is so soft, it just falls off the bone. The only thing for me is that it was really saucy, maybe a little less sauce would be better ( I scraped some off) We had a side of fries and macaroni salad, which was really delicious too. Next time I'm around the area, I am definitely coming here again!

Looking at their overall ratings, it doesn't look like they need my help, but I'm here to confirm it. This place has some good 5 star BBQ. As someone from a BBQ bragging part of the country, it took me a good 2-3 years of eating at different BBQ places in CA before I gave up. The first place I went to after moving to CA, their BBQ was like warmed over ham covered in sauce they'd gotten from Sam's Club. Awful. Even a place I went to Oakland was really bad. I don't mean to paint it as a disaster or whatever. I mean, there's so much good and cheap Mexican food in this fair state, how could I complain? But then after biking by - and smelling - the Mission Hills Phils too many times to count, I had to give it a shot. And let me tell you, Phil knows what he's doing - and not only by California (BBQ) standards, either. Good stuff, 5 stars.

Almost never an off meal at Phil's. Baby Backs are the best. Fries are pretty much my favorite of any restaurant. The only thing I don't like about Phil's are the buns they use for burgers and sandwiches. They are plain, dry and just not up to Phil's usually high standards.  We usually go to San Marcos as it's closest to us. I don't think the newest one in Santee is quite as good as either of the others, something is just not quite perfect there with the food. I haven't been to the Sports Arena location in a while but last time there it was great too. People I know from classic BBQ parts of the county sometimes turn their nose up at Phil's because it's saucy vs smoked but it's the sauce I love!

All I really need to say is this...I grew up in Memphis, Tennessee. We know our BBQ. We run BBQ Fest. We're home to some of the best BBQ in the freaking WORLD. So when I came to Phil's, I was like...OK, lets see what you have to offer. And Phil's DELIVERED. Pulled Pork sandwich - OUTSTANDING. Crispy and juicy and flavorful all at the same time. Just the right amount of slaw needed along with it to cool down the spice and sweetness from the pork. Also ordered some baby back ribs, beans, and potato salad. The meat on the ribs was so succulent and tasty and came right off the bone. SO delicious. And trust me - the wait of the line is worth it. When my boyfriend and I arrived, I was freaked out that I'd be waiting for like an hour. What Phil's does to help this situation is have super nice waiters come around with snacks and treats to keep everyone feeling good. They also have a bar set up outside where you can go and grab a beer or some wine to chillax during the wait. OH also def recommend checking out the ice cream/gelato dessert store right next to Phil's. I went there to grab some water during the wait and you can get a small cup of ice cream or something if you're absolutely starving and need some sugar to help ya out. ;)

I've had food here numerous times but on Friday night, it was the first I actually stood in line to dine in.  My friend and I came around 8:30 pm expecting to wait at least 2 hours but luckily we only waited about 45 minutes.   There's a cart outside that serves drinks in case you want alcohol or soda.  My friend offered to buy me a beer while we waited but I was so hungry that I couldn't think about drinking beer.   My friend and I decided to order a full rack of baby back ribs with a side of coleslaw and fries, El Toro sandwich and a side of colossal onion rings.  I also grabbed a red velvet whoopie pie located at the counter for dessert.   Food was great.  I really enjoyed the ribs and fries.  The onion rings were a bit too greasy for me but it was still delicious.  I thought the El Toro was a bit smokey and too much drenched in bbq sauce to enjoy but nevertheless, it was still very flavorful.  I wish Phil's provided combos with chicken, ribs and tri tip.  I would totally order that.   Staff was great and welcoming.  We left tip even though we weren't really served.  I had a rather pleasant time dining in. By the way, skip out on the whoopie pie.  It wasn't worth the extra $ or calories.

I was in San Diego for a wedding and some friends mentioned this place.  I was thinking that there was too much hype over it and the food was either going to be meh or they were going to skimp out on the portions.  I was wrong about both.  This really was some of the best bbq I've had and the portion sizes were really large.  I really wish they would do something about the line though....

Delicously meaty baby back ribs where the meat comes right off the bone and melts in your mouth along with the tangy bbq'y sauce. Beware that this place is super popular and expect a line when it opens at 11am, or any time of day for that matter. Calling and ordering ahead makes the ribs disappear into your belly faster. The onion rings are awesome, they are huge, crispy, and sweet. Dip them into some extra bbq sauce and you will hoard them for yourself.

Boy was I disappointed with this place. I was surprised to see that the menu did NOT have brisket, pulled pork or hot links. I don't know about you, but a proper BBQ establishment should have those items as  standard, right? I ordered the "Rib-Less Dinner"... That's just pork shoulder chunks. It came really fast, (Despite how busy they were and I was pretty impressed with that)... And it was a HUGE portion, almost enough to share... Though the meat was definitely NOT slow cooked in a smoker, therefore it wasn't BBQ'd, okay? Was the pork of good quality? Yes it was, though all I'm saying is that it's not the real thing, that's all. But what really shocked me was that everything comes out of the kitchen smothered in a very sweet sauce, almost like a Chinese sweet & sour takeout style. So did I finish my plate? Yes I was hungry! Would I return? Probably not because this IS NOT real BBQ. However if you are just plain hungry, or got a family to feed, or want large portions at reasonable prices, or worse if you don't know how glorious 'real' BBQ is, then this place is for you, (As long as you're not a diabetic).

The portions are awesome and the sauces are really good. But unfortunately, most of the other foods are flavorless. The sides we got (macaroni salad, beans, and cole-slaw) were lacking in flavor. And the meat itself really lacks flavor. I understand that the ribs are mesquite grilled, but it needs some seasoning minimally.

Had to yelp Phil's to become the 4111 person to review this amazing place. This place really does stand up to all the hype around it, and is probably the best BBQ I have had from San diego... But this is not the best overall BBQ I have ever had, But probably the best Baby Back Ribs, but it is a close one between Phil's and Henry's Hi-Life in San Jose.   The line was out the door, around the corner at the front, around the corner in the side, and into the parking lot.  I waited in line for about 5 minutes and decided to order a beer at their beer stand out front.  Glad I did because the guy working the stand informed me their was a couple seats inside at the bar... Saving us at LEAST an hr of waiting in line.   Got the half Baby Back, half beef rib dinner. The beef ribs are waaay tinier than the pork, and much less juicy and tender.  They weren't at all bad but would not order them again.   The Pork BABY BACK is where its at!!! The ribs are glazed with Phil's bomb ass bbq sauce to the point where they STICK to your TEETH.  So tender, the meat just falls off the bone.  WOW i am salivating just writing this review.   Onion rings are bombay, but their coleslaw had too much cabbage and their fries are nothing special.  Got a Kona Brewing Co. Maui Coconut and some other beer from a Mission Brewery in DAYGO and made for the perfect lunch.

The short version: (out of 5) Flavor: 5 Originality: 5 Presentation: 5 Thanks to Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America.  By chance I happened to watch the show the night before leaving for San Diego.  After being crowned the best sandwich on the West Coast, I had to try it. I had worked up a massive appetite biking from Coronado.  The place is quite popular so expect a long wait.  If you're by yourself, skip the line and try getting a seat by the bar.  Better yet, if you're in a hurry, call in your order. I spent an hour in line in anticipation for this meal but I was able to get a small sample of an onion ring and was really impressed.  Very nice crunch with a flavorful thick onion inside.  The ranch dressing had a nice tang to it.  I needed more.  Could these be the best onion rings I ever tasted? I finally bellied up to the counter and placed my order.  The tri-tipped sandwich (El Toro), beef rib dinner which comes with two same sides or one large one.  Since the onion rings don't count as a side, I order the "small" portion of rings and the fries and cole slaw as my sides. They give you a pager as you wait for your meal.  About 10 minutes later, 3 trays worth of bbq goodness was there to greet me.  I needed an extra pair of hands to help me get all the food back to my table. I attacked the bull sandwich with both hands.  The tri-tip was a cut I was unfamiliar with.  You could tell that the firmness was braised long enough to leave succulent portion meat afterwards.  The "sauce is the boss."  Feel free to order some extra.  The variety of spices meld together complementing any meat or side dish. Based on the suggestions on yelp, the beef ribs were where it was at.  With the dinner portion, you get five bones.  These are massive.  Not enough to tip over a Fred Flintstone car but good enough to fill most people up after two.  Keep in mind that I only ordered the small portion of fries and cole slaw.  The slaw was pretty typical and about the portion of a cup that you'd see at KFC.  But man the fries.  I don't know if they were feeling generous that day, but the ribs were layed out beautifully on this bed of potatoe heaven.   Getting back to the beef ribs.  They had a nice char which balanced out the fat against the tenderness of the slow cooked beef.  Just admit to yourself now that there is no way your mouth will remain spotless when eating the ribs.  Good thing the have a roll of paper towels on each table.  Bibs are available if you need them. Lest we not forget about the onion rings.  These are huge.  Like size of your hand huge.  Not sure where they source them from but I would imagine they won first place in the county fair.  After devouring through them, I can confirm that these are the best rings I've ever tasted. The meals are best shared and I would challenge anyone to leave here hungry. Thanks Phil.  I'll you again in September.

Full of flavor and so meaty...nomnomnom. You will not be disappointed. Sides are pretty good as well. Favorite are the fries and macaroni salad. Damn, writing this is making me crave for Phil's.

We went here for the first time for a Military function. We didn't eat in the main restaurant and I am thankful for this as it seemed complete chaos. We were in a building across the street. We thought being mid week would not be so crowded, but we were wrong. Apparently this is a very popular place as you can see by all the reviews. My review for only 3 stars is because there was a huge mix up on the credit card charges for our tabs and I just feel it was handled very unprofessionally. Being in the Military a lot of people have the USAA cards which all look alike. Several of us got the wrong cards returned to us and the wrong amounts charged to our tab. We didn't notice until the next day when we went to use the card. I know we probably should have checked to see if it was our card but I feel as if their staff should have checked as well when returning the cards. We were in a private room and they were only catering to this event. The following day the person who had our card was using it all over town (unintentionally) at places where you don't need to enter the pin #. We had to track this person down to find our card and get reimbursement for the charges. The one person I did speak with on the phone acted as if this was not possible, even disagreed with me about our tab charges trying to tell me what we drank. My husband ordered 2 beers and bought 1 for someone else. It was very simple, they told me they'd look into it. I'm not exactly sure how long it takes to figure out you made a mistake but they didn't seem to interested in fixing the problem and never even called me back. I know everyone enjoyed the food, our daughter is 3 so I can't say whether the food is good for kids as she wouldn't eat it. I just feel their management and customer service needs a lot of work. I doubt we will go back.

Phil's BBQ reminds me of one of those food spots that they have in disneyland. boyfriend and i came here for a late lunch. probably around 2pm. anyways, we didn't expect it to be busy but when we got there there was a HUGE HUGE HUGE line. i almost didn't want to eat here anymore, but since i've been wanting to try it forever i waited. first off, don't get turned off by the line. it actually goes by quickly. why it reminds me of a disneyland food spot is because as you wait in line there are two menus to look at and decide what you want. as you wait, you can also take a picture. not sure how much it cost but they have a photo booth lol. moving on, as you enter you wait until one of the cashiers are available to take your order. after placing your order you take a buzzer and find a seat. drinks, utensils, plates, bibs, etc are all self serve. when your buzzer goes off you get your food. this place has a restaurant vibe, but it really isn't. no one takes your order, gets your drink, etc. i think their way of doing things help people come in and out quickly and efficiently. food: half order of baby back ribs: they use a dry rub and bbq sauce. i actually really like the dry rub. the bbq sauce is okay. the ribs were really tender and moist. the meat just falls off the bone. sides: cole slaw: def. not my favorite. baked beans: WOW they are amazing! def. will order this again. colossal onion rings: small order is def. enough for 2-3 people. i actually really really liked them. the batter is def. not something i've had before. it's really good. these onion rings were very crispy as well.

Finally was able to try Phil's BBQ after hearing so many good things about it and it was amazing! We headed over after a long day of snorkeling and kayaking. The wait really wasn't bad for a Thursday at around 5pm. It was maybe 10-15 minutes. I feel like the staff is very organized in terms of getting your order and getting your food to you, they are very efficient. My friends literally sat down at our table as I went to the restroom to wash my hands. When I came back our food was already there, awesomeness :) We got the bbq pork sandwich, el toro sandwich, and full rib plate to share with fries and coleslaw. The bbq pork and el toro sandwich were just ok to me but I really loved their pork ribs and coleslaw. I can see why Phil's is part Yelp's top 10 in the US! If making a trip to SD, you should come try this place, it was on tv and everything. Also, the food is oh so finger licking good!

Was it bombdotcom and all that? YUP! Was it worth the hype? YUP? Worth the 40 minutes wait at 9:30pm on a sunday evening? Definitely. Yes yes, some people really don't see what's so special about PHIL's bbq, but simply put .. their ribs are AMAZING! Tender, sweet, juicy...and a whole mound of sauce. I have to say, you have to LOVE lots of sauce on your ribs to like the ribs here. If you're more of a dry rub kinda person, this might not be your place. I've been waiting to try this staple for the longest time and I am glad i finally did. Honestly, the prices are decent, portions are huge, and the service is amazing. You even get a cute little piggy sticker to indicate to the waiters that you're a "first timer". Everyone is very eager to help you make the best selection possible. A friend and i share a full rack of ribs with 2 sides and another dinner plate with a quarter chicken. I went with a group of 4 and the 4 of us shared another order of onion rings. WAY TOO MUCH FOOD. The next time i would definitely just get a tickler plate. That seems like more than enough food for one individual. If you had to get anything, go for the RIBS! The chicken was juicy and moist, but nothing too spectacular. Make sure you go with friends that are as eager as you to have succulent juicy bbq pork. Otherwise the wait might seem like a long journey. Well worth the wait though, and will definitely return....after several months of detoxing.

Beef ribs are top notch here! So tender and juicy and drenched with their signature wet BBQ sauce. Baby-back ribs are really good here too! Half a rack is pretty huge!! 3 Beef Sampler is also very huge. They are really generous in terms of portions! Sssshhh don't tell them I said that. :P This is definitely Home of San Diego's most famous BBQ joint! Over 4000 reviews and counting! They do a real good job with marinating and cooking lots of meat! There's always a lineup to get your order/seats anytime during the day. Very surprised at how well they maintain the quality that comes out of their kitchen with such a large continuous mass of people ordering. The staff are very nice here. Very prompt in providing plates and utensils and providing wet naps! They even have their boss/managers ask around to make sure everyone is enjoying their meals! So thoughtful of them! I do agree that waiting for over an hour is a bit overkill. If I want food I want it now or soon! Be aware they close on Mondays! Many times I myself or friends crave to go on a Monday just to be so excited to see that there's no lineup but oh crap it's closed!! It's funny because their menu never really mentions about lunch options. Food portions is just so huge here that it's more dinner high calories meals! The prices are pretty fair I think for what you get. There are secrets to beating the lineup. One, just order it to go and you completely bypass the lineup. Or you could also just eat at the bar and order the food. Those are the best bets if you go during their peak hours. If not, you'll have to suffer waiting in line. Definitely a must try if you come to San Diego!

I came here on a Saturday night around 9:30 pm and there was still a wait, but I guess 45 min isn't too bad from other reviews I've seen. We ordered the baby back ribs, beef ribs, El Toro tri-tip sandwich, and onion rings.  The baby back ribs were probably the best I've ever had, very tender and packed with flavor.  The beef ribs were good but one of the pieces I had was tough and chewy.  The onion rings were also really good.  However, I was very disappointed in the tri-tip sandwich. It was sliced too thin and I could tell its been sitting for a while because it was dry, chewy, and cold.  If this sandwich was good I would've definitely given this place 4-5 stars :( I'm glad I got to finally try Phil's, I would definitely come back just for the baby back ribs!

This is one of those places in San Diego I actually would not hesitate on recommending to an out-of-towner. There are many hyped-up places in San Diego that I simply just find underwhelming, but this place is legit. I've also met Phil twice now and he is such an incredible man! Not just for his damn good bbq, but he's also just a cool guy that takes care of his customers well. This is one of those businesses I am happy to support for years to come. BEST OF BOTH WORLDS and the PULLED PORK SANDWICH. Those are pretty much the two things I get. I don't think there are enough adjectives to describe the complex fusion of delicious flavors that explode in your mouth upon tasting that sweet tangy spicy feisty taste of bbq sauce and tender, unadulterated meat. Sorry for the graphics everyone, but come on! You know this shit is delicious! haha

Simply put... the best ribs you'll ever have! I came here about a year ago and simply haddd to come back for more, even though I live 1.5 hours away. My boyfriend and I went for lunch on Labor Day, and surprisingly, the line wasn't too long. After waiting for about 15 minutes, we were greeted by the hostess, who gave us little stickers for visiting for the first time, and were able to order our food. We ordered a half-rack of ribs with fries and macaroni salad, and a quarter-rack of ribs with macaroni salad and cole slaw. We were able to find a table really quickly and the food came out within 5 minutes. The ribs are amazing! It's cooked just right, the meat falls right off the bones, and the bbq sauce is soooo good! The fries and cole slaw was pretty good, but my favorite is the macaroni salad. We stuffed ourselves until we couldn't eat anymore and took the sides to go. If you're in san diego, phil's bbq is a must!

Beef ribs hands down. Forget the long line. Forget the hype. Forget the obvious blatant request for 5 star yelp reviews on many of the banners. The beef ribs are freakin good. My GF took all the babyback ribs. I did not give a shit. More beef ribs for me!! I didn't care for the onion rings. They were extremely oily, and some were soggy. Giant? Sure. Not the tastiest though.

I'm not a huge fan of BBQ, but I'm a fan of Phil's. Sizable portions of good food at reasonable prices - who doesn't love that? Their meat falls off the bone and melts in your mouth, and their BBQ sauce is pretty good butttt I don't love it. I'm no BBQ aficionado so take my opinion of their sauce with a grain of salt, but I really just find it to be average. That being said, all of their food is fantastic and you won't be disappointed with the quality of your dish. I recommend everybody ORDER TO GO. If you want to experience dining in the restaurant and are willing to sacrifice an hour of your life standing in a line with strangers then go for it but ordering to go will definitely shave off a ton of time and you can eat in the comfort of your own home. There is a separate line for take out and it is sometimes empty so you can get in and out and bypass all the chumps twiddling their thumbs outside. Whoever wrote that the line goes by quickly is flat out lying unless they somehow got lucky and came at a time when the line was only 20-25 people deep. I've never seen this place not have a line slinking along the perimeter of the entire parking lot and I've had to stand around for almost an hour and a half multiple times.

Service: 5/5 Food: 3.5/5 - meat lovers would disagree with me! Cleanliness: 4/5 Area: 4/5 Price: 5/5 - a lot of food for what you pay. So I came to San Diego before and me and my boyfriend were trying to eat dinner here and the wait was 2 hours long. ridiculous. but we came at 11:30am before rush-hour and got our food very quickly. Service was very helpful, the cashier explained and helped me pick my side-dishes and explained to me what the Chick-less dinner plate was. So I gave her a 5/5. She took the time to acknowledge my existence as a costumer. Food wasn't what I hoped for. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, or maybe I'm just not a big fan on meaty plates but I wasn't feeling the Chick-less dinner. The proportions are huge and big for the price you pay. I had leftover lunch for the next day, however they are known for their baby back ribs and probably the sloppy joe which I saw a lot of people ordering but they could consider making the "less fattening meals" taste better. I felt that the chicken just was covered in sauce and really lacked juiciness unlike my boyfriends ribs which were pretty good and the pork could be pulled right off the bone. the fries were pretty good and crispy and baked beans were okay, which is why i think this place is only known for just the ribs. I guess my advice is don't order what I got, and if you like big portions. go for it. but I wouldn't wait 2 hours to eat here. i feel if the restaurant took the time to better their other dishes, I would've gave them more of a plus. I'm just not that into meat i guess.

Totally need to try this place out if you're in SD and you're a fan of BBQ. I've had this place bookmarked for months!!! So I was excited when we finally found my way down here. FOOD: Delicious, it's really not a sweet BBQ. It has so many different dimensions to it: sweet, smokey, spicey, and a bit of tartness to it. In my opinion it is as BBQ should be. It's also smoked/grilled BBQ, not boiled. Definitely cool points on that. The ONION RINGS are massive and battered perfectly. SERVICE: I'm including the wait in the service department. Ridiculous!!!! I get that this is good food, but the wait is a turnoff. It's also the reason for the knocking down of a coveted star. Btw we came on a weekday, around 3-4p so I suspect this is a natural occurrence. Luckily, I'm a savvy Yelper and realized that I could phone in my order. SCORE! So that's exactly what I did. As the throngs of people waited restlessly, the mister and I simply breezed by to the pickup line. All this took about 15 mins... possibly less. We ended up eating in the car, because you can't sit in if you take out. But who cares?! Gotta love Yelp for all these helpful tips ;) I do wish they had a better selection of sides. What BBQ place doesn't carry mac n cheese???? C'mon! Totally BBQ staple!

Be smart people! A place with this many reviews is doing something right and that is why there is always a line. Order ahead and you will not be disappointed. Everything here is mouth watering and if you can't wait in a long line, go somewhere else. This restaurant outgrew it's former location and will soon out grow here! The combo ribs and chicken was enough for left overs the next day. The sandwiches are huge. Be prepared if you take the food on a picnic! The staff is great trying to get the food out in a timely manner and well staffed.Love it!!!

I came here for the full baby back rib dinner with a large side order of fries and a fountain drink with free refills ($23.64 total). The meat falls off the bone and you get this smokey and savory flavor in every bite. This may be weird, but if you're daring dip your ribs in extra bbq sauce and sour cream, it'll give that cool refreshing taste in your palate from the bbq sauce (that's just nasty bro). The fries were on point, crispy and moist. If your hands are already filled with bbq sauce and you don't want to use a ketchup bottle, just dip it in the excess bbq sauce that's all over your plate, you won't regret it. As you wait for your food, prep by ripping out paper towels for you and your friends so the roll won't be stained by your bbq fingerprints (MY GERMS!!!). Also get some wet naps armed and ready when you're finished devouring your feast of a meal. Expect a long line, being a vulture when it comes to finding a table (unless you're with a big party), and a full stomach. Call your friends or relatives also when you're waiting in line and tell them to go to the Phil's bbq website to see you in the live cam feed online. "OH S___!!!, I'M ON CAMERA, FIRST THE POLICE NOW THIS!!!" I would go out of my way just to get my hands on these ribs again, can't wait for another visit at SD.

The BBQ at Phil's really is THAT GOOD! I don't know what it is about their BBQ sauce but it's outstanding. I probably don't need to elaborate much since 4000+ reviewers before me have said enough, so the only thing for you to do is to go try it! I love their ribs so much I haven't tried anything else. The baked beans are bomb and the cole slaw and fries are pretty good too. Be aware though, chances are you will probably have to wait in line... even before the restaurant is open! I know because I came for lunch right before opening time and I was about 4-5 people back.

Advice if you are just with you and a date or 2 people you might want to try to skip the line and see if you can get into the bar alot faster then the 1 hour wait or so. I'm telling you yelpers the food is amazing must put on your bucket list to try.

Wow! More ribs than I can chew! Tender baby back rib.... makes me want to sing the Chili Baby Back Rib song in my head over and over again! The beefy rib just melt off the bones. Usually pork is the meat of choice, but when I tried my friend's beef rib... man... I wish I was a carnivorous cow with 4 stomachs keep all the food in! Why do they call their fries small portion? It's more like XL and XXL... I had to tell myself that it's not worthy getting a heart attack. Live to eat another day, y'know? I enjoyed my coleslaw... KFC is still my standard by which to judge all coleslaw... and this is pretty close. Beans are sweet... hmm... I'm not much of a bean person and still probably won't get it. Nevertheless, I can see why people like it. Oh yea, get the onion rings! It's different than most places... I don't know how to describe it but whatever adjective I use it's synonymous to good.

It has been 3 years since I last ate at this joint since I left So Cal and the ribs were as awesome as usual. I drove directly from the airport and was not surprised to see a line at 11AM on a Saturday morning. I ordered a full rack and half rack of baby back ribs and they were nice enough to give me a sampling of the tri-tip and it was heavenly. My only complaint about the ribs is that they drench the sauce and it's a little overwhelming because it is smothering and a molasses based sauce. Since I've moved back to the East Coast, I've been exposed to Southern BBQ and they let you decide how much sauce you want to put on your ribs and I like this so much better and I've been spoiled eating Southern BBQ. However, Phil is King in San Diego and his BBQ is the best in America's Finest City! I'll definitely eat here on my next trip to SD.

This place never disappoints me when it comes to the food. My usual choice will be a pulled pork sandwich, half a side of fries, a corn on the cob, and some soda. The best thing is that the buns they use for the pulled pork sandwiches don't fall apart half way through the meal like other buns do. I wish they didn't charge corn on the cob for as a whole side, but it always goes great with the meal.   I noticed that even when you order take out, they don't begin putting your meal together until you go up to the counter to check in your name. It's understandable that they might have a build up of take out orders, but when I'm ordering take out, I usually want to be in and out quickly.

Had to hit this place with 4000+ Yelp reviews. And it lived up to its hype. Probably said 4000 times already, smokey fall off the bone baby backs with such delicious sauce that I shamelessly licked my fingers in public endlessly (and probably would have licked anyone else's fingers with bbq sauce on them too). Beef rib was succulent and tasty. The onion rings were huge and good if you love thickly battered stuff... if not, you can pass on this. Bottom line: Crazy busy place with even a separate wait line for pickup orders (?!). Friendly staff with kickass ribs. All hail to Phil's.

This place is onolicious!  The food was plentiful and comes at a very good price.  We tried both their beef rib and pork baby back rib and I was not disappointed with either one.  They were both tender and contained lots of meat.  This place is all about their bbq sauce as they did not have a dry rub version.  Their cole slaw side was also good.

By far the best barbecue that I have ever had. Came here on a Saturday afternoon on Memorial day weekend. Yes the line is long and parking can be a pain in the butt but it's totally worth it. Did I mention you can grab a cup of beer while in line too? I had the half rack pork ribs dinner with macaroni salad and beans. I don't usually get beans but damn it was all good. Pork meat came right off the bone. Since I knew I wasn't going to come back for awhile I also ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw. Took a bite out of it but I was already done for lunch. Anyways, it still tasted just as good the next day for lunch! Oh and a quick note, get a bib and if you want extra barbecue sauce you can ask the servers! There are restrooms if you need to do your business and there's a massive sink if you just need to wash your hands from all that barbecue sauce too!

As you can see from all the other reviews, Phils BBQ is absolutely amazing. For everyone complaining about the line - when the food is absolutely delicious and the atmosphere is amazing... of course there is going to be a line! I've really never had a problem with the wait, because I do phone in orders when I need to pickup. Otherwise, the wait is not that long and food is served in a timely manner. For anyone who is not a San Diego native (and hasn't tried the ribs out before), I would highly recommend checking out Phils BBQ

**Disclaimer: Came with a group of 4 around 2PM on a Saturday so the line wasn't too crazy** BBQ, how could you go wrong? Right, you can't. You are delicious. Dry rub? Slathered sauce? Phenomenal. If 50cent knew about you, he would be singing about beef ribs instead of cake. I ordered the 3 beef ribs with a side of corn. Onion rings to share for the table of course! They give you bibs so that you don't ruin your clothes... I should definitely start carrying those around with me. The ribs were succulent and delicious, but the sauce was a bit TOO tangy for my taste. I prefer the ones at Lucille's. The corn was good, but it would have been better if we had more of that cajun spice mix! THAT STUFF IS DELICIOUS! They were all out, but one of the waiters managed to find one for us. :) Win! I wouldn't wait two hours in line for Phil's, but 20 minutes was just enough time to get our tummies rumbling for some BBQ. Delicious! It's corner bakery ordering style where you order first and are then seated. They escort larger groups to tables, but if you're a smaller group, good luck finding a table! It's a pretty big place. They might want to adjust their ordering system because the actual counter ordering system is a huge bottleneck.

SO good and so cheap ! I was supposed to go here for a graduation party, but we switched locations because it was so busy. I wish I went earlier ! But I finally got to go and it was SO good ! I honestly thought it was going to be over hyped because a lot of my friends raved about how good phils was and it totally met up to my expectations ! We went at an awkward time between lunch and dinner so we didn't have to wait for more than 5 minutes. The food came out surprisingly really fast too! I got the baby back rib tickler and I got really full too. I read in the description that it comes with two onion rings and I thought they were gonna be small, but they were HUGE. I couldn't even finish my whole plate. I wish there was a phils bbq in the LA area !

The line was insanely long for a bbq place...whoa. but its not a sitdown waitress spot so this wasnt as bad. it was order at the counter and wait for the food to be called. so i would say its very much like shake shack in that sense. The food. The baby back ribs were AMAZING. The sauce was very very good i couldnt stop using it on my fries.  The hostess recommended the "Beefy ribs" while they were good the meat is not as tender as pork ribs.  the beef ribs were huge though. one is enough. Definitely a must try attraction in San Diego!

Ok, I might not be the best person to rate a bbq place since I dont have bbq food all the time. This is what I think. I don't think this place is worth waiting an hour for if you have to wait that long. Half hour: yes. Forty mins: maybe. The baked beans here were good. I'm not a fan of their fresh cut fries. I know the el toro sandwich was featured on Adam's travel channel, but I would just stick with the BBQ meats. The onion rings are nice, crispy and light. The meat is nice and fall off the bone tender.

I used to eat here all the time. Ever since they changed the sauce to the bottled sauces I don't come as often but I still do love what they got going on. It's really busy and can gather a long wait at it's peak times. The onion rings are something that I have to order every visit I make here. Don't order to go because it's not the same after 10 minutes. Eat in only and it'll be much more worth it. I think most of the reviews here are pretty spot on and it's hard to add anything else that hasn't been said about Phil's.

Here's how it works: 1. Wait in line and browse through the menu 2. Order and get a pager 3. Find a seat and wait to get buzzed 4, Pick up food from counter 5. Put on a bib and GRUB!!! It's that simple... People aren't kidding when they tell you there's a long line and the food is worth the wait. I came here during lunch time on a weekday. The wait wasn't too bad.. about 10 minutes. Anyhow, I ordered the full rack of baby back ribs with the sides of macaroni salad and beans. The baby back ribs were delicious, tender and tasteful. And yes, the meat falls off the bone. The BBQ sauce has a very bold flavor with a kick of zest. The macaroni salad was good and just right. The beans were ok. The overall ambiance is pretty cool. It's dimmed so if you're going to take pictures, get your flash ready. The staff is pretty friendly. If you're not sure what to order, ask for samples.. that's what I did. Enjoy!

I know many of my fellow San Diegan's LOVE this place. It's okay, and yes, I am qaulified to say so. It's good, but by far not the best bbq. On a scale of 1-10, I'd say it's a 6.5, maybe a 7. I grew up in Kansas City, I myslef am a pit master and smoke master. I can say that this is not the best BBQ. However it is some of the best that SD can offer. What can you expect for southern californian? That would be like asking for a great surf shop in Kansas CIty. Just trust me. If you ever get a chance to visit the midwest, you will find a lot of BBQ that will Blow Phil's out of the water. You will still like Phil's, you'll just know and understand why it is by far, not the best!

Phil's is the one place in San Diego I know I can reliably get good Q. Now, the first time we ever dined at Phil's it was in their Hillcrest location, many years ago. It was the amazing, smoky aroma that brought it to our attention. We'd been running errands, and skipped lunch, so we went in hungry....and left satisfied. The Hillcrest location has been closed for some time now but they have the Sports Arena location, which is much larger, though it lacks some of the soul of the original. Now, I don't want to make you think the new location isn't worth checking out, because it is...but it's definitely more commercial than the Hillcrest rib joint that we first happened upon all those years ago. Phil's makes both flavors of ribs: pork and beef. The pork ribs are a favorite around our house..tender and flavorful. The beef ribs are immense, and have a nice smoky char, but they're too much for me! Phil's has an award winning sauce, which a lot of people love and come back for time and again...but I always say to really test the mettle of any rib joint, you need to taste the meat "dry"...therein lies the rub. Rub, get it?  I've tasted them just this way at Phil's, and they stood up to my finicky palate and passed with flying colors. If you're not in the mood for ribs, you certainly have other choices. There is mesquite chicken, for one. There are the ribless and chickless dinners, which are basically like getting a rib or chicken dinner without the troublesome bones involved in the process. Chunks of pork or white meat chicken with Phil's famous sauce, served with a choice of sides. And there's also the BBQ Broham...a tangy pulled pork sandwich, served with the traditional cole slaw, on a soft, tasty bun. Personally, I order the slaw on the side...but I do see plenty of people eating it as is. Me, I like to top it with the baked beans! Yummy! They also have burgers (beef or turkey), and a tri-tip sandwich, which I've never tried, but have been told is delicious. There's even a veggie burger for any vegetarians that happen to come along with you! Sides are what you'd expect: corn, baked beans, potato salad, macaroni salad, steamed veggies, baked potato, fries & rings. The onion rings are nothing short of phenomenal! Battered and fried to crisp perfection, they are both hearty and light and make the perfect accompaniment to all that tangy sauce. And they're not kidding when they call 'em colossal! The new Phil's has plasma tv's and a fast hectic pace. They used to let you phone in orders to dine in, but have since stopped doing so. The lines can get long! Be prepared to spend some time, especially if you head over on a weekend night! Of course, you *could* phone in an order to go, and then "change your mind"! But I'm not advocating that, of course.

I'm normally not a fan of BBQ, but I really did enjoy Phil's. It's my 2nd time here and after trying it again, I still have to say that it was a little hyped. I had take out the first time and after waiting a mere 15 minutes or so, I took my order to eat at a nearby fast food to devour. It was pretty good, but not what I had expected for #1 on yelp. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt of it not being the same if you don't eat there (or so my friend insists). half white chicken - too dry, too bland. No Bueno baby back ribs - delicious and saucy. Love the sauce. sides: Sweet Beans & Mac Salad - lovveddd the sweet beans. Brings back old elementary school lunch memories. Both sides fit the craving for something healthy/light in comparison to the heavy meat. el toro - too full to eat, but I did take a bite. It was okay. Standard. 2nd time around, I came again after spending the day at San Diego Zoo. I was hungry, tired and not amused by the Disneyland line that wrapped around the building.  When you prepare for the worst and hope for the best, you will always be surprised.  Before I knew it, I was about to order. I was told the Chickless chicken was the good chicken, but this time I was smarter, didn't want to get disappointed so I didn't venture out to explore. I stuck with Pig and Cow. baby back ribs - still just as good. Tender meat falling off the bones. Amazing. beefy rib - huge pieces of meat, soft and juicy. Amazing. still love my sweet beans and mac salad sides. all in all, I would come back again. The wait does build the anticipation. With the combination of hunger, the food will be fantastic. Though I do have to say that I still didn't expect it to be #1 on yelp material, still worth taking friends from other places to try. check out my pictures  :  )

At Phil's, the beef ribs themselves are about as good as the handful of previous reviewers (about 4,000 or so) have claimed. Meaty cuts, smoky (though they could be smokier), and fall-off-the-bone tender. The Beef Rib Dinner (three ribs with two small sides or one large side, $13.95) is more than likely enough to satiate most appetites. As the cashier will warn you, the beef ribs come slathered in sauce, unless you explicitly ask otherwise. The sauce here isn't bad. It's both sweet and slightly tangy, but so much so that I felt like it overshadowed the meat. And the sweetness felt ever so slightly cloying by the time I moved on to my third rib. I'd probably go for the stuff on the side next time. I was mildly annoyed that the onion rings here, so exalted by thousands of other reviewers, weren't available as a side. Instead, you're forced into ordering them separately -- $3.95 for a small, $5.95 for a large. Fortunately, the small is hardly small, as both the portion size and the rings themselves are enormous.

I hate giving places that are highly rated and have plenty of reviews 5 stars because I always feel like I'm just following the crowd.....but this place definitely deserves it! Perhaps if I had waited hours I'd dock off a star but my experience here was just plain  great! I came at 4:15 PM on a Tuesday and boy this place was already packed! We came just in time to miss the long lines though because we got our food and got seated in about 10 minutes. First of all, I'm not ribs expert but there baby back ribs are BOMB. My friend and I got a full rack order (10-12 pieces) with beans and fries for only about $20. Not only is this a really affordable deal, they give you a good amount of meat! The meat was tender, flavorful, juicy and falling off the bone - just how I like my ribs. The flavor wasn't too sweet or too tangy and it wasn't dry (which are usually the issues with some ribs I've tried). I really wonder what they put in the sauce! I also thoroughly enjoyed dipping my fries in it. After walking at the SD zoo all day, this was the perfect meal to replenish my energy :) I don't usually crave ribs but after this, I'm actually craving it now...

I came here with my boyfriend and we came here around lunchtime, the line wasn't ridiculously long we only had to stand in line for 20 mins.  We also didn't have to wait that long for our food either, I want to say a max of 10 mins.  We ordered a full rack of ribs that came with 2 small sides and we got two extra small sides because why not they were only $1.50 each.  We got the fries, potato salad, coleslaw, and macaroni salad.  The sides were definitely not what I call a small and we even got an extra rib, but no complaining here! The meat practically fell off the bone and it was super tender.  The BBQ sauce was bit on the tangy side, which wasn't bad but I would have preferred the sauce to be more sweet.  Even though this place doesn't have a waiter service there are plenty of super friendly workers floating around willing to help you.

I'm not a fan of BBQ, but I knocked out a pulled pork sandwich like there was no tomorrow. Next time I'm in town, I am totally coming back :)

Hate to bring the reviews down, but this place was good not great. Meat was tender, but most of the taste was in the sauce they drenched it in. Beef ribs my friend got were much better. Sides were nothing to write home about. If you have a small party (2-3), definitely check out the bar for open seats rather than wait in line...

Phil's BBQ is probably the best you can get in San Diego, but compared to Texas BBQ, I can't give this a five star. I'm not a fan of the line and the drenched BBQ, but have to admit the chicken meat is actually juicy and the baby back ribs are really good. The sides are okay, but I always stick to the corn on the cob, slaw and fries. The macaroni salad is okay, but it tastes like too much mayo.

"The best things come to those who wait".   Way back in The Day, The above was the tag line from a famous Heinz ketchup commercial starring an incredibly young Matt Le Blanc.  Who knew they were really talking about Phil's BBQ? As a general rule, I am not a fan of waiting in line for anything, least of all restaurants.  If a place I want to go to takes reservations, I'll make them; if they don't, and I arrived to discover the wait is longer than 30 or 40 minutes, my tendency has been to seek nourishment elsewhere; life is short, lines are Evil, and they're for amusement parks, not for restaurants. At least, that's what I used to think.  This Old Dog learned a new trick on a recent trip to San Diego: restaurant lines are sometimes an Evil worth enduring - especially if you've got good company, and the light at the end of the tunnel is particularly bright and alluring :-) Having just spent a perfect afternoon strolling through Coronado and the Hotel Del, then enjoying some time on Coronado's beautiful, broad, white sandy beach, my friend and I were looking forward to dinner at the legendary Phil's BBQ.  With over 1,000 five star reviews (says one sign), it made Yelp's  top 10 restaurant list for 2011 (says another sign), and as of this writing has close to 4,000 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5 stars - quite a lot of hype!  We arrived at 5pm on a Sunday.  I remember thinking, "how bad can the lines be this early?"  That turned out to be about the most misguided thought since it occurred to John McCain that he could broaden his appeal to women (not to mention intellectuals) by adding Sarah Palin to the ticket... The line was literally around the block - and then some!  I must admit I was stunned, and for a fleeting moment I thought about suggesting that we leave, but I knew my friend wouldn't want to, and if ever I've had a friend worth indulging, it's this one.  Besides, we were already close enough to be in range of the tantalizing smell of BBQed meat... We waited about an hour and a half; it was a warm night, the atmosphere was festive, and I couldn't have asked for better company.   NOTE: When we rounded the final corner, I noticed a booth from a local winery that was offering free tastings - they should have several signs for this all along the line so people know it's there, but I'll know next time, and you know now :-) Enough waiting, on to the dining experience!  Let's start with the bad things first: - Phil's has no table service; you place your order at a counter, then get a beeper which will alert you when your food is ready so you can go back and get it. - Beer and wine is sold in a separate bar area; you have to go there and wait in another (and somewhat shorter) line to get it while you're waiting for your food to cook. - The Fresh Cut Fries are nowhere near crispy enough; in fact, they're borderline soggy, and not particularly tasty either. We found a table out on the patio and a couple of minutes later, it was time to try some of Phil's legendary fare!  We wanted to try a good cross-section of what Phil's had to offer, so we ordered a 5-bone Beefy Rib dinner, which includes 1 large side (we got the Corn-on-the-Cob) or 2 small ones, and a half-order of Baby Back Ribs.  We also got separate orders of Colossal Onion Rings and Fresh Cut Fries. While the corn was mediocre, the rest of the food we had was amazing; I'm not exaggerating when I say the ribs were so good they bordered on orgasmic! Beefy Ribs:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… These amazing specimens of BBQ fabulousness are big enough to feed an armored division, and they'd all die happy :-)  Tender, perfect, melt-off-the-bone and into your mouth wonderful.  It simply doesn't get any better! Baby Back Ribs:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Serious BBQ perfection, these fabulous babies are fall off the bone tender, with a slight char crust from BBQing, and coated in Phil's wonderfully tangy sauce that's sweet, smokey and zesty.  The best damn pork baby backs I've ever had! Colossal Onion Rings:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… These were stupendous!  Plumb on the inside, crispy on the outside, perfectly battered, golden brown and flavorful. We had an excellent meal, and I'm glad that I added another play to my personal playbook.  When coupled with good judgment about what to wait for (and what not to), I now see that being willing to endure a long restaurant wait can sometimes yield an incredibly worth-while result. Was Phil's BBQ worth the wait?  Totally!  I'd go back in a heartbeat, though next time I'd start the wait at 4pm for dinner, and hope that would have us eating after only an hour - a man is only as good as his dreams! :-)

Okie dokies, giving you one more star Phil's BBQ for having an awesome turn around on your phone/to go orders.  This time I ordered the beef ribs with my boyfriend and it was super tender with lots of flavor.  We got there late one night, the line was out the door as usual but we decided to place a to go order.  Our order was ready in 5 minutes, totally beats waiting in line for over an hour.  We swiftly picked up our piping hot dinner, then the Boyfriend and I had a romantic and satisfying meal in our car. I'm also very impressed with one of the owners who personally emailed me on Yelp!, terrific customer service.

My husband always (always) gets the ribs.  I always get the Broham sandwich.  A tip...get the sauce on the side. Try it just once.  Without the sweet sauce smothering the meat, you really get to taste the smoked pork.  That little red tint, that is the smoke ring...just the way pulled pork is supposed to be. It's actually very full flavored with a good hint of smoke flavor and moist. Not sloppy moist, just right. I always get the slaw on the side also.  I have had better ribs in the Carolinas (and my hubby's grill), but in the San Diego area, Phil's and the Barbecue Hut at the beach, are the best bets.  I love pulled pork and the sandwich at Phil's  is great, but I always get the sauce on the side now. That way the flavor of the meat is the star and not the sauce.

I guess I'm contributing to Phil's selling point of over 1,000 5-star reviews here on Yelp but I honestly feel like it's that good. One of the first things you'll notice is the line. A line that literally stretches around the block. It's funny b/c I really didn't know anything about this place and no one had told me about it and I vaguely remembered seeing this name on someone's Facebook status a long time ago. But this place is right across from my hotel so we decided to go. Even though the line looks daunting, it's really a matter of crowd control for Phil's since they are inundated with families, large parties and everyone in between. You get a good long opportunity to decide what it is you want to order and then when you give your order to the people, you wait for your little electronic buzzer thing to go off. My family got the BBQ ribs and chicken and fries, macaroni salad and potato salad. Yes, obviously an incredibly healthy meal. But the meat. My god. The meat was SO. GOOD. I've never been to a real BBQ place and the only one near FC is that shitty Armadillo Willy's place. But this is authentic, "made with love" kind of BBQ. The sauce was amazing and the meat literally fell off the bones. It was not greasy or gross or overly sweet or anything. It was all just so good. And their onion rings are MASSIVE. We got the small order which was about 6 rings and that alone could have filled us up. And what I like about this place the most is how self-autonomous you an be. Essentially the wait staff is there to guide you and take your order, but you get the drinks and plates and utensils yourself and since they know you can't finish it all, all of the take-out materials (to-go box, bags, etc) are all there for you. I really liked having that there. And even though it was busy and crazy it never once felt crowded or overwhelming or out-of-control. Everyone working there knew what they were doing and were very friendly. I can definitely see why this place has gotten so many 5-star reviews! They need one in SF!

The sign that says 20 min wait is off by about 20 min. Meaning it's 40 min from the sign. The food is better than par and the servings are large, but it's nothing special. I've had better bbq on many occasions, and the truth is I really wanted to like it. Maybe I got my hopes too high. Perhaps this is the best bbq in San Diego, but it's definitely not among the best in the country. We ordered the baby back ribs, the chick-less chicken, the pulled pork sandwich, and the onion rings. The meat wasn't tender enough, the sauce to vinegary, and the sides lacking flavor (beans & Coleslaw). The onion rings were some of the best I've ever had.

This place is rated well for a reason. We had the baby back rib dinner (10-12 ribs) with coleslaw and beans. All so yummy. The only downer is that this place is really popular so be ready to wait in some long lines. They do a good job of people trying to save seats for a table of 15, when they're 30 minutes away from getting their food. A definite must try in SD.

Pretty good food, horrible place to eat tho, nowhere to sit.  -1 star for poor seating and long long long wait.  I would recommend the food to any meat fan.  Got the beef and chick-less which comes with ribs, chicken (no bones), and two sides, I got fries and potato salad (I wouldn't do the potato salad again).  Fries were bomb. I'm not a meat fan, but I enjoyed this meal and the price was perfect -- $12 for a big sized meal. Enjoy! #BigFAY http://www.ticketmanonli…

LOVE THIS PLACE. I had to wait an entire hour before entering the restaurant. The lines were out the door and around the corner. There were a lot of graduation celebrations going on that night. Thankfully, the restaurant also sells beer to those that are waiting in line. Before I was in the restaurant we had polished off quite a few cans and happily buzzed. the FOOD is delish and the wait time from ordering the food and eating it is surprisingly short. (10-15 mins) I had a great time here- great energy, yummy food. (it can be a bit saucy so you if you dont like that, you should ask to have the sauces to the side)

I totally don't get this place.  It's expensive, the lines are crazy long, and the service is bad.  If you like lots of BBQ sauce you won't be disappointed, if you like the flavor of meat, don't bother.  It is truly disgusting how much sauce they put on everything.  Much better BBQ in San Diego you just have to look for it.  This is for people that don't know the difference or care about the flavor of the meat.  I'll add that I am from Texas and prefer to taste the meat over the sauce.

My most recent visit was probably the most enjoyable.  I usually order chicken but this time got an order of baby back ribs.....MOUTH-WATERING.  It basically fell right off the bone and I could not get enough of it. All their sides are great but I'd prefer 2 small sides rather that 1 large side with my order.  The cajun seasoning they offer at the table is soo good to sprinkle over almost anything, especially if you order fries. Outdoor patio is perfect if you want to keep an eye on your little pooch, and by pooch I'm talking about your animal not the stubborn portion of your "abs". Didn't realize I didn't bring my bf here so it is a must for me to bring him here.

Delicious baby back ribs that are also affordable. This is the place to get your barbeque fix when you're feeling your carnivourus side of you bubbling to the surface. If you're looking for a full rack of ribs, which I am pretty much always down for, and dont want to pay $23 or even more at the high end restaurants just for the ribs by itself, Phils BBQ is the place to be with their full baby rack dinner including 2 sides for $19.99 (I hope that's right!) With the enormous amount of sides that they give you, I highly suggest that you split the sides with someone. My best suggestion here is to order one of their dinner combos to include the two sides, and have the second person only order whatever meat they want to eat. You will definitely not regret it when you're actually able to stand up from your table. I've done the whole dinner on my own once and couldn't stand up for a good 15 minutes before I digested just enough to get out of the place so the other customers who are standing in line for what is usually about half an hour can have a table to eat their delicious barbeque at. Aside from their deliciously affordable massive amounts of barbeque, the people here are just SO NICE! All the servers who work here talk like they love what they do, and that makes me happy that I can eat at this establishment. Their tables are cleaned really fast so their efficiency will make it so that your wait isn't longer than it should be. Once you order, you get your food only with a few minutes of you getting the pager in your hand to tell you when the food is ready. They give you so much condiments so you'll never feel like you're lacking anything! Cajun seasoning on your table goes super well with the fries! Overall LOVE this place!

I can't believe how long I've been going to Phil's and have never reviewed them. All I can really say is if you go to Phil's, you'll know why I gave it 5 stars.  My absolute favorites from Phil's include the pulled pork sandwich (Broham) and the baby back ribs.  Phil's unique BBQ sauce is incredible and they don't hold back :) I've taken so many people from out of town to Phil's and when they come back to San Diego, it's the number one place they want to eat at when visiting.   Word of advice, it is HUGELY popular so be prepared to wait in line.  The line looks bad as it wraps around the restaurant outside, but don't worry, it moves pretty quickly.  But if you don't want to wait in line, don't worry.  They have take out.  But again, your best bet is to order before you go because even take out takes a little while.   I have tried BBQ from the West Coast to the East Coast and all inbetween and Phil's is without a doubt my favorite.  I do consider myself a "foodie" and highly recommend Phil's if you have a craving for BBQ.  If you aren't craving BBQ, try it anyway and you might find yourself craving it more often.

Despite the 8 million reviews, I must still weigh in on this fabulous location. They definitely KNOW what they are doing here. While there may be a wait involved, it goes quickly, and their system is organized. There are Disneyland-esque markers informing you of wait-times from certain points (fairly accurate by my count), and inside an employee directs you to a cashier who takes your order. Then you are given a number. You can choose your seat, and wait til you are buzzed/called. Obviously, food is amazing. Even the chicken is tender and delicious. Yes, the sauce is more sweet than spicy, but it will please you with its smoky transition to slightly sweet aftertaste. Sides? Onion rings and fries are a YES. Plus, there is a row of sinks behind the drink machines so you don't clog up the bathroom just to wash your hands. They really did think of everything.... Yummilicious Factor = A

Okay. I can't believe I didn't write a review for this place yet. It. is. THE BEST. RIBS I have EVERRRRRRRRRRRRR eaten. I've tried Lucielles. I've tried all those fancy shmancy rib places and NOTHING can top phils. Do you remember as a kid where you watched cartoons and when the lion eats meat off a bone, the meat just slid off? Yeah... that's how it is here. It just slides RIGHT off the bone. And the meat? it LITERALLY melts like cheese in your mouth. Wait... I'm not done, and the barbeque sauce is like heaven juice, overflowing in your mouth and exciting your tastes buds juuuuuuusssst right. I think I came to eat here after every finals. And there was never a time where I hated it. And the service is just amazing. O yes. I'll be back.... I'll be back....

Once every month I'd scrap all my change and go to Phil's and treat myself to some bomb-ass RIBS! (student life!) YES, there's a wait. Who cares, it's worth it. I'm usually in line for 20-40 mins. If you can't wait, get it to go or eat at the bar and enjoy some beer. If you're a beast get the full rack. If you're a vagina boy/girl get the half rack(still gets the job done). The main dishes come with two sides. I'd recommend the fries, potato salad and the mac salad. There is cole slaw, unfortunately I dislike cole slaw. I been to a couple of rib joints and I AM NO RIB EXPERT but the sauce here is damn delicious. It's sweet, tangy, with a side of Chuck Norris round houses. Trust me you're winning if you dine here. The only thing IS, I've had their half rib half chicken entree recently and for some reason the chicken is not always consistant. Sometimes its on point and sometimes it's dry. Also the last time I ate at Phil's I felt like the side portions became rabbit sized. Economy? MAYBE! Phil's financially hurting? SIKE, they basically own that plaza! Def. recommend this place THO!

Dear Phil, your ribs are top notch.  It has just the right amount of tang and spice.  It slides off the bone.  I savored every bite until I found myself licking the sauce off my fingers. Just one thing,  I ordered to carryout to have a picnic, but the staff forgot eating utensils. You would have gotten 5 stars if that SNAFU didn't happen.

There are plenty of reviews here about how good Phil's is so I will just write about a few things that made it even better for me! - TICKLER options are smaller portions and allow you to enjoy Phil's without feeling like you doubled in size! And it lets you feel like you have some self-control even though you really don't. I got the baby back ribs tickler and it came with plenty of cole slaw, fries, and 2 onion rings (OMG delish). I was very happy and full, but not bursting. - CLEAN: Yes, a clean BBQ joint! Phil's does a few things that really impressed me, and some of you may not care about clean, but I do! They have this glorious trough-like stainless steel hand-washing, automated soap-dispensing, automated paper towel thing in the back, next to the bathrooms. It is GLORIOUS! Right when I was noticing that Phil's did not give me any wetnaps to clean my hands, I walked over and saw the shiny hand-washing station. I was in love! Inside the bathroom, Phil's also has a way for you to open the restroom door from the inside without using your hands - it is a forearm handle. First time I've ever seen that. I prefer the shiny hand-washing station outside, but still, a place that values cleanliness like that is a gem indeed. - FRIENDLY STAFF OUTSIDE: We ate outside and there was a nice server there to help. He seemed solely dedicated to the patio area which is nice because I thought it would just be a self-serve type of place. Overall, it is the little extras that puts Phil's in a category above the rest!

This place is one of the most popular places to get BBQ in SD. Its usually busy but the line move relatively fast and the portions are large. Food: I'm a fan of the beef ribs. People swear buy the baby back ribs, but I think the beef ribs are much better. The BBQ has a vinegar base so its a bit sour with a nice kick at the end. Service: They move fast on the ordering but that's really it. Not a waiter place it more like fast food. Price: It may look pricy but for BBQ its good and the portions are relatively large.

MY FAVORITE BBQ PLACE! When I got there, there was a long line, but you can skip the line if you have a party of 2 and don't mind sitting at the bar, which is exactly what my boyfriend and I did. I usually don't care for American BBQ, but the pull pork sandwich made me care! I think the pull pork sandwich is a MUST GET when you go to Phil's. I just love how tender it is and how it leaves a smokey bbq taste in my mouth after I take a bite out of it. UGH, thinking about it makes my mouth water. The pork ribs are okay good, I like it a little less tangy, I ate it the next day and felt like it taste better LOL. OH, I LOVE THE ONION RINGS! They're probably one of the best onion rings I've ever had. I like the batter they use for the onion rings :) The pull pork sandwich + onion rings are the must gets for me!

Yumm. Stopped by on a Thursday right before the rush around 4:30 and waited less than 10 minutes. Just as we were seated, the line began to wrap around the outdoor seating...yikes We got the beef ribs, which are much bigger than the baby backs. A normal sized person would be stuffed from eating just two of these. We shared two orders of the beef ribs with one large side and three smalls among 4 of us with a good amount of left overs. I wasn't very fond of the onion rings, but the normal fries, mac salad, and beans all were tasty. I really enjoyed the casualness of Phil's: order at the counter, find a table, pick up your order when your buzzer goes off. If it's the week of your birthday, you can skip to the front of the line. Otherwise, I'd recommend getting there before 5pm.

I don't even like bbq and I'm giving phils four stars. I don't do well with sweet foods mixing with savory foods and the bbq sauce is basically gooey candy. Mixed with the delicious savoryness of the baby back ribs without sauce, it is overwhelming for me. But if you like really sweet bbq sauce, this is your place. Sides can't be beat. Favorites are the corn on the cob and macaroni salad. You also MUST get the onion rings. I like the pay before you eat aspect but searching for a seat can be a bit annoying. Check the line cam online before you come so you can assess the wait but, rest assured, the food is worth it!

Your beefy ribs and onion rings... Sigh that combo alone rules every bit of my heart. I love you Phil's. Nobody else does it better. You're very far from me.. And I miss you very much. Those other guys don't matter, please forgive me.. Wood ranch, tony Roma's, chili's, Lucille's, I was just settling baby! You're the one I want.. You're what's on my mind. I hope we see each other soon. I promise I'm coming back for you.

Okay, WOW. I found it hard to believe when I saw that this place had 4.5 stars after 3000+ reviews, but the hype is spot on. We got there around 5 pm on a Saturday and waited about an hour to get to the front. We had a huge party of 12 but they managed to accomodate us anyway and in such a friendly manner that I was taken aback. I got the baby back ribs & chick-less dinner with potato salad and baked beans. The food came out within minutes -- another star for service. But the best part was how AMAZING everything tasted. I was blown away -- the meat was sooo tender (even the chicken, which a lot of people have complained about being dry) and the sauce was bursting with flavour. The sides were probably my favourite part. Both the potato salad and baked beans were perfect. I had a few of my friend's onion rings, too, and I can see why people are crazy about them. Phil's BBQ is totally worth the wait, especially if you haven't been there before, and I don't say that about very many restaurants.

I've been here twice, the first time the line was super long and it was over an hour's wait to eat in so we got it to go. It's so fast and their service is very thorough. Second time we came was just before dinner time rush hour and we were seated almost immediately. So you line up with your whole party and the hostess will not let you in unless everyone's there. Once your group is there, you go up to the counter and order what you want and they give you a beeper. Then you're seated and and wait for your food to be "called" which is super fast. The ribs are succulent and fall off the bone, they are a must! Quite generous and large portions so you're getting your money's worth. The restaurant is very casual and can get quite loud but it's all part of the experience. Service is fast and efficient with a smile. Every time we're in SD we always drop by here for some comfort food!

a bit overrated, i only find myself craving this place once in a blue moon. i am a fan of waiting in long lines for food (no joke), but honestly i think lucille's & famous dave's does a better job with bbq. i know those places are so "mainstream" but i don't see what's so special about phil's, but the fact that you're only limited to two locations so it seems "rare". i'm sure if they broke out & opened up more restaurants, it wouldn't be as popular. something about san diego, they suck the sh*t out of food places. must be deprived of variety =) if you hate lines, don't go on a Sunday for sure.

I make it a point to eat Phil's BBQ every time I visit San Diego. I've never actually dined at the restaurant though (the line to eat there is always around the restaurant)! I usually phone in a huge order and stand in the quick takeout line. It's all about the ribs and sauce here. We usually order racks of the baby backs and the beef ribs (which are enormous). Nothing too special about their sides, but the order of onion rings is large...I mean, very large! We usually get that along with some baked beans and mac salad. I think their El Toro sandwich was featured on Man vs. Food, but I thought it was only okay. I'd stick to their award winning ribs.

Best BBQ ever! Baby back ribs are amazing the meat falls of the bone and melts in your mouth. It is so delicious. The sides are delicious and there are a lot of variety to choose from. I don't think I have ever finished a full rack of ribs and a side. I can't wait to come back and eat here again & again.

I swear I called in my order less than 10 minutes prior to getting there. Strike one: Girl answers, asked for my number, *silence on her end* but I hear someone repeating someone's order, 619.... what was the number again? WTH?! (mind you I was not driving, and enunciated my number slowly (there are a lot of 8s)) Made my way to the to go line, what's up with people who are in the other line being in the way. EXCUSE ME, don't block the to-go line. Strike 2: Anyway, made my way inside and told the girl my name, and then she asked for my number, and then asked if it was under another name. No... She takes a new order. Get the buzzer, wait, *buzz* ask for ranch, "next time it's 50 cents" Um ok. I would have paid the 50 cents. Is their ranch made in house? Just curious... Would not wait longer than 20 minutes if you're eating there. Stingy when it comes to the BBQ sauce for to go orders. I like to make my own take on "carne asada fries" but with phil's bbq: meat + fries + ranch = fatty, but good. :) They have Ballast Point Pale Ale on tap. Still good stuff, but not OMGaaahmouthgasm good. BRISKET, make it happen! *drum roll* Strike 3: HAIR IN THE COLE SLAW! I think i'd be less disgusted if it were a bug.

Hands down the best BBQ that I have ever had! The wait can be long but it's well worth it. After waiting in line you order your food and find a table as fast as you can or on the weekend am employee saved us a table. I suggest you not wait around for your food. Sometimes there might be an open table on the outside patio area. They give you a remote control that vibrates and lets you know that your order is now ready . *Know what you want to order before you get up to the cash register otherwise you'll be holding up the line and you don't want to do that! Food:     Baby back ribs+2 sides- The baby back ribs are of course smaller and don't have too much meat on the bones. Excellent flavor though and very soft. $19.95     Beefy ribs+2 sides- These ribs are my absolute favorite! Excellent flavor and the meat just falls off the bone. Also there is much more meat on each bone versus the baby back ribs. I highly suggest this dish! $19.95.     Half BBQ chicken+2 sides- good texture, but some pieces can be dry, but put the BBQ sauce on it and it's so good. $9.95.     BBQ Broham (pulled pork sandwich)- The pulled pork has great flavor and come with coleslaw on it. Very reasonable at only 6.95.     Colossal onion rings- These are such huge onion rings. Great batter which turns golden brown and piping hot. Nice crunch, but the batter is thick so the inside stays a little soft. It tastes amazing when you dip it in either the BBQ sauce or ranch. Two thumbs up! This is an absolute must if you come here. $5.95. If you're in the area I highly recommend this place for lunch or even dinner. It's great food and a great experience.

Waaaaay overrated!  Perhaps it used to be better before it became so huge.  The BBQ is okay, a little rich for me, but not even close to the best I have ever had.  The pulled pork is super dry, and they smoother everything with too much sauce.  They also don't have many side choices (no mac n cheese or cornbread?).

OK, front of the line BIRTHDAY PASS.. most awesome thing evvver! Ditch the hour and a half line on the week of your birthday by signing up with Phil's Fan Mail. Took 3 of my friends with me, jumped to the front of the line after secretly feeling deep satisfaction as I looked at each person and ditching the line that wrapped around the building. Handed over the birthday pass email and my ID to the host and ordered within 2 minutes. Sat down and literally my order was done in 5 minutes. I looked like a little girl in a candy shop as I took a look at my "Best of Both Worlds" order. Got the baby back ribs and 1/4 chicken dinner with a large corn on the cob with the sauce on the side. PERFECT ORDER. Both chicken and ribs were easy to pull off the bone and the tangy BBQ sauce to top it off was delicious. Got to try the fries and the mac salad ad both are highly recommended. Got to taste the el toro sandwich, and definitely has my seal of approval! I was such a happy camper that day! Granted if I had to wait an hour and half this review might be a 4 star rather than a 5 as I do get a little bit***, I mean, cranky when I'm hungry. But this birthday pass was like gold. Loved it!

I don't know why it took this long to get my butt over here. But that's not important because yesterday, I finally got to taste the famous baby back ribs. And it did not disappoint! Truly did fall off the bone! For sides, we got the onion rings (huuuuge and crispy), mac salad (This was just okay.), cole slaw (Liked this better than mac salad), and corn on the cob. Onion rings = #1 side. The next time I come here, I don't think I'll even bother getting any side with my ribs except onion rings!

Is there any real reason to review this place anymore? Phil's is outstanding, but I've only ever had it to-go, which apparently is the the way to go on a crowded night (which might just be every night). Calling in ahead of time is a life saver. The lines look daunting but there, on the left, is your very own express lane, also known as the side-eye line as all of the hungry people in line for a seat glare at you for calling in your order. The beef ribs are ginormous and have flavor as big as the ribs themselves. I'm a pretty big eater and I couldn't tackle three ribs plus fries and slaw in one sitting. Come hungry or be prepared to be defeated. Quick side note, after picking up our food, we were deterred from our immediate course straight freaking home so we could eat by cravings of Extraordinary Dessert and the need to drop food off for a friend. Despite these delays of about an hour, the food was STILL warm and delicious when we finally did get down to eating. The fries had cooled off and got a bit soggy, naturally, but everything else was outstanding. Just a heads up for anyone worried about traffic or a commute on a pick-up order.

My boyfriend says I eat like a bird. Something small, something light, my stomach does not have a very big capacity. Phil's BBQ is the only place where I will ever go, order a HUGE plate of delicious ribs slathered in bbq sauce, and eat the whole damn thing! My only tip: They open at 11. You're gonna want to be there by 10:30 to stand in line, or else it wraps around not only their building, but all the neighboring buildings as well.

First let me say that if I lived in SD I probably wouldn't be as critical of the food here.  But if you skip breakfast, drive a few hours to try out BBQ that many people rave about, well you go in with some expectations.   The line was long, but not ridiculous.  We were a group of 4, but two were running late so I did not know what to order, so I just ordered family style.  When we sat down with food for 4 at the table with only 2 people, there was a woman sitting across whose eyes nearly bulged out at what she thought was pure gluttony.   We ordered rack of Beef/Pork ribs, chicken, and sides.  The sides we ordered were beer battered onion rings, potato salad, sweet beans, and cole slaw.  Beef ribs were the favorite of the bunch.  The sauce for me was too much on the sweet side, but the meat was good.  As for the sides, the potato salad was not bad as was the slaw, but the onion rings did not impress me much.   As for the atmosphere, it is quite busy and noisy.  This place does plenty of business, but it seems more like it is churning out BBQ instead of a smaller home style place. I wanted to find a place that would take my BBQ heaven up another notch, but alas, this place was not it.  Bludso 4lyfe!!!

ummmmm...YES. Typically, a place that I had to wait an hour and a half to order would not get 5 stars...but this place is simply that good. My first visit to Phil's was 4 years ago. I think they must have recently moved at that point, because their old address was still in the GPS. Fortunately, though, we were able to find the new place. Back in 2008, Phil's must have not had been nearly as well known as it is today, because over the course of 2 days, I'm pretty sure we went there 2-3 times...maybe even twice in the same day. Each time though--no wait. Now 4 years later, I finally returned to Phil's, wanting to remind myself why I was so in love with this place. When we pull into the parking lot...a HUGE line. I immediately said to my partner in crime: "We came this far...we are waiting". I can only assume that Phil's has grown in popularity IMMENSELY. But ya know what, I have to hand it to them...they have taken it in stride. They have built an impressive business (not just a restaurant). It's an experience. As you're waiting in line, you mingle with your fellow linemates. You get a taste of Phil's as they bring around a tray of their delicious onion rings (they are seriously unreal). They also have a photo booth, toys that you can buy, an "Official Tweet Spot", and even a pre-entry stand where you can get yo drank on before even stepping foot into the restaurant. If that isn't enough, Phil's has seriously employed probably 75% of San Diego. They have what I like to call "Official Schmoozers". These are people who are outside with the people waiting in line just chatting you up, asking what you are going to get...just being friendly. It's a nice touch! Once you finally get inside, there are at least 8 different cashiers ready to take your order. After taking the order, I couldn't believe how fast they got the food out! It couldn't have been more than 5-6 minutes. Now up until this point, I have only commented on the experience, because hey, if you are going to be waiting in line for an hour and a half, you gotta have something to entertain you! But what you really come for, is the food. Each time I've gone to Phil's I've only ever gotten the ribs...and for good reason. I don't know what sort of sorcery they use to make these puppies, but my oh my. They just fall right off the bone, they are meaty, and their homemade sauce is just AWESOME. Part of me wishes after waiting that long, I had gotten something like a pulled pork sandwich to go because it looked so good too! Nevertheless, I couldn't have been more pleased with my choice. If you are ever in San Diego, you MUST go here. If you live in SD...I envy you.

Shortly after I reviewed my experience at Phil's, the owner did contact me and apologized, which was nice. He did offer me a front of the line pass...but really?! considering we spent EASILY $300-$400 on food, a front of the line pass seems a bit inconsiderate. Clearly no appreciation towards once loyal customers. Smh...

Bbq pork ribs and beef ribs! By far one of the best in the West Coast. Tender, juicy, and of course fall off the bone. Sweet and tangy bbq sauce and generous portions of meat on the bones and sides is just shear spectacular. Potato Salad is just the right amount of creaminess and sweetness with fat chunks of potatoes. An abundant pile of fries freshly made to order. This place has folks lined up around the building all for a very good reason and purpose, to get a taste of baby back ribs done right. When you come in you order at the counter and then grab yourself a seat. Be prepared for a lot of food and your taste buds off the fritz. The smell of the place has that BBQ enticing smell, with the fresh and coolness of the well ventilated interior. The line seems to be always be moving faster then it seems and the wait for seats are also surprisingly not long since everyone in there has only one goal and one goal only...Eat, Enjoy, and Muster your way back to the car with a food coma on the horizon. Phil's offers lot's of seating areas inside and outside and has a full bar that can't be over-looked because having a beer in one hand and having a rib in the other speaks volumes on ridiculousness! So if ribs is your nature, or just some stright up good ole BBQ, Phil's BBQ is your place to go and check out.

Found this place through TA and Yelp. This place is busy.  First come, first serve but if you call early you can pick up your order to go.  That doesn't always work for travelers. The smells were wonderful.  You wander up, place your order, get a pager go sit down and wait, not very long, to get your food. I had the ribs. They were great.  Flavorful, meaty, and well worth the short wait. My wife had the pulled pork. This stuff was great too.  It had a charred flavor which was wonderful.  I would order that next time. We had a side of onion rings, wow.  They were big, crispy, not oily and the onion inside was not mushy. Some of the best we have had. Next time we are in SD we will be showing up again.  Maybe not at lunch so we won't have to wait as long.

Believe the hype. Phil's BBQ has all that Western barbecue kitsch, has a line clear around the corner, and yet I can't help but start drooling when I think of their succulent ribs. Came here around 7PM on a Friday night and had about a 60 minute wait. However, once you're in the door it takes less than 10 minutes to order your food, take a seat, and pig out on a tasty bbq meal. The boyfriend and I decided to split two dinners-- a full rack of beef ribs (5 large bones) and a full rack of baby back pork ribs (about 10-12 bones). This came with a full order of fresh cut fries, an ear of corn, and a small side of cole slaw. Since we were famished, we ordered a small onion ring on the side, too. SO MUCH FOOD. At only $52, this could have easily fed 3-4 people...! Great value on very good food. The ribs fell off the bone, were moist, and saucy. I'm not terribly crazy about their dry-rub, but their sauce is sweet and thick. All the sides were great, but it really is all about the meat here. The beef was good, but I think the baby backs were a little better. I will need to come back to try their tri-tip sandwich that my friends keep talking about. Phil's easily gets a solid 4 stars in my book, but it's their insanely efficient and friendly staff that bump the experience up to 5 stars. There was this one server named Zach who was seriously the human version of a hummingbird. Incredibly fast, checked in about 10 times during our visit, and grabbed anything and everything we needed from waters, extra bbq and ranch sauce, to-go containers, and even bringing up our food. He was even sweet enough to offer coffee and make sure that we were all set. I dine out 3-5 times a week and I have been to many fine dining establishments where the servers don't even give you the time of day, so this was quite a pleasant treat. Don't let the long line scare you away. Phil's is definitely worth waiting for at least once-- oh, and they LOVE Yelpers, too.

I'm surprised as to how many 5 stars this place has.  Here are the facts: Pros:   -  The BBQ meat was super soft and cooked well. -  Service is great, staff is friendly, and food comes fast. Cons: - There is always a line out the door, and you have to wait 30 min plus just to get seated. - The all important sauce - way too tangy for beef or pork ribs.  Good for chicken, but not ribs.  Its an all in one sauce.  We went as a group of four, and very hungary.  At first we were glad we waited, and the first few bites taste super great, but as we started to fill up, we all found the sauce very unpleasant, and unfortunately all the food is completely saturated with it. So two stars for the long wait times and choice of only one mediocre sauce.  A better sauce or at least a few varieties of sauce and this joint would be 4 stars, get rid of long lines and it would be five stars. Sorry, but as is, the place is over rated. Tip: If you can't wait, get the food togo.  You'll be in and out in 10 minutes or less.

Meat falls off the bone so fast, I barely need to dirty my hands.. I can just pick at it with my fork. Baby back ribs are my fave. Pulled pork sammy was good too, but I prefer the ribs. I'd say it's definitely worth a 45 minute wait.. longer though.. I'm not too sure. Depends on how hungry you are :p A must-try for out of towners. Despite how daunting the line looks, it isn't too hard to find a table once you order so don't fret about that. As far as the sides go, I stick to the oh-so-sweet beans and mac salad... love both of them I think I could eat a bowl of each even without the ribs. Not a big fan of the onion rings here, but whatever floats your boat.

Incredible BBQ.  Baby back ribs and BBQ sauce are delicious, as is everything else.  Normally get the platter that comes with ribs / fries / cole slaw...great value (~$10) and fills you up.  Line can get really long, so suggest avoiding during peak times (though they're still pretty quick even then).  Check out the live webcam of the line on their website if unsure.

I live in LA but always stop by Phil's BBQ everytime when I go down to SD. It is no surprise that there'll always be a wait for delicious food & Phil is one that is worth to be in line for at least a good 30mins for short or an hour if long. Recently they added a photo booth so it's quite interest to snap silly photos while waiting in line but always fun to see how it turns out. Once u get pass the door then get ready to order full baby rib & fresh cut fries on the side. Yummm now dig in for the tender juicy tasty BBQ ribs. [Pic: http://www.yelp.com/user… ]

The line is daunting, but the food is worth the wait! We got there a little after 5 pm and the line was already wrapped around the restaurant and past other businesses. It moved at a good pace though, and I like that it felt like an amusement park attraction. There's a sign to let you know when you're 21 minutes from the front and a place to take photos. It turned out to be quite the roller coaster of emotions deciding what to order. I blame it on the extensive menu + long line + low blood sugar. Luckily a staff member started passing out free onion rings. It lifted our spirits and helped us finalize our order (it also convinced us to add onion rings). We made it to the counter after an hour. I ordered the full rack of baby back ribs with sides, one beef rib, and a small onion rings to share with one other person. It cost around $30 and was more than enough food. Everything was delicious! Both the pork and beef were very tender and flavorful. I wish they had a variety of bbq sauce, like sweet or spicy, etc but theirs is decent. For the sides I liked the fries because they reminded me of the ones at In N Out, and splurging on the onion rings was the right thing to do.

Best ribs I've ever had in southern Cali. This place would give Sandra Dee's, up here in Sacramento,a run for her money. No kidding! A visit down to San Diego, my friends decided to take me to this place for dinner. When we arrived there was a line wrapped around the side of the restaurant. But my friends reassured me it'll be worth it. This line was really long and it definitely wasn't going as fast as I expected. As we came closer to the register to order our food. I noticed people walking by me with their orders. Me being very hungry because of the wait. One look at those ribs and pulled pork sandwiches passing by me with its strong barbecue aroma, I nearly passed out because of hunger and anticipation for what I foresee to be was an epic meal. This place definitely did not disappoint. After picking up my order that included those ribs, a drink and a side of fries with baked beans. I skipped out on getting my drink first and simply had to take a bite out of the ribs. It was a bite of heaven. You know the ribs are great when the meat simply falls right off the bone. The meat on these ribs were tender and moist and it definitely fell off the bone. The sauce on the ribs were medium spicy, tangy, sweet and a little kick of hotness. Some of my friends had different orders like the barbecue chicken and pulled pork. You know when you're absolutely stuffed beyond belief and when you are, you just can't look at food the same way as when you were hungry? Well after being stuffed with all that rib and taking a look at my friend's order. It seriously got me wanting to try more. Good  thing I don't live in San Diego or else there will be a scarce of Phil's BBQ. Maybe I was just crazy hungry and "anything" I eat would have been good. Either way, I'm glad "anything" was Phil's BBQ. I'm excited for another trip to San Diego. And honestly, it's mainly to eat here again.

What can I write that hasn't been already written? I'd give it 5 stars but hate to wait in line..especially for 2 hours.  I will give them props for bringing out water and lemonade and cookies for those in line. As for the food, it's absolutely delish.  The sauce is tangy and the ribs cooked just right.   Portions are huge so go with the 1/2 rack unless you're really hungry because the sides will fill you up.  Definitely a must eat in San Diego.

Love this place, but I am not a big fan of waiting in line, so I strategically plan my trip and try to get there when they open. I must say, the line does go by fast! I have tried getting the food to go, but it's way better to eat your food there. Love the ribs and onion rings!

The onion rings are amazing. The line kinda sucks. Go with friends that you enjoy talking to/hanging out with. The ribs are decent. If you like the sauce, then you'll like the ribs...if you don't, you won't. I don't crave Phil's, but I definitely like it. The ribs are easy to eat because the meat just falls right off the bone :) I DO crave my dad's BBQ cooking, but then again...that's a different story.

Phil's BBQ is a legend in this area and for good reason. With that popularity comes high demand and an equally long line whenever I've gone, but I'm told it is possible to avoid the wait with proper timing and a little luck. I would insist on getting the ribs to make your outing worthwhile. I've tried both the beef and baby back ribs but I prefer the beef. Both exhibit that cliched but literal "fall off the bone" presentation and are smothered in their signature sauce. It's hard to impress with fries these days, but Phil's are excellent and remind me of a thicker-cut In-N-Out style fry. If you ask me, they're even better if you add the hot sauce on their tables. Not only is Phil's good, but it's surprisingly affordable. I can get a good sized platter of  their top-notch food for $15. Phil's BBQ is a must-try for anyone looking for some good eats in San Diego.

Probably the best damn bbq ribs I ever had.   I went on the weekend of Comic-Con. I had to wait 2 hours in line to eat but I must say it's worth the wait. I tried to go the previous year but I did not want to wait in line but this time I wasn't going to leave without trying this place. By the time we got to the front of the line I thought the place would have closed but we had another hour  before the place closed. If you are a first timer they give you a sticker of a pig. I ordered the half rib dinner with macaroni salad and french fries. I could not finish it but it was so delicious. Took it back to my hotel and let my friend finish the rest since he passed out and didn't go with us there. My friend ordered the El Toro and he thought it was hot but it wasn't. This is the must place to go when your in San Diego. nuff said!

I thought Phil's BBQ was... really overrated. I've had good BBQ in other places too. To me, the food was not really worth the wait... The macaroni salad was a meh, the ribs were just.. average. I'll go again.. if I don't have to wait in line.

I was born and raised in Texas so I know my BBQ. The only reason this place is popular is because it is in San Diego, which lets face it, is not known for its BBQ. Seafood and Beach-Mex maybe but definitely not BBQ. If this place was in a competitive market it wouldn't last the night. First off the BBQ sauce is a thick overpowering goop that masks the flavors of the meat. It tastes like a mix of cheap ketchup and olive oil with flour added to thicken it up. The disturbing part is they drown everything you order in it and when you ask to get it on the side the staff looks at you like you just called them a jerk. If your meat is seasoned and cooked right then you should serve the meat with the sauce on the side ALWAYS, and let people enjoy the flavors of the meat, not your pathetic sauce. If they like your goop then they can always add it on later.   Next off the wait/bar staff  is socially awkward and this has a lot to do with managerial pressure and unreasonable policies that get shoved down their throat. They try to do a good job but you can tell they are not given enough freedom to relax and enjoy their work. This place is not worth the wait and not worth your time. Good BBQ is worth traveling to get and once you taste the real stuff you will understand why Phil's BBQ is weak in comparison.

By far the best BBQ ever! I drive all the way down from LA just for Phil's. So worth it! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The meat just falls off the bone, and the BBQ sauce is perfect! The prices are very reasonable as well. I typically order: Full Rib Dinner (10 to 12 Bones) $19.95 Full Beef Rib Dinner (5 Bones) $19.95 Each rib dinner includes 2 small sides or 1 large side. The onion rings are huge! Beans are very tasty. There are also sandwiches. The BBQ Broham is bomb! Along with the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and deli-cut sammy.

Came here base on the reviews . Let me just warn you in case you are in a hurry , plan on waiting at least an hour. The lines usually wrapped around the corner . My husband loves BBQ , he sacrifice Ribb Fest to come here on our end of summer vaca and so I want to take him here. After the long anticipated waited , it wasn't all that . I gave it 3 star only for the beef ribs .everything else was not worth writing about.

Ribs, corn, fries, yum! This place may not be the best bbq restaurant in the world, but it's definitely high up on my list. Their meat is never dry. Yes, the lines are ridiculously long every night, but they make it up by passing around free fries while you wait. It's a shame they're only in SD but when I do go, phil's never disappoints.

Great food, at some occasions bad service.  I recently eat at the NEW Santee location and was seated by the bar.  Waitress completely ignored many of my request, but was thoughtful enough to not charge me for an item. Gave 4 stars rather than 3 due to the due diligence. Other than that, great place to eat at!

Phil's BBQ was just okay. Now before you start throwing BBQ sauce at me and calling me crazy, I'd just like to say that while I can see why people like this place, people just overhype the food way too much. Upon arrival, we were not too surprised to see that the line had extended way past the entrance of the restaurant, and looked more like a line to a Six Flag's roller coaster ride rather than to a BBQ joint. The staff was totally cool, and were passing out free samples of their famous onion rings, which was a great way to keep the hungry people in line happy. I wish I could gush over the food like most people here, but to be honest, I didn't fall in love at first bite. The baby back ribs were tender, but there were some pieces that were sort of dry and grainy. The sauce was pretty tasty--sweet and tangy, just the way I like it. But as for the actual meat, it was fall-off-the-bone but I had a hard time finishing up certain pieces. For my side dishes, I also got the macaroni salad and the corn. Sorry to say, but I liked the sides better than the actual ribs. The macaroni salad was small, but it was delicious and refreshing. The corn was sweet, but tasted even better after I brushed on some butter and sprinkled on some cajun seasoning. You can thank me for the suggestion next time you try this! Even though you'll most likely be met with long lines every time you come here, the line has a tendency to move fast, and there is plenty of room to accomodate all the famished patrons. I don't know if this would be my first choice of restaurants to dine at next time I visit SD, but if I'm ever craving BBQ, I'd give this place another shot.

Not much more to add here that hasn't been said. Took advice and got it to go.  Restaurant felt too much like an amusement park. Staff VERY friendly. We got the baby backs and it was indeed falling off the bone. My only complaint was the sauce was way to sweet and took away from any smoke flavor of the ribs.

We went to Phil's BBQ for the very first time on a Saturday around 5pm. We waited in line for about 40 minutes. I guess that's not too bad according to other reviews. Pulled pork sandwich - 3 stars The meat was a bit dry although it was slathered in a lot of BBQ sauce. Don't get me wrong - Phil's BBQ sauce tastes great, but it was just too much and therefore too salty. El Toro (tri-tip) beef sandwich - 4 stars The tri tip was cooked and sliced perfectly. But again, it was too salty because of too much BBQ sauce. Baby back ribs with 2 sides - 4 stars I really wanted to give a 5-star rating for this. However, both slabs of the baby back ribs were burnt. The surface turned black and had the bitter taste. Sigh~ We like the mac and cheese and baked beans. The cole slaw and french fries were mediocre. Onion rings - 5 stars They are huge and very very crispy! The prices were very reasonable considering the huge portions of everything we ordered.

I'm a Texan who prefers my bbq to be made out of a cow and preferably in sandwich form, so I got the el Toro tri  tip sandwich and I was not disappointed.  I also like a lot of bbq sauce and was worried that a California bbq restaurant may not be as into drenching everything in sauce as I am, but the amount of sauce on the sandwich was perfect.

While researching places to eat in San Diego Phil's BBQ always seems to be the first thing to pop up so how could I not try a place with over 4000 reviews?  Obviously Phil's is doing something right if people will wait for hours for a plate of BBQ.   I went on a Tuesday night before 6PM based on all the warnings of long lines after 6PM and there was already a line out the door.  The food looked promising as my friend and I were staring jealously at all the people eating their BBQ.  After about a 30 minute wait we got to the front of the line and we each ordered a full rack of baby back ribs with two sides each, onion rings, and a couple of sodas which came out to about 55 bucks.  They give you a little buzzer when your food is ready and you find your own seats which is easy to do.  Everything is self serve from drinks to getting your own leftover boxes and bags.  They have their system down to a tee which is great especially for a place that is so busy.  Within five minutes of sitting down, our food was ready. As soon as I saw my friend bringing over two huge pizza pan trays of food I knew we ordered too much.  We both got greedy due to hunger and one rack of ribs is definitely enough for two people.  The ribs were definitely tender but I did not like the sauce.  It was too tangy for me, I'm more of a sweet and spicy kind of a gal.  I got coleslaw and macaroni salad as my sides which were good as were the jumbo onion rings.  We ordered the small onion rings which was a pretty large portion, I'm scared to see what large looks like.  I kind of feel like the place was a bit hyped for me but then again bbq sauce is based on personal taste preference.  Also keep in mind California is not the mecca of great bbq so this is probably the best bbq we can get here in so Cal.  Your only other option here may be Chili's or another chain restaurant. Based on the food I would say 3.5 but I'm bumping it to a 4 since it was a nice experience for my first time at Phil's.

HELPFUL HINT: If you can get it to go and eat it somewhere else, I highly recommend it!! I stood in line for about 20 minutes when I said eff it, I walked up to the phone order/to-go line and placed an order and my food was ready in less than 10 minutes. I took my food and just went across the street and enjoyed it at the food court with my girlfriends. Of course I could go on about the flavor of their delicious food and what not, but my review will be much like everyone else's. Therefore my best advice is, if you can avoid dining in, take it to go!

Best BBQ of my life!  The baby back ribs and onion rings are definite musts!  Their baby back ribs are oh so tender and not too sweet.  The seasoning is just right, and the meat just falls off the bone so nicely!  I love!  Also loved their macaroni salad and potato salad.  Their big combo has the perfect portion for sharing with another person if you want to save a bit of money. One thing I didn't like was how the place has a banner that is so big it's in your face and you can't miss it.  It exclaims that it's on Yelp's top ten list of places to eat.  That's a wonderful achievement, and good for you, but you don't have to put that out there so much.  I've been to other restaurants that were on the list, and that were ranked above Phil's.  None of them made it known they had made it to the top ten list.  This is just a little thing I noticed probably because I was waiting in line.  It's not going to stop me from coming here. Quite a bit of a wait, but well worth it, and the wait helped build up my appetite.  Phil's BBQ is for sure on my list of mandatory stops in San Diego.

Without doubt some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Been here a few times when I was in San Diego and the spare ribs are to die for. Absolutely perfectly cooked to tender perfection with the right amount of smoky flavor, a nice crust on the outside and very moist and juicy inside. That BBQ sauce leaves smothered all over the ribs leaves you feeling like you are in heaven.  The colossal onion rings are a good side but I'd suggest splitting them with someone as the portions are huge. The beef rib is also mind-blowing and definitely worth trying if you like them.

TERRIBLE. They let solicitors harrass you in the line (which is also always ridiculously long). And these solicitors aren't even trying to steal your money for a good cause. Arts for the youth. Seriously? We have kids starving all over the world and they consider this a "good cause.". Anyway the food is good, but it no way worth the 45 minute wait and greasy salesmen trying to steal your money. Shame on you Phil's, and no I'm not going to "talk to one of our BBQrew before leaving a review" so you can try and control what's supposed to be a honest place of discussion. My friend has a policy to never wait in line for food to then wait for food, and she's definitely right with respect to this place.

This is our 3rd year here in San Diego.  Finding good BBQ has been hard.  Abbey's BBQ = a joke.  I have heard great things about Phil's.  Finally had a chance to go last week.  Fully expecting a long wait so the hour wait didn't bother us at all.  The place offers a lot of glitz and glamour while you wait, a camera to take your photos, it can be email to you, lots of tv stimulation about its BBQ and a lot of other stuff to keep a newcomer busy while walking through the line.  Finally it was our turn to order... What????!!!!!  No BRISKET?????  Brisket is one of the main meats in a true BBQ place.   Very disappointed with NO BRISKET, we ended up ordering two full racks of baby back ribs and 3 pulled pork sandwiches, fries, bean, large onion rings and drinks. Baby back ribs = awesome! Onion rings = awesome! Fries = good! Beans = good! Pulled pork sandwich (they call it BBQ Broham) = DISAPPOINTING. Why?  The pulled pork was drenched in their BBQ sauce which was good but its the BBQ sauce that kept it moist.  I was able to have some of the pulled pork from my sandwich WITHOUT the BBQ sauce on it. Results, the actual pulled pork meat was VERY DRY, TOUGH and FLAVORLESS.  The buns they used for the sandwich was hard to chew unless it was drenched in the BBQ sauce.  Buns for the pulled pork sandwiches should be easy to chew in order to enjoy the sandwich regardless of how much, how little or NO bbq sauce. I asked them why they didn't have BRISKET to 2 different people at the Phil's, one was the cashier when I ordered and the other person was a person that goes from table to table asking how things were.  Both Phil's staff gave me the same answer.  their identical answers were: "IT TAKE TOO LONG TO MAKE BRISKET".  What a crappy answer, an answer I wasn't expecting from a BBQ place.  "LOW AND SLOW" is one of the KEY to a good BBQ.  I make a killer Pulled Pork Sandwich and Brisket at home myself using the LOW AND SLOW practice. Phil's BBQ need to invest in the true BBQ philosophy rather than decorating their restaurant with all the flat panel tvs and other attention getters in order to truly refine their BBQ. Another thing, Phill's BBQ credit card receipts asks you for a TIP at the register.  There is NO TABLE SERVICE AT ALL.  YOU PICK UP YOUR OWN FOOD, YOU GET YOUR OWN DRINKS.  THE ONLY THING YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IS TO BUS YOUR OWN TABLE.  I asked the cashier what's the difference of tipping here at the cashier, he said if you tip here, it goes to everyone, if you tip at the table it ALL goes to the bussers.  My total bill was $65 for a family of 4, tipping $10 was hard to swallow after knowing that you basically do everything yourself. They have a sign that wants you to let them know before you YELP!  Its because they do not want bad reviews on them.  Why didn't I talk to them about my horrible pulled pork sandwiches and etc...?  It was my daughter's restaurant of choice for her birthday and I was not going to do anything that would anyway lead my daughter to think that we are all anything but happy with our food.  My daughter comes first.  Regardless of what Phil's could have done to remedy the issues, it would not change the dry pulled pork sandwiches and etc... Phil's BBQ = OVER RATED!

I love Phil's!!!! Whenever I'm in SD this is the place I go. The BBQ sauce is a bit much so I usually get in on the side and dip my meat in there. I don't like it when my sauce consumes my sides. :) But the meat if very tender and flavorful. The portion is large and you get your money's worth. I'm in love with their onion rings. They're huge and when you bite into one you get a good amount of onion and batter. It is really good and they're not too doughy or  too much onion. I really like coleslaw and the macaroni salad as my sides. I usually take people to Phil's when they visit SD.

With over 4000 reviews, I hesitated before writing this because I know Phil's really doesn't need another review. Call me a BBQ snob, but I wanted to speak my mind. Although the general consensus seems to be that this is the greatest BBQ place of all time, Phil's BBQ gave me mixed feelings.   - I loved the smoky flavor of the baby back ribs, but I didn't love the sauce. - I enjoyed the fun atmosphere and great service, but it felt a bit commercialized for my taste. - I drooled over the onion rings, but was unimpressed by the macaroni and potato salads. - I appreciated the rib meat that fell easily of the bone, but the tri-tip in the tri-tip sandwich was dry and boring. - I'm no mathematician but BBQ + Beer = Delicious, but at Phil's, you cannot order your beer with your BBQ. You have to go outside and purchase your alcoholic beverage at a separate cart. Although I had a really enjoyable time at Phil's, the food didn't impress me enough for me to go back and wait an hour for dinner. The sauce was too tangy for my taste, sides were just okay, and what, no mac and cheese?!  I still give it a solid four stars because it's a great environment to enjoy a meal and a very pleasant experience.  It's always wonderful to share in a meal of BBQ, dig your fingers into something saucy, and laugh while everybody gets sauce all over their faces. Conclusion:  Do I think it's jaw dropping fantastic BBQ? No. But if you have the time to wait and are in the mood for BBQ in San Diego, I think Phil's is a great choice.

I actually wanted to go here but I never had the time and very few business to be in San Diego. Well I happen to be here one day! and the place was filled with people already at 11:30 am!! I was pretty excited because of the fact that they make the best BBQ/ ribs in San Diego! At first I thought it was just a hype from all the ratings from yelp but I actually enjoyed here! Order was fast! Food was great and some part of the ribs were burnt but when I asked to be changed it was no problemo!

Wow, I really love Phil's BBQ. It's awesome if you can manage to get your party or date a seat. There is usually a long line during peak lunch and dinner hours however, you can usually avoid this by going on their website and checking out the cameras that show how long the line is! haha... one time, my family from Germany saw me on the camera from overseas. Thank you internet!!! The staff is excellent so much props to you. When we were ready to eat, I was fascinated by... ma meal. :} I ordered the 5 full ribs with all fries baby. This is what real BBQ tastes like, I am not into Lucille's sweet style BBQ at all. I'll be back for your ribs Phils!!!

FOOD *got a combo of baby back and beefy ribs -- the baby backs were good, though a little more spicy/tangy, and the beefy ribs were DANG GOOD (and HUGE) with the riiightttt sauce. *sweet baked beans: yum! *cole slaw: yum! not too saucy, which i liked *corn on the cob: OMG SO GOOD Wasn't crazy enough to wait in line, but the to go was SO FAST. Like, amazing. I'm not sure if there's a really good reason to wait in a line for 2+ hours for a meal (despite the fact that the food is really good)... so we'll probably go back, but To Go it forever. and ever. and ever. Random note: our GPS (google maps/bing maps) pointed us to the other side of the street... doh. YAY PHILS!

Are you kidding me, Phil's?! I'll be sitting in my office typing away like a good little worker monkey when I find myself fantasizing about their pork ribs slathered in that mouth-watering BBQ sauce. That's when I have to hold back the tears because I'm MILES away from this amazing establishment. If you haven't gone, seriously... SERIOUSLY: go!

4.5 stars and over 3800 reviews...you do the math! I'm not one to enjoy waiting for anything, but it's BBQ baby back ribs and it's 4.5 stars out of over 3800 reviews!!!! Top ten in America!! After weighting the pros and cons of waiting, from one foodie to another, you just know you must be crazy to pass up this opportunity!!! I waited. 1 hour and 15 minutes long. That's a lot better than their usual 2 hour wait. The line wrapped around the restaurant! It must be that good right? We were starving after a long day at Seaworld, but we had to have food that was going to put that cherry on top of our perfect day. And a cherry on top this place was! I'll cut to the chase because with all these reviews telling you the same thing I'm going to tell you, then you gotta convince yourself to check it out after the 4th review you've read. Dinner for two: $30.00-Get the full rack with the two sides and add their famous onion rings on the side. Small size. That should be MORE than enough for two if your appetite isn't huge. If its not enough, ask the awesomely nice waiters if you can order extra. They'll let you order again without having to stand outside in the long line again. All I can say is it was AMAZING! The ribs were tender and just separated from the bone just as easy as a one night stand. It was sinfully delicious, and if I could, I'd get it pregnant or sew my rear end shut so we'd never part. (I ordered another full rack to take home since I couldn't do either one of those options)

Phil's BBQ is amazing!. The meat is always so tender and so flavorful. Be prepared to wait atleast an hour plus in line if you go in the evening or on weekends. It is well worth it. The portions are pretty large and the prices are very affordable. I highly recommend the BBQ broham sandwich. Ummm...my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Definitely stop by and check it out if you havn't already

Beef Ribs - hands down the best I have ever had.  Even bought their rub and bbq sauce to take home.  We went mid-week and it was an hour wait at 6:30 PM, but it was well worth the wait. We also got the baby backs and the onion rings.  What more can I say that the others have not here.  If you are in SD, go to one of their locations!  You will not regret it.

Ah Phil's, always a guarentee of long lines and awesome food. After moving back to LA, I realize how much I miss this place. Sure there's Lucilles, and other small shop bbq joints, but none compare to Phil's. I even went hunting for bomb bbq in New Orleans, MS, and the south lookin for authentic bbq and ol' Phil's of San Diego is STILL my fave spot! (I'm also a junkie for things that are hard to get, limited edition, etc so the long lines might add to my obsession for this spot!) But yeah, the food is always awesome, and well worth the price for bbq. I try to make a return trip to San Diego for the weekend and make a visit to Phil's the highlight of the weekend. Advice: Def go to this Phil's vs the San Marcos if you can. I heard the food's better and not too far away. And get the food to go if you don't want to wait. You don't get the vibe or the awesome buzzer that makes you jump out of your seat and dart to the pick up counter, but it's an option. Tickler + the broham sandwich is the perfect combo since you get a little of everything, and I always leave with leftovers good for another meal. Do it.

I've been to plenty of BBQ all over the US and this is really the best I can recall. The sauce is incredible. Babybacks are no-brainer melt off the bone. Beef ribs are also very tender and meaty. Pulled pork is the best I've ever had. Awesome baked beans. We went at 5:15 on a Wed and there was already a small line. By 6PM the line was out the door, down the front of the restaurant and halfway down the side. I can tell you though, it's worth the wait. Everyone there has a smile, very friendly and helpful. They appreciate their Yelpers there and take service seriously. So go eat and be happy. Really you'll love it!

Right when we opened our car doors, we could smell the BBQ goodness. I'm NOT a big BBQ fan, but I had to try it out. They've been a yelp and twitter best. When you walk in you stand in line and are greeted by a host, who then sends you to a counter. At the counter, you order your food and get a pager. It's self seating, but luckily we came in on a Wednesday after the lunch rush. You get paged, pick up your food and chow down. We ended up getting the ribs, onion rings and potato salad. Like I said earlier, I'm not a BBQ fan ... Why?! Cause I'm very picky about BBQ sauce. The sauce at Phil's is a different treat. Not too tangy, not too sweet, just right. And the sauce wasn't just dumped all over the ribs, so the clean up wasn't bad. Overall, it's a place that you must try at least once. If you're a BBQ lover, you'll appreciate this place. The price for the quality and amount of food is decent, not overpriced. And if you don't like it, Valley View is next door and I heard they have a great lobster buffet.

I was SOOOO EXCITED TO COME HERE AFTER HEARING HOW AWESOME PHILS IS! But was pretty disappointed. This place is aite. Famous Dave's BBQ in Norcal is equally delicious if not better. The fries were ok and the baby back ribs did not really impress me/were sort of dry. Don't think I'll want to visit this place when I go to Socal anymore :(

Phil's BBQ did not disappoint!!! It's set up cafeteria-style but don't let that fool you in to thinking you'll have a sub-par dining experience. The Food: 5 stars -Beefy ribs were my favorite. Each bone had so much meat on it. Every bite was amazing. -Baby back ribs were tangy and tender. -Chicken was surprisingly delicious and juicy (and I don't even like chicken) -I read a review to skip the Sides, so I did with the exception of Onion Rings. -Onion Rings were cooked to perfection. There's an art to frying and if the oil is not hot enough, your food turns out soggy. These onion rings were not greasy at all! They were tasty and had the right amount of batter.  (Side note: the smaller portion is still pretty big...about 6-7 large rings) -Portions are HUGE!!!! -Best BBQ I've ever had!!! The Customer Service: 5 stars -While you're waiting in line outside, there's a greeter who welcomes you and offers a little small talk. If you say it's your first time there, they put a cute little pig sticker on you. I'm assuming this is to help employees identify first-time customers (maybe to offer extra-attentive service). I can appreciate this attention to detail because an excellent dining experience equals returning customers. Kudos to whoever put this in to place. -The dining experience while you eat your food is also amazing. No matter how busy the employees are behind the counter, they have some kind of sixth sense to know if a plate needs to be cleared off the table. There are also a few people with big friendly smiles who come around to make sure you're doing ok. -The best thing I witnessed was an employee behind the counter who approached the table next to me. He asked if they were still waiting for their food. He took their pager so he could look for their order. He immediately brought the food to their table and everyone was happy. I was so impressed by his attentiveness and that he brought the food to them when the customer is supposed to pick up their order at the counter. Quality control is on point and this place runs efficiently! You will have a great experience and your stomach will be more than satisfied!!!

Visited this place on my way to check out Comic Con.  Friends said its suppose to be one of the top 10 places for BBQ in America.  So I thought we might as well give it a shot since we were around the area. This place did not disappoint.  The baby back ribs were amazing.  Sweet and tangy and also meat so soft it falls off the bone.  You must get the onion rings as it is off the chain good.  The onions rings here put other places onion rings to shame.  I also had the El Toro sandwich which is a deli sliced trip tip with bbq sauce.  The pulled pork sandwich was also very delicious.  Yes I ate all that.  I was stuck in traffic for 4.5 hours and was starving all the way through traffic for this so I might as well make the most of it.   The parking lot is huge.  Just be sure to park on the side where the plaza is at not where the main Phil's parking is located.  that parking lot was full when I arrived.  There was a line when I was there, but the wait was about 45 min and it was worth every minute. Thank you Mr Phil, I do look forward to future bbq meetings with you!

Visiting San Diego this place was unknown to me, but like my father who is an avid Yelper- this many good reviews can't be wrong-right?! First off the line was around the building. I like BBQ all right but an hour or more wait to eat some ribs? Maybe I am just impatient. By the time we got around to the "picture booth" which was not working I was just agitated. Once we ordered, sat, and got our food things went smoothly. The staff is super friendly. The food-meh. It was good, it was hot, would I wait another hour to eat here on another day knowing what I know now? No. I would order to go and pick it up next time but it certainly did not warrant the wait. I don't think it was as good as everyone says. Portions were great, but it's just BBQ people.

The chicken sandwich is always on point, according to my bf.  He says the secret it to let the bun soak in the bbq for 10 to 15 minutes and then pouring bbq sauce all over the rest of the chicken sandwich.  Then eating eat!  I don't know which he likes more making a mess while eating it or the deliciousness of Phil's!! We freaking LOOOOOOVE ribs and will only eat them at Phil's!! Once you go Phil's, you never go back!!

If you're looking for some ribs to dirty your hands on, Phil's is the place to go! If you want to dine in, I recommend going there 20 minutes before opening time because there will ALWAYS be a long snaking line around the buildings for the rest of the day. If you're lucky, you'll only have to wait for ~25min. While you're in line, you should figure out what you want to order already. Once you're in, the process is pretty fast and simple. You go up, order, pay, get a buzzer, find a seat, and wait for your buzzer to go off. I've tried the Award Winning Ribs and Beefy Ribs and they were both delectable! I've also tried the pulled pork sandwich when it was catered to UCSD. The meat is always tender and juicy and the sauce is amazing. Their potato salad and macaroni salads are a good complement to all the saltiness of the ribs so I recommend one of those with probably fries or corn as the second choice. The beans are meh. Definitely a place you have to try but not a place you'd want to frequent if you're watching out for your weight and health! Also, I'd recommend splitting a full rack with someone rather than getting 6 ribs yourself (if that's what you were planning on getting)...it's the same thing and it'll save you some money!

Very good. Expect to wait if you want to eat in. I call ahead and take it home, or sit at the bar. If you don't like the style of sauce, that's just the beauty of BBQ variety. I o personally enjoy the sauce, so I think it's a great place. One Broham is two meal for me, especially if I get the rings on the side. Ribs are terrific and fall off the bone. If they had not moved to the Sports Arena Blvd. spot  (farther) from the original Goldfinch St. location I'd be 25 pounds heavier, but probably also happier. And lastly, we know you think that it's not as good as Place X in your Hometown Y, but hey, it's pretty damn good and we live in SD, not West Texas or Kansas City. I will stand by the BBQ at Phil's all damn day. Enjoy!

Location - The line to get in could be better but moves pretty quick. Wished parking was better though. Food - Baby back ribs, on point! No more Tony Roma's for me. Side dishes?

But we have no hesitations to call in a order and go pick it up, it's always ready in less than 10 minutes. Really love the chickless dinner too, bottom line is their sauce - yum!!!! Also favs are their fresh steamed veggies, corn on the cob & their onion rings!!!! Highly recommend this place!!

Big shout out to Alfredo for excellent service and making my first time at Phil's with my roommate a memorable experience! Besides the great service I received, I had no trouble finding parking in their private lot, and the line for that day was surprisingly short! I came around 12pm, and the wait only took around 20 minutes. Turned out there was a fair or carnival going on nearby(: I was set on getting the baby back rib having heard great reviews from my friends. I ended up with the baby back rib tickler, which includes 3 bones, 2 onion rings, cole slaw, and fries. The portions were generous, especially with the amount of fries! The ribs were meaty, moist, juicy, and came right off the bone! The bbq sauce for the ribs was not overly sweet or salty, right on point. Also, the ribs had a charred smoky flavor which I really enjoyed. The cole slaw was fresh and light on the dressing. The onion rings were giant, crunchy, but a bit oily and heavy. The fries were average. I also got to try some macaroni salad from my friend, and that was my favorite side out of the 4. I would definitely come back again!

I came to this restaurant during my trip to San Diego. I thought this place was mediocre and a bit overrated. I stood in line for a good 30 minutes; which was anticipated from hearsay. We were served free samples of onion rings while standing in line - kudos for that. I tried their ribs and it didn't have that 'smokey' taste that I expected.  I couldn't tell if the ribs were actually smoked in the smoker because frankly they tasted baked. The side dishes were good - cole slaw and corn.   I definitely had better ribs at a famous rib joint in Sacramento called Lucille's. Nobody can compare to the succulent and flavorful ribs there!

Drove almost 2 hours from Orange County just to try this place. I've previously tried the Phils at San Marcos and didn't like it much but gave this one a try. Pros - Get a full rack of ribs, the meat is pretty tasty - Get Onion Rings - The fries are good because they are not salty! Cons - The wait can be 40 minutes or longer - Not that big of a fan of the Phils sauce on the ribs, it's a bit too sweet for my taste

I've been putting off this review for one reason... how does one even begin to articulate the deliciousness that is none other than Phil's BBQ? It's one of those rare dining experiences where one does not even need to think twice about whether it lives up to the hype, and trust, there's plenty of hype. The first thing you'll notice is the ridiculously long line that follows along outside the building. Expect this at almost any hour; I came here one weekend just as it opened and there was already a line before me. For my first time, I dined in, so it was roughly an hour's wait before we got inside (regardless, worth the wait). Cut the time by calling in. I ordered the baby back ribs, which comes with about 10-12 bones and two choices of sides. The ribs are amazing! I honestly order them every time. The meat is incredibly tender and combined with the generous coat of their tangy sauce, it's the perfect filler. The onion rings are crispy and by no means just any kind of onion ring you've seen before -- they're huge! Delicious. This place is always packed, but there's a lot of seating indoors as well as the patio to accommodate for their many customers. There's a bustling and busy atmosphere to it, but the servers are definitely attentive! It's plain to see why Phil's has so many people at every hour of the day. Will be back.. plenty of times.

I know this seems pretty sketchy since it's my first review, but hear me out.   I've been to this place twice. The first time, we got there around 6pm and didn't start eating until around 8pm. The food was good, but I don't know if it was worth the wait. If it were just for that time, I'd give it 4 stars. But this time I got take out...and they forgot my onion rings! Now normally I wouldn't dock a star for forgetting an item, because honestly, shit happens. but seriously? my onion rings?! The girl even asked if I wanted extra ranch for my onion rings. What onion rings?! Moral of the story - always check your order before you leave.

Some of the staffs randomly walk in to the line, greet, and check on the customers. When you reach the point where it says "Approximate wait time from this point is 21 minutes & 14 seconds", expect to wait longer than that. I still wonder why 14 seconds? If you go with a party of equal or greater than 5, it is highly likely you are able to get a table as soon as you pass that "21 minutes & 14 seconds" point. If you go with just another person, after you order at the counter, you need to wait for another 10-15 minutes or so. So big group gets the priority here!

GORDON BOMBAY!!! yea this bbq was BOMB! saw it on tv, travel channel's best sandwich in america, heard great things, read all the great reviews, added it to the list of must-do on our san diego labor day weekend trip from PHX. got there around 430pm on sunday. One of the best smelling parking lots i've ever been in, LOL. you can smell the smoke and aroma down the block as you come rolling up. The line for a table was out the door wrapped around the building. Was getting more hungry smelling it and standing there waiting that we couldnt handle it and changed our minds and jumped into the to-go line. we tried the 'broham' pulled pork sandwich, the famous 'el toro' bbq tri tip sandwich, onion rings, and macaroni salad. had a feeling i would like the bbq sauce so i bought a bottle of it with the order. El Toro was everything i hoped for, the broham was everything u can ask for in pulled pork, both meats had great smoke flavor, but not over powering, love the amount of sauce on the tri tip, usually a dry cut of meat, but not this one. almost like a sloppy joe, sliced bbq steak sandwich if you will, sooo good. small order of onion rings were a huge portion, super crispy exterior, macaroni salad a very good flavor. both sandwiches we huge piles of meat, pleanty filling. Some of the best BBQ ive had. kinda wished the line was shorter or wasnt as hungry as i was when we first got there, woulve liked to sit inside and have a cold one with the grub, but looks like i'll just have to go back again.

more than 4000 reviews with 4.5 stars? i gotta try! see, being a yelp addict that i am, i base my decisions solely upon other people's taste and judgement. sometimes that leads me down the right path, sometimes it doesn't. and Phil's BBQ is sadly one of the many disappointments. when i saw how long the line was, i freaked a little. but considering the long distance we traveled to get there, we toughed it out and got in line anyway. wasn't so bad, i'd say. took us approx 20 mins to get to the ordering station. Settled with the baby back ribs and even though i was very hungry, i didn't find it too appetizing. They drenched the meat with sauce, and the sauce was a bit too tangy for my taste. Usually when i eat ribs, i would always have a small bowl of extra sauce and chili on the side, but it wasn't necessary here.. and that spoke volume, bkus i LOVE bbq sauces. Not to mention, the meat itself wasn't fall-off-the-bone tender like a lot of people mentioned, why you lied to me????? well, at least i can finally say i've tried Phil's BBQ and it didn't knock my socks off. But i don't regret the overall experience bkus i got the newbie sticker that's so adorable and it's now on my purse going everywhere with me hehe

The sauce is simply amazing. I love how the ribs just fall off the bone. I think the chicken could be a little juicier. Also, while the potato salad was delicious and the fries were pretty damn good, the mac salad was kinda tasteless. Cole slaw was alright though. This place, while the wait for food is pretty long, is totally worth it for the delicious bbq. Cheap too if you can get a lot of people to come.

I've been to Phil's bbq at least 5 times, so I can't believe I never review them. Oh well.. First couple of times going there, I've always ordered the best of two, starting with beefy rib and chicken, beefy rib and chick-less, baby back ribs with chicken and chickless. On those four occasion, I have to say that the chicken and chick-less meat are quite ordinary. Nothing special with them other than if you just dump a lot of bbq sauce there. Beefy rib is good, but I still prefer the texture and taste of the baby back ribs. BBQ sauces are as amazing and tasty as always, and the onion ring is very good. On all occasions, I've got to wait in line at least 20-40 minutes, but the wait is worth it because I've had a great time hanging out and eating with friends. My last visit to Phil's was about a week ago, and it's as packed as it's always been. However, I kinda want to try something new from the menu, so I ordered the baby back Tickle and the BBQ Broham (basicaly pulled pork BBQ). I want to say that both foods are a good deal for what I actually got. For the tickler, I got pretty much 3 baby back ribs, 2 onions rings, fries, and coleslaw for just $7, and the Broham is about the same price with a freaking large amount of pulled pork on top of a bun with another bun aside from it. That pulled pork is very good, but remember to ask for an extra BBQ sauce coz I will need it to devour all those pulled porks. Anyway, the food's as good as I can remember, and will most definitely come back next time

Crazy long line with smiles, it must be good to go. The line was wrapped around the building (if you were waiting to eat inside). The to go line wasn't that long. We waited roughly 30 minutes from the time we walked in until we had our order in hand. I must admit the food was well worth the wait. As the other reviews said the ribs are fall off the bone perfect. The sauce is sweet with just enough bite you make you lick your fingers. The chicken was tender and juicy and pulled pork sandwich was unbelievably delicious. All I can say is YELP strikes again. The staff were super friendly despite how busy they were. Here's the five star factor the one thing that pushed them over the top ( besides how delicious the woopies were). The manager came out and greeted the party I was with and held a conversation with us. That's one of those rare things that just doesn't happen these days. You usually only run into a manager when there's a problem, but not here.

ONE WORD -- LEGIT!!!! Ever since I've been back from SD, I can't stop thinking about Phil's because there's really no other place that can compare in LA. Because there's not a single complaint on my end (there was no wait because we arrived moments before the lunch rush hit!), Phil's get a shiny star from me for being top-notch at its price. I had the half chicken meal with 2 small sides (or you could opt for 1 large side) for less than $10 after taxes. The meat was tender and the flavoring was perfect (not too sweet, not too tangy). Small sides include fries, baked beans, cole slaw, potato salad, macaroni salad. Large sides included baked potato, corn-on-the-cob, veggies, and larger portions of the small sides. Since my friend ordered a potato salad and fries, I had the fries and macaroni salad. They aren't lying when they said the sides were small, but they complimented the chicken VERY well. I couldn't stop stabbing my fork everywhere while I gorged on the chicken. The fries may be a little plain, but dip it in extra BBQ sauce and you're good to go! It seems as though my friend enjoyed his rib dinner as well because he demolished it! As for the experience, you walk in, admire the liveliness of the place, get in line while you stare at the menu on the wall, make a decision, walk up to one of the multiple cashiers, pay for your food (and possibly leave a tip in one of their jars with hilarious messages written across it like 'booze money'), take a seat, and wait as your food is delivered to you! Friendly and fast service, and they even thank you as you leave right before they clean up the table for the next party with super fast speed. Oh, and if it gets messy, there's a sink right next to the soda machines. Don't be afraid to dig in, but make sure you sanitize your hand first! I will absolutely be back.

Phil's BBQ has the best BBQ Beef ribs in the state.  period.  There is no competition.  The reason we drive down to San Diego from LA County to eat BBQ ribs is Phil's.  What Phil owes us in gas, he more than makes up for in flavor, and the portions do not disappoint.  If only Phil would open a spot in LA...

OK I admit it's GOOD.  But not wait in line for 2 hours good.  I came here last summer after my friend's graduation and was met with a 30 minute line.  Not bad, there were a bunch of us and we were chilling so not a big deal.  I probably wouldn't wait 30 minutes again for it though.  Nor would I wait what I could only imagine to be a 2 hour wait, which was what we saw as we left.  The line wrapped around the corner, alongside the restaurant, all the way to the other side of the parking lot.  Ridiculous. But back to the food.  The chicken nuggets were too dry, and the sauce was too tangy for my liking.  However the meat was as tender as I've seen for BBQ and I've seen alot of BBQ.  Overall it is still some of the best BBQ I've had.  I just wouldn't wanna wait that long for it.  (But there's no line at the San Marcos location, so that's why I gave that one 5 stars.  Plus the staff is friendlier).

What can be said that hasn't been said already. It's arguably the best BBQ joint in Southern California. The meat, sauce, side items - everything's excellent. It's a great location being right by the San Diego Sports Arena and Sea World. The only reason I give this place four stars instead of five is the fact that it's ALWAYS crowded. The lines build up before the place even opens. But as the other reviews mention, it's worth the wait. There's a reason the lines are huge. Try to come during an off time, you'll be glad you did.

This place is the bomb!!!!!! At least for me, it's the best BBQ I've ever eaten. A must eat for anyone visiting San Diego. The line is ridiculous. No matter what time of the day, there will be a line and you'll spend some time salivating on what you are going to devour when you get your order. A couple awesome tips: Get takeout. It's much, much faster than waiting in line. Or, be a creepy person and hawk around the bar area until a seat opens up. Trust me, it's better than waiting in the long line. I usually get the best of both pork ribs and chicken. It's a good size if you alone are hungry, or for 2 to share. I also get a caesar salad. This caesar salad needed more dressing, but overall, the greens were good. Parking is ok. Just ok. The lot is fair, but it's full from the Phil's and Red Lobster crowd. The actual spots are small, so I wouldn't bring a nice car there.

Does this place need another 5 star review?  Basically the best baby back ribs you can have in southern California.  The line is sometimes unreasonably long.   You should order in advance and pick it up.  And take it home.  It'll still be just as good.  Or you can just go to the bar, and there is bar seating that usually takes about 15 minutes to get. One last tip, just get the baby back ribs and some sides.  Don't get their beef ribs.  Don't get their chicken, even though you like bbq chicken, even if you feel like eating some chicken that day.  They just specialize in baby back ribs and they are amazing.

When I think of San Diego food establishments I think of Hodad's, Roberto's, and of course Phil's BBQ!  I have just never had any other bbq comparison that can even come close to the Phil's BBQ experience.  I may not have had much great BBQ in my life but I love meat (that's what she said?) and this is definitely the place to get it.   The only thing that could possibly detract stars from this place is the fact that the line is very long and goes out the door.  Whenever I bring people here, I use the opportunity in line to talk up the place and describe the food in gross details so by now, the wait just adds to the overall experience.  Although it may take awhile, Phil's is also absolutely amazing at seating large groups despite the huge mass of people.  Easily some of the best service I've ever had. Now onto the food.  When you come to Phil's you MUST get ribs.  Don't be fooled by Adam Richman in Man V. Food and merely order a sandwich (although I've tried the El Toro and it WAS good but it wasn't the ribs).  The ribs are absolutely amazing.  The baby-back ribs have a very nice smoky flavor and are always charred perfectly.  Meat comes cleanly off the bone.  The sauce is coated and grilled onto the ribs.  The sauce is sweet but has a nice spicy bite to it that I really appreciate.  I could put it on anything!  I always ask for extra sauce to put on (I'm a sauce guy).   Now even though the baby back ribs are delicious, I will always prefer the beefy ribs.  If you were a caveman hunting for a dinosaur and BBQ'ed it, you would get the Phil's beefy ribs.  Each bone is big enough to hold in one hand and really makes you feel like a man biting into it while holding one in both hands.  Although there's not as much smoky flavor and the meat is more chewy, there's just so much meat flavor on it that you can't go wrong.  I love being able to bite into it and tear pieces of meat off.  I've been living in SD for 7 years now and I still have cravings for them.  For $20, you can get 5 ribs and two sides (which are also delicious...BBQ beans here are very good).   Go right now and I'll see you in line!

Be patient in line... it's worth the wait. OR go to the bar and find an open seat, no waiting. Phil's is always on my to-do list when I'm in San Diego. There isn't much BBQ places in Hawaii. I think the closest thing we have is Tony Roma's, so so sad. It's a fun place to go with friends, you'll have a lot of time to chit chat while you're in line. This place is that good, when I think of BBQ, I crave Phil's. The line usually wraps around the building. One cool thing is that there's a webcam on their website, http://www.philsbbq.net. Once you're past the webcam, there's a beverage cart for all kinds of refreshments. Keep your cool when you order. You'll probably be starved by the time you're at the counter. I usually get a full rack of the baby back ribs and a sandwich. The baby back ribs are so tender, talk about fall off the bone! The sauce is perfect... sweet, tangy, and a little spicy. I'll take the sandwich leftovers home, for tomorrow's lunch. Phil's is my standard for BBQ. I'd recommend it to everyone!

Went there on a Saturday at 4:30pm. The line was long. Been there on a Friday around 4:00pm before. The line was long. Been there on a Wednesday around 5:00pm before. The line was long. Get the pattern? The line is always long it seems around meal time so expect it when you go. This time around, we took it to go. From the moment I got to Phil's to the moment I left with the food in my hands was approximate 15 minutes. Ordered baby back ribs, 1/2 chicken, onion rings, tons of side items. That was dinner for my family of 4 (2 small kids). Total bill was $46. The little left over was our late night snack as my wife and I had beer while watching the fireworks over Sea World from our resort. It's worth the wait. Just go. Take it go. Don't matter. If you never had it you are missing out. Just go. BTW, make sure to get the onion rings. Unlike any other onion rings I've had before. Our small came with 9 palm sized rings so that's a point of reference for you.

It never ceases to amaze me what people in san Diego consider good Bbq.  I'm from Kansas city and know what great Bbq is. Kc Bbq downtown should be shut down. Phils is a joke. It wouldn't last two seconds in kc. I read several reviews and people say oh wow this is better than tony romas and famous daves. Hahhaa of course it is those are chain spots. Now the meat is crap but the sauce is pretty good. If you are savvy at all try a cherry Bbq sauce then theirs its the same base sauce. Sides are good and they are not stingy at all. If you want good Bbq go on http://smokehousebbq.com and order it you'll get it faster than standing in that line. Of course it received the top 10 of 11 on yelp. Put a top of the line taco shop in kc and it will be the same. Phils isn't better than huffmans. Period

Some of the best BBQ I've ever had, and this coming from a guy who's redneck relatives tow homemade 50 gallon drum bbq grills and a  trailer full of meat product to our family reunions in the South. Thought the beef ribs were better than the baby back and the tri tip sandwich was right up there with the beef ribs. Tri tip was smokey, beef ribs juicy and savory, baby back were tender and slightly spicy. Mac salad was awesome and under rated, onion rings were just tempura battered and over rated imo worth every minute of the hour long wait...

The hype is alive! And the hype demolishes the wait. The ribs are obviously the way to go. Beefy Ribs are humongous. 5 beefy bones is very difficult to complete. 5 does not sound like much, but it is enough. Also, their onion rings are a good complement to the ribs. The only thing holding this review/rating back from a 5-Star is the massive amount of their signature BBQ sauce they put on their ribs. I know that is what they are known for, but it was way too much for me. Next time I am going to try the baby back, and ask for their BBQ sauce on the side. Other than that, Phil's BBQ is a must visit spot when in the San Diego area.

Gah! I totally tweeted on there without even realizing I was standing on it! =) So cool! Then we walked in ordered food. My friend and I shared a whole rack of baby back ribs, fries and cole slaw. =) Yum! The ribs were cooked so perfectly, and they tasted amazing! They also provide bibs for people who want them (like my friends and I, who were first timers!). Best ribs I've ever had in my life =) Definitely earned those 5 stars!

So an old CSUN friend was elated when I told him I was coming down to San Diego. I knew he had lived down in SD for a coupla years and even though he now lived in Los Angeles, I had hoped he'd kept his ear to the streets down in SD so I asked for a coupla recommendations of food hotspots and he gleefully churned out this place. Apparently it was on MAN VS. FOOD a few years ago and my friend swore by this place. The MAN V. FOOD appearance, coupled with over 4,OOO Yelp Reviews made this place a must stop. ---------------- LOCATION ---------------- On SPORTS ARENA DRIVE, near the casino, among a ton of strip malls. I was warned the average wait time to be seated is 45mins-2hours but I swung by around 5pm on a Monday and shockingly it was closed. Apparently MONDAY'S THEY'RE CLOSED. Came back TUES. around 6:30pm and the line was around the block so we ordered our food to-go. Still a 20 minute wait so didn't really check out the interior other than the cashiers place where it was a madhouse. About 6 cashiers with registers lined up next to one another. Super busy. ---------------- THE FOOD ---------------- ~ BBQ SAUCE - I got two extra sides of their sauce to evaluate it. The perfect combination of Tangy & Sweet. It was perfection. Like DRAKE aka "Aubrey Graham also known as Jimmy the parapelegic for Degrassi" would say... it was "The Best I've Ever Had." (5/5) ~ ONION RINGS - My friend told me I "had" to try em, so when I went I did. Paid $2 extra for the "COLOSSAL" size, so unnecessary... so many rings. It'd would've made Sonic the Hedgehog jealous. The battered crispy outside was amazing. Possibly the best onion rings I've ever had. (5/5) ~ THE BROHAM - This was pretty damn good. I think it was $6? Anyway it was pulled pork marinated in BBQ sauce atop a bed of coleslaw. There was SO MUCH meat in here it was ridiculous. It was an interesting combination... I added extra BBQ sauce... it could've used a small slice of cheese or something else. I felt like it was missing something. Perhaps one of those awesome onion rings sandwiched in-between. (4/5) http://www.yelp.com/user… ~ PORK RIB - No one else wanted one so I but one singular one for $3.95. Definitely not worth it if you're going to order just one. It was nothing special. Good not great. (3/5) -------------- AND SO... -------------- This place has 4000+ reviews and a 4+ star. Honestly I would definitely comeback to have the full dine-in experience and explore their menu further. With such an amazing BBQ Sauce I regret not trying any of their chicken options. All-in-all a good spot with decent prices. Going to look up the MAN VERSUS FOOD episode later today to see what he ate there...

Expect long lines and don't be scared of it. It'll move along and you'll most likely still be deciding what to order up until when you get to the cash register anyway, lol. I come here for the BABY BACK RIBS. They're always tender, wet, and so freakin good! You'll think that a half rack for yourself will be enough but it usually isn't and if it too much, you can have your leftovers in 2 hours so WHY NOT? Go for the full rack and you won't regret it. Beef ribs: they're bigger than your face and that's for sure. I'm not a fan of these. They're usually really dry and I always get pieces of the meat stuck in-between my teeth. Chicken: I'll skip on this. They give you big pieces but it's so dry and there's never enough bbq sauce to go around so I never get to finish my chicken. such a waste. Sides: Fries - they're usually pretty inconsistent. I've had some really great fries there before and some really bad ones. When they get it right, it's usually really good and I just can't stop eating them. Macaroni Salad - I always have to get this. Has just the right amount of mayo so you don't feel gross after eating 4 spoonfuls of it. Cole Slaw - am I the only one who thinks KFC still has the best cole slaw?? This is a must stop if you're in the San Diego area.

What is there to say about Phil's that hasn't been said in 3800+ reviews...? Nothing. But I'll try anyways. First things first, I don't like bbq...I don't like bbq sauce and I don't really even like meat.  So going to Phil's was a really big stretch for me.  I waited in line (in the rain) for about an hour with a friend to order our food, so by the time I got there I was expecting A LOT.   I ordered the combo with the beef ribs and bbq chicken with fries and baked beans. Good lord, it was amazing. As I said before, I don't like bbq sauce, but the bbq sauce was amazing.  The beef ribs were literally falling off the bone and they were so tender and moist and they come with sooooooo much meat.  As for the bbq chicken, contrary to some other reviews, I loved it.  I didn't think it was dry at all, it was honestly delicious.  Fries were great as were the baked beans.   The atmosphere was comfortable and inviting and the service was great too, everyone was so friendly.  I have nothing but good things to say about Phil's and I recommend it to everyone, I can't wait to go back to San Diego so I can stop here

Phils has the best bbq in Calif. period. Just amazing, mouth watering food, great customer service, good local drafts. Try the Karl Amber lager, it goes perfect with anything BBQ.   I drive to Phils from the Los Angeles area, and it is always worth the drive. There is a rumor that Phils is coming to Downtown Disney next year. So BBQ fans keep your eyes and ears open.

This place was AWESOME.  I had long heard about the greatness of Phil's BBQ from my SD friends, but... words cannot describe the heavenly deliciousness. Came here after a night of celebration for P's birthday.  We got there around 2pm and thank goodness there was barely a line at all.  Barely a line = line out the first part of the store only and nothing beyond that.  During our wait, we were offered free lemonade samples, which made the wait much better. I got the half rack dinner plate with baby back ribs.  OMG. Best BBQ I had in my life.  I mean, the portion doesn't sound too big with 6-7 ribs, but it's definitely enough for a hungry person. Can't wait to go back for a second time!

Phil Dear Phil how I love you so! I've been a HUGE fan of Phil's since the original location that was so small you had to eat outside. We picked some up for the 4th and I guess everyone else had the same idea! We took it back to the house for everyone to try and I swear even the Vegetarians came out of the closet. You cant get BBQ anywhere else in San Diego that good and you cant get anything even close to it in Los Angeles. This is worth driving for at all costs!

I just realized this was my 3rd review. -.- But anywho, I ordered take out this time since I knew the line was going to be LOOOOONNNGGGG (saturday night). I phoned in my order and I was told to come ASAP because even the pick up line was around 30 minutes. I left asap, but ended up waiting FOREVER! We saw a pick up order sitting on a counter for a while... so finally decided to ask if that was ours. Turned out it was :( and it has been sitting there for a long long time. But luckily (!!), Phil (maybe? manager?) saved our night!!! He totally sympathized with us and apologized for the mishap. He then told the kitchen to re-do our order again and guaranteed us it would be under 5 minutes. Voila!! And it happened. =) GREAT food, EXTRAORDINARY service!!! I'd give Phil's 6 stars if I could :) :)

Phil's BBQ is a San Diego favorite. Every time I go home, It's an absolute must! Delicious ribs falling off the bone, soaked in a sauce that's the perfect blend of sweet and heat. No matter how long the line gets, it's worth the wait (and the weight). Your mouth will thank you. For first timers, get a half rack rib dinner. For someone who wants to sample it all, go for a ribs and chickless/chicken dinner. All their sides are delicious, but their onion rings really standout - step it up by dipping them in the house ranch. For people who aren't in the mood for ribs, go for the Broham pulled pork sandwich (but ask for the slaw on the side, you'll get more than when you ask them to put it in the sandwich directly). This place is awesome. I guarantee it.

HANDs DOWN for their baby back ribs. It is the best ribs I have eaten. The meat falls off the bone and sauce is OMG YUMMY! Their onion ring is too big and the skin is too thick. it is just a meeehh.. The line can be pretty long during the weekend but the baby back ribs IS WORTH iT!! :P

There's definitely a long line for this place even though we came at 3pm on Saturday. We got the combo plate which had both baby back ribs and chicken. The chicken was a little less tender than some other bbq places we've had up north. BBQ ribs was really soft and moist, fries were pretty good. The sauce was great. Didn't like the amount of sauce that was smothered on the tri tip sandwich. After a while, eating parts of both made the mouth only taste of the BBQ sauce. Liked the size and crispiness of their onion rings though!

Best damn BBQ I've had in my entire life! I've eaten here 3 different times. Each time ordering something different. I have not been disappointed once! I finally decided to take my bf here on our vacation and he loved it so much he can't stop talking about it. I'm pretty sure he cried a tear of happiness after he finished his baby back ribs lol. I definitely wish there was a spot closer to orange,ca but its definitely worth the trip!

Since I am indecisive, being LITERALLY surrounded by menus during my 20 minutes wait was super helpful! Ambiance: Large, fast, friendly,family oriented, large parties, huge facility, order&pay. Service: Although we had to wait 20 minutes to order our food, the food came out very fast (in about 10 minutes our buzzer lighted up) and it wasn't very difficult to find a seating. Also, the waiters were all very friendly and helpful. Taste: DELICIOUS. Some of the sides were disappointing, but I came here for BBQ ribs and they delivered. "Beefy Ribs and Chicken Dinner" (2 bones and 1/4 lb chicken with 2 sides)- $12.45 For the sides, we chose potato salad and coleslaw. The beefy rib is huge and full of so much meat. However, the texture is definitely tougher and you really need to bite off the meat.  The beefy rib is not as tender but it has much more smokier flavor. The chicken was simply terrible because it was very dry. I'll definitely ask for the dark meat next time. "Full Rib Dinner" (10-12 baby back ribs with 2 small sides)- $18.95 We chose macaroni salad and french fries This was simply amazing. The meat ripped and fell right off the bones. The meat was tender and full of delicious flavors. It tasted like heaven! The french fries were disappointing since I heard so much good stuff about it. The macaroni salad was a favorite as well. Beefy rib vs. Baby back rib Verdict: The beefy rib is definitely very manly and tough. I would prefer the baby back rib because it is so tender and easy to eat Price: Fair Overall: I love Phil's BBQ. I actually went to Phil's again 3 days later but this time in their second location in San Marcos. There was absolutely no wait, the food came out a little slower, but the french fries were excellent and the quality was better. Lastly, the hand-washing-station is BRILLIANT.  Right outside the bathroom was a huge a stainless steal sink to wash your dirty hands! PS. To check if it is a busy night, simply go onto their website and click the LIVE WEBCAM to see how long the line is!

BILLY MAYS (aka CHRIS ELMI) here with another fantastic product! Do you like BBQ? Do you enjoy stuffing down heaps of succulent ribs, brisket, and pork, accompanied by huge ladles of sides, and gigantic onion rings? Then Phil's has got what you need. The baby back and beef ribs are smoked to perfection, coated with the patented BBQ sauce technology Phil has been using for years. So tender, the meat slides off the bone leaving a nice clean finish. Not a fan of the ribs? Never a problem at Phil's. We got brisket, pork, chicken, sandwiches, AND salads. Each of these hosting their own unique flavor. Did someone say onion rings? Well if you want 'em, Phil's got 'em! We're talking mountains folks. Mountains of deep fried, crispy heaven. So crispy, Colonel Sanders would turn in his grave! Tired of dipping below the legal limit? Well Phil's has you covered. Their patented orange-wheat beer will have you dancing on table tops in no time. Perfect for any meal and any occasion! For under $19.99 per person this can be yours too!

This was another great Yelp find!  Great food and a fun, busy, energetic atmosphere. The only thing I didn't like was standing in line, ordering at a counter, instead of wait service. It wasn't bad, not a long wait and the pulled pork sandwich was HUGE and delicious. The staff is mostly young kids with good customer service skills, which always makes me happy!  Can't wait to go back on our next visit and have something else!

I could rate Phil's 20 stars if I ultimately could. Hands down it's just that good and the best part about the meal was that no 2 dishes tasted the same which is a rare find. We showed up at roughly 11:15 (they open at 11) and the line was already wrapping around the corner(s), but it's only a testament to what you're getting. I have a hard time reading about how some don't like to wait or the line is long (yada yada). Sorry the world doesn't cater to you and ONLY you. Honestly the line moves fast and people seem to be in and out like an elementary school cafeteria. For a place that does on average 5000 customers in a day I'd say the odds are on their side with the whole crowd management. The menu is actually quite affordable and after actually seeing the portion size nothing price wise is a miss. The wife and I decided to split (yeah that's such an oxymoron here) the beefy rib dinner and the El Toro (tri tip sandwich). We selected the coleslaw and macaroni salad as our sides for the rib dinner which certainly added to the overall value. The ribs are tender as h-e double hockey sticks and yes I did the fork test even quite a while after it was first brought up (every time the meat fell right off the bone leaving it skinned bare. The tri tip had a mouth watering smokey taste to it and by far the best I have had to date. The sauce has a rootin' tootin' kick to it, but by no means does it overpower of leave you needing a drink. The coleslaw and macaroni salad were great as well and even rivals my mother's which has stood the test of time for 20+ years (I'm glad she never yelps) ha-ha. They were not heavy as it tends to be when you add the mayo, etc. to them which solidifies why they do consistently have the 5 ratings! I don't give those to many places, but Phil knows his stuff and from the staff to the steer it was just a perfect culinary experience overall.

OK, so before you become shocked about this review, please know that I am a Texas girl. And in Texas, we have some mean barbecue. It's not that I don't like Phil's. I do. I like getting the BBQ Broham. But, their sides just don't uphold to standards. The potato salad is bland and disappointing. And the beans, are just mediocre at best. The true purpose of barbecue is to mix everything together, thus the quality of sides are as important to me as the meat for an overall barbecue experience.

The BBQ here is GREAT! Ranks up there with the Texas BBQ I've had previously.  Once you enter the place the smell hits you Immediately and especially after waiting for so long in line, it's super enticing. We ordered a round of baby back ribs, beefy ribs and onion rings with all the small sides. Definitely get the baby back ribs... fall off the bone, juicy and amazing. Beefy ribs with the BBQ sauce is amazing with huge portions and huge flavor. We also got hooked up with an additional side since the food a bit longer than expected. Props to Chris who helped us when we were asking about our food. Anytime in SD, Phil's is a must go spot.

The best BBQ chicken I have ever had, same goes for the Onion rings and Coleslaw. Reasonably priced! Casssual attire..What more can you ask for? Also  I like the strict rules they had- no table holding etc, hate it when people do that Great service! Will definitely go again. Thanks Yelp!

So my friend's and I went there for dinner after Comic -con. I was told the bbq here is fantastic. Upon arrival, I noticed the long line just to get into the restaurant; reminded me of Pink's hotdog line in LA. I was told this is typical with this restaurant and the seating is first come first serve. We waited like 45 mins. There were restaurant staff entertaining the waiters. They were very nice and socialable and introduced new comers to their menu.  The service was very friendly and staff made sure you were comfortable during your experience. I ordered the full rack baby back ribs with fries, macaroni salad, and onion rings. My partner ordered the El toro.  I also tried their chicken and pulled pork sandwhich. What stood out were their sides and baby back ribs. The chicken, tri-tip, and pulled pork was dry, the extra bbq sauce on the side didn't help the dryness eigther. I didn't give it 5 stars due to the dryness of the other meats.  But their baby back ribs and sides and onion rings are superb! (and their service and food pricing :) )

I practically made a trip down to San Diego just for Phil's. I've made plenty of trips down to SD back in college when a lot of my friends went to UCSD. Those fools never sought to enlighten me about Phil's, we practically ate mexican every meal and I love my carne asada fries as much as the next, but COME ON. They aren't my friends anymore starting this moment. In an effort not to wait in a long line I placed a to go order. It was raining the day I went and also at an off hour, and still there was a decent sized line. A testament to how popular this joint is. Food was prepped and ready to go pretty much when I arrived. Objects of desire ordered: Full rack of ribs: They were indeed fall off the bone. The sauce was perfect. Quite honestly it might be the best ribs I've ever had. I'm still a bit shocked that despite all the hype, it lived up to it. This is rare, very. Chicken: Juicy, but compared to the flavor in the ribs the chicken seemed a bit ordinary. Not comparing this is definitely very delectable. Onion Rings: Thick and nicely battered. Good junky compliment. SUMMARY: Major hype and lived up to it, which is beyond rare.

There is a reason Phil's is a Top 10 restaurant.  EXCELLENT food, BEST service, and every detail is thought of in their restaurant (I visited the Point Loma location).  I could go on and on, but here are the highlights: WHAT I LOVED:  - The bathroom.  Seriously.  Cleanest bathroom and little touches that really make you feel like your hands are READY for some down'n'dirty eatin (minus the dirt!) - including arm handles on the doors so you aren't washing hands and then grabbing a filthy knob.  WIN.  - The beans, ribs, and macaroni salad.  I am NOT a mac salad gal myself, but this was perfect goop to pasta ratio (very light on the goop) and TASTY.  - The TRI TIP - OH GAWD THE TRI TIP!   WHAT I LEARNED THE HARD WAY:  - It's hard to say no to seconds :D

I could go to Phil's at least once a week.  The food is awesome no matter what you order.  I'm a sandwich guy, so that's usually what I get.  The onion rings are beasts!! Took the fam here over the holidays and my little sis ate more than I had ever seen her eat before.  Check Phil's out.  The line may be intimidating, but if you're in good company the time will pass before you know it.  You can also check their website live stream to see how long the line currently is.

Overview After the amazing Ivy W.'s raving review of Phil's BBQ, I figure that I must give this place a try. When planning my trip to San Diego, it was the first thing that made its way to my mind...and definitely the last when making my way back home. This place is just unbelievable! The ribs are juicy, tender, and flavorful. A knife makes for a great table ornament as you really won't be needing it as the meat is so tender it falls apart with a light tug. Top the meat with their delicious sauce and you are in heaven. Just don't be too surprised if you find yourself licking your plate after your last bite of meat. You've been warned... Wholeheartedly recommended.   Food BBQ Price Around $10-20 per plate depending on what you order. Occasion Family gatherings Casual dining Lonely nights by yourself (you can enjoy your meal in their full service bar)

Whooooaa Nelly! *place EYES back into socket and pushes JAW back up* OMG, Black Friday in March?! Nope, just your typical line into Phil's BBQ.  Yes, I can finally say I witnessed and fell victim to this legendary spot. Yelp Top 10 of 2011 in USA, btw. As if I'm going to wait, Ha.  Since the GF and I were starvin' like marvin', we opted for the Phone-In Take Out. HIGHLIGHTS + If you are not up to waiting, call it in! There's a separate line for that! Find a menu via onsite or online before placing order over phone. + Phone-In line: Moves pretty quick.  They will holler at you when ready.  Approx 15-25 minutes total. + Dine-In line: wrapped around the building, cannot speak to this experience. FOOD + We ordered the "Best of Both" Baby Back Rib and Chicken Dinner: 4 bones and 1/4 Chicken.  Mouthwatering, tender, fall off the bone pork.  Juicy, succulent chicken! *$12.95* + Sides: Macaroni Salad and French Fries: Probably some of the best mac salad I've ever eaten.  Fries had a potato fresh taste to them! *included with the Best of Both combo* + BBQ Broham: Probably the best toasted buns on a pulled-pork I've ever devoured!  The pork was tender and tasty, went well with the creamy Coleslaw! This sandwich was huge and will easily fill you up! *$6.95* Quality + Low Pricing = Worth it! Despite the wait.

As seems to be the consensus, Phil's is worth the line. Every time I brave it, I recall a nugget of wisdom a Dove Chocolate wrapper once imparted to me: "The anticipation is half the pleasure." And I appreciate sweet, sweet Phil's that much more. Everyone goes to Phil's. It's crazy famous and there's a line that goes around the building into the parking lot, which is the sole barrier between the restaurant and one of the less polished parts of San Diego. The food is awesome, the staff is great, and blah blah blah. If you'd like to see what the prices are like and what the menu looks like, you may as well look around the page because it's easy to find. Rather than tell you what you probably know from reading the reviews around me, I'll simply go over what I like to get. Every time I hanker for some barbecue, I go down to Phil's with a partner and we split two things: the Broham pulled pork and El Toro tri-tip sandwiches. This is accompanied by some combination of coleslaw, potato salad, and/or macaroni salad. We split them down the middle and distribute, then tear in. Each bite of pork and beef is as juicy as the last, and I have a happy tummy. Don't sweat the wait and share with friends. These are the only pieces of advice I will give as you can't go wrong with whatever it is that you order.

Absolutely love this place! I live in Orange County and a few of us still try to make the drive down a few times a year just for Phil's BBQ. The beef ribs is my favorite thing to get there. As for sides, the macaroni salad is simply the best. Prices are somewhat reasonable compared to similar places like Lucille's. My only negative feedback is that every time I went, no matter what time of day there is always at least a 30 minute wait. Other than that, still pretty good BBQ.

The BBQ is great! The wait will be long (we waited ~1 hour to be seated) but they have an efficient system for taking orders and seating parties so it makes everything flow seamlessly. The ribs are amazingly tender and the sides are all pretty good. The only thing that was sub-par was their onion rings. Someone forgot to season the batter or SOMETHING because they were BLAND as heck. My friend later called me a noob for not getting take out, but I think you gotta eat there at least once for the experience.

5 stars, hands down. Food is great. Service was fabulous. Even though you wait a long time, everything is efficient and accessible. Keeping this brief, just take my word for it. GO TRY THIS PLACE!!! Tonight I ordered a half rack of baby back ribs, along side corn on the cob and onion rings. Going to go back and try the tri-tip sandwich since that's starred on Man Vs. Food. :) My friends also ordered ribs and sides like fries, potato salad, cole slaw, and macaroni salad. This place can be a bit pricey, but they're big on their portion sizes and you'll definitely leave with a full stomach. Also, even though the wait time in line takes forever, the staff makes an effort to keep all of their customers happy. I really appreciated the staff for making friendly conversation with me. They were very approachable. Hell yeah, Phil's BBQ!!

Best BBQ I've ever had, hands down! There is a bit of a wait when you show up but it was well worth it. I ordered half beef ribs and half boneless chicken. The ribs are about 5 pounds each and are fall of the bone delicious. My girlfriend had a half order of beef ribs, which consisted of 6 enormous ribs, (far more food than she bargained for). The service is great, it's moderately priced, and the portions are capable of satiating any appetite. I will certainly be returning to Phil's BBQ in the future for another satisfying BBQ meal.

Popular in San Diego? - No doubt. San Diegans love this place. Real BBQ? - Real BBQ is about smoke, low temps & long cooking times. Phil's "grills" their ribs & chicken. San Diego calls this BBQ, but in reality it doesn't compare. Since Coop's rolled into town, they have lowered my rating of Phil's. Came here a few days ago & I was just disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it was OK & everyone in my party of 10 raved about it, but it just wasn't the real stuff. Coop's BBQ'd meats is about the smoke & the meat. It doesn't need sauce, but if you want to sauce it you're welcome to it. For San Diego, Phil's is the bomb & their overall rating & reviews demonstrates that. I'm fine with that. People like the taste of what Phil's puts out.  I'm just selfishly hoping that the neighborhood Coop's is in will keep the crowds away so I won't have to deal with long lines & waits.

This place is like Disneyland. Long lines, a sign that tells you how much longer you have to wait, and pure happiness waiting at the end. The line will be long, but they're very efficient once you order. I think we got all our food within a few minutes. And the food lasted about half that time. The photo machine's fun to play with while you wait - there's one near the door entrance. Baby back ribs are great - so are all the sides I tried. Potato salad was great, coleslaw was crisp. Don't get me wrong, the food was great - hands down the best BBQ I've have in California. However, being the holiday weekend, it took over an hour to get to order. It's good to go to, but you won't see my returning. Unless the line magically disappears.

FAMOUS FOR: - Onion Rings (9/10) - Baby Back Ribs: Meat (8/10) - Sauce (6/10) I ALSO TRIED - BBQ Chicken: Meat (5/10) - Pulled Pork (No Sauce) (3/10) - Baked Beans (7/10) - Macaroni Salad (4/10) Took a trip to San Diego, so the first thing I check to see is if Guy Fieri's been here. He has, but the few places he went to didn't look very appetizing, except maybe the seafood place. So, since Flavortown failed me, I asked Yelp what the most popular place is in San Diego. I'm looking for a place with 500+ reviews, and if I'm lucky, I can find a place with 1,000. I come across this place and I see there are almost 4,000 reviews! I've never seen a place that came close to that, so for sure, I had to go! Now, even though I've been eating BBQ forever, I've only come to know about the different styles within the last couple years. I've come to the conclusion that I'm more of a Texas style - dry rub. When it comes to pork, I want to taste the meat. Sauce is good in its own regard, but only if it's done right. I like KC style sauces - more sweet and smokey flavors. So, Phil's...is neither. :/ ONION RINGS The thing I read in all reviews is how awesome their onion rings are and how crunchy they were (for me, crunchy = Valhalla). When I saw their pictures on the TV screen I noticed they were beer battered, which made me a little sad. We got them anyway, but already I was disappointed...but that was before I tried them. They were the crunchiest beer battered onion rings I've ever had. I think they actually battered them twice, because while it had the flakiness of a beer batter, it had almost the full crunch of a traditional batter. They were ginormous too. Very very tasty and dipped in ranch, you almost lose all self control! I would definitely order these again. It is still a beer batter, so it lost a little there. It could've been even crunchier with a more liberal application of the traditional batter. BABY BACK RIBS And here we are...the reason for Phil's existence. I got the "Best of Both" with baby back ribs and chicken plus 2 sides. The ribs are incredibly meaty, and a half rack is enough to fill you up, if you get the 2 sides. The ribs have a strange flavor, but it really works. Normally the meat is completely saturated with smoke flavor. Now, I really do love that, but strangely Phil's ribs have a very light smoke flavor and on top of that, it doesn't occupy the whole rib. It's almost layered in taste. During a bite of the rib, the light smoke flavor slowly fades in, gives you a taste, and slowly fades out. It's really weird, but, believe it or not, was kinda fun! While the ribs had excellent, and I mean really excellent, flavor, it was a little lacking in seasoning, but not enough to lose your marbles over. I suppose that's why the sauce comes into play... THE SAUCE Like I said, I like Kansas City sauce, sweet and smoky BBQ. I don't like Carolina style AT ALL! Phil's sauce is a mix. A lot of people like it, because they like the little tangy and sour taste, but not me. If I had to guess, it was 35% sweet, 65% tangy. It was a little too sour/tangy for my taste, and every time I had a piece of meat that needed some sauce, I actually had to think twice as to whether or not that 35% sweetness was worth it. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not for me. BBQ CHICKEN The chicken was downright boring. It was just a tad dry, but I think it's what most people consider "average." I like my chicken almost greasy, but this chicken didn't do it for me. The flavor was also very boring. No flavor, and only a little seasoning. If this was smoked or grilled, I couldn't tell. With the sauce that I wasn't too much of a fan of, I really didn't want to do anything with this chicken. PULLED PORK I asked if they had a small sample of pulled pork, no sauce, but they didn't. It only comes in the Pulled Pork Sandwich with BBQ sauce. She did give me a small sample, though in a cup, which I was very appreciative of. After trying BBQ in Nashville and Houston, I found that I'm a big pulled pork (dry rub only) junkie. That being said, 0 other places than those 2 actually gave me pulled pork that I liked. This is another one of those failures. The pork was pretty dry, and at the same time completely, and utterly, flavorless AND seasonless! For their sake, I'm glad they don't serve this by itself! BAKED BEANS It's almost like Bush's can Baked Beans, but there was some other strange flavor in there, maybe a hint of ginger? I don't know what it was, but it was sort of a lateral move. It didn't add anything special, it just made it a little different. There's nothing wrong with their baked beans, it's just nothing special. MACARONI SALAD This was pretty bad. I'm not a fan of mac salad to begin with, but this was exceptionally bad. There was hardly any flavor in the salad. I suppose by being flavorless, it substituted for the lack of bread with this meal, but whatever. AS GOOD AS IT GETS? No. It's not bad, but nothing compelsMeToReturn.

Between two people, we got a full baby back rib dinner (which comes with 2 small sides -- we got fries and the potato salad) and a 1/4 dark meat chicken. A full dinner is about 10-12 ribs while a half dinner is 6-7. For what we got, we weren't that stuffed. I got a Stella, and for a small little girl, I wasn't full to the brim. For the portion size, the pricing is pretty good. I wouldn't recommend the potato salad, although I've never been a fan of potato salad. Overall, the ribs were pretty tasty, but nothing memorable. I stand by Lucille's BBQ and their apple butter.

I'm no BBQ snob. I don't know which BBQ spot in San Diego is the most authentic.  I don't know whether "proper" meat is smoked, sauced, rubbed, brined, or some combination thereof.   However, what I *do* know is that Phil's is delicious.   Actually, Phil's is HEAVEN.   Phil's beef ribs?  HEAVEN.   Phil's BBQ chicken?  HEAVEN.   Phil's baked beans?  HEAVEN. Phil's onion rings?  HEAVEN. Phil's cole slaw?  Bliss. I also know that Phil's "tickler" lunches -- all under $7 each -- are the BEST lunch deal in San Diego.  These platters are enough to feed two people and still have fries leftover for the next day. If you go to Phil's for a weekday lunch, there's no line either.  Leave the weekend crowds and hour-long waits for the suckers and tourists. It may no longer be cool to be addicted to Phil's, but I remain loyal.  Remember: the first step is *admitting* that you have a problem.

the food is great and the service is even better.  i ate outside patio with my dog.  louis  and mighty mat brought her a whole rack of beef ribs gratis.  the food tastes much better when the employees like their jobs and go out of their way to make sure you have a great experience.  I ordered the meat without the extra sauce on it.  It is cooked with the sauce, then I just got it on the side for dipping.  The baby back ribs were killer and my dog won't give up the beef rib bones.

A different experience is in store for you. The long lines move surprisingly quick. You order your food while standing in line, pay for it, then pick up when your number is called. The self-service was unexpected. Waite staff moves fluently around the restaurant, but is only concerned with making sure tables are ready for the next guests. Onion Rings were great as were the fries. The "ribs" were dry, tuff and untasty., may have been an off day or maybe they weren't fresh. Totally unexpected, as this is their signature dish. Other members of our party got burgers or chicken and were very satisfied. Confusion at the soda bar was a little scary, they should add a second soda bar. Have turned down 2 invites to dine here again. May try it again.

This place is amazing! Great food, great vibes, great people, and all around a great place to eat!  I came here with a big group, and we happen to come on a busy night [there was a performer next door at the sports arena], but the line was surprisingly fast for how long it was; it was no more than 20 minutes tops.  After we all ordered, we were surrounded by amazing .. what would you call them .. servers?  We were tended well to, and I was surprised since this isn't the type of place where you have a server per table.  All the staff were extremely nice; not a single one looked like they were not having fun doing what they do. The food, which should be the main focus, was delicious! I highly recommend the beefy ribs [tender meat that practically melts off the bone with their signature bbq sauce]. I can't wait until the next time I come!

This place is incredible! Holy crap this is some amazing BBQ. I've only been twice as I don't live in San Diego, but any other BBQ place I've had in my life pails in comparison to Phil's. We waited ~ an hour in line last time we went down to eat here.

5 stars because my boyfriend loved it and said, "It tasted like sweet baby jesus gave birth in my mouth!" whatever that means...but he really really liked it. Took him here on a date and I myself am not a meat eater so I thought it was just ok, ordered chicken breast and yes it was good but wasn't overly the top amazing. Boyfriend had baby back ribs and said it came right off the bone and was super soft. Said it was the best barbeque sauce he's ever had. I suggest getting the onion rings and sharing! If you're not a big eater try sharing a split plate with someone like half ribs/half chicken etc. I didn't see that on the menu and just ordered 1 plate for myself and couldn't finish. This place gets super packed so come early. I came both times right when they opened at about 11:30-11:40 and only had to wait about 10 minutes. After that the line goes around the building. So if you don't like waiting, come early. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful. You seat yourself so you don't really have a waiter but the people who go around always ask if you want any napkins or wet naps and if you need more sauce etc.

When I think of San Diego I always think of PHIL'S BBQ! I had to come back because those ribs were delicious. The bf and I had to wait for about 20-30 minutes which wasn't bad compared to an hour wait or more. However, it was hard to get the waiters attention to clean the table because they were very busy. We got the beefy ribs (5) which was A LOT OF FOOD. Next time we'll just get 3, but we had plenty of left overs. The meat is good, but lacked on flavor because they didn't have a rub on top just sauce, but the meat was still good itself. It goes great with the beans and french fries. I got a half rack of ribs and I really enjoyed it with my corn on the cobb and coleslaw. I've never been to Texas or the south to try the real deal, but this is as good as it gets for me. Wash it all down with some pepsi and I'm a happy camper.

I'm not the biggest fan of barbeque...but I am a big fan of Phil's BBQ. =)  Order the baby back ribs and battered onion rings.  You will be in food heaven. =) This was my favorite out of our "Man vs. Food" stops - and apparently, all of San Diego knows about Phil's BBQ.  This place is very organized and has a high turnover of customers.  We've been a couple of times, and no matter what time you go, it will be crowded or there's a line.  In fact, we came on a rainy day right at 11am (when they open) and there was a line about 15 people deep...then after we got in, the restaurant filled up quickly. I recommend ribs - I personally prefer the baby back ribs but the beef ribs are delicious as well.  The meat is really tender and falls off the bone.  I also prefer to have my sauce on the side, with just a dry rub on my ribs.  Whether you like it smothered in sauce or dry, the ribs are just good.  I've also had the BBQ chicken which was ok.  I think I need to try the tri-tip but honestly, all I want to eat here are ribs because they're the best I've tried so far.  The sides seem ok...I really love the corn on the cob though.  It's really fresh and prepared perfectly here.  The best appetizer/side though are the onion rings!!  Get an order to share with friends - there's a lot but you'll finish them all I bet.  I love battered onion rings over the breaded ones - they are really good here! The staff here is super friendly, everything runs efficiently and I love me an organized restaurant!  This is definitely one of the places we always want to eat at when we are in San Diego. =)

So I have been hearing about Phil's BBQ for years, and being someone with only an amateur appreciation for meat, I was always like "eh, how good could it be?" Oh my WOW. How naive I was. We tried to drive to Phil's for lunch, but ended up being stuck in traffic for a bajillion hours (thank you Rock and Roll marathon and random Sea World detour), so we called in an order and brought our Phil's to the beach, which ended up being an awesome decision. We found a random bench to put the food on, and could literally see the looks of envy on everyone's faces as they passed by. We had both the baby back ribs and the beefy ribs, and both were super yummy. It is seriously impossible to eat the ribs without ending up with sauce all over your face hands, but when you stop caring about the random smear of sauce across your cheek, that's when you know it's good. My friend and I attempted to split a beefy rib, and at first, we tried to be dainty and cut it like civilized people, but a plastic knife was no match for the really beefy beefy rib, so we ended up having one person hold the rib while the other used her teeth to rip off pieces of meat. It was totally barbaric and completely out of character, but I loved it in an "omg this is so awesome I don't even care how bizarre this must look" kind of way. The baby back ribs were my favorite because they were so so so tender. And having extra containers of sauce definitely helps. The sides were all really yummy too-- yay potato salad and cole slaw! tl;dr: Mmm, wanna lick the sauce off. (And it's not even my birthday?)

A friend of ours brought us here when we went to visit them in San Diego. From what I've heard there is ALWAYS a line wrapped around the building of this place. We got there at about 3:30 on a wednesday afternoon and walked right in, now wait at all. It's not your typical resturaunt. You walk in, look at the menu hanging on the wall, then walk up to the register and order. They had a pretty good variety from hamburgers, chicken, salads, and ribs. I originally was going to order the turkey burger but that "eh, what the hell, were at a BBQ place" so I got the the baby back ribs and chickless (chickless meaning boneless skinless) dinner combo with a baked potatoe (which right after I ordered I saw an order of a macoroni salad came out and I wished I had gotten that instead). After you order we paid right then and they gave us a buzzer and cups for our drinks. We sat ourselves at a table outside, and the food came out FAST! The service was great! The food was cooked perfectly. The ribs were fall off the bone tender, and the sauce was great. I would've prefered the chicken to be slightly more tender but it was nothing to complain about, it was still delicous! I would return to this place, but I would not wait in some insane line that wraps around the building.

There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about this place. It's that good. Would you expect to find such great BBQ in SD? Probably not and that makes it even more special. Phil's has found their niche and they are rockin' it out. I am lucky enough to live within walking distance of this place which is amazing, but rather frightening for my waist line! ;) order the pulled pork sandwich... The slaw on it is the perfect tang. My man and I always grab take out... You avoid the ridiculous line and can enjoy Phil's snuggling on the couch together with cold beer. Yum!

Seriously, this place is flipping amazing. I had my first taste 4 years ago when I visited my friends down in San Diego and to this day, I still crave it every time I think of barbeque (once a week usually). I have no problems waiting in line, however long, as long as I can get my ribs here. The baby back ribs are to die for. The meat is flavorful, juicy, and tender, and it falls off easily. Surprisingly enough, the beefy ribs are just as well made. I usually think of bigger ribs as tougher and harder to eat, but nope, these are freakishly amazing too. Personally, I think they drench on the barbeque sauce too much so I just ask for it on the side. I love the sauce but too much can overpower the flavor of the meat. When I'm leaving, I buy a giant bottle of the sauce and bring it back home to norcal to share with family. For the sides, I'd recommend the sweet baked beans and the macaroni salad. Both are great compliments to the meat! Just writing this review is making me crave Phil's all over again....please open one in the Bay Area!!

I have been coming here for years for my BBQ fix.   I came here for takeout during the first week of April 2012 and had a great experience.  As usual the onion rings were to die for.  I had a pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw (on the side).  My only gripe is that the bun of my sandwich was a bit tough.   I have to state that it was not heated once at home.  They provide extra sauce and ranch dressing which is awesome.

I came here on a wednesday night I believe and it was PACKED. But the line was very quick and I got my food right away. I got ribs and fries because I believe Phil's is known for that but I was a bit disappointed. I didn't want phils to be one of those overly hyped places that don't have much to show for but it was. The ribs were okay and the fries was okay, but for a widely known restaurant, okay food is not what I was expecting. Come here if you want to have the experience but its not worth a second trip.

Who would have thought I would fall in love with this place?! I'm not a fan of bbq sauce, but their food was delicious that I didn't mind! I had so many people talk about this place and how good it was, I wasn't expecting the hype to be Spot On! The prices were comparable to any other BBQ restaurant. I've tried all their meats, from the baby backs, chicken, to the beefy ribs (which I recommend to any meat lover! -- never had anything like it!) It was very flavorful and the meat just fell off the bone! Their sides are pretty good as well. My favorite is the onion rings. It had a thick crunchy batter and the rings were huge! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall, this is the best BBQ place I've been to. Definitely well worth the drive since I'm from Orange County. Would recommend to anyone and everyone who loves food! The only downfall is the wait (which is normally wrapped round the building -- maybe 1 hr to 1.5 hrs at the 2nd door), but it is absolutely worth the wait!

Phil's is the most over-hyped place in San Diego.  The food is ok, but it's not great.  Prices are low.  And it's always really, really busy.   Their sauce is way too sweet and has too much liquid smoke.  The pulled pork is decent but a bit too dry.  Beef ribs are pretty good.  All in all it's nothing special, and certainly doesn't deserve its inflated Yelp rating.

OK, I know people love this place, and I have to admit there are really good things here. But overall, I think it's a little overhyped. I've come here a bunch of times when I was basically living in SD and the food is consistent, but not consistently amazing which it's supposed to be! Things I've tried: Chickless: Basically the chicken without any bones. Maybe because it's off the bones, that it becomes dry, but really? THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN! Flavor wise, it's good because of the sauce, but it's super dry and just alright. Ribless: (do you sense a pattern here? I don't like dealing with bones...heh heh) the ribs just off the bones. This unlike the chickless was still juicy, just not as juicy as the regular ribs. Flavor wise, it's good and tender, but nothing special. I do appreciate them taking the ribs off the bones for me. Pork Ribs: These are really good. They're super good and tender. One of the best to be honest, but not enough to redeem the chicken. Beef Ribs: THESE THINGS ARE HUGE!! I still like the pork ribs better, but these things are ginormous! Still full of flavor and definitely for those of you who are super hungry. Sides: They're alright. Nothing really special. Overall, I don't know if the lines are worth the food that you get. I mean I've waited a near an 1.5 hours a couple of times...I will not deny though that the ribs are delicious...maybe take them to go....

Food-6/5 I never get sick of the food here and it always exceeds my expectations!  The baby-back ribs & beef ribs are out of this world delicious!  The meat just slides right off the bone, and they're covered w/ the most delicious BBQ sauce I've ever had.  You can also taste the smokey-ness of the meats.  Eating here makes me feel like Fred Flinstone when he eats those huge dinosaur meats at the drive-in lol. Grab an order of the onion rings too.  Easily the best onion rings I've ever had.  Grab a side of ranch w/ it too (hey, we both know you're not gonna eat healthy today).  Fries here are standard but the ranch is really good here and compliments the fries.   They also have a delicious orange-wheat beer which isn't too heavy, and it really compliments the meal well.  The pitcher is cheap too!! $15 for a pitcher. Service/Ambiance - 5/5.  Service is great, the servers will restock on supplies & stuff when your eating.  I also really like the bathrooms/cleaning stations here. Tips: -Come here REALLY early or expect a long wait time; usually I show up at 4-5PM and we can just walk right in.  If you show up during peak hours then you might have to wait a really long time (I'm super anal about my wait times so I try to help people out yelpers the best I can).

Went to Phil's because of a recommendation from a friend. Not gonna be in the San Diego area much, but I know that I will make every attempt to eat here every time when I do. The line and the wait wasn't too bad, seemed as though few people try to play smart and cut in lines and such but the wait wasn't much of a problem. The baby back ribs were pretty damn good, and their side of beans were simply the best I have ever had. I must say the macaroni salad was a little disappointing. Overall, I have nothing but good things to say from my experience there. Aside from waiting in line and trouble finding seats inside, the service was good, the food was great, and the price was just about right. I really do look forward to coming back and trying a lot of things on their menu.

Been going to phils ever since it opened at the old location off of washington and this place is even more packed!... probably 10 times more crowded now! i still remember the days when we could call in our order then pop in and grab a seat after we paid. They soon caught on and were smart to expand into their existing location and their newer San Marcos location. Awesome baby back ribs, awesome boneless ribs, awesome pulled pork sandwich, awesome beef ribs, awesome bbq chicken, awesome baked beans, awesome corn on the cob, awesome tri tip sandwich, the most awesome onion rings! Even their French fries are pretty darn good all drenched in the leftover Phil's BBQ sauce.... Mmmmm makes my mouth water just writing all this. Did i mention this place is freaking awesome!

I was never a fan of BBQ and that whole ordeal all because of a ruined store bought ribs I got somewhere. But I decided to give the whole bbq thing another shot. And not just any kind of bbq, but Phil's BBQ. Go big or go home right? This place is unbelievably packed I'm pretty sure everyday. Noon is when it starts picking and towards the PM time it gets really packed. The line would literally rap around the corner of the building where you could see people eating outside hah. But don't get me wrong peoples! The food they had to offer was pretty damn amazing. Not your average beef/baby back ribs or bbq sandwiches. These meals come in pretty sizable portions. And the quality I would say is pretty high up there if you love meat! If you're hungry I recommend the full beef rib dinner which isnt too bad for around $20. Something light like a sandwich I would recommend either the Broham or the El Toro. Every bite of those bad boys are delicious. And let me tell you about the sides they got, well, one in particular that I personally love, their Onion Rings. Not just any ordinary onion rings. They call these bad boys Colossal Onion Rings haha. Comparable in size to doughnuts maybe :). But hey with that dip that comes with it I think ranch or something - oh man heaven. Let me tell you after going there the first time. I am now a huge fan of BBQ! Oh and their sauce? Man you just gotta go like next time anyone's visiting Socal SD! Check it out! It's worth the wait! Looking for a place to binge on food this is up there.

We were in San Diego for a vacation and while watching the Travel Channel this place won for best sandwich, so of course we had to check it out. When we got there, the bbq was awesome! quite possibly the best bbq i've ever had, and I'm from NC! would definitely visit again next time were in SD.

I just don't get the hype.  I think my problem with Phil's BBQ is that there isn't an option with the sauces they offer.  So you either love it or you don't.  George Carlin once mocked advertisements for convincing the public they can use the unnatural words "tangy" and "zesty" to describe foods stating that those are not real words and I agree with the man, God rest his soul.  But for some reason those are the only two words I could come up with to describe Phil's sauce.  Now, given the meat has to be some of the most beautifully tenderized meat I've ever enjoyed off a rib bone, but the sauce just killed it for me.  No denying the quality of their meat and preparation is top notch, but the sharp flavor of sweetness was the card to blame for toppling the house.   The same goes for the onion rings and fries.  The quality of the food and the preparation can't get any better.  You know you're biting into the best onion ring when the entire onion doesn't slither out of the batter from your first bite like a snake shedding its skin.  It stays put with every bite.  But where's the flavor?  Where's the party?  It's like the douchebag who shows up to the kegger without the keg.  You're glad you found the spot but now the failure of one dude who's sole responsibility was to bring the party to life makes you settle for a single bottleneck waiting back at home after the long, head down drive.   Phil's substance quality is nonpareil.  I agree with the rest of top raters on that.  If there were sauce options like spicy, smokey, tangy (oh wait, they got that covered) and so forth I imagine they would do that well as it does appear they do take tremendous pride in their production.  But I still don't get the hype.

The line suck but the new Phil's in Santee will help the issue.  This is the Best BBQ in San Diego.  I have tried the others in San Diego but I'd rather wait in line and eat here because the food is the best and customer service is outstanding.  Must go and eat spot when you are in San Diego.

I think the overall rating for Phil's BBQ speaks for itself.  It really is that good!  Phil's has put me in many a food coma.  I usually get their tri-tip sandwich.  There is almost always a line so if you go by yourself or with a real small group your best bet may be to skip the long line and try your luck at catching a seat at the bar.  You can usually order beers while standing up and stalking patrons at the bar to leave.  A must try when in the point loma area.

Even better then everyone says it is.  The ribs here were more tender and flavorful then anything i've had, and my family's from Texas!   We came here after the Holiday Bowl at the Q after my Cal team lost to the hated Texas Longhorns.  I wanted sympathy ribs, and they sure turned my night around. You know a place is good when all around you are happy Texans, especially since bbq is all they really have going on over there.  I brought some pulled pork sandwiches back for my friends.  Instant hero. I can tell that this place queues up pretty fast, judging from the Disneyland style line set ups they have going on, but if the meat is this good all the time, I can't think of anything better to get rid of the bitter taste of defeat.

I've lived in San Diego for the majority of my life but my dislike of crowds prevented me from trying Phil's BBQ.   After reading several of the less-than-5-stars reviews, I can understand their complaints.  However, I am a member of the 5-star-crowd and I wil explain why: Upon arrival, there was an estimated 21 minute wait to order.  Big deal, I've waited longer at other places.  Besides, standing in line gives the illusion of progress, rather than standing around waiting to hear your name called.   Once at the ordering counter, we quickly placed an order as we had 21 minutes to decide.  My boyfriend ordered the beefy ribs and chicken dinner, while I foolishly ordered a pulled pork sandwich because I thought it would be small.  HA. HA. HA. Seating is a free-for-all, and I have a feeling that arriving closer to the traditional lunch hour would be quite frustrating.  However, we came a bit before noon so we quickly found a table.  I've seen come critical remarks about the soda fountain, calling it confusing.  All I have to say is if you're confused over walking up to a soda fountain and serving yourself, then Welcome to America, I hope you enjoy your stay here.   So, so far we have encountered an ordering and seating system more akin to fast food than restaurant fare.  If that turns you off, then by all means pass up Phil's.  There is no table service, and no-frills.  Do I care?  No.  I just paid $6.95 for the World's Largest and Most Delicious Pulled Pork Sandwich, and all I can think about is "THIS IS DELICIOUS".   I have had a variety of beef ribs in my life and I typically go for the baby back because they're easier for me to eat.  Not the beefy ribs here.  My boyfriend handed me a rib to try and the meat fell off the bone and into my mouth.  Holy smokes, that was juicy, tender, AND tasty!  I would likely order that for myself on my next visit to Phil's.  I also had a taste of the chicken breast which was a bit dry but still good.  But come on, chicken?  Please pass the ribs.   As for the sides, we split a large order of onion rings (big mistake, a small would have been better for two) and my boyfriend ate his whole corn on the cob with his dinner.  The onion rings are excellent and I miss them already.   So yes, and excellent meal and I do believe the food is a good value for the price.  Best barbecue I've had in San Diego and I am looking forward to more!

You're not living life if you haven't tried Phil's. The beefy ribs here are massive! I'm usually full after 2 of those monsters. The half rack of baby back ribs is a lot easier to finish and just as much if not more fall-off-the-bone goodness. I've also had the pulled pork sandwich here (as seen on Man vs. Food) which can be a bit on the saucy or not-saucy-enough side depending on how you like it. Personally, I think the sauce can get a bit much sometimes, but hey, it's BBQ sauce. You could smother a tire with that stuff and I'd eat it. I will say one of the disappointments here are the sides. I find the coleslaw to be very bland. A bit more vinegar and sugar would really spruce that dish up. Likewise, the macaroni salad is also pretty dull. I don't know if their beans are made there, but they taste like baked beans you could get out of any can at your local grocery store. They're still good, just nothing out of this world. The onion rings on the other hand are a different story - HUGE and deep fried onion goodness in all its glory! Chances are there will be a line when you get there, but if you're a virgin to Phil's and love BBQ you have to try it. Ask any local for the best place for BBQ and they'll simply tell you "Phil's".

Phil is the man I go to when I need a good porkin'.  Trust me, all girls need to get porked every now and again. The way his sauced up meat just slides down my throat is heaven.  I can tell by the he way he thrusts his meat all over my grill, this ain't his first rodeo. This is the place I come when I need a man to nourish me and fill my mouth and belly with his protein.  This is always the place I come. Oh yea, and the BBQ is good too.  I like the baby back ribs and once in a long while I will crave the Broham sandwich. The sides could use some work.

I have been here a couple times before and the food is hand down amazing, but on my most recent visit I was dissatisfied with the level of customer service. It is football season and there are many tv's around the diner and I asked 2 different managers to put football on the tv's and they refused to because its for the "bar only" which is always full and only has like 20 seats. Don't expect football crazy people to come back if they can't watch a game while they eat!

Phil's has the BEST bbq around. Im sorry Lucille's, but Phil's just kicked your ass. I ordered the beefy rib and chick-less dinner, which comes with either 2 small sides or 1 large side. I got about 2 beefy ribs and 3 large chunks of chicken. For the price you pay (about $13) it's definitely worth it. For the side dishes I got the coleslaw and potato salad and was pleasantly satisfied with both. The coleslaw didn't have too much mayo or that buttermilk stuff. Lastly, the bbq sauce is freaking finger lickin' gooood. I licked my ribs clean. Also, I guess Phils is in the TOP 10 BBQ places in the USA! GO PHILS!

Oh Phils! With so many glowing reviews is mine necessary? Probably not. The pulled pork was one of my personal favorites.Tender, lean, delicious. Served on a home made bun with coleslaw, well it is some serious lip smacking perfection!   There is a reason there is a line out the door here. But I took some of my trusted yelpers advice and i bypassed the line went in the side door straight to the bar, where conveniently there was seating and a Charger game on! Double score! I only wish they had a spicier sauce I like some heat with my meat! The bone on chicken  was better than the boneless. It was super tender and juicy with great smokey flavor. The tenders were on the overcooked side. I have to admit I am not a huge rib fan but I really enjoyed Phils. I did not care for the soupy beans. I like the peppery flavor but there were hardly any bean and a lot of sauce. The coleslaw was mediocre in my opinion. Overall Phils is the best barbecue I have had in awhile.

So I finally had Phil's BBQ and felt that it was needed especially since I reviewed two of the best BBQ's in LA. (JayBees and Bludsoe's) and having tried their bbq I can finally make what i believe is an unbiased opinion. Phil's beef ribs was amazing!!! beats JayBees and Bludsoe's hands down. For beef rib ive never had anything so soft and tender. As for the rest I think Jaybees is still better. Their sauce isnt as good as Jaybees and their sides were not as good. However their onion rings were amazing!!! When i finished my meal, I was walking out and saw their pulled pork sandwich and as full as i was it made my mouth water and my jaws drop!!! why didnt i order one of those!?! will come back and try their sandwiches. Overall this is one of the best BBQ's and it definitely deserves a 5 star!!!

Whoaaa there...What's the big deal? When I first moved to SD, everyone I knew was like, "OMIGAHH, have you been to PHIL'S? OHMIGAHH you HAVE to go! OHMIGAHH it's SO GOOD!". OHMIGAH, OK, let me help you put your eyes back into your head. Lord, Jesus. I wasn't happy to hear about the long wait, but my friends kept telling me, "It's going to be worth it.". Ok, it better be. Lucky for them (and me), I didn't have to wait in the line, since we found a place in the bar area. First come, first served. Ta-dow, how you like me now? The 3 of us seated ourselves along the countertops facing the window to the outdoor seating area. Pretty soon, a friendly, personable server came by to take our drink orders. We ordered 3 beers and they were brought back to us promptly. Now it was  time to order our food. I ordered what was called "The Best of Both", which included Baby Back Ribs and BBQ'd Chicken and choice of 2 small sides or 1 large side. I went with Baked Beans and Potato Salad. The plate was reasonably priced at about $12. *DRINK*TALK*DRINK* Then before we knew it... FOODS HEA! OHMIGAHH IS IT GUUUD OR WHATT? Yeah, it was good. But *#$Tf*#y@*(^#$ GOOD? No. Not even. Now, don't get me wrong, I love me some BBQ ribs. I truly do. But I am confused. What's with all the OHMIGAHHs? Friends, please help me understand.

First off, this place is an automatic GO TO THIS PLACE. Why? well read below This was my first visit because i was around the area, but let me take you on my experience. This place was true about the wait time, was in line about 1 hour and a half to two hours, but do not be discourage by the long line! Keep on reading! This place does not have servers or waiters, but has clean up individuals. Food at this place is I would say......AN EXPLOSION of flavor, you just keep going. I had only enough money in my pocket for a BBQ Broham (Pulled Pork Sandwich). Man the portion was huge it was only 7 dollars or so, but they gave me like a tray filled with pulled pork between two buns that it was spilling out. I came on this visit with my friend from UCSD, they got ribs, but they shared their ribs, which was an automatic fall off the bone, which is what you want in BBQ. Their sides are huge portions too so you will not go hungry leaving this place. The sides I had that my friends shared was potato salad, macaroni salad, and (sweet?) baked beans, and some Onion Rings, and finally Fries. All of this was so good, except the baked beans I didn't know they were sweet, I am not a sweets person so it caught me off guard, but I had to get accustomed to the taste, but it was great. Overall this place is a great experience and worth the wait does not disappoint would keep coming back here if I could.

As usual the line was long, but only waited for 20-25 min.  I had ordered the Quarter rib dinner with small Mac and beans. Jessica at the counter was very helpful and I loved her enthusiasm . Asked me if it was my first time and she explained briefly in how it worked at phils, which I  really appreciated. A real  hometown country ranch and warm setting. There is a separate bar area conplete with bar tables. My friends and I  actually sat outside, which was great because there were heaters as well. A breezy day when we went. The food was..... and you all are going to bust me for this.... it was okay. The BBQ sauce was a little too sweet. Meat perfectly cooked, juicy and tender. But with all that being said.... it was still okay. I had a difficult time thinking about how to critique this place because there is so much hype about the food. I really truly was honest and open to Phil's with high expectations, but it wasn't enough to take make me go crazy for this place. Apologies to SD, but this place is only a 3 star for me. I really have had tastier BBQ. If anything, when I do come back which I know I will in the future, I will revisit my review and it possibly maybe different.

Good place to pig out on the Californian version of BBQ.  I gotta be honest Im partial to my KC BBQ but this was an interesting take on BBQ.  Be prepared for a peppery tangy sauce very different from what we have in KC.  The food was executed well and the service was on top of it.

Typical bbq place.  I usually get the ribs because they are so delicious.  The meat falls off the bones and the sauce is sweet and tangy.  Prices are pretty reasonably.  Onion rings are a must have.  Occasionally they give them out when the line is really really long. Only downside is that so many people know it is so good that there is usually a wait.

Best BBQ ribs I have ever had.  Not something I normally order, but hey, this is a very well reviewed BBQ place so it was time to listen to fellow yelpers.  They were fall off the bone tender, and that sauce.  I think I dreamt of that sauce last night.  Spicy, tangy, perfect.  Its a wait, yes.  Even on a Saturday afternoon we were in line for about a half hour.  But the service was great.  From the greeter to our server at our table, their service was astounding!  Manuel was our table server and he took great care of us.  It was wunderbar.  =)  So, go.  Go early, and go often.

The wait was an hour to an hour and a half so we decided to grab some food to go. I fell in love with the onion rings and the order size is an amazing! I ordered a full rack of beef ribs and as I was eating meat was just falling off the bones. The food was very good and my only complaint aside for the long line was the potato salad. The potato's in my salad felt hard like they had not been cooked enough so that was a big let down.

Came here on Sunday Father's day for my birthday. My friends waited for two hours around two o'clock to get inside. tip. if you want to eat at the bar... I believe you can just go straight in and wait for a seat.. Anyways we ended up eating at the bar to watch the NBA Finals... I first ordered the Onion rings.. Straight Up best onion rings ever!!! They are likely chewy and crunchy at the same time. The ranch dipping sauce is good. My dinner was half baby back ribs and potatoes fully loaded.. Baby back was really good..  the meat is super moise like it falls off the bone. The back potato was hugh wrapped in foil with butter and sour cream. For dessert Rob gave us a whoopie pie.. Which is a car shaped circle sandwich with filling in the middle. Price: 13.99 for half rack and side. onion rings 5.00 for a large. drinks= 20 a person. wait: line was around the side and toward the back..Nice is the workers are super fast and they even give out lemonaide. I hear its super worth it.. but if your hella hungry then eat somewhere else cuz the line is long. Will come back

Really solid pulled pork sandwich in a huge portion!  Fries were good too, and the beans and potato salad were fine.  My sons really enjoyed the cheeseburgers, but it was a big one (they split it).  Beware that there was a 20 min wait to get in the door, which is apparently pretty typical on a weekend or weekday evening - so don't go expecting it to be a fast trip.  All the staff was really helpful and there were a good number of TVs for watching college football (or whatever else is on).

Went here this past Sunday and waited in line just under two hours.  Expected to wait long considering it was Father's day. This was my second attempt at coming here.  First attempt was sometime last year on a Friday evening, but saw how ridiculous the line was and decided not to fall in line.  This time, I didn't really have a choice.  My cousin kept ranting and raving how good this place was and wanted to take us here.  By reading a lot of the 5 star reviews, I had really high expectations. I ordered the full baby back rib dinner, with a loaded baked potato and macaroni salad.  I have no complaints about the food whatsoever.  The ribs fell right off the bone, the sauce was really tangy and could really taste the vinegar.  It was definitely delicious.  The sides were also good, but nothing spectacular.  This meal definitely did not blow my mind and it's sad to say that it didn't meet my high expectations, but the prices were very reasonable. Fan of the food, but not a fan of the hype.  In my honest opinion, long lines create hype, which skews peoples perception of what is really "the best".  I saw a lot of people say these are "THE BEST RIBS I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE." or "IT LIVES UP TO THE HYPE."  I completely disagree.  Either those people have never had other ribs before or they are just justifying the fact that they waited in a long line to say they had the best ribs ever.  I can honestly say that I have had better, but you can't really complain about the price. I would definitely recommend this place to someone that is visiting San Diego and has a few hours to kill and doesn't mind waiting in long lines.  I would definitely go back but only if we were driving past it and there was no line, which would probably be on a weekday afternoon.  Otherwise,  I had my experience.  Good food, but would not wait in a ridiculously long line for it again.  Kudos for the friendly staff and great service.

One of the finest renowned BBQs of San Diego! I have always heard great things about Phill's BBQ since it opened and after trying their ribs I understand why they have so much hype and a line outside the door. Their ribs are really tasty and I love that Phill's understands how messy they can be and has sinks lining the dining table so you can clean your hand periodically. I love that they sell their famous BBQ sauce there too,so you can enjoy their style from home too. It's worth the visit and the clout they have in San Diego

After living in San Diego for the past 22 years, the one undeniable fact I've come to know about our great city is that when it comes to BBQ, San Diegans wouldn't know great BBQ from a hole in the ground. I'm from Texas, and we're serious about the stuff, like we are about football. Phil's BBQ, for the folks that appreciate BBQ, is the biggest joke ever, and frankly when I see the huge lines forming around the side of the building, I am embarrassed that my town actually thinks this stuff is worthy enough for a hungry dog...let alone for human consumption. The first time I tried it was over 15 years ago, and it's gotten worse than it was back then. It's a cafeteria that serves faux BBQ without the slightest respect for what the real thing should taste like. Do yourself a huge favor, and either eat at Chic-fil-A, whose chicken is actually 100 times tastier and a lot less expensive, or eat at the Red Lobster and have much tastier frozen fish...it would still be a better bet. But if you're just ignorant to what BBQ is all about, which is not the sauce...which unfortunately you have to use at Phil's to add any flavor at all or to moisten the dry beef, pork and chicken, then stand in line and hand them your money, they're glad to take it while giving you the worst BBQ you should never eat in return. Better yet, just burn a steak to a crisp at home and drown it with ketchup...it would be better.

It's really hyped up. But I can understand why. Maybe I've never been to a spectacular ribs place, but within my memory, this is probably the best place for ribs that I have ever been to. Every time I go back home to SD, this is a top priority place for me to go out and enjoy with my friends. Pretty long wait typically, especially on weekend nights, but hasn't surpass forty minutes for the times I've been there. The way they manage operations is spectacular, as they serve a huge amount of people daily. The wait is worth it though. I definitely recommend the Beefy Ribs, or Baby Back. I've heard great things for their El Toro, the tri-tip sandwich. Pretty much any side on the menu is delicious, but their fries and coleslaw is my go-to. The sauce might be overpowering at times, but you can order the sauce on the side, which is what I'll probably do my future trips here. I wish they had a combo of the baby-back and beefy ribs, that would be my only negative point. Try the Beefy Ribs with Chicken combo, it's actually a really great deal. Onion Rings are also delicious here as well. Don't want to wait? Phone-in with a to-go order, and it'll take you ten minutes to receive your food. A great option.

Phil's BBQ is probably the best BBQ I have ever had. I am a real estate agent and when I have any type of brokers caravan I always want Phil's BBQ to cater it. Who doesn't love a great pulled pork sandwich. Not to mention the ribs are also a family favorite.

I we to school in the mid west. The bbq is good but it isn't so great that I would wait that long. My boyfriend says in the San Fernando valley, Dr. hoglie wogglies doesn't fall too short of Phils. Phils is still a little better but not for the wait. Here is a tip. If you aren't going in a big crowd, go to the bar area, it is first come first serve. We found two seats right away and didn't have to wait the 2 hours. We made it in and out in 45 minutes and had time to go see old town after dinner. We felt sorry for the people who were waiting in line. If you don't mind ghetto style just call in for take out, get a bunch of napkins and eat it in your car if you want to try this experience and can't afford to wait. Good BBQ but its not EPIC like in these reviews.

12:20pm arrival time...waited 1 hour and 20 minutes on a Sunday. Outcome...ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...just ehhhhhh.... Would I wait in the crazy line again and say it's worth it like the other people standing inline....NOPE! I dunno what ya'llz so crazy about this place for.  Drive to Oakhurst, near yosemite, and taste some REAL BBQ at Todd's Cookhouse BBQ...I just don't get it...Why so much hype? The sauce is also a bit too sweet, and drenched on...I prefer mine more on the dry side with a smokey deep sauce. Definitely boiled, charred, drenched, n served...

Great BBQ, the lines can be a little long, but it does move fast!  Make sure to 2 sides, as if you just get fries, it will be enough for 8 people.

If you've been in San Diego for more than a week and if you have a car, there is no excuse not to eat at Phil's. It really is the best bbq in the country (and I lived a year in Dallas so I can make that statement somewhat legitimately). This is the ONLY restaurant I will (gladly) wait in line for more than an hour.

I love BBQ. Did I mention how much I like BBQ? Love it! Thank goodness for Phil's I have not had this good of BBQ since I left the Berkeley/Oakland area. My favorite is the chickless (boneless white chicken) + pork ribs dinner platter. I like the potato salad over the fries. The only downside is that the line to get in is Disney-esque. I tend to avoid the line when I am there alone by going to the bar, where they have the full menu service.

4000+ reviews about this place so I doubt anyone will even care about what I say, but I will say it anyways. My experience at Phil's BBQ was a positive one. There was a guy giving out free popsicles while we were waiting in line! Thats fantastic! Theres also a fairly cute sticker for those who are first timers. So lets move on to the food. I had the Baby back ribs and my girlfriend has the pulled pork. Don't get me wrong, they were delicious but I think I just came in with too high of an expectation. Above average service and slightly above average food, and I will definitely come back whenever I am in SD. my main gripe is that I was not blow away. This place actually deserves a 3.5 in my books. I just thought it would have been a much more special experience.

A bit pricey but DEFF worth the price. I usually always get the half and half. Half chicken and half beefy ribs. the beefy ribs are sooooo good. I usually cant finish it. What's great about it is that even for leftovers, the ribs are still amazing. The down part of this place----it leaves you craving for more! And of course, there's the notorious wait in line. But obviously, well deserved. It's hard however standing in line watching and smelling the delicious flavors. Yet somehow I always find myself back in line. :)

Do I really have write anything?  They sell their sauce at Costco...nuff said. My fav are the baby back ribs with 1/2 chicken dinner.  I've tried the whole menu many times and I have never been disappointed. The only bad thing is it is not worth standing in the 2 hour line to eat there, so we frequently call in our order.

You see mostly young people here or entire families for a reason. It's almost always a long wait, and you COULD cook something just as good at home, but if you are overworked (family) or can't cook (lots of young adults) than this restaurant is the equivalent of awesome home cookin'. Don't get me wrong. The food here is actually fantastic. The service, once they have your order, is quick and friendly. The portions are very filling for around $12-16 per plate which will give you entree plus sides, also can get entrees or sandwiches/burgers for less. Its not the price that is dismaying, cause you get the value for your food, but the long wait during evening is a bit much. Expect to wait 30min to 90 minutes before getting there. Overall: Basically you should plan your whole evening around going here, stand in line with your friends and joke around, cause its going to be a wait. But once you sit down and grub it is one of San Diego's finest BBQ restaurants that is worth a try. 3/5 because of the wait, and although their BBQ sauce is great, you can buy it yourself and grill at home for less.

Yes. Baby back ribs done right. I'm not a ribs kinda girl, but when I crave it, I only crave Phil's. So from the 3,500+ reviews, you probably already know everything you want to know about Phil's. At 4.5 stars, there's not much else I can add. The meat falls off the bone and tastes as tender as you would assume it to be - it's smokey and piping hot. SO GOOD. The BBQ sauce doesn't overwhelm it either. Yummy! I'm also a fan of their macaroni salad... creamy, but not too much. Onion rings are good but too much to add on; I'd rather save my stomach space for the ribs. GOOD price for what you get! As for the line - it may be long, but it goes by quickly. Though, the second time I've ever tried Phil's, I discovered it's all about timing - there are short periods of time where Phil's has NO line (RIGHT between 11:30-12 ish)... just a tip. Phil's is a must-try. It IS as good as it gets.

Jeez this place has a lot of reviews. And yes, I sheeped my way there on my last SD adventure with K and we bought it take out to take back home to eat. We went around 3:00 and there was no wait. It was also a Tuesday so.... However, I have to admit, however weird it was to have signs telling you the wait time, a line of cashiers with the organization of a Disney themepark ride, bbq that can still taste fabulous and fall off the bone amazing after a two hour drive home is really good bbq. I was surprised at how small the menu is: basically chicken, baby back ribs and beef ribs but man, they make up variety with concentrated quality. Finger freakin' lickin' good. We spent $45 getting all three kinds of meat and they were all worth it. I can't wait to come back- but I'm still scared of how long my in dining experience may take. Those signs are scary...

Went for a late lunch on a Friday. People waiting in line out into the parking lot. Wow, must be great. Line moved reasonably quickly. Order at counter and wait for your food at a table. So far so good. Ordered caesar salad (below average but people aren't coming here for the salad), onion rings (really greasy and heavy and tasteless), half chicken dinner with macaroni and potato salad (chicken was dry, salads uninspiring), baby back rib plate with baked beans and coleslaw (ribs were exceptional, sides were dull and unremarkable). Not awful, but not worth waiting in line for for sure. I don't see what the fuss is about. Must be really lousy BBQ in San Diego if this is rated so high.

OHHHHH EMMMMM GEEEE! I've known about Phil's BBQ for quite some time - thanks to Yelp, but was always turned off by how long the lines were... Plus, I didn't think it could be THAT amazing since I've had authentic bbq in the real 'South' before... not just South CA. I decided to give this place a shot after re-reading the reviews about a to go line... and just so I could say I've tried it before. Boy oh boy, am I glad I did! We went on a Sunday afternoon and saw that the line wrapped around the building. They even had markers like at amusement parks stating how long the wait time is at a given spot in line. The to go line is on the left side and only had 1 party ahead of us. We were in and out with our food in less than 10 minutes and decided to enjoy it at a nearby park. The ribs were cooked to perfection and easily fell off the bone. Although half a rack of ribs and 2 sides is enough for 2 people to share... in retrospect, I regret not getting my own meal! All in all, a MUST TRY to anywhere remotely close to the area!

I finally just had Phil's BBQ and overall I thought it was A-OK. Yes, the ribs were very tender and I did enjoy the sauce! For ~$22 my party of three enjoyed a full slab of ribs, fries, beans, and mac & cheese. Overall, I do like the place! We waited about 30 minutes just to eat here. I did like the beans, they were flavorful! The mac & cheese were just A-OK... nothing too special about that. The fries were baked and highly appreciated! I do like how they have a sink outside the bathrooms so customers can wash their hands outside before waiting to go inside. For a place that specializes in BBQ and to be "Top 10 in the US", I expected the place to blow my mind. However, it was just standard to me.

I eat a Phils several times a year...only because I get the front of the line pass for my birthday and my friends and husband does too..bonus..sign up on their website and you bypass the long line on the week of your birthday for you and 4 of your friends.. priceless as the line is out the door every nite of the week. However this time  the hubby and I went for a San Diego Beer week event at their event center...separate from the restaurant..Needless to say it was fab..all you can eat  bbq slider, sides, chicken, brisket , riblets and beer..not crowded and beer to boot..this happens only once a year so get on it in 2013... so worth the ticket price, the food and beer, top notch service no children allowed 21 and over..EPIC!!  LOVE me some Phils!!

This place was a hit long before it was featured on Man Vs Food.  REALLY GOOD BBQ!  Beef ribs, baby back ribs, soft tender, smoky, and the sauce has just the right zing to it.   The lines are always really long, Around the corner long; so i've never eaten at the restaurant.  The best thing to do is to call in a take out order.  When picking up your order, you should know there are 2 lines, one for eating in and another for pick up.  Which line to stand in?  Just remember what Beyonce told you, "To the Left, To the Left!" If you insist on eating there, consider off hours, brunch, early dinner, check the website they have a web cam so you can judge the wait time (which for some reason PL location doesn't  seem to load on my computer) also note that they are closed on Mondays.  You can also find the sauce at Costco.

I first have to say that I normally dislike bbq. And pork. That flew out the window at Phil's, because I ate so much delicious bbq pulled pork, I could barely stand! My friend and I shared the pulled pork sammich and the tri-tip sammich. I honestly can't say which was better - probably the combination of multiple meats and bbq sauce! We topped that off with onion rings and baked beans (go big or go home, right?) Both delicious. I think their ranch should also get a special shout out - oh hey girl, you tasted delicious on my onion ring. Wednesday night at 9:30 the place was packed, but from arrival to food was only about 15 minutes - so this is definitely a good time to go! I kind of wish I were going again today......

Went here recently and had almost everything they offer.  Overall, it is very good, but some things were great, while others were so so.  Definitely not the best meal on the entire western US, or one of the 10 best restaurants in the US, or any of the other ludicrous superlatives that have been lavished on it.  It IS, however, very good BBQ. The baby back ribs were tasty..they had a nice smoky flavor with the sauce which is tangy and sweet.  The beef sandwich was also very good...the beef was sliced into small pieces and they had a very good meaty, sweet flavor, and it was very generous.  The sandwich had a ton of meat falling out of it.  The pulled pork sandwich was also very good, and similar to the beef sandwich.  Nice texture and consistency, a ton of meat, and a good compliment to the sauce.  The "famous" onion rings are pretty damn good also.  They have a very good onion taste to them, unlike some other rings that you cannot even tell have onion in them.  The battering is thick and delicious as well. The baked beans were pretty mediocre...they tasted like a can of cheap beans.  The vegetables were also pretty sorry...they just tasted like plain vegetables, no seasoning or anything.  The chicken tickler, which is basically just hunks of bbq breast meat with sauce were ok, but not that great.  They are a little dry, which you might not notice since they are slathered with sauce, but that does not change the fact that they are otherwise a rather large and thick hunk of somewhat dry breast meat. Overall, it was very good.  Nothing was throw away gross or anything, although some parts were less than stellar.  The fact that you are guaranteed a semi long wait to sit down also knocks it down a bit.  We waited 1 hour to order and sit down while standing in line.  Honestly, as I said, this lowers my rating a bit, because while it is definitely very good BBQ, it is not worth standing in line for an hour.  Also, the inside is pretty disorganized, with some staff telling you to find your own table, others are telling you they will get you one, and being told not to take this table or that one for whatever reason.  There is a take out line, which supposedly takes like 10 minutes, which is a better option if you want to take it home and eat it.

Nom. Phil's has the best beefy ribs. Meat with a bite; tangy and spicy BBQ sauce with caramalized yummy bits goodness. Sides are so so, onion rings are a must. Might be a bit overhyped considering the long wait times plus extraordinary yelp reviews.

3500 reviews and a four 1/2 star average and I'll admit I was thinking curiousity probably killed the cat, but whenever I see ratings like that I feel a strange compulsion to go and find out. Here the question was, is this place really that good, or is the Pink's of the San Diego culinary world? The answer is somewhere in between. First impressions weren't that promising, everything about this place screams middle of the road chain. It was disappointing there wasn't more charm or ambience. It's really not hard to decide what to try, practically every review clearly states baby back ribs, bbq chicken and onion rings. I'm intrigued that the reviews are so consistently high, not because the food isn't good but because this is actually not the most popular style of barbecue. Generally it seems most people prefer or expect the smoky style of Texas but this is closer to the sweet and mildly spicy Kansas City barbeque. On the positive side, I can see why this is so insanely popular. Like most good chains they've developed a memorable and tasty formula for their food that is likely quite addicting after a few meals here. The onion rings really stood out, they really are quite a delight. About as good a version as you're likely to find. The chicken was also a standout, moist and tender, it's really quite good. On the flip side, the sides were adequate at best. Corn on the cob was tasteless and mostly inedible, cole slaw was average. The baby back ribs were good, but certainly not even close to the best I've had. The masses obviously disagree but then I wouldn't wait in line for this or any other food, but I also woudn't have a tizzy if someone made me eat here again. It's not the greatest barbecue ever, sorry fans (although it could conceivably be the best in San Diego as there doesn't seem to be much competition), but it's pretty good all told. Four stars feels a little generous to me, but it's certainly better than a three so I'll round up. Best Plates: BBQ Chicken, Baby Back Ribs, Onion Rings Palate: Mainstream Food - B+ overall (bbq only A-) Ambience - B- Service - A Value - A

Finally! Phil's BBQ. Everytime I was invited to go to SD and try this place, it never worked out. I finally tried this place for the first time over the weekend and it was some goooood stuff. It wasn't fun driving here since Cirque du Soleil was playing at the sports arena right down the street. It took forever to get through that traffic! Once we got there, we found parking and a seat at the bar immediately. No waiting! Isn't that amazing? I've heard about nothing but the wait and beef ribs in the past. Anyway, I started off with an Orange Wit which is basically a hoppier version of Blue Moon. Yum. $4.50 for a beer? I wish we could have stayed longer. The beef ribs are huge and delicious but a little too heavy for me. Joe and I shared a full beef rib dinner with baked beans and potato salad for the sides. The baked beans were too sweet with the sweetness of the bbq sauce but the potato salad was bomb. Oh yeah, and we ordered small onion rings. THE ONION RINGS ARE GOOD! I don't even like onions, but they were delicious. My girlfriend got the tritip sandwich which was also very delicious. I would totally get the sandwich for lunch. My experience was awesome because I didn't have to wait. Would I have waited over an hour to eat here? Mmm maybe, maybe not. Regardless, the food is great, service is excellent, and I recommend everyone else who doesn't mind a wait to try Phil's at least once.

I wrote this review after going to eat there.  Then I get a YELP email telling me the review was not within their guidelines and the review was dropped.   1) I went there, waited in line. 2) I ate the food, couldn't believe the dreck they call food.  SALTY KRAP. 3) I came home wrote what I thought.  My simple and sincere observations. So I will re-post the same review, because this is the honest truth!   What you read below us the orig post from early Jan. So ya like the place? Ask to see their BBQ. They won't show you because THEY DON'T HAVE ONE. Ribs in convection ovens and them flopped on a burger grill and burnt. Cover with "sauce" and..... True BBQ is described as meat, slow-cooked, using wood smoke to add flavor. There is equipment designed just for this type of cooking. Barbecuing is not grilling. Grilling is cooking over direct heat, usually a hot fire for a short time. Barbecuing is cooking by using indirect heat or low-level direct radiant heat at lower temperatures and longer cooking times. The distinction between barbecuing and grilling is the heat level and the intensity of the radiant heat. It is the smoke from the burning wood that gives barbecue its unique and delicious flavor. San Diego has so many wonderful restaurants, some even prepare BBQ. Sadly not this one. Don't waste the time waiting in line for food you can make better on your gas grill at home.

One of the best food experiences of my life. We came on Sunday night to celebrate my birthday - there was a huge line out the door so we ate at the bar. The bartenders were incredibly friendly and welcoming - it felt like a home away from home. Hubby and I shared small order of onion rings & we both loved our sides - I had baked potato and my loverboy had corn on the cob. The baby back ribs were to.die. for. Anyone who can't give this place 5 stars needs to become vegetarian as this was a meat lover's paradise. Besides the wonderfully friendly staff - we loved the hand washing station!!! :)

I love Phil's BBQ! Sometimes it's better to call in, order to go because the line to go is way shorter, the line to dine in is always busy and the line sometimes go around the building, but either way, it's WELL WORTH THE WAIT, if you're willing. It has a medium sized bar area with tv's that's great for sports events, some might even consider it small though. The dining/eating area seems like a good old fashioned country club with wood accents everywhere, it's got that southern vibe with a nice and cool atmosphere regardless of all the hustle and bustle. The people are great! Sometimes you can catch Phil workin' with his workers and that's dedication coming from an owner. Service is quick and easy. *Food: The menu is easy and not overwhelming...it only gets overwhelming when you can't decide what to get. I'm always getting the boneless chick-less dinner, BBQ broham and the el toro, I love it so much that I would marry it! It's so good i'm startin' to sweat just thinkin about it *sigh*...so sexy! The chicken is sweet and juicy, BBQ'd to perfection, it has the right amount of juiciness and tenderness. The BBQ sauce is sweet with a hint of hickery, it's not so much smokey but full of just heavenly flavor from Phil's rub (which you can also purchase a jar of). The El toro is very soft and succulent, it practically melts in your mouth, the same goes for the BBQ Broham. The meat is so tender that it just melts in your mouth...just like M&M's but SOFTER! There are no words to really describe how good phil's BBQ, that might be overstated but you just have to try it out because it's just awesomely good...to me at least...and some others. If you visit San Diego you gotta try Phil's BBQ, it's kinda like a San Diego type of deal. Go with a group, friend or by yourself, either way, it's a win.

I've been dying to try this place, and it did not disappoint! I came with a big group of friends after we had all gone to the San Diego zoo together. The line was pretty long, and my boyfriend tried to get us to go somewhere else once he saw that line. Thank goodness no one wanted to listen to him! The line wrapped around the restaurant but it actually went by pretty quickly. They have a camera out there to take a picture of your group while you wait to kill more time. And once you get in to order, the food comes out super quick. I think my food was ready like 3 minutes after I got my beeper ?! The boyfriend got the baby back ribs dinner while I got the beefy ribs dinner, so we could try both. Personally, I liked the baby back ribs better. All of my friends swore on the baby back ribs. I should've listened. They were exactly what I imagined for mouthwatering, delicious, and tender ribs. The beefy ribs were still good and tender cooked in the same sauce but it was chewier and those things were big! I like eating ribs with my hands and boy you can't eat these with your hands! Unless you wanna look like a caveman... I didn't even finish one whole beefy rib! We had massive leftovers. For sides, I got the baked beans and macaroni salad and the boyfriend got cole slaw and potato salad. I especially loved the cole slaw. It was so light but crunchy. My fork kept moving towards the boyfriend's plate the whole time we were there. The potato salad was also really good and had big chunks of potato but wasn't too heavy. Macaroni salad was good as always. The baked beans were nothing super amazing but still good, your typical baked beans if you've ever tried from anywhere else. But the best thing was probably the onion rings! They were gigantic but SO SO good. You must definitely order these if you ever come. Perfect amount of crispy batter! Definitely the only place I would wait in a crazy line for. The food is that good and service is great too. Everyone who works there is super friendly and attentive to your needs! And you'll have enough leftovers for another feast the next day. Make sure to ask for extra BBQ sauce!

I finally ate here. It was awesome, but with all the epic reviews and my friends fawning over it, I was a little underwhelmed. Maybe I had too high of expectations. The line wasn't too long, at about 7:30 on a Wednesday night, we waited maybe 20 minutes from getting in line to ordering. Our food did come out super fast though, boyfriend barely sat down before his food was ready. He got his usual, the baby back rib tickler and the broham (yeah, both). If you don't know, the tickler comes with fries, slaw, and two onion rings, no substitutions. It's quite a bit of food and boyfriend always loves it. The fries are really good, especially dipped in barbecue sauce instead of catsup. He got a "fry" that was basically a chunk of potato about as big as my wrist and it was hilarious. The broham is a pulled pork sandwich that has cole slaw on it. Pro tip: ask for the slaw on the side and you'll get more. I got a small caesar salad to start (not the best I've had but really big for being a $4 "small". I got the "Chick-less" dinner, which consists of chunks of white meat chicken in the barbecue sauce, along with either 2 small sides or one large. I got 7 large chunks of chicken and a baked potato with sour cream and cheese. I was not expecting the cheese to be a slice of Kraft cheese, but it was. That was weird. Potatoes are potatoes, but this one wasn't too dry or anything. The chicken was really good, not dry, nice and flavorful, but the sauce left something to be desired for me. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it was SO tangy that after a few pieces, my tongue was sick of it. And I LOVE sour, tart, tangy candies and foods. This was kind of a turn off. Overall, it was good, and I'm glad I finally ate here, but it wasn't anywhere near as mind-blowingly good as yelp and Man v. Food led me to believe.

Drove there from Riverside thinking we were about to eat some authentic BBQ!!! Boy were we wrong!  I didn't enjoy the food at all!! The sauce is tangy and not good! It's not authentic BBQ, to me the ribs are boiled and grilled just to get that BBQ look!! I would never go back!! Want real BBQ try Lucille's and Smoke House BBQ in LA!!

COUSIN'S BACHELOR WEEKEND: PART I - PHIL'S BBQ On Cinco de Mayo weekend I went to San Diego for my cousin's bachelor party. I wouldn't normally write eatery reviews on Yelp but since we were coming from the San Francisco Bay Area and the amount of money we plan to spend in San Diego I felt it was important to put my two cents in. This was the first eatery stop. It was on a Friday. We originally were supposed to have dinner here but at the last minute decided to have lunch here instead. Before I decided to place an order for myself my cousin decided to place an order for the whole group. He ordered two full baby back rib dinners. The two sides were fries and coleslaw. The ribs were moist and tasty and the two sides were pretty good (personally I'm not a sides type of guy as I would rather focus on the main item in this case the ribs). However one of our friends ordered the beef ribs. And it's rare to find a place that not only serves pork baby back ribs but also beef ribs. As they were eating their beef ribs and stating how those ribs were really good I was about to go back in line to order the beef ribs for myself. Not only was the line long (the start of the line was outside) but I was already full from the baby back ribs and the two sides. Looking back I wish I ordered the beef ribs. My ratings are based on what I ate. Had I ordered the beef ribs my ratings would at least be one star higher. That's too bad because I don't know when I will head back to San Diego.

Been here a few times. TRICK TO BEAT LINES - Call it in from your cell phone in your car. It'll be ready for pickup in 10-15 minutes. That way you beat everyone who stood outside waiting. It worked for me... Meat wasn't that great to me... but then again, I frequent Texas BBQ often in the year, so I shouldn't compare Texas BBQ to San Diego BBQ... Phil's meat is what I expect San Diego BBQ to taste like... Their sauce and sides were good though. Didn't like potato salad too much because of the red potatoes used. I would suggest Jones Brothers off Logan and Euclid for better Meat. Get the meat their and come back and pick up the sides you phone called and ordered from Phil's

Very good BBQ; light on smoke, but very tender with a good char. The sauce is a well balanced tangy/spicy/sweet creation that doesn't overpower the meat. Sides are overall average, but the exception are the amazing onion rings. Don't mistake these for those pre-fab types; these hand dipped beauties are quite possibly the best onion rings anywhere.

The line for sat lunch was not bad at all, I think we waited around 20 min or so.  I really like how tender the baby back ribs are and the sauce is amazing.  I also got a bottle of their BBQ sauce and the dry rub to try it at home.

I'm going to keep this review short because I don't want you to waste anymore time trying to think about whether to go. Just go. Get the baby back ribs, half-rack, full-rack whatever you're feeling, just go. My personal favorite sides are the french fries and beans but i can say in full confidence, that anything that comes out of the kitchen here is bound to taste delicious. I'm pretty sure if they lathered that amazing bbq sauce on a dirty rag it would still taste good. Meat falls off the bone, sauce has the perfect touch of zesty sweetness, service is GREAT, nothing can ever go wrong here. Oh, except the wait. The time always varies but even if I have to wait over an hour, I will always make sure to get my Phil's BBQ fix whenever I'm in San Diego.

I've been to Phil's quite a few times in my life and I always stick to ribs.  They're fantastic.  But this last visit changed my life forever.   Unfortunately for me, my Neanderthal upbringing never allowed me to consider eating boneless BBQ chicken.  That's sacrilege where I come from!  "Real men eat meat from bones", was a common statement heard on Sunday BBQ's with Dad. But these boneless chunks of sweet BBQ laden chicken breast flesh have changed me.  I ordered the Chick-less Dinner on a suggestion from one of my healthier friends and my goodness, I didn't know chickens could taste this good!  Put down your forks and use your opposable thumbs, man!  I've finally found the true meaning of BBQ chicken and sweet baby Jesus, it is delicious! This moist tenderness of edible perfection cannot be duplicated with the sincerity in which this chicken was created.   Chicken that separates the hens from the boys.  It's so good, chickens would eat this chicken.

Meat lovers rejoice!  I am not a meat lover, but I do occasionally enjoy some ribs! Came here for dinner and the line was very, VERY long.  However, it actually moved pretty quickly.  The three of us ordered half a chicken with steamed veggies, beef, and baby back ribs.  The ribs were so delicious.. the meat fell cleanly off the bone and it was so juicy.. they were definitely the star of the night.  Chicken was good too, but it wasn't completely far off from the usual roast chicken you can get at Costco (which I enjoy, occasionally). The bf was definitely jealous that he wasn't able to partake in this feast.

Tuesday 2:30PM= No Line. Thick, heavy, sweet and smoky sauce with a zing. Beefy ribs and Pork ribs. It's unfair to try to judge this place after my Kansas BBQ adventures. The meat was tender,but I was overwhelmed by the sauce. If I return, I'd ask for sauce on the side...

Process of my meal: Stand in line in excitement. Hear so much about the amazing ribs. Sit down finally with ribs in front of you. Bite into ribs.. Expect ribs to be the best ribs of your entire life. Let down...... I can honestly say that eating the baby back ribs was a big disappointment. I got the Baby Back Rib teaser and the best part of the meal was the onion rings! Those I still craveee to this day. Surely not as special as everyone assumes it to be. Go in with no expectations and low hopes. Maybe then you can leave satisfied.

So sad writing this review... I have been a loyal Phil's fan for quite some time now. We dine at both locations and looked forward to the new one in Santee opening. However, I doubt I will be eating there again. Went to Phil's this weekend with a party of 6. Of course there was a line but we were sat right away due to the amount of people. Off to a great start you would assume. We ordered and were given a buzzer. Well the buzzer didn't work. The server saw us sitting there for a while and checked on our food twice, but never brought it too us, we just assumed it was not ready. When the food finally did arrive most of it was great, but not all of it. Some food was cold as if it had been sitting in the kitchen waiting for the rest of the meals, and we also did not receive all that we ordered. Upon taking the receipt up to the front letting them know we are missing things, the girl working at the counter told us the server would bring our food. He never did. Went up a second time to remind them, and still no food. Finally went up for a third time (we were practically done eating at that point) and asked for a refund on the food we did not get.  The manager was not pleased to give me a refund and definitely was not very nice about it, but eventually he gave me my money back. I hate writing this review but Phil's as a sign outside that says something like "before you yelp, let us help.." Well we gave them plenty of chances and still nothing. I hope it was just a bad day for them because there is really nothing like Phil's BBQ.

My first impression was, "The long lines are so expected that they have signs directing you to the entrance!" Your bang for the buck in San Diego. You want good quality meat, you got it. You want variety, you got it. You want flavorful, rich barbecue sauce, you got it. You want hearty sides, you got it. You want crispy hot onion rings, and original beans with your ribs, you got it. You want huge portions that will make you fall into a food-coma afterwards, you got it. All of it together at a family friendly style restaurant, and you'll be back to do it all over again. The lasting impression? "Short and simple, git your fingers dirty and leave happy."

Fell in love with BBQ and Ribs after coming here for the first time last year. The wait made me so anxious but it was worth every second. Once we got in, you order in the front, get your number and find a table to seat yourselves at. So it's kinda like a fast-food joint but no worries, take your time. You waited sooo long for it! Ordered the half baby back rib dinner order which was about $13.25 roughly. Now I wish we had gotten the full rib dinner for $18.95. Came with 2 sides and we got the potato salad and french fries. Along with that, we had ordered the El Toro sandwich that consisted of char-grilled deli sliced tri-trip topped with bbq sauce. And of course, a small order of the colossal onion rings. BABY BACK RIBS 5/5 - mouth-watering, tender, flavorful, juicy. basically an orgasm in your mouth, no joke. It's that yummy!! EL TORO 1/5 - The deli/sammich was so burnt and not tasty at all :( and not a big fan of tri-tip. I don't know why we even ordered it or even listened to the girl who recommended it. BLEH horrible taste she has! ONION RINGS 4/5 - HUGE! Realllllllllly oily/greasy. But yummy in my tummy. Couldn't finish it though :( All in all, a good experience, oh and they have bibs for you! Hehe. I needed one 'cause I'm a messy eater. Will I come back again? OF COURSE! I just need to find time to trek down there :( damnit, why must it be so far away! Someone recommend me a bbq place that is much closer to my home in the 626 area please! But I doubt there is one that lives up to Phil's expectations.

I would give 3.75 Stars to be exact, but I'll round up for them. The first time I went to Phil's was probably 8 years ago at their old location, and I didn't think it lived up to the hype so I never went back. Fast forward to Memorial Day Weekend 2012, and I decided to give it another try since people STILL raved about it and I stayed close by. Bottom Line: It IS pretty good, but I wouldn't stand in that huge line for it, nor would I travel a huge distance to get it.  I would definitely recommend the to-go route, which took less than 10 minutes. If you're a BBQ aficionado and only appreciate true slow smoked BBQ, however, then you WILL be disappointed. My impressions: 1) To Go Service was excellent, fast, efficient.  They did forget to give me my sides, but they corrected that quickly.  The line attendant was friendly. 2) Full Rack of Baby Back Ribs w/ sides: I slow smoke BBQ as a hobby, so I typically expect a smoke ring and more robust smoke flavor.  I believe Phil's ribs are finished over wood, so there is some smokiness but it's hit or miss depending where you bite!  The sauce is tangy and flavorful, which I think is what most people enjoy about the ribs.  They're very tender, but I usually prefer a little more bite to the meat.  I give the ribs 3.5 stars, and I would prefer Lucille's BBQ ribs over these (if you wanted to compare commercial ribs).   I got the macaroni salad and cole slaw with it.  The macaroni salad was very good I thought, and the cole slaw was your standard run of the mill slaw. 3) Pulled Pork Sandwich: this was actually pretty good!  Surprisingly there was a lot of smoke flavor in the sandwich, and it was HUGE.  I was most pleasantly surprised by this.

I like it saucey! That's right! Pour all that sauce over those ribs, (chicken) breast and thighs. Yum and delish. And those onion rings- oh my word they are goooddd. Now I'm just salivating over eating some more of Phil's! You literally have to wait to get in this place. However, don't fret over that long line you see because it goes by quick. AND when I came here (on a Thursday night), they passed out free French fries that were mighty crispy and delicious while we waited. And yanno all that sauce I wrote about? Well, they have a huge sink by the bathrooms dedicated to clean all that sauce off. But you might not need it, because the sauce is finger-licking-good!

Straight to the to-go line on the left. I listened to some random lady standing in front of me in the dine in line for a few minutes wasting my life. Fries:  pass on that , it's not great. Flat , didn't taste seasoned or crisp . Cole slaw....damn this was actually good , nice and sweet. Light on the mayo. BBQ : What makes this different from other places?  I didn't see me no fire pit, only  a bunch of hombres( thumbs up - you guys looked like you where flooded with orders) grilling in the back.

I don't understand the hype. At all. I came here because of the great reviews. I ended waiting in line for close to an hour, thinking "this better be worth it!", It wasn't. The food isn't BAD, it just didn't live up to the hype. I'm not a fan of their style of BBQ, I prefer juicy southern style BBQ, theirs seems to be more of a Kansas style maybe? I'm not sure, but I prefer a sweet sauce compared to their very vinegary sauce. The other thing is everything seemed too dry.  I tried the pulled pork, I hated it. However, the ribs were good. In the future if I order here, I will only get the ribs and I would call the order in ahead of time. There is no way in hell I would ever wait an hour for that BBQ again. I do have to mention that the staff is very friendly, didn't want to throw them under the bus with this rating :p

Yes, Phil's is San Diego's most popular BBQ joint. It's simply amazing. The Point Loma location has lines out the door and wrapped around the corner with wait times around 45 minutes. Thankfully, their second location has opened in San Marcos and I don't have to drive the 30 minutes that I used to for some Phil's. I love the baby-back ribs here, when something is this good, you can't help but get it time after time again. The full rib dinner is good to split between two, at least for my standards, but I honestly don't eat that much. The BBQ sauce has the perfect amount of smoky tang. Out of all the sides, the mac salad is my favorite. The service is quick and friendly. You should leave there with no complaints and fully satisfied.

saucy fall off the bone ribs!! yea boy! phil's got top 10 restaurant in the states! i love the baby back ribs! rib & chickless & red velvet whoopie pie for the win! Hands down the BEST BBQ I have ever had! The line here is always out the door and around the building since they moved from their old school location in Mission Hills to Sports Arena. I always order the Ribs and Chickless which is great! The Sauce is tangy, sweet, smoky and addictive. The Ribs are fall of the bone tender and mouthwatering. I eat those things clean like the bones were made for preservation in a museum of something. It's that good! Everytime I even go to Kolby's closeby, the smell of Phil's always draws me back in! To avoid the long line, I always order by phone and pick up. That way I get my fix without the wait!! Ask for extra sauce for dipping! The bar area is great too and they carry local craft beers and wines. Be still my heart. I love Phil's!!

OMG I thought I new what good BBQ and ribs were until I came to eat here. I used to think Famous Dave's or Tony Romas made some good ribs, but now I will never go back to those places. I have had the baby backs and the beef ribs and both are 5 star excellent! I also love their potato salad and macaroni salad and if you are in the mood for onion rings they make some giant ones here. Pair that with a pint of Windansea local brewed beer and it makes for one dang good meal. I recommend this place to everyone I know Quick Tip: If you have a small party or group, you can usually find a place in the bar to sit and dont have to wait in line and can still order all of the same items.

Wow... the line wraps around the restaurant during dinner time. People weren't kidding about the line. But it moves fairly quickly. We started off at the back door but got to the counter to order in about 30 minutes of waiting. It was nice of the restaurant to send someone with a tray of hot onion rings for people waiting outside in the line. I got the tickler and the husband got the quarter rib dinner. The ribs were tender and moist, and the sauce was thick and tangy. I like tangy. The potato salad and cole slaw salads were good too. If the lines are too long for your liking, you may want to try the bar. You might have to hover behind people to nab a seat. We tried this for 2 minutes, but it got too stressful, so we decided to suck it up and wait in line, which wasn't all that bad.

I've been here 4 times within the last year. You would think that's not very often, but I live in the LA county area. I only come to San Diego for Phil's BBQ. That's about a two hour drive for their delicious ribs! My friend was the first to introduce me to Phil's BBQ. He lives in the San Diego area but went to school in LA with me. The first time be brought me to Phil's BBQ, I was so very happy. Since then, I knew I had to make more trips to here and I did. I said I've been to Phil's 4 times, I've only been to San Diego also 4 times. So to me Phil's BBQ is a must every time I come to San Diego. I always get the full baby back ribs here all to myself. My friends sometimes want to share, but I refuse. I always get the fries for my sides. They're just regular fries, but dip them in Phil's BBQ... then their PHIL'S BBQ FRIES; the best tasting fries ever! I came earlier today to introduce Phil's BBQ to my co workers. Like me the first time I had Phil's, they immediately fell in love. We love Phill's BBQ!

I love Phil's. I can't say enough about how great this place is. Whenever I am in the SD area I make sure to go here at least once or like my last trip, I made it there three times. The beef ribs are fantastic. I typically order either the tri tip sandwich and 2 beef ribs or the pulled pork and 2 beef ribs. I have tried the sides bit I am there for meat so forget the beans and replace them with ribs. The only thing I would like is a bit less sauce on the sandwiches. Its a must visit place in San Diego. Also I recommend calling in a to go order and just taking it down to the beach to eat, unless you like waiting in line.

the DL: simply the best BBQ in San Diego. bang for your buck and unmatched in flavor. I grew up on Phil's. Went to St. Vincent's when Phil's was on Goldfinch and we would walk over and get fries and BBQ sauce... plus some amazing ice cream (they don't do ice cream no mo'). Phil's is so daaaank that they singly handily took out the other restaurant in the area. The smell would be so attractive that no one would dare try any of the other local fare. At one point Phil's tried to reconcile with the other businesses in the area and built a huge ventilation system that was supposed to de--BBQ the air. At this point Phil's was so popular he said "ta hell with Mission Hills" and moved to the Sports Arena location and began his conquest of San Diego. If you have never been... it is quite the spectacle. Huge lines, a full dining hall, and a packed bar. Don't get scared though... the system works! Once you have ordered you will be eating in no time! I would, however, if you aren't a fan of lines... TAKE-OUT! They have a completely separate line set up for the phone ins! Food? Yes they have food. It is all so good. Broham, El Toro, Cheeseburger w/ those delicious onion rings on top, Caesar salad w/ BBQ Chicken, fries, and RIIIIIIBS!!!

I don't understand what all the hype is. Phil's has good food, but not any better than any other place I've been for ribs. They put WAY TOO MUCH BBQ sauce on their sandwiches, so if you get one of those you should ask for it on the side. Their ribs are good, but like I said not any better than some other places I've gone for ribs and I certainly wouldn't wait 2 hours in line to eat them. We have gotten food to go. They are an okay restaurant, but certainly not the best.

I'm probably like a tear drop in an ocean of compliments for this place, so I'll keep this short. Dress Code: dress comfortably because this food will lay you out. The good: Erry'thang. More specifically, the baby back ribs and a bunch of corn. Can you make this at home? YES. Will you? NO. Let the pros slow cook that meat to juicy tenderness for your lazy southern comfort food loving butt. Trying to eat light, get the pulled pork sandwich. Its the baby back ribs minus the bones. I don't think I'll order that because I like to get my hands dirty. The bad:  popularity precipitates lengthy lines. I'm really digging deep to find something bad to say. r/sm

Excellent BBQ and large portions! Got a half rib of baby back ribs ($11.25) and a small macaroni salad ($1.50) to share with one other person. Neither of us were starving, so this turned out to be a perfect amount of food. It would probably be enough for one hungry person to eat and have some leftovers, but the full baby back ribs would definitely be enough for two to share! The baby back ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, sweet and wonderfully tangy. Great macaroni salad - but be forewarned, it's very peppery. The onion rings are HUGE! I don't even know how they manage to get that much batter on them, or where they find such big onions, for that matter. The fries were OK, but tasted much better with some creole salt and ketchup. Also tried a bite of the BBQ Broham sandwich, and while the meat was yummy, this was also VERY peppery. Lucky for me, I didn't have to wait in the hour-long line. Came with a group of 25 people and the staff at Phil's was soo friendly and accommodating. We were seated outside on the patio, and the server offered to grab us extra BBQ sauce and ranch. While I had a great experience and felt the food did live up to the hype, I don't think I would do the whole 2 hours in line thing for it either... Try to come here right when it opens!

I'm always getting the 5 bone beef dinner with fries and macaroni salad; you cannot go wrong with that! By the way, my wife and I always share that and have left-overs, unless you are a big eater, you might want to get the 3 bone version. The ambiance is great, the service is fast too. The only downside is the line! Unless it is you or a group of 4 and no bigger, you can cut to the front and go to the bar section.

I got the El Toro sandwich.  It was the best sandwich I've ever had. Best BBQ hands down. When I drove to San Diego this past June to live here, I ate at this award winning BBQ joint in Missouri that had a bunch of BBQ trophies in the window. IMO, Phil's beat it by far. Like a lot of people say, long line, but worth it!  Friendly helpful staff, great food.

Oh boy...I think I am the last person to review this place....For those of you who live in SD or are longtime residents your mind is probably already set...but for visitors this review is for you.... Atmosphere - Typical BBQ joint.  Please note that unless you eat in the bar you place your order at the counter (a la McD's) and they call/buzz you up when ready for pick up.  They do have errand boys running around to assist you with some stuff but the drinks and food are self-service.  There is no table seating so your best bet is to have someone order and someone stalk...yes STALK cuz it's usually packed...a table.  The bar has TV's and a U shaped bar to sit at.  They also have outdoor seating now and beer as you wait...nice bonus. Food/Beverage - For those of you who have ever eaten BBQ outside of SoCal, Food Trucks or BBQ Fairs the sauce here will taste tangier to you.  If you don't like that well then you are SOL baby cuz they only have 1 flavor.  For those that enjoy a more honey, hickory, spicy, etc sauce...do not come here.  Also, no serious BBQ place would not have beef brisket on their menu...c'mon man.  Their sides also leave a little to be desired.  That being said I do like the quality of their ribs (both), pork and chicken...so for me it boils down to the sauce...which isn't awful...but I feel I could get better at Ralph's. Cost - Now the cost for the food isn't too bad at all for all of the (misplaced) hype.  You can get out for $30 (for 2) if you sit on cattle seating side....since there is no need for tip...sit in the bar and add 20%.   Summary - For visitors I STRONGLY recommend you not make this a priority for your trip or you most likely will be disappointed ...not to mention waste 3 hours in SD where we all know there are MUCH better things to do than stand in line.  It is an inexpensive decent place to grab a meal if you can get in and out fast...but I drive by this place daily and I can count on one hand how many times there hasn't been a line around the corner.  Shit if people would look around they'd see that Bull's Smokin BBQ is 2 miles away with no wait and better selection..although pricier. BONUS BONUS BONUS Sneak in the back and stalk a seat or two in the bar...you will get your eat on faster.  Or you can call in your order and be in and out in 5 minutes....it's not like the ambiance is the selling feature or part of the "Phil's experience."

Phil's, I love you. Really. I have eaten BBQ all over the US, tiny joints and big famous restaurants. I have my favorites but Phil's is perfect EVERY time. I haven't had a bad meal yet. I love the sauce. I love the sauce so much that I buy bottles and use it at home when I'm broke and need a Phil's fix (my meats are never as good but hey, I'm SUPER happy that they sell their bottled sauces and rub). The price is great too, I hate when places gauge you on their bottled sauces. The wait, yes, expect to wait a long time if you show up at like 6:30 on a Friday night. This is why I come on off days or a little earlier/later dinner. I've never waited longer than 45 minutes. The onion ring samples while waiting suck you in. They are delicious, crispy, good onion to batter ratio. Once you get in and up to the counter, order, and grab a seat, you get your food pretty fast. One time I was in, I ordered, grabbed a drink, and just as I sat down at the table the buzzer went off. awesome. I always get the baby back ribs. Tender, delicious, coated in sauce. Side of fries, coleslaw. The coleslaw is so tasty and crisp and a good palate cleanser when you're in sauce overload mode. The chicken is pretty good too, and I also like the corn on the cob. I already commented on the o rings, they're GREAT. If you're a light eater don't get a full size meal unless you like leftovers because you are guaranteed to have some. The portions are MORE than generous. You will make a mess and you will get sauce on you somewhere, so be sure to take advantage of the paper towels and hand sinks. Most of the staff is awesome, friendly and helpful. And try a whoopie pie. Most people forget, I grab one to go sometimes. Tasty!

WUT WUUUT 10 minute wait !! The secret!? If you have a small group of people, or on a hot and sexy date with just one other person, go to the bar area; it's first come first serve! Unless you're wanting to take in the entire Phil's experience (1.5 hour wait, and all), creep into the bar and sneak attack warm seats after 30 minutes (at most). Pork ribs = to die for. Beef ribs = effing delicious. BBQ Sauce = just the right amount of tang and sweetness (the boy begs to differ, but he doesn't like anything that tastes good.. hehe) Chicken = AIGHT. just aight. YES YES YES GO GO GO YUM YUM YUM NUM NUM NUM

Great BBQ menu, so many options so little time.  Beat the lines at the front and zip your way to the bar!  Will be coming back for ribs for sure.  This place is all about RIBS RIBS RIBS everybody!  Prices are affordable for the quality of BBQ you get here.  Good ambiance and great dining experience overall.  Will try shredded pork burger next time I am in town.  Just made my stomach growl typing about this mmmmm!

Really San Diego? This is the best BBQ in the city? It's decent. I don't think you'll ever get a bad meal here, but really it's an average BBQ place. I hate to write negative feedback or talk trash, but this isn't remotely close to the reviews it's been getting. It's been around for awhile and people love it, but honestly I believe people are settling because there are hardly any BBQ spots in SD. I'll stop in from time to time to make sure I'm not crazy and the stars weren't aligned on my visits here, but I believe Phil's could step their game up a bit to deserve the stellar reviews they've been receiving. I've had bbq in quite a bit of places around the country, and I'm definitely no bbq expert, this is run of the mill. There's not one item that stands out here. I've had much better bbq in places that aren't even know for their bbq. I can't believe there hasn't been people from Texas, Kansas or the Carolinas coming to SD and capitalizing on the lack of bbq yet. If you're craving bbq and don't want to travel out of the city, go here.

By far the best BBQ I've ever had and one of the best places to eat in SD if you're looking for food and not scenery. I've Been a fan since the Hillcrest location but you could never find a place to sit during busy hours in those days. Although this location is fairly large be prepared to wait in a line comparable to an amusement park ride if you show up during peak hours. Recommend the beef bones and the El Toro sandwich. Not a huge fan of the sides but who cares, you wont even notice them you'll be busy stuffing your face with everything else.

Overrated. Why do people like to HYPE up places? Man...gets my blood boiling especially when it's about food, BBQ ribs for all that matter. Anyways, I don't understand what the hype is about with this place. The sauce is good but I had better; it's called Kraft. Jk. But on a serious note, this is mediocre BBQ at its best. I mean, they don't even offer cornbread or greens! You call yourself a BBQ joint with NO cornbread or greens? Service was super duper awesome though. That's really all I can give them.

I think the hype of this place speaks for itself. I am proud reviewer 4201 and I am sure the list will continue to grow. So I would like to shed a new perspective into this little giant that you call Phil's bbq. The food itself is not eye opening. Sure the meat falls out the bone and the just melts in your mouth. Sure their portions are ginormous. However, is it something that is hard to replicate? I don't know. The bbq sauce overpowers the flavor of the meats. At some point there isn't much difference between ordering the baby back ribs or the beefy ribs (go for the beefy ones as it has more meat). The sauce is tangy (from vinegar and tomato product), spicy (cayenne and other spices) and sweet (from sugar). For what it is, the food is up there. However, I am hesitant to give it 5 stars on the food alone because quite frankly I don't think the flavor and textures themselves are the sole reasons for this restaurant success. The onions rings though are quite amazing. Do go for 'em. The reason Phil's bbq is successful is because the business model is second to none. I don't want to take anything away from the quality of the meats or their excellence in preparing one thing well, but as far as business go, good food itself won't make this restaurant a transcendent business. High volume, high speed, and big portions is what makes this a success. Lines are ginormous at any time of the day, but it is possible to be seated in reasonable time because the restaurant operates like a fast food joint. As a matter of fact, I got my food in about 1 minute upon ordering (2 minutes tops); I didn't even have enough time to fill up my drink cup or find a place to sit. Silverware, drinks and plates are all self-serve, which eliminates the need for servers (speeding up the process). Food is cooked in high volume to keep up with the demand. In fact, they have expanded into 4 locations and even bought food trucks for catering. To give you an idea how amazing this model is, consider this: San Diego county has ~3 million residents. If only 20% of residents had Phil's once a year, assuming they spend $17 a person, they would have a yearly gross income of $10.2 million - obviously we haven't even begun talking about carrying capacity, you math/statistics folks. This is of course a big underestimation of how much they actually make considering their 4 locations, catering options, big orders, multiple-time and out of town visitors. Essentially, they sell their stuff as fast as they cook. Remarkable. You could seriously learn a lot about the food industry from Phil's bbq. Everything from marketing to operations they do well. Do I think this is the best bbq place in the country? I don't know. Is it the most successful? Arguably so.

I ate here before I knew what real southern BBQ was like.  Phil's is like Mc Donald when you don't know what real burgers should taste like.  They grill instead of slowly smoking their meat and to cover for that they (or you) need to drown your meat into their really sweet (but again not smoky) sauce.  Since I discover Coop's in Lemon Grove we have never gone back there.  And the line up was Terrible.... All the time.... Any hour..... Terrible!  Do yourself a favor, go try real southern smoky BBQ....

The ribs were great, I was a little disappointed that they didn't have Mac and cheese on their menu. But over all the BBQ was some of the best I've had,being from SoCal. BUT I must warn, the customer service is Horrible! You order at the front, like a fast food joint and they were extremely rude both times I've been there, so it wasn't a fluke. So if you are willing to put up with some attitude from a young snotty lady for some great BBQ, then I recommend it.

I am from the South and I grew up on some authentic bbq and I must say this spot is hands down the best bbq joint I ever been too. Before today it was a close call between Famous Dave's, Lucille's, & Texas Roadhouse.  After my first visit, I know have a #1 bbq joint. The long line and wait is the only down fall but it is totally worth the experience.   It even has an area in line where you can take photos and print them out from the store.  Also, there is a little stand where you can buy beer and wine.   I had the best of both order with baby back ribs and chickless (white meat), and 1 small order of coleslaw and 1 small order of potato salad.  The baby back ribs literally was my favorite. The meet was really juicy, fell right off the bone and the bbq sauce was Flavor Flaverful.   Since there are only 2 of this food chain, I highly recommend this place if you want REAL bbq for friendly service, great price, and big portions.

Went to the desk at out hotel and asked how close another bbq joint was and they said if you really want BBQ you should go to Phil's. We did. We were very happy we did. Food was incredible portions were perfect, and prices were extremely reasonable!! I tried both the pork and beef ribs, and the tri tip. Ribs were incredibly tender. Sides were outstanding. Just truly one of the places where everything comes together perfect. They put a lot of sauce on their food and the sauce is good but if your like me and like to taste the flavor beyond the sauce I suggest getting the sauce on the side.

So good it'll make you wanna punch a puppy in the face!! This place is always packed during meal times because its that good. But don't get discouraged. The line may be around the corner but the line moves pretty quick and its worth it!!!! I've never had a bad experience here and to be honest I can't get enough of it. They might not have a huge selection, but everything they serve is on point! Things to try -tri tip sandwich -best of both worlds (BEEFY RIBS and CHICKLESS) -cole slaw -eat at the bar The ribs are second to none here. Not sure how they BBQ it but the meat falls off the bone like it had no business being there in the first place!!!! If you get the beefy ribs, the meat will literally slide right off if you pick it up from the bone. Its a nice simple menu with the "meat and potatoes" of any good BBQ menu. Its all seasoned and marinated perfectly and then its painted on with more of Phil's specialty bbq sauce. Its a very casual atmosphere and you go find any open table after you order (the staff is good about helping people find open seats). Paper towels at the table so you know its party! Their BBQ sauce is DELICIOUS so I dip whatever I can in them. Portions are heavy and hearty. I'm not a huge fan of cole slaw, but the one here is soooo good. It's not too drenched in the dressing or whatever. Chicken here is also very good because its not dry at all. There is also a bar in the back which is a fun place to eat. Bar is decent with the most popular beers on tap. Bartenders are real cool and you can eat at the bar too! Plenty of tvs everywhere so its a great place to watch a game and get your grub on! I can not rave about this place enough!!!! I am no longer in San Diego and miss this place like an old friend. Cannot wait to go back!!! (I don't usually use exclamation points, but when I do, its for Phil's!)

Wasn't a BBQ fan until this place came into my life! I use to hate BBQ things because I just didn't like the taste of it, but this place is BOMB. BOMB enough for me and my friends to order it to go and eat on the sidewalk or inside the car because the wait was too long to eat inside. Which is a good tip for all you eager eaters! If you don't want in the long line, best bet is for you to order it to go and just eat it elsewhere! It's most likely busy more than half the time so expect to wait! The french fries are also really deliciously seasoned too, and hot sauce goes so well with everything. Customer Service is always great, and nothings going to stop me from coming back in the future. :) Recommendations: Best of Both Worlds

Wow. Hands down the best bbq I have ever had. What made this experience even more interesting was that we went on a Friday night and the wait was barely 15 minutes!!! We were stunned, but once we got inside it was still packed. My friend ( a girl) and I split the ~20 full dinner. We got the babyback ribs along with 2 macaroni salads. At first I was iffy on sharing the food, but we could not even finish it! My other friend got the beef ribs (which I got to try and it was better than the babyback ribs) and he can usually eat a lot but he could not finish it either. The must get are the tempura'd onion rings. The best onion rings I have ever tasted!

Wow, Phil's BBQ must be doing something right with over 3000+ reviews! I came here after my friend recommended it, and I'm so glad that I got to try Phil's BBQ.  We were warned that it can get super busy with long lines, so we came at around 3pm for an early dinner.  There was definitely no line for the cashier, but the place was definitely packed! After looking at the menu, I shared a full rack of ribs and fries.  We had to pay and then look for a table.  There was probably at least 60 tables inside, and most of them were filled with happy customers eating bbq food.  I was glad that we were able to find an empty table at 3pm. We had to wait about 15 minutes before our food buzzer went off.  The full rack of baby back ribs was slathered in bbq sauce.  There was a huge mound of crispy fries next to it.  The baby back ribs was super moist and delicious.  I loved how the meat fell right off the bone.  The fries were cooked perfectly, too.  It was a bit crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I liked how Phil's bbq offers bibs for their customers.  I noticed a few people wearing them, too.  Its very convenient that they have sinks right outside the bathroom, so customers can wash their messy hands. Overall, I'd definitely come back to Phil's BBQ!

Wow, can't believe w/ 4000+ high star reviews I would disagree so strongly. Did not really enjoy my lunch here at all. First they say everything comes with sauce well it's way too much sauce. Ask for sauce on the side. Second the chicken was terribly dry. We had half a chicken and their chicken chunks and both were soooooo dry. The baby backs were ok but nothing outstanding. The onion rings were huge and decent. The fries were like In N Out and the same bummer 5 min later. Oddly the better part of the meal was the macaroni salad. The portions were huge as well which seems wasteful because there is no way to eat it all. Maybe the pulled pork is good or beef ribs but no chance I wait in a line for this food. Sorry, don't get it.

Since my Mom "discovered" unlimited texting, she texts me more than she used to call.  Here's her latest text. She has this annoying habit of using caps when she thinks it's an important message: PHIL'S  BBQ  LNCH SAT GO I have always enjoyed the food from Phil's.  I always call ahead for pick up. The ribs are delicious.  I enjoy the beef ribs more than the pork.  There's more meat,tender,fall off the bone,delicious,dripping flavorful fatty meat... I also love the sauce, which I always order on the side. I love sweets. The side dishes are not that spectacular, coleslaw,corn,beans,onion rings, not the greatest,but edible.

Unbelievable.Blow my mind. When I first saw the line, I wanted to leave. I'm glad my boyfriend made me stay. I can't believe there is ever a line that I would gladly wait in, but this line is it. The baby back ribs are exactly like everybody says: melt in your mouth, fall off the bone, tender, delicious, and juicy.   I personally think that waiting in line exacerbates the hunger so when the ribs arrive, it tastes extra good. But, this place is easily one of the most delicious meals I have ever had.

Not exactly five star quality ribs.  Or maybe this place has been hyped up too much.  On a recent trip to San Diego, Erin L, Matt P, Jenni H, Robert H, and I decided to try out Phil's BBQ.  We tried to get there around 5pm to beat the dinnertime crowd.  However we failed miserable. I blame this on Matt P and his poor navigational/planning skills. Anyway, we arrived to Phil's a little after 6pm.  The line was ridiculous.  It wrapped around two walls of the restaurant.  Instead, we decided to order to go.   We had a rack of rib, half a chicken, coleslaw, and baked beans.  The ribs were good.  They weren't too sweet.  And there were no hard or chewy pieces.  I liked their chicken because it was very moist.  The side dishes were pretty average.  And you don't really get a lot when you order a large or small size.   I would not wait in line to eat here.  The dining area inside is dark.  And it's a cafeteria style setting.  This is more of a takeout kind of place.  Takeout service is quick.  And you still get all the good food that Phil's BBQ has to offer. You can also sit at the bar and order from there.  You avoid the lines.  And, you get to drink alcohol with your BBQ. :)

With all of the hype surrounding Phil's, my road tripping comrades and I concluded that we had to make our way here for dinner on a recent day trip.   We showed up at 6 on a Saturday evening.  Big mistake.  The line out the door wrapped a good 50 yards around the entire length of the building that Phil's occupies.  After speaking to a local in line, we were informed we'd have about a 45 minute to hour wait, and was supposedly worth every minute of it.  Waiting an hour or so just to get seated wasn't in our schedule, so we placed our orders to go and they were ready within 10 minutes!  Had we waited in line, we would have just been seated by the time that we were able to get some drinks at a nearby CVS and finished feasting on our meal at a nearby park. Now on to the eats.  We ordered 2 orders of the pork ribs and the barbecue chicken.  The ribs were good.  Not too tough and slathered with a good amount of sweet sauce.  I'd recommend these to any rib lover.  The chicken was tasty too.  The barbecue on the bird wasn't nearly as good as the taste of the ribs, but the meat itself was cooked to perfection. Sides included beans, coleslaw, and a baked potato.   I think this place is a little over hyped, but the food was good and very affordable.  Would I come back?  Yes.  Would I wait an eternity in line for it?  Not so much.

There's kind of no point in writing a review for somewhere like Phils. But I guess here goes just because it's the San Diegan thing to do. Phils is delicious. Expect a long line out the door and around the restaurant. Expect there to be no parking. And expect the food to be finger licking good. I recommend the baby back ribs with macaroni salad and french fries. But.. honestly I think you can get anything here and it would be satisfying.

Quick Tip: Call in. Get food to-go. Eat in your car, or preferably, right outside - to make the people waiting in line jealous. The pork ribs were disappointing and small. However, the BEEFY RIBS were gigantic and amazing. The sauce is deliciously tangy, especially with their natural cut fries. The Beefy Ribs are the size of my face, and you will seriously be stuffed after eating 2 ribs. SO GOOD! Next time, I'll have to save room for the whoopie pie.

awwwwwwwww yaa! once upon a time, I used to be a carnivore. Then it dawned on me, cows are nice. so are chickens. why eat them? broccoli and carrots and avocados...those were the real villains, so I became a vegetarian to make sure that I eat as much of them as possible before they eat others. anyway. this was hands down the best american bbq I have had ever. The ribs the ribs the ribs. RIBS RIBS RIBS just fall off the bone and into your mouth. Sauce or no sauce, side of corn or mashed potatoes or even both! food tastes home cooked and with the amount of business this place gets it is UNBELIEVABLE how great the food consistently is. I don't like waiting in line, so I try to go on the off nights. No more meat for me, but that doesn't mean no meat for you. :D

My friend Katherine Y. and I met up with a couple of our college friends here for lunch on a Thursday at 1pm. There was hardly a line everyone talks about but we ordered and were seated within 10 minutes :) My friend and I split the order of half rack ribs with cole slaw and macaroni salad for sides. The ribs were really tender and the meat came off the bone easily. The sauce on the ribs was flavorful and the sides were really good, especially the macaroni salad. The waiters checked on us frequently and were very friendly. Now I can see why this place was voted for top ten best restaurants in the U.S. because of their delicious food, fast service and an overall great atmosphere :) I would come again to Phil's if there was pretty much no wait in line lol

So everyone keeps telling me that I did not order correctly here. Apparently getting bbq chicken at a bbq restaurant is wrong wrong wrong. I wanted chicken, so sue me! Yeah my bbq chicken was not the best. The sauce was great. Very sweet and tangy. The skin was nice and crispy. The dark meat was moist, but the white meat was dry. Half my dish was great, and half was not. I had one of my friends pork ribs and it was fantastic! The meat was soft and just fell off the bone. Afterwards I wanted to return my chicken and get the ribs. They were just that good. I definitely made a mistake. I am not gonna get the chicken here again. If I get to come back I will know better next time. Note: If you come right when they open, which is the perfect time for lunch, you can avoid the long lines.

I always get the chkn tickler or beef rib meal. White meat was a little tough this time but isn't white meat usually? I love the buttermilk dressing and my meat soaked in extra bbq sauce. Nevertheless, I love the spot. My guy would give 5 stars! OHHH yea, I buy the seasoning as well.

This place sucks. This is my first time to Phil's BBQ, for sure it's my last time. I heard about it long time ago, and checked reviews on yelp. I was pretty anticipating. I have stopped by Phil's many  times before, 2 times it was closed, other times there were too many people waiting. This time I persuaded my friends waited with my for an hour, just for the FAME. Thanks for my friend paid the dinner, now I'm really sorry for your money. The food; To be fair, meat is ok. Baby back ribs are pretty soft and juicy. But all meat were burned  to black. All of us don't like the sauce flavor; it is just average, not worth waiting for an hour. Also, to us, the worst thing is all ribs are same flavor. Is there only one sauce? I don't wanna be mean, maybe just because I prefer Asian taste too much, it's hard to me to accept American flavor (But I do like Phil's neighbor a lot) . If you have same problem to eat Asian food, just ignore me.

I love the atmosphere here, and Phil's is definitely the best BBQ in San Diego, but I really do think the food is overrated. I've been here a million times. I've had take-out. I've been to birthday parties. Heck, my friends have even rented out the side room! But every time I eat here, I just think to myself that it's so not worth the hype... it's not bad, it's just not worth the hype (nor the 2-hour long, wait in the rain Disneyland-esque lines!!). The baby back ribs are aiight. The meat isn't especially tender and though it falls off the bone, it always seems a little bit dry. As for the sides, other than the potato salad, nothing has been too memorable. I will say that the chicken is pretty dang good though! Juicy and flavorful-- just wish I had discovered it sooner! What is outstanding is the service! The staff is so wonderful and friendly and I fondly remember one of the servers planting a juicy wet kiss on my friend for his birthday... twice! In the end, the food is not bad, and I have many good memories attached to this place (watching Lakes games, pounding on the tables like savages, circling like vultures looking for a table, countless celebrations, late-night post-finals binge fests), so 3 shiny stars for Phil's BBQ!

Let me start by saying that I'm almost leaning towards a five star review, but I feel like I will need to go once more to really make that jump. The lines are long; I think we waited about 45 minutes.  They did have a beer stand outside near the door, so that's a plus.  A little alcohol will always make line standing more enjoyable. When we finally got up to the counter to order, we went with a full rack of baby back ribs, the broham sandwich, and an order of onion rings.  The baby back ribs were SO MEATY and tender.  They fell right off the bone.  The BBQ sauce they use is really tasty as well.   The onion rings, to die for!  They're really big and fried perfectly.  The kind that you bite and you DO NOT end up with the  whole onion in your mouth. My least favorite item (hence the 4 stars) was the broham.  Maybe we were too full from the ribs, or maybe they were having an off day, but the pork was a little on the dry side.  I prefer my meat more "wet." All in all, great food and great restaurant feel.  They do a good job of keeping customers happy and the restaurant clean, even with the high traffic.

For me Phil's is one of those places where I can only go when I'm craving ribs, but when I am actually craving them... words cannot explain how delicious the ribs are. I always order the baby back rib dinner with macaroni salad and fries. SO GOOD. I've tried their chicken tickler once too but honestly I would just stick with the ribs because that's what they're famous for. Also, something that might be good to note is that if you come in a party of two, skip the line and just head to the left side where there's a bar and try to find seating cuz sometimes the wait can be really long. A must come if you've never been!

I've heard a LOT of good things about Phil's and when I was down in SD I KNEW I had to go! We got here a little before 12 noon on Friday and the wait was only about 7 min before we got to order. I've heard stories of people waiting 1.5 hours for this place and I was glad the line was short! The beefy ribs are so juicy! The chicken was also juicy and not dry like other places so that was awesome! The onion rings had a tasty batter! The dinner meals with either 2 small sides or 1 large side is the way to go at this place. My chicken dinner came on top of a large pile of french fries! Everything was slathered in yummy BBQ sauce! After you order you grab your own seats and the pager lights up when your food is ready. Then get ready for some messy grubbing! The only thing I have to mention is that the bathroom closest to the entrance on the left when you enter only has one stall, but there's a large sink outside if you just need to wash your hands. There are also additional restrooms on the other side of the building if somehow the person in the bathroom takes FOREVER...

What is the ultimate test of good BBQ? IS it how the meat is so tender it falls off the bone? Is it in the sauce itself, or how it incorporates all the slow-cooked smoky goodness. No my friends, the ultimate test that distinguishes good BBQ from GREAT BBQ is that when you have GREAT BBQ you will lick and suck on your finger to get that very last bit of flavor and not think twice about where that finger has been. I found myself in this exact predicament the first time I came to Phil's. It is a good thing that we are no longer primates and  eat with our feet because the way I was going at it, I would have probably been branded as having a shrimpin fetish. The BBQ was so good, I wanted to down the sauce in shotglasses.  I couldn't even pause long enough to remember if I had washed my hands or not.  Did I use the bathroom? Did I scratch that itch in between my toes or in the nether regions?  Who cares?!?! Just keep it comin and don't stop.  In hindsight I think that I had washed my hands otherwise my wife would have shot a look of horror my way. After I was all done, I looked like the fat dude from the Twin Peaks movie who got lipstick smeared all over his face from makin out with Laura (Wow, where did that come from? What kind of BBQ makes me think about David Lynch movies?). Don't let my four star rating fool you - it is really good and probably the best bbq on the Pacific Coast.  I only reserve the 5 stars for the best bbq that I have ever had - and in that case I put the leftover bones in my bed so I could sleep with its aromatherapy. Forget the San Diego Zoo and Shamu.  Phil's is the area attraction for me.

My favorite is the Beef Rib dinner. These things are HUGE and DELICIOUS. The Baby Back Ribs were ok for me, but I would come here everyday for the beef-- if I could afford it. It's expensive for a college student like me; but with the portions they give out, it could probably feed me for days. :D Also, It's worth trying at least once. I hated bbq sauce until I tasted Phil's. Their  sauce isn't too overpowering, and I actually wanted more of it.

This place has some down right finger lickin PHENOMENAL bbq. As the most highly rated restaurant in San Diego, a line wrapping around the building, and a pig on their website that oinks when you squeeze it, I expected nothing less! Definitely not your regular sit-down restaurant. You begin by standing in an endless line, salivating through the glass at the people eating inside, passed several giant menus and a beer stand (in case you want to make your time in line that much more enjoyable), you then order at the register, grab your fountain drink, a table and pick up your food when your buzzer goes off. Then the time comes to devour the ooey gooey fresh and MEATY baby back ribs. You could drink these ribs with a straw they're SO tender! Although.. I don't recommend it. It is marinated in both dry rub and wet marinade, topped with bbq sauce that is then caramelized, then topped with more sauce! I also had the beef ribs that were good but I'm not a huge fan of beef ribs in general. The peppery and creamy macaroni salad is GREAT. Oh, Phil's BBQ - Won't you open a location in Orange County?

If you haven't been here then you are truly missing out of some amazing, juicy, heart-attack bringing, finger-licking good food. Phills is a great place to get a huge portion of food at a reasonable price. My favorite is the 5 bone beefy rib dinner. I normally share it with a friend since it comes with a large side. For $20 it's totally worth it. The staff here is sooooo nice. They are very quick to keep your table clean and are always making jokes with customers. I highly recommend coming here but keep in mind it is a lot of meat so if you want to stay alive for a few more years I would recommend only coming here twice a month

Perfect example of San Diegans just repeating what they hear from others. I've eaten BBQ at many of the best in the country (Salt Lick, Smitty's, Fette Sau) and Phil's is such a joke in comparison. If it ain't slow smoked, and dry rubbed, then it's just comparable to what we can grill at home. So it better be super high quality meat, grilled to perfection, with great sauce. At Phils, they use sub-par meats, often overcooked, which they have to douse in a sauce that is is cloyingly sweet, and not even smoky! If you want to have real BBQ find out where the  Slo Cal BBQ truck is parked and have some real Q.

Yep, I'm going to do it...I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and give this place five stars.  :) The food is smoky and sweet and spicy and there's a LOT of it.  People are constantly checking on you to make sure you have enough sauce or ranch for your COLOSSAL onion rings or drinks and these people don't get tips.  The customer service here is genuine and beyond anything I've experienced in YEARS, let alone in California. Yes, there's a wait.  We waited two hours.  But it was so completely worth it.  If you don't want to wait that long go to the San Marcos location, but I'm glad we didn't leave.  And I miss good bbq.  I had the tri-tip, onion rings, and a sangria.

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! I come here EVERYTIME I come to San Diego! Yeah, their meat isn't about the actual smokey bbq taste, but it's their sauce that makes them AWESOME. And how can you complain when their sides are awesome, their employees are awesome, and their beer choices are awesome?! Once in a while i'll get a few burnt pieces, and every time I ask for a replacement of just the few pieces, they just give me a whole new meal with new sides.

This BBQ cannot be beat!!!!  Phil has perfected the BBQ here.  The only drawback is how long the line is to get in.  The wait is well worth it, but it can be an hour or longer in the evenings.  The ribless is my favorite, but the baby back ribs come in a close second.  Love this place.

Came here on a Saturday afternoon, around 1:30pm after a day of hiking nearby. Hungry as shit, I wanted to eat!! And then I saw the line... WTF IT WRAPS AROUND THE BUILDING?? But my buddies tell me that what I saw wasn't that bad. I had waited for an hour, and the nice lady by the cash register was telling us how later that night it would actually be close to a 2 hour wait. PHEW The set up and ish gets a 3.5 or so, but this rating isn't for that. BABY BACK RIBS. These 3 words say enough. My first time here, and I had high ass expectations because of all the reviews and the word of mouth. Boy, my expectations were met. Split a full rack with a friend, had some fries, onion rings, macaroni salad, and POTATO SALAD. Definitely well worth the wait. I could've chowed down some more, but I knew major food coma would arise from me, AGAIN AS USUAL. With that being said, I'm sure the previous couple thousands of reviews speak for themselves. Definitely coming back here next time I go down to Sandy Eggo!

Eat It or Beat It? **EAT IT!!** Took a trip down to SD with the family... and one of the main reasons was Phil's BBQ! What can I say... it sure as hell did not disappoint! Sure, there's a line... EXPECT a line, but it's so worth the wait! The prices are very very reasonable... anything and everything is priced under $20 and the meat quality was out of this world! A lot of the times, sketchy prices means sketchy meat... but Phil's quality is superb! How do I know? With a nice pull with your teeth, it comes right off the bone... CLEANLY! whoofff.... so good, so delicious, so juicy, full of flavor, a lil' of that charred meat... hot damn, I'd take a special trip to SD for this anyday! However, one small downfall are the sides... it's nothing really out of the ordinary, however, their red potatoes are pretty amazing compared to the rest of the sides. Nevertheless, the price, portion, and quality of BBQ overlooks the sub-par sides. CONCLUSION: 5 STARS, 5 STARS.... 5 STARS... It is a must try anytime you happen to be in the area! I guarantee Phil's BBQ will not disappoint! Order the combo items... it's a lot of food but no one ever complains about leftovers! :P EAT IT EAT IT EAT IT! All the way!

My #375 Review has to go to Phil's BBQ!! Okay, you hear about Phil's BBQ, You wonder about Phil's BBQ. People talk about driving far for Phil's BBQ and you say "what is the BIG deal about Phi's BBQ?!" My friends would always ask me when I tell them about a restaurant, "Is it really good? is it like PROMISING?!"  With Phil's BBQ I would say 100% with a BIG smile on my face YES this place is PROMISING!!!!! let's GO!! So.... WTF are you waiting for?! GO TO PHIL'S BBQ! Make any excuse you can to drive there and GET SOME! Here are the reasons why: 1. TOTALLY worth the wait! 2. FALL off the bones Ribs When you bite into it, it's like GET IN MY BELLY!!! They are known for their ribs, so order RIBS! 3. LARGE Quantity and great for sharing (normal people okay! Not you bottomless pit stomach people, you might want your own meal) LOL! 4. Pretty cheap compared to other Rib places! $20 for a full rack of baby back ribs INCLUDING sides! 5. Food comes out QUICCKKK We waited about 5 minutes! 6. BOMBBBBB ASSS ONION RINGS! Seriously, order it! You won't be disappointed! great for sharing!! 7. If your meal comes with either 2 small sides or 1 large and you want to order Fries, make sure you order a SMALL size of Fries, it's practically the same size as the large or even more.. LOL TRUST LOL 8. Customer Service - GREATTT! Very helpful and genuine workers! They don't get guaranteed tip so make sure you tip them before you leave!! Our Server Corey was great! 9. Better than Lucille's BBQ in my opinion! Don't get me wrong. I love Lucilles! but Phil's BBQ will still have a bigger spot in my heart. Notes: 1. You pay before you sit down. 2. if you have a large group and get close to the front of the line, a worker will tell you 1 person from the group has to sit down and save your table. Make sure you have that 1 person ready! 3. Tip is not included so remember to tip them before you leave! 4. you get a buzzer after you pay and pick up your own food 5. Didn't like the pulled pork sandwich or tri-tip. just get the ribs! That's what they are known for! 6. Get ready for FOOD COMA! Side notes: Our Server Corey was great! I think you deserve a raise! He came by, asked us if some of us are sharing and brought out extra plates and utensils! One couple part of our group ordered last and it took a bit for the food to come out so Corey actually went to get their food for them and served it to us! He also came back many times to make sure everything was okay and if we need more sauce. Brought wet wipes when we were almost done and always came back with a smile! Now, every time I go to SD, I make sure I stop by and have lunch/dinner at Phils! A SD trip is not the same without it!

Alright, I haven't eaten at many BBQ places, but I remember leaving this place incredibly happy and ready to KTFO. My best friend Brighton took me here right as I arrived from the airport. Apparently Phil's BBQ is widely known to the one of the best restaurants San Diego has to offer. We shared the Full Beef Rib Dinner. This entree comes with 5 bones and 2 sides. We picked coleslaw and fries for our sides. The fries here are so delicious (I like my fries regular sized, not thick and mushy). I felt like they were cooked perfectly. I didn't eat the coleslaw because I'm not a fan of mayo but Brighton seemed to love it. The beef ribs were AMAZING. They were even better because I put a crapload of hot sauce on them. If I didn't have such tasty hot sauce, I don't think I would have enjoyed the ribs as much. I barely had 2 bones and I was already really full. I took my leftovers home and ate when I was drunk later on that night. Just as delicious!! The service here was good too. I went at 11AM right when they opened, so it wasn't really crowded at all. The girl taking our order was really nice and gave me a lot of great recommendations. Our food was under $25 and we both left really satisfied. I definitely am missing Phil's BBQ already!

Waaaaaaayy too much sauce. If you like to taste the meat in your bbq, ask for the sauce on the side because they literally drown it in sauce otherwise. It's tasty, but way too much. With so much sauce they may as well just serve a bucket of sauce. Aside from being drowned in sauce, everything else was good and I'd go back. I'll just make sure to ask for my sauce on the side.

So Phil's is insanely well known.  My friends from Norcal (at least 400 miles away) came down and wanted to eat Phil's...insane. I've been here a few times and been very satisfied every single time.  I've always gone with some friends so the wait in line isn't too big of a deal.  I suggest going with some company 'cause the line is pretty long! I've never done a to-go order but it seems to be pretty nice.  My roommate did it a while ago and said it was good. Okay I'll start with the slightly negative first.  BBQ places in general (at least from my experience) don't do chicken well.  And Phil's chicken isn't that great.  It's not as dry as a desert, but it's not as moist as it could be.  BUT, then again you're going to a BBQ place so why would you get chicken anyways... Every single time I've gotten the baby back ribs.  That's the way to go! Sorry guys, just not as big of a fan of the beef ribs.  I don't think the beef ribs compare to the baby back. The baby back ribs are insanely tender and succulent.  Falls right off the bone.  So goood! The sauce is really good too. Sweet, spicy, tangy, mmm... And the sides are huge and filling. It's always impressive when someone can finish a full rack and all the sides. Big eaters are definitely welcomed at Phil's! Got to go back, it's been quite a while...

I'm not sure if we went on a bad night or what went wrong : ( Perhaps it is over hyped. I had warnings from a couple of friends that it wasn't that amazing. But of course with 4.5 stars and over 3 thousand reviews, who could turn away?! We waited for almost an hour before we got our seats. Line moved, so it wasn't too bad.. There's heat lamps along the way to recharge and also seats :) We got 3.5 racks of ribs and 3 pulled pork sandwiches for 6 people in all. The ribs at the first bite was really good. I mean DELICIOUS! I think it was a combination of me being hungry and the fact that anything hot was good. But after the 2nd rib I was soon over it. It was drenched in sauce and it wasn't that great. The pork sandwiches were just okay. I mean it was dry and didn't have so much flavor to it. But the onion rings were good. I give them that :) The corn on the cob was yummy too! I don't think I can wait that long for mediocore food.. when I can make it myself. OPEN INVITE~!! :p

I don't know what I can say which hasn't already been said. Amazing amazing amazing.   The line was about 45 minutes but once you're in, you pick up your food and go to it. HUGE portions.  Review of what we got: beef ribs: the meat slides off the bone and there's about 1/3 pound of meat per rib. tender and so damn good it's not right. pulled pork sandwich: not as good as the beef ribs but for $6.50 I can't recall a better/bigger sandwich I've gotten. Comes with cole slaw which I normally don't like, but actually finished. Baked Beans: The other  side I"ve never liked. This was different. I don't know if they're soaked in honey or what, but very sweet. Onion Rings: awesome, and lots of them. Potato Salad: I am a big fan of potato salad and this was very good.  Not too creamy either, which I would like, but given you're already eating tons of meat and onions rings, it's nice to have something that's not completely bad for you. All in all, I would highly recommnend this place.  I  hear Bludso's in LA/Long Beach is supposed to be somewhat comparably but not as good. PS Does Yelp really have a selection under ambience for "hipster crowd"?

Good god. SO GOOD! You won't get good bbq unless you come here. The line is long so make sure you come early or go online and see how long the line is. They have their own parking lot so not too bad. I usually order it to go since the line is shorter and the wait to eat this delicious bbq isn't that long. I recommend the baby back ribs and potato salad. But honestly, whatever meat you get, it doesn't matter cause the spices and sauces are just good. Would suggest each person ordering a bit and sharing cause it is a LOT of food.

I don't exactly know what the hype is all about! Haven't you tasted real BBQ before? I just moved here from the south and let's just say I thought this place was hyped up way too much. Unexpectedly,there was a bit of confusion/miscommunication at the register when adding our drinks (which was fine). I took it as , while waiting you had the option of adding cups of water along with your fountain drinks, if you wanted.   A lady, employee, shortly came over and said," For future references, the clear cups are for water only" she tried to be nice as she could but still came off rude. I tried to explain their was confusion when ordering and I could pay for drinks, she said don't worry about it,  for we were first timers. I took her statement as if I wanted free fountain drinks. This ruined both my appetite and mood. I did see a gentleman who happened to be a manager, told him the situation. He listened and apologized. The restaurant had great parking, inside space, and loved how it was  filled with so many families. :)  I just feel that I could have had a BBQ at my own house. :( OAN: The BBQ sauce needs improvement. The potatoe salad I couldn't even touch. It tasted just like potatoes and light mayo. It was plain.The chicken I ended up taking home and making my own sides.

This place does not need another review to tell you how amazing it is but I'm going to give you one anyway. Phil's blows Lucille's bbq out of the water, and that my friends is an understatement! I made a clear mistake of showing up on a Saturday night, and the line was insane to say the least.  My boyfriend left me standing in line to go wander around and discovered their bar area where seating was a free for all.  So instead of standing in that ridiculous line, we stayed on the prowl for seating at the bar.  A friendly gentleman named Rey helped take our order while we were standing there so by the time we found seats, our food was ready. We ordered the half chicken, ribs, potato salad, macaroni salad, onion rings and baked beans.  The meat was practically falling off the bone, the sweet and sourness of the bbq sauce was just right and not overwhelming.  The potato/macaroni salad was creamy with big chunks of potatoes and incredibly flavorful.  I am not a big fan of beans but Phil's baked beans...my god, GAME CHANGER.  The onion rings were crispy and stayed in tact when I bit into it.  I hate when I take a bite of an onion ring and the entire onion gets stripped out.  All of this amazingness that made us both want to unbutton our jeans only cost $22! TWENTY TWO DOLLARS FOR BBQ SENT FROM HEAVEN FOR TWO!? Thats the cost of one meal at Lucille's. The service was impeccable.  Everyone was polite, drink refills were not a problem, and Rey went above and beyond. GIVE THIS MAN A RAISE!!  Lots of parking, clean bathrooms, and full bar was also a plus!  So worth the two hour drive!!

Top 10 restaurants in the USA? The best bbq in SD? The best bbq, ever? After hearing all these claims from friends, I had to try Phil's when I was in SD this weekend and I must say, they weren't kidding! We waited for about an hour in line, but this was to be expected and I was willing to wait if the food was as good as people say.  You could even order a beer from the beer stand and cool yourself down while waiting in line. It feels like waiting in line for a ride in Disneyland; long, but worth it. My favorite are the beef ribs... so tender and juicy!  The portions are huge! We ordered the dinner portion, which came with 5 ribs and either 2 small sides or 1 large.  We also had the pork ribs, which was also very delicious!  Add sides of macaroni salad and it's a filling meal! I tried the bbq chicken despite some suggestions saying that it can be passed, and sure enough, they were right.  You could pass on the bbq chicken, as it was a little sour for my taste.  Not bad, but maybe it's because the ribs are so good, the chicken couldn't compare. Don't forget to grab your bibs before sitting down and getting your hands dirty.

Ahh #800!  What better place to review than a BBQ spot that DEFIES THE BOUNDARIES OF DELICIOUSNESS d^_^b My homie (yet another first lol) and I arrived in the late afternoon off peak hours and were lucky enough to endure a mere 15-20 minute wait.  Before I even get to the food, I must point out the unexpectedly stellar service here.  One of the staff, Tammie, greeted us while we were in line and as soon as I mentioned that I was visiting from NorCal, she whisked me off for a quick tour of the kitchen!  I got a run-through of the area and upon commenting on how good the onion rings looked, she immediately nabbed one for me from one of the cooks.  Freaking.  Legit.  Later on, our server, Marlon, introduced himself and said he'd be taking care of us throughout our meal.  For a place where you order food up front and pick it up yourself, it was a seriously pleasant surprise that added further to the legitness. Now for the good stuff ;) Baby Back Ribs - very good in terms of tenderness and flavor, but it paled in comparison to the... BEEFY RIBS - AMAZING!  It was loaded with meaty, fatty goodness infused with smokey notes and covered in tangy, spicy BBQ sauce.  Even just one bone is almost a meal and a half in and of itself. El Toro - Adam Richman wasn't kidding about how good this is!  The tri-tip had such a deep, smokey flavor to it just like its beefy cousin and each saucy bite was a mouthgasm.  At only $7 too, this stands as one of the best sandwiches I've had to date. Colossal Onion Rings - normally I'm not much of a fan, but these were damn good!  The rings themselves were cut nice and thick and the batter was hot and super crispy.  Ernie F. would go to town on these haha. By the end, I felt like one lardy tub and you know what?  It was TOTALLY WORTH IT =D  And as a final note of advice to echo what some others have said, come during off peak hours or call in advance and order to go if you want to avoid a crazy long line.

Kinda stupid to be writing a review for this place. But in summary: 5 stars for sides + ribs! Quick tip - if you don't want to wait in line, go to the bar and order a drink! The bar is usually much faster than the tables and you can still get your rib business on over there.

Hands down best BBQ outside of Memphis I have tried. I have been coming here for years. I'm personally not a particular fan of fatty meats and eat things on the bone. So they have a chickless dinner here I've loved since the first time I came here. The Sauce is key and they sure know how to do it right here. I have also tried other dishes here all were great. You must order the onion rings battered to order with their homemade ranch they are to die for!  Since I moved always try to stop by when I'm back. CLOSED MONDAYS

Excellent! The pricing is great too! They give you so much fries! The meat just falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. Definitely one of the best BBQ I've had. I went at like 1215 on a Sat for lunch and the line wasn't bad. I only waited 20-25 min. But definitely worth the wait.

I'll be honest, I'm not a huge BBQ fan.  I like it, but it's not something I usually seek out unless I'm in a BBQ town, and San Diego is not a BBQ town.  But Phil's is pretty rock solid.  Rock solid enough to warrant the fanaticism that this place inspires?  No.  Rock solid enough to warrant a line for a table that wraps around the building?  No.  But if you can sneak past all that and get to the bar to order some food, you won't be disappointed.  Hands down best BBQ in San Diego, and virtually nobody disagrees.  Man, and I remember when it was a hole in the wall on Washington and there was never much of a wait.  Ahh, the good ol' days.

We decided to get take out because we didn't have much time to wait in line and sit down and eat at the place. We had 7 people so we ordered what seemed to be a lot but was just right. We placed a phone order for a beef rib dinner, baby back rib dinner and a half a chicken dinner. We also had some sides such as mac salad, coleslaw, fries and onion rings but none of them stood out much. The beef ribs were the best. Tons of mean and fell right off the bone. Deft suggest that! The baby back ribs were just okay.... kinda dry and not very tender..... the chicken was very moist but was drenched in too much bbq sauce. Overall I'd deft go back for the beef ribs, but that's about it.

If you do go here and eat at the bar, make sure that you find Ray, who happens to be an awesome bartender. He's friendly and interacts with customers (always important). So while the service is great, there is one pattern I am curious about and want to share with you. So, I went to Phil's BBQ yesterday with my boyfriend and when you sit at the bar, a bartender will take your order, put it in, and hand you a buzzer. When the buzzer goes off, you, the customer, are expected to go get your own food. Well, yesterday, my boyfriend and I noticed that one of the bartenders brought the food to the couple next to us. Last time we had gone to Phil's, the same thing happened, but the couple was a little older. When we had asked the bartender why some people have their food brought to them while others didn't, he said, "it depends on how busy we are." Um.. okay, but they're usually just busy all the time. While we were sitting there and time passed, it's not like the busy-ness changed. There was a pattern that we both found peculiar. Either it was a mere coincidence or not, but both times the couples were Caucasian. I'm usually not one to think that people are using preferential treatment based on race, but in this situation, I can't help but think that it my be so. Like I said, though, it could just be a coincidence, so I'm not complaining here. In fact, I was thinking maybe they have an "upon request" policy or something, which would be great, and if that's the case, I want in on it. Either way, I'm curious to know what is going on here. Help me out and drop some wisdom, if you can.

The food was awesome. I ordered 2 full racks of baby back ribs, onion rings, beans, and cole slaw. The meat was tender and sauce was good! I will definitely come back here when I want some good BBQ. I called the order in and it was ready in 5 mins. I recommended calling in and picking up the order to avoid the long wait. This is one of the best BBQ I have had!

Before Phil's was featured on the travel channel, I was going here.  Bam! I am happy to guide anyone to this restaurant as their starting point to San Diego's culinary experience! The sauce and everything on the menu is tasty and has a unique taste that identifies their BBQ... The wait is a killer and the reason why I haven't gone back. If I was to judge this place as a west coast BBQ joint I would give it five stars due to the fact we don't have too many establishments the can delivery like the East Coast or Down south.  But compared to any other BBQ joint this place lacks so much flavor and service. The menu prices are way too much for what you order and less could be said for the food portions that do shrink with the uneasy ordering style. Service on a busy night is non-existent.

Everyone always heard the saying,"If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face." -Carl's Jr. Over a year and a half ago, I bookmarked this place on Yelp for so long and ended up only staying near Downtown San Diego every time I was in the area. Definitely regretted it, and on top of that I used to pass by there so many times without noticing this restaurant. Epic fail on my part. Anyways, we got there twenty minutes right after they opened, which was awesome, since we were on the road for about an hour and a half. Exiting the car, you can already smell the sweet aroma of BBQ, and my stomach was rumbling. We had to wait in line for about twenty to twenty five minutes as you may notice from the pictures. The menu was already located outside, well a couple of them, because once you stepped in there, there will be a line of cashiers to place your order. So be ready to order before you get to the front of the line. (Makes the line go quicker) What we ordered was the following: 1. Best of both (2 beefy ribs and 1/4 BBQ chicken)-The beefy ribs was my favorite at this restaurant! Fell off the bones, tender, tore apart easily and the BBQ sauce was not overwhelming. This tasted like beef jerky, not rough and tough to pull out your teeth, this was made so perfectly that I wish my tummy could have devoured more! The BBQ chicken was tender and not dry...surprised because it was breast meat! This was actually pretty good. 2. Full rack of baby back ribs-Fell off the bones! Not one of the ribs was dry. They were tender and tore apart so easily that it was remarkable. The sauce on the ribs was good; however, I would suggest not to get BBQ sauce on the side...it was tangy and left a bad after taste. I like bold, sweet, and spicy BBQ sauce like Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ. 3. Macaroni salad-This was my least favorite, tasted weird and tangy. Something in there needs to be taken out, because I would have liked this side if it didn't have that tangy taste to it. 4. Coleslaw-Not a lot of mayo, which is a big plus. The vegetables was nice and crispy. 5. Corn on the cob-White corn=Sweet...Enough said. Ok, maybe I had to put Tapatio because I love spicy foods...bias I know... 6. Colossal onion rings (Large, separate order)-Super crispy and huge! Omg! This could have been a meal for itself...Couldn't even finish half of it. The batter on these bad boys was made just right. I didn't even have a soggy onion ring! The ranch dip was light and it definitely went very well with the onion rings. Each entree that is listed above (#1 and #2) came with 2 small sides or a large side. Those sides above was what we chose to try. (So fellow Yelpers, try other sides and review them please! Thank you!) Also, we noticed the fries looked limpy from another persons table, so I wouldn't recommend getting that. After your done ordering, you get a taser looking buzzer. Guess what? Another line was formed just to find a table...The line wasn't too bad, just about two to five minutes, only because there was a lot of large parties that wouldn't leave. BUZZ BUZZ! TIME TO EAT! Nom Nom!! Like I said on the first quote, it got messy haha thankfully we had our bibs and a whole roll of napkins like Boiling Crab. (Those who want to be civil, like myself...you can get plates and utensils). Unlimited drinks for $2 more dollars. Suggestion, try the Crystal Light! Mmm!! Service here was quick and excellent. Very attentive and sweet. They didn't make you feel like you were being rushed. The manager helped me bring the food to the table. Definitely give the staff five stars. =) Overall, I would definitely recommend coming here! Note: If you don't like something that you may have ordered, speak up before you start Yelping Phil's BBQ. That is why I had to take a picture of the menu outside, because I was definitely ready to Yelp, if I didn't like something...forgot to tell them about the macaroni salad...too full. (I find this to be a very smart tactic to make sure customer satisfaction is reached) Now, do you understand how they earned to be one of the top ten restaurants in the US?

http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Seriously. I don't even like bbq, but i had to come here. I just had to get a taste of those ribs that make people wait in crazy lines. Luckily, even on a saturday lunch time, the line was oddly short and only waited about 15 minutes. Craig R even caught me on the webcam going in! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Since we JUST HAD BRUNCH literally about 30 min before coming here, we had just enough room to share a big platter of food. My friend Ken C had a huge smile on his face, so he must have liked the ribs alot. Dude on the other hand had mixed feelings on these ribs (he was more impressed by the sanitary handle on the restroom doors!), but both of them agreed that adding the magic spices made them even better. If bbq sauce in general didn't make me feel nauseous , i wouldve eaten more- those ribs were mighty tasty. The fries i could do without, and sadly, i could do with out the mighty onion rings too. The batter was too thick for my liking.potato salad was awesome. But man was i excited when i saw this. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I'm a sweet tea addict and i wish i had one of these at my office. I'm getting me a whoopie pie next time.

Okay, so I judged my 4-star rating off one visit, and that was at the San Marcos location. Sorry for my serious miscalculation. THIS PLACE IS A WELL-DESERVED 5 STARS !! Ö Since my last review, I've frequented this place about 3 more times (will be more in the coming months, hehe)! This place has theeeeeee best fall-off-the-bone lip smackin' finger lickin' baby back ribs EVER. But, I'm sure you knew that judging by all the other 4 and 5 star reviews! The BBQ sauce is tangy and slightly spicy! I loveeeee it! Every time I come here with my friends, I always watch their reactions after their first bite into the ribs, and not once did I ever get a bad reaction. They all had foodgasm faces, both subtle and not-so-subtle..hahaha.Also, the half side of fries are more than enough for 2 very hungry people, haha. Their fries are superrrrr good, tooo! Crispy and tasty to perfection! And their service,.. their service is PHENOMENAL, just like their ribs! All the workers have smiles on their faces, and they're always so upbeat and helpful! There's this girl that usually mans the lines, and I guess she recognized me after 2 visits, haha :x What can I say, their ribs keep me coming back here!! She recognized me again while I was in their 45 minute line today, and she stopped to give me a smile and hug :) aww! They also passed out french fries while you wait :D hahaha, and you can help yourself to some lemon-water (it actually tastes like lemonade more than water... hahaha). While we were still waiting in line, another one of the workers saw us hungrily waiting, and when we got into the restaurant, he recognized us, talked with us a bit, and then asked "the wait wasn't that bad, right?" We said it was a long wait :( and I jokingly said that he could compensate our wait with an extra side of fries. Well, he offered three of us free drinks instead! :) Even better!! After we ordered our stuff, he came over and asked which drinks we wanted, then gave us glasses of Sangria (which tasted exceptional) on the house :)!! That's what I call exceptional service!!! Everyone that worked here was all smiles and all the people that were eating here were all smiles, too :D! Phil's, I'm gonna be seeing you for the many months to come ^_~ OHHH and btw guys, if you don't mind sitting in the bar, I was told that you can just skip the line and order/seat yourself at the bar area (if seating is open there)! I remember seeing a few booths in the bar area, too! :D enjoy~

Honestly think this place is A-OK. The meat is good but I'm not a big BBQ person, maybe that's why I don't believe it's worth the wait (Sunday around 1:00pm we waited 2 hours!!) However, the food is consistent and definitely more of a tourist-y spot than anything else. They're also opening a new location in San Marcos. I wonder what business will be like up there since they will be competing against Famous Dave's...

Read the reviews and believe them - - this is some good BBQ.  My wife is not a BBQ fan but she did enjoy Phil's.  We showed up early - - around 4:30 and waited about 10 minutes to get in.  The place was fully packed and we waited a couple of minutes for another couple to finish their meal before we could sit down.  After we sat down and drank out iced tea, I happened to look outside and the line was out the door - - more to come later.  My wife ordered BBQ chicken and I had the Beef Spare Ribs.  The chicken was moist and tender.  But the ribs - - they hurt me.  Not that they were bad - - they were so good I ate so much that my stomach hurt.  Overeating!!!  About 15 minutes into our meal I looked at the line and not only was it outside, it was approaching the corner of the restaurant - - more to come.  Our sides were baked beans, cole slaw, and French fries.  All made my stomach hurt even more - -but boy was it worth it.  As we were leaving I look out and saw the line to get into Phil's BBQ and it had wrapped itself around the second side.  Look on the bright side - - by the time that group gets in, they will be so hungry that when they do overeat it won't hurt so much.   I think the key to not having to wait in line so much is to get there early or eat at odd hours.  Either way.  Enjoy.

Very very delicioso. The ribs were so tender and slid right off the bone. It was definitely finger-licking good. I did take off a star for the cashier getting us coleslaw instead of fries, but I re-added that star remembering the photo machine thingy right outside the entrance. You can even email yourself the experience for free! But I did take off another star for the long wait. It's good but I'm not sure it was worth the hour and a half. If I come back here next time, I'm going to definitely get it to go and eat it somewhere else.

Won a trip to San Diego in Feb. we weren't even looking for this place but ended up stumbling upon this place & come to find out it's been on Man Vs. Food, cool huh? The line was out the door but their staff keeps it moving & they are very friendly with how busy they are. They seem to enjoy where they work. Wow, am I the only one reviewing this place that didn't eat the baby back ribs? Sheesh. I ordered half a BBQ chicken & skipped on the beans. The servings are GINORMOUS! So make sure you're hungry when you go here. The food was super yummy! I'd go there again if I ever visit San Diego again.

Phil's BBQ is a San Diego Tradition and hot spot for all tourists because it is the best BBQ ever!!!  It is always a difficult decision on what to order because everything is so darn delicious.  I think my favorite item are the ribs with a side of onion rings and coleslaw! The line is so completely long and ridiculous all summer long.  Your best bet is to hit this place up during odd hours and during the week.  Or you can just order the food to go and avoid the whole mess of waiting in line.  The secret is to sign up for the birthday club directly at the restuarant and get a Free Front of the Line Pass for you and 3 friends on your birthday!  I look forward to eating Phil's BBQ on my birthday every year!!  As I write this review, I am thinking of how yummy the food is and I want to go there right now.  Maybe I will call in an order!  Phil's BBQ-  You have a piece of my heart!!

TWO HOUR WAIT on a Saturday evening. Really?? The waiting sucked but I was entertained by my friends who couldn't stop talking. Haha! I love them. It made the TWO HOUR WAIT not so long. The smell of the smokey goodness in the air does not help hunger pains though. After the wait, we finally got to the front of the line and got two cans of coconut beer. MMMmmmm it was like I was make in Oahu sipping coconut beer in the only Irish bar in China Town. We ordered and went to our table to wait for our food. As soon as I picked up the food from the front counter I regretted ordering so much food. Well maybe not since I had the left overs the next day. I ordered 4 beef ribs with coleslaw and fries. Make sure you get extra bbq sauce to go with your BBQ. It's a must!! The beef ribs were so huge!! You can rip off the meat with  your fingers so easily... The meat is so tender and delicious. The coleslaw is good and the fries are good as well. Try dipping the fires in the bbq sauce its yummy!!! Overall the BBQ is very delicious but the TWO HOUR wait is not. It's up to you if you wanna wait that long for BBQ. Try it at least once!

I've heard rave reviews of this place so I had to go try it when i was down in SD. When they said the wait is long, they were not exaggerating. The line stretched from inside to all the way around the building and past other stores. Luckily we went into the take out line. Got in and out in about 15 minutes. Fuck yeah. Now onto the good part: - Ribs were amazing. Fall off the bone? We ate the bone -- it was that good. - Onion rings were huge as expected. Tasty but a little burnt on the outside. Just a tad. No biggie. - Baked beans. Legitttt. Never knew i could love baked beans so much. - Macaroni salad was not good tho. Too sweet. - Beef brisket sandwich - good but not as good as i was hoping. It was a little on the dry side. But they do pack that bish with a ton of meat. Side note: we ate our food on the side walk rite next to the parking lot. Most ghetto dinner ever but also one of the most delicious. I miss you Phil...whoever you are. Keep making your delicious BBQ!

Seriously, after eating slabs of ribs from Phil's BBQ, I questioned why I ever was a vegetarian.   It's that good.  There are only a handful of places I would say is worth enduring a 20+ minute wait, and Phil's BBQ is definitely on that list.   My favorite was the beefy ribs.  I think they were better than the baby back, but I'm not a huge fan of pork so I'm a bit biased.  The meat is soooo tender and moist, and it literally falls off the bone and melts in your mouth.  The barbecue sauce is the perfect trifecta of sweet, smokey, and tangy - I honestly don't think I've tasted better bbq sauce.  The chicken was also juicy and delicious.   Prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food that you get.  I love getting The Best of Both which includes either beefy or baby back ribs, chicken and sides for less than 13 bucks.  Enough food for you and a friend, but if they're a good friend, they'd get their own and let you have it all to yourself.   Tip:  To avoid that long line, call in your order ahead of time and get your food to-go.

Sweet Dixie! If I could eat BBQ every day, I would ... and if I could drive down to San Diego every day ... and get some home lovin'  TLC from Phil's BBQ ... I WOULD! The Food is worth the wait (heck, just ask the ppl who stand in line). Me ... I tried ordering food to go ... and was personally escorted by this lovely lady that made me feel like I was one of the family! (and just ta set the record ... that's a good thing folks).  8D The Food: Onion Rings .... decent, respectable ... but not the best I've had (BWW) El Toro (deli sliced tri-tip ) .... Wow!!! The BBQ Broham (or pulled pork) ... Oh My ... WOW!! Baby Back Ribs ...  Holy, mother ... WOWZER!!! If you haven't been ... heck, more for us that love this place! (you can just stick w/ the ribs from Applebees ... or them chimichangas from On the Border)

The BBQ quality here is exceptional! I enjoy the dynamic vibe Phil's has to offer. It's fun, energetic, and the workers are extremely friendly. Of course, the line is the biggest issue, so I suggest going during off-hours. But when is that really? The place is perfect for groups cause they have a grip of flat screens around. They always play sports, so it's a perfect place for sports fans. I had their Baby Back Ribs Tickler for $6.75. It comes with 3 bones, a side of coleslaw, 2 huge onion rings and freshly cut fries. Honestly, it's the perfect size for one person, hungry or not. The BBQ sauce is to die for, the ribs are so tender and easy to eat. Don't forget to wear your bib with the pocket right side up (it'll help catch the food that falls over). I'm a fan of coleslaw so that's pretty good too. They have the Chick[en] Tickler too, but it's not as good as the ribs. Why would you even go to Phil's BBQ just to order chicken? Who does that? The last time I went, I ordered the BBQ Broham for $6.95, which is a sandwich with shredded pork, coleslaw and BBQ sauce. I ordered this only cause it looked so good when I quickly glanced at someone else's plate. However, when my food came I was surprised that it didn't come with a side order. (insert sad face) But the good thing about it is that they fill that sandwich UP! I actually had to eat the pork that fell out of the sandwich with a fork. EAT DAT POKE WITH A FOKE. But I will admit that it was definitely tiresome to be eating a sandwich filled with meat and meat, and, uhh, oh right more meat. I even had to mooch some fries off my sister's tickler just cause I was dying for something else other than meat. I will add, that they got these cool "sanitary door opener" in the bathrooms! Now you don't have to touch the door handle right after washing your hands! (Fyi, I don't touch the door handle. I use a paper towel. Don't yo mama teach you anything?)

Wow is this place good if you are feeling like eating at a great BBQ place. As many people have been saying over and over again, there is ALWAYS a line at this place. I honestly think it's worth the wait since the anticipation is worth it. I ordered the 3 bbq beef ribs dinner plate with a side of potato salad and fries. My only regret was getting all starch in my sides, which filled me up almost immediately. The portions are HUGE as I was sadly only able to finish two ribs. I'm not sure what they put into their bbq sauce but all I can say is that it tasted amazing. They cook the ribs in a way where it brings out the smokiness of the meat perfectly. For sure I will be back here again the next time I go down to San Diego. I guess good mexican food isn't the only thing that's great in this city after all.

I like how they have a sign saying to go review them on yelp! haha! I will be back for sure! :) on a weeknight again so the wait is not too bad! GREAT for the price!!!

I can't sing the praises of this place enough. I'm not a huge BBQ fan, so it better be good or I will be disappointed. If beef ribs are on the menu, you know that's what I'm ordering. It's what I grew up eating at home and I love them. These were fall of the bone delicious! The meat was tender and seasoned perfectly. We also tried the BBQ beans, potato salad and onion rings. Everything was great. The sides weren't my favorite, but they were still pretty good. I'll be getting the corn on the cobb next time I'm in town, but I'll definitely be back. This place gets packed (duh) so timing is everything. We got here just before the line got long around 5:30 on a Friday evening. There isn't much to be said that thousands of other people haven't said before me, but this place is no joke. Definitely lives up to the hype and worth every penny, although they are very reasonably priced and centrally located. YUM!

So after moving here I found it difficult to find a good BBQ joint. Phil's was recommended to me so naturally I checked it out. Not too bad. Very big portions. The two times I have been the meat has been too overcooked and dry for my taste. I think the reason Phil's has such a following though is because of their BBQ sauce. The sauce is delicious! If possible I would recommend going between "normal" meal hours because this place attracts a good amount of people and a line usually wraps around the building.

T.T Onion rings - 5 star, thick onions and break right away when you bite, great Ranch sause too BBQ chicken - 5 star, tender and juicy BBQ ch Pulled pork sandwich - beyond 5 star, best ever! not too dry, not moist, goes well with the coleslaw. and yes, they give you a lot pork, it covered most of my plate!

Phil's BBQ... the Legend, the Hype, the Truth? Was down in San Diego for a convention and had to try this place out.  I figure, over 3k+ review with the average 4.5 stars rating couldn't be wrong right?  Well... not to sound snobby or even un-educated in the subject of BBQology, my thoughts on this experience was only well.....fair.  Yes... you read it correctly... fair... but before you lynch mob me with pitch forks, please hear me out... Let's start from the beginning... Line out the door!  Madness!  Out the building, around the front, wrapped around the sides, a total BLACK FRIDAY feel to it!  How crazy is this?  Talked to the friendly cashier inside and she said that it's like this on a daily basis... WOW!  Phil's loyal legion of BBQ devourers on the move!  That's a great sight to see in this horrible economy. Since we were in the subject of talking to the cashier, overall the service was top notch.  Starting from the nice phone call and awesome help by one of the cashiers/operators, going in for a pick up and ordering on spot was definitely the way to go.  The friendliness definitely shows and it seems like despite the chaos at Phil's, everyone seem to be having a good time working there servicing all these patrons.  Oh, and the wait time was much less than stated... I was told 10-15 minutes for pick up but it was more like 7 minutes...GREAT! Décor was decent... It's a BBQ joint what do you expect?  Location is nice with ample amount of parking but based on the look of things doesn't matter if Phil's owns the nearby Sports Arena (I'm assuming?)  That will still fill up with ease. Food... oh oh... here is where I'm gonna get hammered by the loyal legion army of Phil's.  got 2 things on this trip because I wanted to sample the favorites... Broham!  Huge pull pork sandwich!  Decent flavor but it was much too dry for me...  Perhaps the meat is more lean than expected and the sauce was lightly drizzled?  (I actually liked the fact there isn't so much of the sauce but the pull pork gotta have some fat to make it juicy!)  But for under $8 bucks it's definitely a great deal! Pork Rib tickler:  Smaller version of the regular pork ribs, tender off the bone delicious!  BUT......... Tender off the bone is to be expected from any famous BBQ joint so that is a required criteria.  The sauce however, was much too tangy for me to handle because I'm so used to the sweetened version locally.  If the sauce was less tangy and kept the light sweetness, I can see it being amazing. Sides:  Onion rings was ok but I definitely like the fact it was freshly fried, and the cole slaw wasn't mushy and was very delicious!   So why did I give it a 4 star despite my worries about getting mobbed by the fans?  Well... too many 4.5s really made me feel bad... the service and overall experience was definitely but the food definitely not worth "my wait" for over an hour.  Here are the breakdowns.  Service: 5   Location: 4   Décor Ambience: 4   Food: 3   Average = 4. Would I come back?  Yes... if the line is much shorter and bearable.... But if you are a visitor like me, do have to check this place out!  The scene there will amaze you!

Finally made a trek down here on a week day because i always wondered what the fuss was all abt since lines are always out the wazoo. Ordered full rack of ribs with sweet beans and mac salad. Mac salad and sweet beans are tasty and ribs are tender. BUT THATS ABOUT IT. I was waiting for it to blow me away and it didn't. Not a fan of the vinegar base sauce either.  price was decent but did not get what was all the fuss about.

Hands down the best BBQ Rib place in California. They have full/half dinner sizes of ribs that come with two sides (cole slaw and fries for me) that are delicious as well. The Rib melts in your mouth and sauce is very flavorful and tangy sweet. Only bad thing is that the wait can get more than an hr but the food covers it. I sometimes go to San Diego from LA just to eat at this place. Solid 5 stars.

This is the highest rated place in San Diego and one of the highest rated in the nation. Don't be too intimidated by the line- ours was to the parking lot and we were ordering in 40 minutes and food comes flying out of their well oiled kitchen. Come on off hours if you can. When we were leaving (near closing) there wasn't much of a line. Still, I thought the food was worth the wait. Yes, it's fall off the bone and I expected that of the baby back ribs, but shocked that the beef ribs are too. I have never had a beef rib that was so skillfully cooked to a crispy char on the outside and tender meat inside. The dual textures was awesome! Even most other awarded BBQ places fall short on beef ribs and I never bother to order them at most places. We also had the chicken which was also pretty decent. Potato salad, macaroni salad and baked beans were solid with the beans being the star (coming from someone who isn't a bean person). They only have one type of sauce and I liked it but it's rather tangy so keep that in mind if you're a sweet sauce type person. I love sauce variety so next time I would bring myself some sweet sauce and a spicy one. Service is friendly. The prices are very reasonable (we got a 2 beef rib/ 4th chicken combo-  $12.45 and half baby back combo- $13.25) for a lot of food. We could not finish the food and took the rest back to our hotel for late night snack eats. If you haven't ever liked beef ribs, this may be the place to try it and see if it changes your mind. It's definitely the star for me. I now believe in the hype!

Everything is the BOOOOOOOOOOMB DIGGITY! I love this place! I think the staff is so friendly and their food is so delish! I always have their pulled pork sandwich with a side of fries and ranch dipping sauce. It's such a great combo. I have my tangy, salty, and...ranch haha My boyfriend gets pork ribs or beef ribs. I prefer the pork, but the beef is still really good and they're humongous! This place is worth the wait in my opinion. I would definitely stop in when you're craving some BBQ and you don't have a grill.

So Phil's does get a lot of press and other BBQ places are often compared to them. I have been eating here for years and have had the luxury of eating at some fine BBQ places all over the United States. I give Phil's 4 Stars overall for the reasons as follows. They are very consistent if food quality regardless of the day or times I have eaten here. Phil's has a pretty decent selection of menu items and the prices are very reasonable. I would say they best things on the menu are their baby back ribs and onion rings. I guess the biggest contention from my friends who have tried Phil's is their BBQ sauce. You either love it or hate it. It has a tangy taste that I must admit is different then any other place I have had the pleasure of dining at. BTW, they also sell it at Costco and in the restaurant. I usually get the Baby back or Chick Tickler. They come with french fries (I rate the fries average), 2 onion rings and coleslaw. All for less than 7 bucks. This alone is a very good portion size and most people will be full if they ate the entire meal. I also like the BBQ Broham (Pulled Pork Sandwich) seasoned and char-grilled, on a bed of Cole Slaw topped with BBQ sauce, Rib-less Dinner (chunks of pork shoulder seasoned and BBQ sauce) and the Beefy Rib & Chick-less Dinner (2 Bones with chunks of white breast meat chicken seasoned & BBQ'd). A cool option they have is a 1 Bone Sampler Beef rib for only $3.95. I prefer babybacks over beef ribs, but sometimes I get the hanker for a hunk of beef and don't want to order a full or half rack. I get the 1 Bone Sample with a pulled pork sandwich and it really hits the spot! The colossal onion ring (small $3.95/large $5.95) rock! They go down perfect with ranch dressing and are not real greasy like some other onion rings you get at other BBQ joints. The batter is awesome and I can almost down a small order by myself. Get one of the ticklers and they give you 2 with your meal. Other menu items include burgers (only tried them once and they were lean and had good flavor, but don't compare to top burger spots in SD (see my other reviews), El Toro (char-grilled deli sliced tri-tip topped with BBQ sauce), BBQ Turkey Burger, BBQ Chicken Breast and a BBQ Garden Veggie Burger. They also have a few different salads, but that's not why you come here. GET THE RIBS! Depending on the day and time, be prepared to stand in line for up to 2 hours. I recommend getting there right when they open at 11am on Saturday/Sundays. They are closed on Mondays as well as a couple of weeks around Xmas. I eat here a lot on weeknights and rarely stand in line on the non-summer months. An added bonus is they also have Fresca on the fountain drink dispenser! You can get seated right away if there are seats available in the bar area and you can always call in your order and pick it up. Just a word of caution, DO NOT call in your order and then eat it at the restaurant. They will come up to your table and other customers will probably give you an ear full. Since moving to this location form Mission Hills, they have a huge banquet room in the same little business area where the restaurant is located. Oh yeah, they do cater, but the couple times I have the catered food, it was not as good as the fresh offerings served at the restaurant. So, the baby back ribs are REALLY tender and melt in your mouth. The onion rings are awesome and the coleslaw has a nice flavor as well. The lines can be long and sometimes the parking sucks. Not the biggest selection of side orders and they do not offer different types of BBQ sauces like many other fine BBQ establishment. Prices are decent and the line moves pretty quick. Great service at the ordering counter (no waiters or waitresses) and with the people who work in the dining areas. Plenty of outdoor seating. If you like traditional sweet or smokey BBQ sauce, you may not like the tanginess of Phil's sauce. I say nothing ventured, nothing gained!

I absolutely love this place.  It has the BEST BBQ in San Diego, hands down!  The ribs are absolutely amazing and I always have to order them. The is always a crazy line to get in at night but definitely worth the wait.  If you want to skip the line, I recommend going in the afternoon.  And if you get there at night and the line is crazy long, just call your order in and jump right to the head of the line to pick it up and bring it home. If you place an order for pick-up, be sure to ask for extra BBQ sauce since they tend to skimp a bit on it for their to-go orders.

"I've waited in longer lines for worse food" - Lucho trust me, when Lucho says something like that, it is HIGH PRAISE We waited in line for 20-30 minutes and not knowing the ordering process + a big party made it a little hectic at first   Once I had my platter of baby-back ribs and fries in front of my face it was bbq heaven    The onion rings are dinosaur sized and can be a meal all on their own The only not-so-good thing was the baked beans    It's not that they were horrible it's just that my future Mother-in-Law makes them sooooo much better ;) ps The pulled pork sandwich looked out of control ridiculous thanks for the seasoned salt stoopid

Tickler?  Really?  This was more like a side splittin' guffaw! Phil's Baby Back Rib Tickler...3 Baby Back Ribs, 2 Onion Rings, Slaw and Fresh Cut Fries.  Sounds like a decent size portion unlike the rest of the menu right?.  So why is it when it came out my stomach suddenly felt like the size of a pea?  I tackled the ribs first and didn't even need to gnaw it off the bones as it fell right off.  In between bites I had fork fulls of creamy crunchy slaw and I snuck a french fry in here and there.  I was doing pretty good but forgot the 2 steroidal onion rings.  I managed to fit one in before finally calling it quits, leaving a mound of fries and the boney remains of my ribs. Damn that was good!

5.3.1. Five napkins. Three Wet naps. One bib. These are all the things that I needed to eat this amazing meal. We had heard about the wait at Phil's but decided to risk it anyway because we were dying to try it! We went at about 430 on a Friday and the wait was only about 20 minutes. Which according to everyone was awesome. Once inside, you are asked to order your food first then go find a place to sit. If you have a larger party, some people can order and the rest can go sit. I ordered the El Toro sandwich (Tri-tip & BBQ sauce) and my bf got The Best of Both (Chicken & Baby back ribs). On most meals you can either get two small sides or one large side. He decided to get the basked beans and french fries. Our food was ready relatively quickly and once I saw our plates I knew that we were in for the best BBQ of our liiiives. And I was right. The meat  was spilling out of my sandwich and literally filled the whole plate. Usually when theres high quantity there is low quality but this was CERTAINLY not the case at Phil's! The tri-trip was gahdamn perfect. And don't get me started on the BBQ sauce....SO GOOD. It was the perfect blend of spicy and sweet. I managed to sneak a few bites of my bf's meal as well...and his plate was just as good! There was more than enough fries and baked beans! Two people could easily share them! (which we did!) Do yourself a favor and ask them to add their sauce to your sides. I'm not sure if it's free (I didn't notice it until after =/) but it will be worth it! We accidentally ended up with "BBQ fries" and I was so glad we did!! Bottom line: Phil's is the best BBQ I've ever had! They serve you quality food at a more-than-reasonable price!

Who waited in line for 1 hour 30 mins in line?  Ohhh.. me!  The wait time to get seated felt longer than it did when I waited in line for the new Nintendo Wii when it first came out!  Maybe the hunger kicking after 30 mins of waiting and the aroma of the BBQ in the air made it a killer wait.   I was in San Diego for my annual 2 or 3 Chargers game a year and since I discovered Yelp early this year II found this comfortable place!  Being a Charger fan that visits this nice and lovely city for the past 11 years now I have been missing out bigggg time!  40-50 min wait from LV yelpers?  Lucky!!  Close to the entrance is a 20 min in itself, we were way back and almost wrapped to the end of the sidewalk!   Finger licking good was the food!  Of course I got the full rib dinner (it was less than $12!!! Come on Vegas!!!) but also ordered the Broham sandwich which was delish in it's own right.   My friend complained about the rings and the amount of sauce on her items but hellooooo we're here to get down and dirty with San Diego's finest BBQ!  And they delivered!  I just wonder now if they have the same quality at 11am when they first open up.

I brought a couple friends here on a rainy Sunday night. As usual, the the line was long so I thought either people don't cook on Sundays or Phil's BBQ is just too irresistible. I reassured them that their patience will be paid off in no time. Plus, this is an iconic and integral part of San Diego just like California burritos. By the way, the last time I was here, it was not an enjoyable experience. A compilation of bad service, loud crowds, cold and dry food at Phil's was unacceptable. I was hoping Phil's would reclaim its top spot as the best BBQ restaurant. I ordered the 3 bone beef dinner with fries and sweet baked beans AND the BBQ Broham sandwich. Go big or go home right? The giant beef ribs were cooked to perfection! The charred ribs were glazed with Phil's BBQ sauce and it was absolutely amazing! The meat was so tender that you can pull it right off the bone with just the tips of your teeth. DROOL! Now, I will reserve this paragraph just for the BBQ Broham sandwich. I'm not a fan of pulled pork but I was drawn to this sandwich for some reason or another. I kept reading the small print over and over, "seasoned and char-grilled, on a bed of Cole Slaw topped with BBQ sauce". BOY! I could have never been so right! In between the buns was a generous portion of pulled pork and a bed of of Cole Slaw. The smokey BBQ flavor paired well with the sweet slaw. I became a believer tonight and I will jump on the Phil's BBQ bandwagon. Just too irresistible! I will come back here rain or shine and get a complete fix for my cravings.

Every time I've been there, I've had to wait a long time to get seated and eating. I've caught on that it's much better to order your food over the phone and take it to go.  I made my order over the phone , got there and my food was ready within ten minutes. It doesn't get any better than that!

Have been here numerous times and can never really complain. Yes, there is always a crazy long line which usually moves rather quickly, but that's why you call in your order (even if its right in front of the restaurant) then walk on in. The food is always good, but the atmosphere is what really makes this place. The people are always super friendly and helpful with anything you need. I will continue going back and continue to introduce this place to my out of town friends and family who would enjoy some good ol' BBQ!

My friend and I shared a full rack of pork ribs dinner with a side of macaroni salad and a side of coleslaw. They were fall of the bone tender and so finger-licking good (yes, we ate with our hands!) I really like both the pork ribs and the beef ribs, but I'd say the pork ribs are something you can't eat too much of, where as the beef ribs you can keep eating and eating even past being full.   Onion rings were humongous and perfectly deep fried. OH, so worth the 1 hour and 40 minute wait. The sign lies though, we waited 35 minutes-ish past the 21 minute sign. o well.

I have to admit, this is the best bbq I had in many years.  All the places I use to go to for bbq have gone down in quality.  However, the bbq ribs melts right off the bone at Phil's and very reasonable prices.  The beef ribs were a bit tough for me.  There were not a wide variety of bbq sauces as I encountered at other bbq spots.  I got two sides, but they were average.  I would definitely come back if I was in the San Diego area.

Definitely a must-eat restaurant if you're visiting the area! There's a reason why the line wraps around the restaurant even at 1pm on a weekday; their famous baby back ribs attract people from all over the area and keep people from san diego going back for more. after waiting in line for a while (we had to wait for about an hour one time when it was really busy,) you get to choose which dinner option you get to go with- personally, i adore the baby back ribs, and i enjoy the coleslaw and macaroni very much. Sure, it's a little expensive at around $20 per person, but your stomach will be fulfilled beyond its wildest dreams and your taste buds will thank you for the delicious meal. If you haven't been there already and you go to UCSD like me, you should definitely pay phil's a visit before you leave!

This place was ok. Just ok. I was really looking forward to trying out its famous BBQ especially after watching Man v Food. However I found the sandwich and food to be underwhelming overall. The BBQ sauce was way too tangy for my taste. The food is overrated for the wait you have to endure to eat there. In sum Phil's BBQ is overrated.

This place is simply delicious! Definitely worth a visit if you're in SD! The line may look long, but it moves faster than you'll expect. We stood in line where it said "20 minutes from here" and it was a very accurate wait time. It's actually not that long because you'll be pondering what to get on the menu, and by the time you've decided, it's your turn to order! Between 2 people, we wanted to get the full rack meal and extra ribs, but we decided to just get the full rack meal.  I'm glad we didn't order the extra ribs, because the meal was pretty big! To be honest, the ribs weren't as tender as I expected, but the sauce, oh the sauce... very delicious. I should have bought a bottle of the sauce. We didn't finish the fries or potato salad, it was a huge portion. If you're eating with more than 2 people, I would suggest order the full rack +extra ribs. The sides in the full meal is enough to feed 3-4 people.

You know that BBQ restaurant of your dreams that you'd never thought you'd find? Yea, well Phil's is definitely "the one"... I've never had BBQ that was so tender, moist, well-seasoned, and perfectly crispy in my life! I've been to my fair share of BBQ places, but this one is definitely the best. Instead of merely serving bland meat smothered in BBQ sauce, they actually serve generous portions of flavorful meat with plenty of their signature smoky sauce. My bf and I ordered the beefy ribs, as well as the baby back (pork) ribs. Both were phenomenal, but we both liked the beefy ribs better, simply because the ribs are ENORMOUS and they come with soooo much meat! I highly recommend getting their ribs. After all, they are award-winning! The sides are good, but not phenomenal. The corn on the cob is sweet, but pretty standard. The french fries are really delicious, but they lack the saltiness that I usually love...and they do start to get a bit mushy after awhile. I can't speak much for the coleslaw, since I'm just not much of a 'slaw eater, but my bf seemed to enjoy it. The atmosphere of this place is downright comfy and homey! Even though I've never been to Texas before, I'd imagine it to be like this joint. Unfortunately, their lines do get super long, so you might find yourself waiting for awhile, although it does give you plenty of time to figure out what to order. They have lots of seating room, so finding a table isn't too challenging. I love me some BBQ...especially Phil's! :)

We had the ribs and they were good. But I wish I had chosen not to have the sauce put on them.  Just too saucy. The ribs were huge and juicy. The sides delicious, especially the beans. We got an order of onion rings...I didn't care for the batter...I prefer a lighter version. Either go really early or be prepared to wait in a long line. We got there about 11:00am on a Sunday morning. I think we waited for 45 minutes. Parking was difficult since the parking lot doesn't match the capacity of what the restaurant holds and the number of people waiting in line, not to mention all of the other businesses in the strip mall. The staff were very nice and very quick to clean up, or ask if you needed anything.

My fervor for this place has subsided. The food is AMAZING, but everything else that goes along with it is annoying and just not worth it anymore. Here's why: 1) THE LINE: Every time I drive by there is a HUGE line around the corner, plan on waiting a long time. No thanks. 2) THE SEATING: the "open seating" arrangement is frustrating. People fighting and arguing over tables. You have to stalk people with empty plates and then throw elbows to get their seat. 3) THE BAR: I used to sit in the bar to avoid the chaos, but now they have all these new rules (e.g. you can only buy food if you are sitting at the bar, but I see people shark tables and have one person sit at the bar and order food for everyone). This place needs to expand or open another location in San Diego, it has become too popular and frenzied. Food (5 stars) + Atmosphere (1 star) = 3 stars.

Came here many times while I was in school down in SD. I have to say, definitely the best bbq I've ever had...the only thing I took a star off for was the price of the food, $20 for half bbq baby back ribs and a drink?! Definitely tried to stay clear of the place because I would have been an even more broke college student! Friendly staff, never had a complaint about them. Pretty quick line, even though it wraps around the building. There have been times where I've had to wait at least 45 minutes to just get to the doors, but after that the food comes out pretty quick. YUM.

This place sucks!   I called beforehand since I saw that veggie burgers take at least 15 minutes to make on their online menu.  The guy who I talked to couldn't take my order beforehand because he said the grills weren't fired up yet (I called like 10 minutes before they actually opened) but that it would be only like 10 minutes of a wait for the veggie burger.   When we got there there was already a line but it did move quickly, you are treated like cattle, a lady sitting on a stool letting you know when you can move from the line to the cash registers to order.  When I got to the cash register I placed my veggie burger order and she said it would be "at least 20 minutes" I told her I called ahead of time and she said well I don't know why they would tell you it would only take 10 minutes.  Customer service sucks here.  Plus why would it take 20 minutes to make a damn veggie burger?  We ended up leaving and going to eat somewhere else.

Okay, I'm not sure what all the hype is about... but I think Phil's is overrated. I WISH I could give a 3.5 stars, because it's not a 3 but not a 4 either. I'm glad I came here right when it opened so I didn't have to wait in line for hours because in all honesty, I don't think it's worth it to have to wait THAT long. I'm not gonna lie, the ribs are good... but I don't see anything special from Lucille's? The portions are big and the sides are good, but again.. I don't see anything super special! :( Also, I don't like the fact that you have to order and pay first then you get your food. What if you want more? Then you have to go back and wait in line?!

This place is AMAZING! The sauce is really good. Its BBQ with a hint of spicy. I got the Half Rib Dinner and shared it among 2 other girls. We each got about 2 ribs and it was definitely enough food, but I could have eaten more. The macaroni salad is good. Oh and make sure to get extra sauce on the side so you can dip your fries in. I think there ribs are much better than Lucille's but I really like Lucille's biscuits with their apple butter. Definitely going back here whenever I am back in San Diego.

I'm probably one of the last locals to try the place out.  I honestly don't know why it took me so long to have me a piece of Phil's.  Maybe because I'm not such a big fan of all things BBQ.  Haha.   Anyway, I was so excited to eat dinner here but when we got there the line was super duper long and we were super duper hungry so we opted for some take out.  I know it's not getting that whole Phil's BBQ experience but I'm sure I'll eat inside... one day. The order came out pretty fast.  Probably a 10-15MIN. wait compared to an hour of waiting in line.  I'm sure we would still be waiting in line even after driving back home to Scripps and finishing our meal in the comfort of our own home. On to the food:  of course we ordered the full dinner of baby back ribs, the rib-less dinner, the full beef rib dinner, and the half chicken dinner.  Sounds like a lot huh!?  Apparently not for our family.  We pretty much demolished everything on our plates besides the chicken.  I think we ordered too much!?  Hmm.. the baby back ribs were so f*cking good but everything else was just okay.  Maybe because I'm not a fan of bbq beef rib or bbq chicken. I used to not like BBQ as much but Phil's made me a believer and I'll be back for some more yo.

I am pretty picky when it comes to BBQ, and Phil's was okay. There is a secret to faster seating, but I wont tell... Their pulled pork sandwich is amazing. I would recommend that and fries to anyone that eats here. The ribs are okay and that is why I wasn't the biggest fan of Phil's. The line can get ridiculous, but the outside bar has a few drinks available for purchase. Overall I think the place is overrated. But the pulled pork is really good.

Yes its true all of it. It is the bomb, and you do have to wait over an hour to be seated if you dine in.  Tip one if you've never been is stick to the baby back ribs, the chicken for me has been hit or miss.  Tip two, order to go! 15 minutes max for me on Sundays, and I just pick up and head home to watch football in the comfort of my own home face covered in BBQ sauce.

It probably deserves a four, but for all the hype and the wait, it gets a 3. The food...  I love ribs, I love BBQ, I love meat in general, but... this place just does it well.  Not great, not amazing, not even "really good".  Perhaps the fact that I'm from the midwest ruins my expectations, but a lot of decent neighborhood joints in the midwest have better ribs.  Sadly, the best part would be the sauce, which sort of masks the BBQ in general (hence why dry rub is so hard to pull off).  REALLY good BBQ should be falling off the bones with smoked in flavor, and maybe a wet rub if you like sauces (which I also enjoy).  So... I'm sticking to an "A-OK' on this. The ridiculous wait... I just don't understand it.  Perhaps it's the lack of BBQ places around, but I can't believe the wait that's out there.  For mediocre BBQ I wouldn't wait in that line.  Though I guess with the fact that I could grab drinks in the line it'd both make the waiting better, and perhaps hinder my judgement once I got in? Overall... A-OK since it's decent ribs, but if I'm around the area, there are so many other good places to go.

For openers, they cheat. They cheat, but it is good. Used to be when San Diego called we'd go to K.C. Barbecue down on Market Street; the food wasn't great but it was, after all, the restaurant/bar where a lot of the scenes from Top Gun were shot.  It has since burned and, in search of barbecue, we were pointed towards Phil's. Phil's is a local phenomenon in a city in a state not known for barbecue. A phenomenon in that the former hole-in-the-wall restaurant now is many times its former self and serving up to 3,000 folks on a weekend day. But it's not barbecue!   What Phil's serves is very tasty  ribs and chicken (and presumably other items we did not try) that are subjected to their great rub, baked, slapped on the grill, coated with sauce and then grilled again, caramelizing the sauce giving the meat a nice char and a good flavor - but it's not barbecue. Barbecue, by definition, is meat low temperature slow cooked over hickory, oak, maybe apple or mesquite...  then maybe slathered in sauce and finished over an open grill flame. If your criteria is whether it tastes good, then Phil's is your place. If you're a purist who wants to see the smoke ring and taste the wood flavor (most barbecuers use hickory), Phil's is not for you. For the record, their food does  is fairly priced, the people are super friendly and yes the lines can wrap around the building - manager Jorge Garcia said the wait weekends can hit two hours.   If you go, their baby back ribs are excellent, ditto the chicken... no one in our group tried their gigantic beef ribs or the pulled pork  sandwich. The fries were hand cut and good, onion rings had hard outer crust and great if that's your choice, the baked beans, slaw and ear of corn all very good. It's good, but for the purists amongst us, it . Baking meat, rubbing it with spices and then sauceing, is not barbecue - despite what the sign says.. Four Stars.

We were visiting San Diego from LA, a friend of ours invited us to meet them for dinner at Phil's BBQ.  When we got there (around 6:30 on a Friday  night), there was a line of about 50 people in front of us.  I knew I was in for a treat since people don't line up for just any restaurant. We ordered ribs, onion rings, corn, and potato salad.  WOW!!!  I can't remember having better tasting ribs in my life.  My wife is so picky when eating ribs, nibbling on them and leaving the fat chunks.  She cleaned these ribs to the bone.  The onion rings were also delicious.   Not only was the food great, but the service was incredible.  This is a casual dining, place where you don't really have a server, but there were employees walking around asking if we needed anything constantly. I would definitely make this a stop if you're in the San Diego area.

Yelp seriously let me down on this one.  We waited in the long line for about an hour and finally we get up to the front and realize that its the cashiers that are so super slow that make that line!  There were plenty of tables open when we sat down so maybe they need to rethink their order taking process?  The menu is super limited for a BBQ place, so we settled on Baby Back ribs and chicken combo and the El Toro Sandwich.  The sandwich was almost inedible due to the amount of sauce on it.  Was there meat there? Im not sure, all we tasted was sauce and frankly the sauce is weird, almost tastes sour.  The ribs were ok, luckily they didnt have a ton of sauce on the them and the chicken was eh, I have definitely had better! This place is all hype, and it really bugged me that they had a sign that said if you were going to rate them lower than 5 stars on yelp to talk to them first.  Maybe I would have if the reason I was rating them so low had to do with something they could fix but really I think their food only warrants 2 stars.  I have had better at MANY other BBQ places (even chain BBQ restaurants!) Up to you if you want to wait in the ridiculous line for average food, never again for me!

3,000+ San Diegans, plus Food Network, can't be wrong: Phil cooks up some amaaaazing BBQ. First off, I'm ridiculously picky about BBQ sauce. Phil's has it down: spicy, a little sweet, laced with vinegar. It's perfect. Then they slather it on perfectly smoked meat: their pulled pork, in particular, is succulent and tender and delicious. Their brisket is hit-or-miss, but when it's good it's pretty much the best thing in San Diego. Folks, there's a reason the line wraps around the entire strip mall. It's literally THAT GOOD. However, if you live nearby and don't want to wait, they allow call-ahead take out orders. And then you get to go straight to the head of the line. Which, honestly, makes it worth five stars right there.

I love going to Phil's BBQ! This place is soooo good. Really great service, they employees all do their work well. The food is amazing and really reasonably priced. My favorite is the BBQ Broham. I get a side of the 'sweet baked beans' and get the coleslaw on the side. There is so much meat that I usually take the extra home and have it on some bread for lunch the next day. And for only 6.95 its such a great deal. I'm pretty sure everyone in SD has tasted this goodness. If you are visiting SD from out of town, make sure you come here for at least one meal! The line can get really long, but it's work the wait.

Bf and I decided to come down to SD for a mini vacay and one of my to-do list is to come to Phil's because of all the yelp reviews. We got here around 6:30pm today and the line wasn't too bad looking. I think there's about 15 ppl or so passed the 21-min mark. My bf didn't want to wait so we phone in our order in the car, waited about 5 mins, and walked into the restaurant. I think the whole process from waiting in line to getting our food only took about max 10 mins. We ordered the full baby back ribs dinner w/ sweet baked beans and macaroni salad and beefy rib tickler just we can have a variety since it's our first and probably our last visit. I do agree there's plenty of meat on the beef rib, but we still prefer the pork ribs. I think you'll like the beef if you're into stew beef. It has a similar texture. Now for the sauce, as some yelpers, it is on the tangy side. We prefer if they tone it down one notch, but we got used to it after awhile. The meat wasn't completely fall off the bone, but didn't need much effort to get the meat off. As for the sides, we liked the macaroni salad and the beans. We didn't think much of the cole slaw. At first I thought it was because it got kind of warm due to the fact they packed it with the hot food, but after eating more of it, there just wasn't anything special about it. The fries wasn't good. First off, it was under the beef rib, so they got smashed. Secondly, with the bbq sauce and any juices made them soft. However, I have a feeling the fries weren't crispy to begin with. We score three onion rings with the tickler and they're pretty good. The batter was light, crunchy and a bit sweet. Good combo. It's hard to find good bbq these days and I think Phil's is one of the good ones. However, the rub on the ribs has too much salt (it's been about three hours since I ate and I'm still thirsty!)

3.5 stars If it'll be your first time here - just go, you won't hate it :) Errrrrrr...sorry but I can't agree with the majority here.  However (really BIG however), I can see why one might enjoy this place.  It's inexpensive. The meat IS very tender and you get huge-A-mongo portions!  At 5'1" and 110 I shouldn't have ordered the Beefy Rib dinner (3 bones) as I did.  I probably should have gone for the 'tickler' which is a much smaller size but enough to get you nice and full. The sauce is super tangy which I personally don't care for and they douse the stuff all over.  The service was great.  We had a nice guy named Luis bussing our table who seemed to love his job.  I can really appreciate that after having had my share of bad customer service (particularly in the Point Loma area). Oh, and yes, the line - it moves quickly, so NBD. Bottom line: I prefer my BBQ to have a sweeter taste which Phil's did not. But if you haven't tried it - gooooo!!!  You might just fall in love...

This place is SO GOOD! We drive from downtown to this restaurant for lunch on occasion it's that good. I personally like the beef over the pork or chicken but everyone likes something different. Also when you go, be sure you get extra sauce, they give you a lot but trust me, you will need more! The side are good, coleslaw and backed beans are my favorite. I am a fan of get-it-yourself when it comes to drinks, silverware, plates, to-go boxes, etc. so if you liked to get wined and dined this is not the place for you. The only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is the wait, it's out the door and around the block if you don't get there soon after opening or in off-peak eating hours. While they have a pretty efficient system for handling the crowds and even a "mini bar" in the patio area to belly up to while you wait, it can still be frustrating.

The last thing this place needs is another review--- but WOW...the ribs here were so damn good I couldn't not write about them. Here are my thoughts: --the line is long but moves fast. It's worth it to wait and sit inside because the atmosphere makes it better; i'm convinced that this food just wouldn't taste as good if I ate it at home --you MUST try the ribs. The chicken is good too, but nothing compares to the ribs --the baked beans are also delish!!! I was in Texas a few months ago for a wedding, and no TX bbq I went to even remotely compared to Phil's. I'm not even a big meat eater but these ribs will have me going back frequently.

Absolutely amazing place that's worth the 45+ minute long wait. I'm amazed I haven't heard of this place before but when me and gf went to go to Sea world for the first time, we followed my friend Jason's Joseph's advice and stopped by here. Everyone stands in line, no reservations. Amazing, succulent BBQ. I had the BBQ full rack and ate the whole thing while downing 4 beers. All the sides were perfect. I had cole slaw and macaroni salad. What to expect: 1) Park in expansive strip mall style parking. 2) Stand in line. 3) Wait. 4) Get hungry. 5) Order at counter-- then someone will seat you and you eat. We got lucky waiting in line because they had an opening at the bar if we had a party of 5 or more. I was with my GF so we formed an ad-hoc group with 3 friendly san diego natives and a telecommunications engineer from Qualcomm who was originally from South africa. We all bonded over the most delicious BBQ ever. I actually found the bar experience great because we didn't order at the counter-- we actually had a waitress take our order.  She must have expected us to be an adhoc group because she offered right away to split our checks. I estimate we were able to get in about 20 minutes earlier than what we would have and the booth seating was nice! Beer selection is surprisingly good, with some surprising items such as sangria and apple cider. The staff are very well organized, and seemed to be in full communication with each other at all times. We were told to come in from the side entrance and we thought it was a bit dodgy but as soon as we walked in the door the staff was there to seat us. This is a very well run restaurant, with delicious food. A must visit place if you are in San Diego.

To be honest, I never crave for BBQ, but I had to try it because of the rave reviews. I loved it. The first time I went here, I ordered Beef Rib Ticklers, onion rings, corn, chicken... overdid it. The second time, I just settled for the Beef Rib Ticklers and a side of macaroni salad. I never had to wait more than 15 minutes, so maybe that made my experiences 5-stars. I definitely think it's worth a try.

When I told my friends from UCSD during my recent visit back there that I hadn't been to Phil's yet, they immediately started screaming. How could I have attended UCSD for 4 years and never been to Phil's?? Even friends from Vancouver have been there. This place is internationally famous! I guess the stories of the lines always prevented me from wandering over there. But I was only in San Diego for a few days on this visit, which was my first visit back in 2 years. I decided it was worth waiting in line to see if this place was worth the hype. It was. I went for lunch on Sunday and only had to wait about 20 minutes, which isn't bad considering that's the typical wait at any good restaurant for dinner. There's a menu outside for newbies to analyze while waiting in line. You pay first at the booth and then get seated. If you have a large party the staff will kidnap, I mean, take one person to a table to save it for you. We got a nice booth table for my group of 7 and our orders came relatively quickly. I shared a half rack of baby back ribs with steamed veggies and stole some fries and an onion ring from others. I expected the steamed veggies to be overcooked and gross, but they were actually lightly steamed and still crunchy and quite good! I was impressed...it certainly made me feel less bad about eating ribs. The sauce is definitely the secret, it has a sort of tangy flavor that really makes the meat more delicious. And you can buy bottles of the BBQ sauce to go home. They also sell this sauce at the San Diego Costco! Now I regret not having gone in college. It's worth it.

Got half a rack of ribs, the pulled pork sandwich, and three sides for $28. Pretty cheap! The sauce the ribs was sooo yummy and they came right off the bone. It came with a LOT of fries. The pulled pork sandwich needed the sauce it came with. The macaroni salad was okay. The beans were pretty good. Definitely get the ribs!!! Luckily we beat the rush, when we arrived we were at the "20 minutes to the front" spot in line. I wasn't too happy about waiting that long but when we sat down the line was wrapped around the side so I guess I'm glad we got there early!

Can't beat the portions and they have the best ribs in town. The line is a bit long (wait times for dinner around 7pm are consistently 25-30 minutes) but once you're inside, you order and grab whatever table is open. They have a rack of paper towels on each table to try and keep you clean but it's impossible to eat their ribs politely (and if you can, you're not really enjoying the rib.. or life). I will definitely keep coming back.

It was completely by accident that Jamie W. and I ended up at Phil's BBQ this past weekend when we took a quick getaway to San Diego. We were looking for an early dinner before getting ourselves to the airport. Jamie had a hankering for barbecue, and I just happened to notice the number of check-ins at Phil's. When I read the glowing reviews, I was sold. But we were rather disheartened to see the long line that extended around the shopping center sidewalk. Jamie immediately asked the middle-aged woman in front of us whether the wait was worth it to which she replied, "Oh si, si, si !" Then her husband and hyperactive brat with his Nintendo showed up. Fifty-five minutes later, we were finally able to order at the counter. I went for the $13.25 Half Rib Dinner, a half-dozen baby back ribs ladled liberally with their barbecue sauce and accompanied by corn on the cob (see photo). Jamie ordered the $6.95 BBQ Broham, which is a pulled pork sandwich piled high with Cole slaw and topped with barbecue sauce (see photo). Both were delicious, hearty amounts of finger-licking, family-style food that certainly should have satisfied the husky likes of us. But no, we needed to have the $5.95 large order of the Colossal Onion Rings, a house specialty that lived up their ballyhooed reputation - crunchy-crispy, huge and tasty with the cup of ranch dressing on the side (see photo). And to delude us into thinking we should eat something healthier, we shared the $5.95 Caesar Salad which was thick with their housemade dressing (see photo). It is quite an efficient operation they have here where you pick up your food when your buzzer goes off. If you order more food than your two arms can carry, then you get a helper that follows you like a sherpa. The line didn't let up all the time we were there, and the waitress would come by every couple of minutes to see if everything was OK. In other words, she's waiting for us to get our butts out of the booth, so another starving group of diners can gorge on their ribs. Like us, you'll be going through a lot of hand-sanitizing wipes to get the sauce from under your fingernails. Good stuff and yep, worth the wait. FOOD - 4 stars...famous BBQ lives up its local reputation AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...big place with plenty of seating, but that line still wraps around the building SERVICE - 3.5 stars...they're attentive for sure TOTAL - 4 stars...be patient and bring an appetite...and a Kindle

I usually don't have high standards for BBQ places. They all seem the same to me... decent food, but nothing that would really entice me back. That said, I would go back to Phil's. I normally don't care much for BBQ chicken (most places are too dry and overcooked). This one was amazing! Perfectly juicy and tender. I took one bite and wished that I had just gotten the chicken instead of the beef ribs too. Speaking of those, they were HUGE! The meat was tasty, a little tough for my liking. They also need to give you a better knife for those, the generic restaurant knife just wasn't working. I had a bite of the babe back ribs from my friend and they were very tasty too. I would have preferred those instead of the beef. You can get the sauce on the side, which I like so my food isn't overly doused with sauce. I got the steamed veggies as a side, those were disappointing... more like blanched veggies. You order from the register and grab a table, then go up and grab your food. That makes the service relatively fast. I didn't have a problem getting a table, but I could see how it would be difficult during rush meal hours. Overall, a fun place for a casual afternoon lunch.

My BF has been wanting to try this place ever since he saw it featured on the Travel Channel.  We were visiting family in SD and finally decided to give it a try.  We WERE going for lunch..but after seeing the dine in line wrap around the building..we decided on something else.   We were determined to eat at this place this time around and decided to order take out to avoid waiting in line.  I called at 6:30pm to place our order.  We ordered the Full rack baby back pork ribs meal with large cole slaw ($20), Full rack of beef ribs meal w large cole slaw ($20), and large order of onion rings ($7).  When we arrived, there must have been 150+ people in line.   My sister in law dropped me off in the front and i seriously thought i would just stroll on in to the front and get my togo order....so not the case!  I walked to the entrance and noticed there were two lines funneling into the entrance..the line to the right was the dine in line and the line to the left was the take out line...holy crap there were like 30 people waiting in the take out line too!! I waited about 30min in the take out line before getting to the cashier and paying for the meal.  It took about another 2-3min before I got my order...i would really suggest getting togo if you can...i would not wait 2+ hours for a meal. Now onto the food.  There's a lot more meat on the beef ribs, but i prefer the baby back ribs cuz the meat is leaner.  The onion rings were awesome..it was still really good even though it was sitting in the take out box for like 15min.  The cole slaw was really good ask well...not too much mayo and slightly sweet.  I thought the bbq sauce was ooook.  im not big on vinegar based sauce and it felt vinegery to me.  Overall, pretty good bbq.  Definitely worth a visit if ur into bbq.

2nd time coming here. LOVED the macaroni salad from the first time. Friendly service. The staff was always smiling, not in a creepy fashion either! LOVED arriving there and not having to wait in a long line. Our order came very quickly as well! This is not my favorite ribs place. It fell off the bone but that's all it did. The sauce was too tangy for me. The ribs weren't grilled so that it formed a crispy exterior as well. Go to Lucille's or Cecil's for those kinds of ribs with AMAZING sauce. But on to the side dishes... cole slaw was bomb esp when paired with ribs. It was light but crunchy. So good. Macaroni salad was good as always.. I have no idea what they put in there but I saw some eggs and onions. No wonder I always get onion breath after eating this :( Beware of that if you're on a first date.. bc by the 3rd or 4th date onion breath shouldn't really matter as much.. right? haha OH their fries were so good as well! They gave A LOT... about 3/4 a plate full and the plates are huge! And again, service as amazing. We had 25 girls and they accommodated all of us, bringing us extra chairs and wetnaps + plastic bags after we ate :) I'll def hit this up again if i'm ever in SD.

I was a bit skeptical about this place initially.  I've been to some of Man vs Food spots and have been very disappointed.  So with great reviews and all this hype, it had a lot to live up to.  And of course, I had mentally prepared for a 1hr+ wait, wondering how my 3 nieces and nephews would cope. When I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised to see how efficient and clean this place was.  You line up, order your food and find a seat.  We ordered 2 full racks of baby back ribs with side orders that were the size of full plates.  The ribs were served in about 5-10 min.   These ribs were smoky, tender with a sauce that was not too sweet nor overwhelming.  It's so finger licking good that they installed a sanitary door opener in the restroom!  I am so impressed, I wish they would have this at every restaurant.  (see pic) There's also a bar where you can get beer on tap. The staff constantly came over to check up on us to see if we needed anything and how everything tasted. Great food, friendly smiling staff, clean, fast and painless.  Bring your kids and other people's kids, it's going to be a hit.   I just wish there was one in the OC.  I still dream of these ribs so I  shall make another hour drive soon to make it a reality.

Mmmm... this is some tasty BBQ. When you get to Phil's, there are two lines. The carry-out line and the dine-in line. Obviously, the dine-in line is significantly longer. But, it does go by quick. Grab your ticket number and wait patiently for your order to be called. One of the things I do appreciate about Phil's are the plethora of hand washing stations throughout the restaurant so that you don't have to walk to the bathroom to clean off the tangy BBQ sauce. BTW Phil's uses a sweet and slightly spicy sauce for their BBQ. It's a bit closer to Carolina BBQ than Texas BBQ. Personally, I'm not a fan of the rub they use for their ribs, but to each his or her own. As for parking, yes, it's quite a madhouse to find parking. You'll know you're getting close, because of the overflow of cars onto the street.

Yumm. When I lived in SD, my roommates and I would go visit Phil's whenever we were bored. It was all gooood until I realized that all that yummy bbq and onion rings will catch up with you real fast in your stomach and thighs. I don't like bbq- the sauce and getting messy- but this is so worth it. The meat just falls right off and you really have to get the onion rings or your meal is just incomplete. The pig is definately much better than their cow ribs. I just don't like how long the lines have become.

My favorite: Beef ribs- so juicy and tender- lots of meat falling off the bone! Onion rings- huge beer batter rings, how can you go wrong? El toro- my husband loves it The best time to go is during the week right when it opens. The weekends are really busy but worth the wait!

Phil's never fails. Except maybe when it's super busy, you get there at 7pm, and you have to wait basically an hour to get your food. BUT besides that, win. I always get the Baby Back Ribs Tickler since I'm not a boss and basically incapable of eating more than that anyway. My guy friends love this place because they can eat a ridiculous amount of saucy meat, get it all over their face, and no one takes a second glance. It can get a little pricey for the more substantial meals but you can always take what you don't finish home in a "quitter box" ;) BBQ meats + fries/onion rings/whatever sides you prefer + a pitcher of beer = good times with friends every time. Also, sweet sink to wash your hands of all grubbiness on the way out. Plus.

Ah Phil's bbq. The 2nd food trip place on my SD trip list. Adam Richman lured me in. The El Toro burger what was i was after. This burger made it to the Semi-finals on Adams show "Best Sandwiches On America" show. Store opened at 11 and we were early. Decided to go elsewhere to kill time and as we returned the line was already forming! We make it to the front and it was interesting. You get to the counter inside and order first, handed cups, and a pger  then are welcome to seat anywhere you like. Pretty good layout and process if you ask me. Waiter was polite and I order the El Toro burger. Wait was hmm maybe 20minutes. The actual burger was aiiiight. What made the burger was the tri-tip. Sauce was a lil too much in my book. Will i return?! yes i will because BBQ is a man's paradise =)

Hmm..trying to figure out what the hype is all about.  The food here is good, but it's not worth the wait in line (the line moves faster than you think...it took about 30 minutes to get our food).  Tip: if it's your bday, you can cut the line (we had a bday person, but didn't know that!) Ate here for a snack so ordered a "tickler," which is basically a small combo: 2 onion rings, 5 babyback ribs, coleslaw, fries.  Also had a bite of friend's pulled pork sandwich.  I thought the pulled pork sandwich was too saucy, but it's pretty decent.  The babyback ribs are very tender (liked it more than the pulled pork), but the bbq sauce was too thick & sweet for my taste. (I'm comparing it to Texas style bbq, which is more of my preference).  Onion rings were too greasy, yet not even crunchy.  Slaw was decent and fries would have been better if they were hot (similar tasting and style to in & out fries). Overall, food is ok...if you like thick, sweet bbq sauce then you will love Phil's...but if you like the lighter, tangier sauce style of Texas (like me), then u will think this place is overhyped.

Love. The baby back ribs are sooo tender, melt in your mouth! The bbq sauce is perfect. Not too sweet, not too strong & salty. They serve the biggest onion rings you've ever seen! I went on a Sunday around 530pm & waited about 20 minutes. By 6pm, the line was around the corner of the building! It is definitely worth it though! I recommend splitting the baby back rib plate with fries, beans, & a side of onion rings with someone else (or two). We did not even finish it all, but I tried & kept eating...still stuffed 2 days later lol!

These are the best ribs I have put in my mouth at a restaurant. The beefy ribs are the best and they are fall off the bone delicious. They are covered with a tangy sauce that adds a special flavor. The ribs are not the only good things they offer. I love getting their beer battered onion rings, which are huge. They also have amazing Macaroni Salad that everyone should try at one point. The only problem is that there might be a line especially on weekends so plan ahead by looking at the phil's cam on their website. Overall its great food and a great atmosphere.

It was my first time ever going/eating there and it was very good.  You just have to accept the fact that you'll be waiting in line between 20-40 minutes.  I used to get scared of those long lines outside, but really, it's not too bad.   The overall atmosphere is pretty cool.  We actually ended up cutting the line and eating in the bar area so we got a waiter (I believe you order your own food, pick it up, and find a table if you're in the general area).  The waiter was very nice and the food was quick to get to our table.  I think they prepare so much food in advance that they literally just take what you want and put it on a plate so the wait time is about five minutes. The overall food was good.  Was it as great as I thought and as everyone had hyped?  Not really.  It was just chicken and baby back ribs with barbecue sauce.  I think everyone just enjoys the overall experience, which, I enjoyed, too, so it gets a four.

Phil's doesn't really need any new reviews... but I just want to stay, this place is SUPER CONSISTENT. A lot of BBQ spots I've been to are not consistent enough.  Sometimes the ribs are too chewy or the chicken is too dry.  However, at Phil's, it is the same every time!  It's quite amazing since so many racks of ribs and so many birds go out. I haven't been back since I left SD after college (around 2 years) but am glad I got to taste Phil's once again.  It's causes serious cravings and there have been countless moments when I would be sitting and all of a sudden... I start thinking about Phil's and my mouth salivate like a Pavlovian dog.   It's that good.   Super long line?  It's worth it.

I'll add one more review to the thousands already here. Phil's is phabulous. Really enjoyed the huge plate of baby back ribs, macaroni salad, and beans. The sauce, slathered thickly on the meat was light, tangy, and had just the right pepper kick. If you want, they will serve it on the side. The meat had just the right tug off the bone with enough of a hold to stay until you pulled it away from your mouth. They cook em over an open pit, resulting in a nice little bit of char and a slow cooked tendness. The whoopee pie to finish was also excellent and too big for one sitting. Phils was worth the 20 minute line (you wouldn't think twice about the same wait if there were not a line). I'd really love to go back and try the tri tip sandwich, but alas I'm 1800 miles away! No matter what though, Phil's is on my list any time I'm in san Diego. By the way, the state of California would like you to know that charcoal might cause cancer. But who wants to live longer without BBQ?

I don't understand the hype, and I certainly don't appreciate the hour-long wait at the door. The food is not bad, but not great. I've been there 3 times, ordered different things, and still thought the food was just average. The baby back ribs were good, but the pulled pork sandwich meat was dry and tough. The sauce was... just okay. Just because it was featured on Food Network doesn't make it great. Sorry.

Good stuff (3.5 stars) + Service EXCELLENT: (this alone  bumps up another star)  Our server Louis was BOMB, so on top of things and really helpful, proactive. Servers would walk along the  line checking for questions about the menu. Really kind and efficient staff :) + Ribs: fall off the bone, tender +/- Chicken: tender and moist, but odd flavor -  Sauce: TANGY/sour, a little too much so for me to enjoy, I enjoy sweeter ones + Giant onion rings: HUGE onion flavor, none of this nothing but batter stuff + Fries: fresh and not too oily + Hand washing station

Oh. My. Gawd. There is a reason why Phil's BBQ has 3456 reviews, now +1. Intense smoky flavor with a mildly spicy after kick, perfectly saucy and charred, fork tender, good portions. YUM. Go on a weekday or night, save yourself the wait, or take out like the locals do. A definite do for San Diego!

Totally turned off by the long line (which wrapped around the side of the restaurant), I noticed the super SHORT LINE for To-Go/Phone Orders. They said that it would take only 15 mins, so of course the BF and I got in line. Full Rib Dinner (10-12 ribs) $18.95 w/ 2 small sides (macaroni salad, cole slaw)- the sauce has a nice kick to it. the ribs are cooked to perfection, and definitely fell off the bone. the sides were pretty normal, and nothing spectacular. Half BBQ Chicken $6.96- also had the same sauce. i was afraid the chicken would be dry, but it also cooked to perfection. Small Onion Rings $3.95- for the small size, it was a lot more than i expected. BEST onion rings i've had so far. The place was PACKED on a Saturday night. So either arrive early, phone in, or order to-go. Definitely worth visiting if coming to San Diego. Scratch that...it's a MANDATORY visit.

It's crazy they had a big line when I thought there would be a quiet time between lunch and dinner.  Once I ordered my food was ready pretty quickly.  I had a rack of beef ribs.  It's the perfect size for a big meal if sides aren't ordered.  The meat was cooked just the way I like with a bit of char on the outside and nice tender meat on the bone.  I don't like the sauce though.  I prefer a sweet sauce like Tony Roma's Carolina Honey sauce.  The fries were good.  Kinda like at In-N-Out Burger.  I like coming here once in awhile when I'm in the mood for some grilled ribs but I hate waiting in a big line outside.

Here I sit in the middle of one of the biggest BBQ states, Texas and crave Phil's BBQ. In three years here in the Dallas area I have only found one place that even has good ribs, and I gotta tell ya, it ain't nothing like Phil's. There is just something about the moist beef on the ribs and the BBQ sauce on the side that is like no place else; and let's not forget that wonderful fried onion ring that comes with every order and because it's so good you just gotta have a full order of them with your food. Miss Phil's and hope to get back to San Diego soon to try the Santee location, where I grew up.

This place is crazy busy from opening to closing and after tasting the food, I see why! The line to be seated was all the way around the building at 4PM on a Thursday! The pulled pork sandwich was the best I've ever had. I don't like cole slaw, but even with it being on the sandwich, it didn't make me like it any less. The sauce is out of this world! I'm not a huge onion ring fan, but I was to I had to try Phil's. They were also the bomb! Generously beer battered and less greasy than most, they were the perfect compliment to the sandwich. We called in our order but it was still so busy that they gave us a pager and we waited 20 minutes because everything is made to order. The prices are ridiculously low too: $7 for the sandwich which had enough meat for 3 sandwiches! I live 2 hours away and visited while we were on vacation, but I would seriously consider driving down just for another meal at Phil's.

Alright, where do I begin? Clearly, with 3000+ reviews, Phil's BBQ is definitely one of the best. We were totally unaware of Phil's popularity and having parked towards the back (closer to Red Lobster next door), we did not see the insanely long line that wrapped around the building at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon. We went in towards the side that had immediate access to the bar and a few empty seats. Aha! What a good way to skip that line! We both ordered the Baby back ribs + Chickless dinner with Coleslaw, Macaroni and Baked beans. Well, what else can I say that other reviews haven't already said? It was pretty darn good!!! I had flashbacks of the best BBQ I've ever had (which was in Kansas City) and Phil's came in really close. The baby back ribs were my favorite! Phil's should open more locations (specifically in LA and OC) so that they can give Lucille's a run for their money!

This place is the best BBQ in San Diego that I know of. I've tried a lot of places around town and none of them compare to the prices and quality here at Phil's. Nothing but raves and rants about how good the food is here and the onion rings always make me drool just thinking about them. However, I don't here as often as I have the craving since sometimes the line can take an hour during dinner time. They really should open a Phil's somewhere else in the San Diego metropolitan area to ease the wait on those lines. One thing I learned is never drink soda while eating Phil's BBQ because you ruin the taste of the BBQ sauce. Their BBQ sauce is so intensely sweet, tangy and spicy that it would be a sin to add sugary sweet syrup like beverage while eating that sauce. A beer or water is the only thing my mouth will consider drinking while inside.   Also, they have a decent selection of taps that are mostly local micros.

First time at San Diego and first time at Phil's BBQ. I told my cousin that the wait better be worth it because I was STARVING!!! The wait wasn't as bad as I thought because my cousins were telling me that they had to wait like hours but we only had to wait about 45min. We ordered the Beefy Rib dinners which comes with two sides and one order of onion rings. While we were in line there were some workers coming by to say hello and make sure that the people weren't freezing in line. I expected Phil's to be like a sit down restaurant but it was more like order, get your food and sit down somewhere unless you had really big party then they let you reserve the table. The beef ribs were DELICIOUS!!!! OMG.... they were HUGE!! It came with five ribs, first I thought five ribs weren't going to do anything but after two...I was going to die. The sides that I got were the cole slaw and the fries and I ordered a side of caesar salad because I thought I would need fiber to flush it down.. (TMI sorry haha) I had to deduct a star for the caesar salad because it was WAYYY TOOO GARLIC-YYY I mean I like garlic but this tasted like PURE RAW GARLIC...omg no. hahahaha I had to keep drinking water to talk to my cousins. haha The tables all had sauces, hot sauces, salt, pepper, and this creole powder that I had no idea what it was but then found out it went really well with the fries. So when I think about ribs I always think of pork so I wasn't very "interested" but when I heard it were beef ribs I got EXCITED! It was juicy and big, it wasn't as fatty as I expected. The BBQ sauce wasn't too over powering so you had the beef meaty taste! The BBQ sauce kind of tasted spicy to me but I might have slathered the creole sauce all over but definitely it was good..and it was hard to admit but it was worth the wait. haha They have a hand washing station so you don't have to use those little hand wipes to wipe all the sauce off your hands. It is the only  rib place that I ever tried but it was definitely delicious! I would come back but it's sooo farr :( I HAVE LEFT OVERS YAY! hahaha (is that gross?)

I failed bad... I was in San Diego... My friends and I went to Phil's BBQ.. And I didn't order anything cause I was full from a BBQ i went to earlier in the day... So while I didn't order.. My friends did.. And before you think "oh what.. this dumbass waited in that long ass line and didn't eat." I'll assure you, that wasn't the case. lol.. My friends ordered to go. And ordering to go and eating it somewhere else sure beats waiting in that long line. Wait 1 to 2 hours in a line to sit inside and be rushed out. Or call in to go and wait 20 minutes for your food and eat in the bed of a truck or in the parking lot and take your time and enjoy the ribs... You choose which sounds more better. lol. But anyways.. My friend let me try one of the ribs. Tons of flavor and it was very good.. I was almost tempted to order some right when i tried it. The onion rings were pretty damn good too. Sooo... Phil's BBQ, I had a emotional trip back to San Dimas because i didn't get any food. I for SURE gotta make a trip back to San Diego before I start up school again. And next time I'm coming with an empty stomach so I can grub on some RIBS! :D

My first time here is very comfortable. Things are very casual----line up to wait for a table for 8 only took less than 15 minutes, one person went to order food and the rest of us can be seated. We didn't wait too long to pick up the foods at the counter. You serve yourselves for all you can drink sodas and for utensils. The baby short ribs are the best that I like most.

Typically if I had built up this amazing rib joint in my mind from all the people raving and claiming how amazing this place is I would probably give this place a 4. However this place unfortunately does not live up to the hype or the wait. I came on a Tuesday night adn the wait was seroiusly 35 min.. RIDICULOUS. Ribwise.. this place is probably one of the best places place i've gone to, given i'm not obsessed with ribs in the first place. The place is clean and a great place to have dinner. Portions are huge and the meat almost falls off the bone. The one thing I wish they worked on were the sides. They were all very mediocre. Nothing stood out to me. The coleslaw macaroni salad fries were all not very good. I'll probably come back to bring guests but overall I am not wowed by my experience.

Phil invited us back to try again. We went straight to the front of the line and were treated like royalty. Best experience we've had there. We've gone twice more since then. Both times were excellent experiences; though, the royalty treatment disappears when you're not under the spotlight, of course. :) I still call Phil's BBQ my favorite restaurant and recommend it to practically everyone I meet. Phil knows how to do business (please your customers), and I will be continuing to bring my business to him for the unforeseeable future.

Phil's BBQ is just too good.  I would never choose to go out to eat BBQ until I came here for the first time a few years ago.  The wait is super long, but it is definitely worth it!  I usually order the baby back rib tickler which comes with a couple ribs, 2 onion rings, slaw, and fries.  The sauce is so delicious and the meat falls off the bone.  It is so much food, I usually have leftovers to take home for dinner! This is a great place to bring out of town friends.  You have plenty of time to catch up while you are waiting in line. It is also a great place to go with big groups because everyone orders and pays separately! Just be sure that your entire group is there before ordering and being seated, because there are no saving seats Also, the service here is amazing.  Staff is everywhere and ready to help. If you are in a hurry but still want Phil's you can call in your order and pick it up in a separate phone order and to-go line!  This is the best bet if you want quick food during crowded dining times.

I have to agree with Forrest D. Phil's BBQ may be the best in San Diego, but as a native Texan, there are a few things I'm looking for in my BBQ. - The quantity of the sauce: It's gotta be great BBQ sauce- more on that later. And the meat has to either be smothered in sauce or there needs to be an extra side of sauce. And there's none of this business of charging extra for more sauce. The meat was "smothered" (so they claimed), but it was not. Not by my standards at least. - The taste of the sauce: I like my sauce a little tangy and a little sweet. This sauce was super vinegar-y, which is fine, but the look and the taste reminded me of a hot and sour sauce at a Chinese restaurant. - The meat: The sign of great BBQ for me isn't just the ribs/brisket/pulled pork, but also how tender they can make white meat chicken. The white meat (I'm not talking the chickless, but the actual bone-in) was not tender. It was more on the dry side, and it wasn't seasoned past the skin. And without additional sauce, this made the white meat hard to continue eating. The ribs on the other hand were fine. - The sides: We got the cole slaw and the baked beans. I'm used to BBQ baked beans. This was more soupy- it looked like lentil soup. The taste was interesting- I can't quite describe it, but I'm guessing it's not made with their BBQ sauce. The cole slaw was pretty good, probably better than some other slaws I've had. I do have to say that Phil's is super clean considering all the eating with the hands and sauce-smearing that's going on. They also have a hand washing station. And the service was awesome. Our order taker was super sweet, and the employees checked on us maybe three times during our meal. When we came at 12:30 on a Saturday, there wasn't a wait! We probably just got lucky. Don't get me wrong. The food was good. It just wasn't the best I've ever had. But I guess 3000+ beg to differ.

My roommates had a trip to SD and when they returned they could not stop raving about how good Phil's ribs were. Then, I noticed EVERYONE were raving about this place so I decided to check this place out myself. The line wrapped around the place and I assumed it would take an hr or two but my boyfriend and I waited a little over 30 minutes (the line moved super fast). When we got in we ordered: Half Baby Back Rib Dinner w/ cole slaw and baked beans, small onion ring, and BBQ Broham sandwich. ALLL THREE OF WHAT WE ORDERED WERE AMAZING. I now understood the numerous ribs. The price is amazing, the food is amazing. I absolutely love how everything is set up. Everything is ready for you and if you end up not finishing your food then the to-go box and bags are by the utensils for you to take home. I can't wait to go back to SD to have Phil's again.

I'm a San Diego native  and I'm going to commit sacrilege. Phil's BBQ was disappointing. And here's why. Before the tar and feathers roll in, I just want to say that I love BBQ. I LOVE it. I've driven to Compton for it (literally). BBQ is about slow-cooked meat (low and slow baby) so tender that it melts in your mouth, with a complex yet utterly food-orgasmic sauce on the side. BBQ is about the love and care someone puts into their meat -- a kind of love that you can just taste. Now I expected a wait when we got there. Fine. I'm okay for waiting for good food. So to me, that wasn't the issue. We ordered the baby back ribs, beef ribs with sides of macaroni salad, coleslaw and onion rings. The beef ribs were straight up CHARRED. And not delicious charred but tough and dry charred. The charred meat had no taste except for 'burnt'. Ugh. I didn't like chewing through that at all. The baby back ribs were all right but I've had better. They were not melty or tender. They were just over-cooked ribs with sauce slathered all over it. The sauce was not to my liking -- it had a tomato-y taste that clinged to my lips in a way that I was not fond of. I'm all for red sauces, but this red sauce was not my thing. The macaroni salad had so much pepper that my culinary friend Anna, regarded it as "pepper salad." Coleslaw was decent. However the onion rings were the BEST THING I EVER HAD. Oh man, I will go back to Phil's just for the onion rings. Woo, baby those onion rings are GOOD. Perfectly battered and when you take a nice big bite, the batter/onion doesn't move - giving you that perfect bite of onion and beer batter that will satisfy you for days. Never had anything like it. The service was impeccable - 5 stars for their customer service. But the rest? Maybe we had a bad batch of ribs. I mean who can argue with 1,000 5-star reviews? Well San Diego, I'm going to say it. There is better BBQ out there. I love the beach, I love the Chargers, but I think I'm going to get my BBQ elsewhere. Except for the onion rings. I will always come back for those delicious onion rings.

This place is DAMN good!  Kinda just stumbled upon it on our San Diego vacation.  We didn't see the long line til after we parked the car. At first, we weren't sure if we were up for a wait, but the line moved surprisingly fast.  As we got closer up, we noticed that there was a bar area.  We were told that we could sit in there with the kids, as they don't serve hard alcohol..just beer and wine. So we got to go right in, cutting about ten minutes of our wait time. We ordered a large order of the onion rings and two of the large baby back rib dinners to split between the two adults and two kids.  If I had to do it over, I would probably skip the onion rings cause they were a tiny too greasy for my taste, but, they were big and fried to perfection. The ribs were AMAZING. The coleslaw was pretty good. The atmosphere was fun! I would recommend this place in a heartbeat.  No wonder it's voted one of the top restaurants on YELP. Go here!

So i drove from fullerton to san diego (1.5 hour drive) to try this place. Got there around 5 and waited in like for about 30 mins. My girlfriend ordered the chicken and ribs and i got the one with white meat and ribs. The sign outside said it would take about 15 mins but my order came out 5 mins after i ordered it. It was strange but as soon as i took a bite of my white meat chicken, the unthinkable happened....it was DRY!!!! unbelievable... The ribs and the sides were alright. would've tasted better if it weren't for my damn dry  chicken. I would come here again if im around san diego area

This place is overrated. The line is incredibly long, and the food is alright. We waited an hour and 45 minutes for a Saturday dinner. The baby back ribs were overdone in a very salty sauce. The meat itself was overcooked and had no flavor of its own. I was expecting "fall apart tender", but it was mushy! The barbecue chicken and beef ribs however, were a table favorite. The chicken was tender, juicy, and infused with smoky and natural flavors. The beef ribs were the same; meaty and flavorsome. We had french fries, cole slaw, and corn as sides. The french fries were limp and flavorless, and the cole slaw was just bad. The corn however was sweet and juicy! We also had an order of onion rings. These were generously coated in a thick batter that resembled "fish n' chips" batter, and were quite tasty.

President's Day Weekend. Trip from OC to SD. Saturday. Prime time. Dinner. LOOOONNNGGGGESTTT wait of my life. My friends and I waited about 2 HOURS. From the sign that said approximately "21minutes and 14 seconds", it literally was over 45 minutes (I timed it with my phone) The man and I spilt a full baby back ribs with two sides (fries and macaroni salad), a red velvet whoopie pie, and one drink for about $27. Food came out fast and it was hot. The racks of ribs: The meat was tender and soft. However, little meat on each rib, and it was mostly burnt to black on the edges. I don't like my food scorched. The BBQ sauce made up for the taste of the burntness. You have to ask for the BBQ sauce up front when you're picking up your food. I was expecting a lot more BAM! to my food. Side: fries were decent. I added the creole seasoning to make them more tasty. The macaroni salad was really good. The noodles looks like huge macaronis cut into smaller rings. The salad wasn't overly drench with mayo- Big Plus. Whoopie pie: REALLY GOOD! tasted like red velvet. Frosting in the middle was great, not too sweet, not to sour. I think it was the best out of all the food. Overall: Food was decent. Dessert was great. Line was way tooooooo long. I guess everyone thinks that the food is great because they wait so long that ANYTHING taste yummy when you're starving. I really thought i would get blown away from all the hype, but I didn't. Yes, we did get a LOT of food for the price, but it didn't make it worth standing in line for so long. Maybe we came at the wrong time and the food wasn't as tasty because of all the people they had to serve. I don't know if i would give it another go.

OMG This was love at first sight! I visited San Diego the first time by myself and I came here for lunch with a really good buddy. I asked him to take me to his favorite place to eat in the SD. He drove me to this joint where parking is not impossible to find but the lines were ridiculous! It was a Thursday around 2pm time and the line wrapped around the restaurant. BUT the line moves pretty fast. The servers and the staff were so nice, the lady that took my order kindly summarize the menu and recommended something that was delicious and inexpensive. I chose the babyback ribs OF COURSE! The ribs were not completely off the bone, but tender enough for you to bite into. The fries and the coleslaw completed the meal with the perfect blend of crisp and crunch. I have to definitely visit this place again. I think everyone from socal knows this joint. BUT Norcal, you must try! You will not be disappointed. I think the babyback ribs will be a safe choice! But I am sure if you ask the staff they can recommend with something delicious as well.

Christmas-time is our new Phil's BBQ time.  Very small line!  My husband checks their website periodically to see what the line is like.  We were planning to go to brunch somewhere, and he comes out of the office and says, "There's no line at Phil's!" So we headed down straightaway.  There in fact WAS a line, but it took about 10 minutes to order and get seated -- not bad at all. I like Phil's, I really do, and I honestly haven't found better bbq in San Diego.  That said, I don't love Phil's.  They're kind of chintzy on the sauce.  We ordered two half orders of white meat chicken, to have for dinner later.  And, it was dry.  It tasted good, but was dry.  I had their beef ribs over lunch, though, in the restaurant, and they were delicious. Lots of meat, tender, yummy.  Totally 100% worth it -- given the small line.  My husband had their pulled pork sandwich and was really happy with it.  The sides -- cole slaw, baked beans, onion rings -- were okay, but not remarkable. The service, though, was good -- lots of coverage, friendly, and attentive.  We'll go back, next Christmas.

Best Barbeque in San Diego, hands down! There is a reason that there is always a line around the building. Now I don't want to repeat what everyone's already said about its deliciousness, so I'll just give you guys some pointers: -If you're by yourself or with your significant other, you can skip the line and head straight to the bar. If you find a spot, take it, and you can order right away. -Closed on Mondays, so don't even bother. -If you go on Friday, or any weekday, go before rush hour. If you go from 2-4, you're in pretty good shape, otherwise expect to wait in a 45 minute line! -Call in your order and pick up in 20 minutes if you're in the mood for ribs but not in the mood for the wait.

My all-time favorite restaurant in San Diego. Phil's should have a frequent customer discount card or something because I come here that often. While Phil's was closed for renovations, I went through the most intense cravings that led me to drive to the San Marcos location. I usually get the beef ribs, although their pork ribs are amazingly tender too. I love the barbeque sauce that are slaughtered all over those ribs and I like to dip my french fries into them. For sides, I have tried the french fries, coleslaw, and the corn and all were very tasty. When I venture to other items on the menu, I like to order the broham sandwich, which I prefer to the el toro. I want to try the chicken too, but I always feel myself being pulled towards those tantalizing ribs! Instead of waiting for the insanely long lines, call in your order ahead of time, go up to the shorter "phone-order" line, and pick up your order in less than ten minutes. Then eat everything and prepare to be induced in a very satisfying food coma.

As a somewhat jaded but open minded LA\OC " Q " fan who talks food with other snootier foodies from wla and lower sfv it wasn't looking good for Phil's BBQ of San Diego folks.  Obviously, you can see from my rating I drank the koolaid ! To really appreciate Phils you have to wait in the ridiculously long line where people talk to each other, veterans and newbies alike. They even have a Phils cam where you can email and print a logo'd photo of you in line (5.00 charge). You need to get your fingers covered with their tangy bbq sauce while eating a Beefy Beef Rib with your hands while you keep reaching for the paper towel roller. You have to keep refilling your drinks from the fountain and wash up at the hand washing station in the back.  The bus service is also amazing if you need anything cleared or brought to your table. Love the condiments especially the cajun seasoning which I poured on everything. As crowded as it was the table spacing was so good I never never " felt " the other patrons. In short they are a bbq place that pays impeccable attention to details and guests needs, Phils is the Disneyland of BBQ. Another reviewer mentioned Lucille's and that fine establishment came to mind as well. The fun factor is just not there maybe its their higher pricing and upselling but just doesn't feel as downhome. Get the Beefy ribs or baby backs, cole slaw is excellent, chicken is good but we really weren't there for that.  French fries and corn on the cobb are also above average too. Prices are very reasonable !

I just had the best Beef BBQ Ribs I've ever had.  Let's be clear, I grew up in Houston Texas (Home of the Annual Texas BBQ Cook-off), and as much as it pains me to say that the best BBQ Ribs to be found are in California, that is the truth! As for the rest, all the food was really good, and the restaurant has a great feel to it.  The only thing that made me think about giving Phil's a 4 star rating (as opposed to 5 stars) is that the line was ridiculous!  After about 10 minutes I had moved maybe 10 feet so I pulled out my cell phone and placed my order to go, and walked in to the "Orders To Go" counter.  It only took a few minutes and I was out the door with my meal.  The only other issue I had was that they didn't give me any to-go utensils, and since I'm staying at a hotel, that was a bit of an issue. So, bottom line, if you don't mind waiting in a long line, or if you are good with getting it to go, then go to Phil's and get the absolute best beef ribs you will ever have the pleasure to taste..!!!

A more refined fast food restaurant. The service was mostly self service, but then again this place is ultimately a fast food joint. The food was great, the ribs, the pulled pork, the chicken. They are to die for. But the sides could use a little work on, bland potato salad, macaroni salad, and the subpar french fries. I've got to admit though, some of the best sauces I've tasted. Overall, I would come back here any day of the week, butane sure you bring an empty stomach.

Having spent 8 solid years in Texas eating my fair share of BBQ, I've been severely disappointed with the choices of bbq in San Diego.  Until now!  We were going to the Explosions in the Sky concert and happened to drive by Phil's BBQ without even knowing it was there.  We hightailed it over there and found a short line that lasted maybe 10 minutes tops.  Apparently the line gets ridiculously long.   I had the baby back ribs, coleslaw and fries.  LOOOOOOVED IT!  The meat practically fell off the bone and was so flavorful and delicious. Everyone there was super friendly and helpful.  Their beer choices on tap were kinda lame - if only the had Shiner beer I'd be giving 5 stars haha!!!

After numerous glowing recommendations from friends to try this place out my fiance, a friend & I decided to plan a day trip to San Diego with Phil's as the main reason for going. After having visited the South many-a-time and loving Carolina BBQ, I've been looking for a REAL BBQ joint in SoCal. Sorry, Phil...but Ohio BBQ doesn't compare to real southern BBQ. Everyone knows about the wait & all that, so I'll just cut to the chase. I'll just describe what I got to taste: Baby back ribs - very tender, but the meat alone didn't seem to have as much flavor as I'd hoped without the sauce. My preference of BBQ is the kind where the meat can stand on its own, without being drenched in BBQ sauce...and this was just okay. Not as amazing as everyone says. Its really all about the sauce here (I believe this will be a reoccuring theme). El Toro - tri-tip sandwich. Another of my pet peeves in BBQ. Deli-sliced tri-tip. Lets all that wonderful flavor dry out when you slice it so thin. Again, hidden by the BBQ sauce, but if you find a piece not drowned in BBQ sauce, it just tastes like unseasoned tri-tip meat. Tastes better with the sauce, but again, saucy BBQ is not my preference. Fries - tasted like sliced potatoes with no seasoning. They were really bland. If I'm eating something deep fried, I'd at least wanna have some flavor with my unhealthy. Onion rings - super disappointing. Batter was so thick and had no flavor. It was also super greasy. Couldn't taste the onions & its a damn ONION ring. Onion ring doesn't taste good without the dipping sauce. Again, this food is all about the sauce. The actual food, in my opinion, does not stand up on its own. If I'm eating something deep fried, I'd at least wanna have some flavor with my unhealthy. Cole slaw - bland. Yeah, I know cole slaw is usually pretty bland. My friend who ordered it said, "I wonder if they purposely make the sides really bland so the main dishes taste better" when she tried it. That's just not a good sign. Conclusion: For SoCal, its a pretty top notch BBQ joint. I'm from SoCal, I love SoCal, but BBQ is just something that we don't do as well as some other parts of the country, for sure. Some people love the sauce on BBQ and its all about the sauce to them. That's fine. To each their own. I am the type that loves the taste of the actual BBQ...not BBQ sauce. And I know I could've asked for sauce on the side, but I tasted the meat without the sauce, and it wasn't that good. Its a case where the meat NEEDS the sauce, and that's not great BBQ in my book. None of us finished any items on our plates. Took home lots of leftovers & forgot it in the car. Good BBQ would smell up the car so you couldn't possibly forget it was there. I really wanted to like this place, but it was just average.

Food is always good. What disappoints me is the management. Today we came for lunch. my party of 5 (6 if you want to count my unborn nephew) sat at one of the large booths in the middle that have signs posted for 6 people or more groups.  We thought it was fine since my sister in law is 7 months pregnant. We were asked to move to a smaller booth which didn't fit out party and had to grab a chair and put it at the end of the table. Clearly to me a fire hazard and annoying to scoot up every time someone had to pass through. I complained to a server since there was a party of 4 at one of the large booths that were clearly enjoying their lunch. The server said they tried to move them earlier but they complained so much that they left them alone. He also said he would notify the manager. The manager "Jorge"came around an greeted every table next to ours except for my table. Seems like poor service and a huge fail to me. So disappointed and couldn't finish my meal! I spent more time "yelping" vs. eating  WTF. Change yer name to Fails BBQ

BEST BABY BACK RIBS EVER!!!! If you have never tried it, it is a MUST-TRY if you're in San Diego! The only downside about coming here is the LONG lines out the door. You might even have to wait an hour to get seated. But the good news is, if you come in a large group, they will get tables prepared FOR you so by the time you order, you can sit right away and wait for your food to be ready instead of having to scrounge around for tables. Although it's a large space with many tables, there's so many people that it can be hard to find a place to sit! I came this past weekend with a group of 12 and we DID wait for about an hour, but service was excellent and they had our table prepared on the patio all ready for us by the time we finished ordering. :) So bottom line is... come in a big group! Or at least, don't be afraid to! But if you come in a small group, not to worry if the lines are too long. There's a little minibar set up outside by the door and you can keep yourselves hydrated with their free lemon cucumber infused water. :) Service here is the best! The hostess is very friendly and sweet. We also had an awesome server named Marlin! He accommodated to all our needs and got us everything we wanted. He went above and beyond and our group loved him for that! Marlin, if you're reading this, thank you!! Now on to the most important part: the food! The baby back ribs are the way to go! They have a quarter rack which only comes with 3-4 ribs, and also a half rack, and full rack depending on how much you want to eat. The meat falls right off the bone and the BBQ sauce is to die for! The perfect proportions of tangy, sweet, and spicy. PERFECTION! The platter also comes with either 2 small sides or 1 large side. I love their macaroni salad and their fries aren't bad either. So if you haven't been here yet, bookmark this place now!

WOW!!! I give them three wow points: 1) I am the 3043rd reviewer (what other places on yelp has over 3k reviews?!!) 2) We arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday night, and the lines wrapped around the store (at least 50 people in line--no exaggeration!) 3) The ribs and onion rings DELICIOUS!! Since we were in a rush and didn't want to do a 4 hour dinner, we decided to do a take out and go back to the apt to eat. In total, the take out took about 30 minutes. My only compliant is we ordered rib that came with the side of "fries," and they put the fries on the bottom of the tray and put ribs on top of the fries. This made the fries all soggy and saucy. Other than that, I would love to come back and get some more ribs!!! :)

Phil's is good. Long wait, but fine if you're waiting with a group. The red velvet cream pie was so good! Ribs fall off the bone, you know... what you'd expect from a BBQ place! Food comes out fast and portions are huge. I shared. Mac salad is yum!

Best BBQ place in San Diego, hands down! ... But then again, I haven't tried too many other BBQ places ... yet. But, I FINALLY tried it after many attempts. Every time I come to San Diego I try to come here, but either they're closed or it's just a personal fail with my friends. So YAY, finally a win. I got to go with my family and it was the bomb-diggity-bomb! I really enjoyed my experience. Here is the sum up. I didn't have to wait in a long line. My food was ready pretty fast. We found a good seat. My freakin' BBQ pork sandwich was amazing. They aren't stingy on the meat; they load up that sandwich like no other. The coleslaw was holycrap GOOD. They have everything you need (like water, HANDWIPES, boxes, etc.) available for you whenever you want/are done. I just went a week ago and I think I'm going again this Sunday. I'm so excited already! (:

I HAVE BEEN WANTING GOOD BBQ SO BAD! The "tickler" is the perfect size for me. It doesn't tickle my stomach, it makes me full and satiated. The price was no more than about $7 for it. Oh my goodness. I love this place. It's also super convenient for groups because you don't have to split the tab at the end since you pay for yourself individually at the beginning. Now that's pretty darn efficient! Also, even though you have to order your food standing up and pick up your food when it's ready, the service is still stellar! There's always someone there to help out and make sure you have everything you need. AMAZING!

Yes, the BBQ is super tasty. Yes, the portions are huge. Yes, the staff is super friendly. BUT Yes, if you go at any normal mealtime, you will wait in a line around the building. I have had my fair share of BBQ over the years in various states and while Phil's is above average the insane lines are not worth it. But if you must, I'd recommend the Beef Ribs, Onion Rings and getting there an hour and a half prior to when you want to eat. Other sides are nothing special, but who goes to BBQ for coleslaw anyways?

It's confirmed.  Still very good.  I guess since this is yelp, I should say why even though the place has a million reviews.  Beef ribs, fries, slaw and cob corn w/butter&creole.  GET SOME.

I can't believe I haven't written a review yet for my fave BBQ! My goodness, first of all I'm gonna let you in on my secret, its hush hush ok. Why are you waiting in line? Head over to the bar people! First come first served. I have waited in line like twice. Everytime I just head to the bar and grab a seat. While you are at it, grab a sangria, yumm. Nothing like meat and sugar. This place is for big appetites, but you can get a nibble if you order the nibbler plate. The perfect size for a "smaller" appetite (its still a lot of food). All in all, awesome BBQ and great service!

This place is good...really good. I love BBQ...and I'm picky with BBQ...and this place is BOMB BBQ. It's one of the best places I've ever been and that's saying something because I'm comparing it to Tennessee and Texas and they KNOW BBQ. Phil also knows BBQ. He's fluent in ribs and sauce. -- Fall off the bone tender...smokey bbqed goodness. Oh man, my mouth is watering...how embarrassing. Phil's is definitely a place you have to try. Yeah the lines are long, but you won't regret it. The meat is outstanding...the sauce is outstanding...the sides are outstanding. This place is fantastic!

When a place has 3000 reviews and over 75% of the reviews are 5 star, you know that the restaurant may have something good. After a shitload of traffic on the 5 frwy, I was tired from the 3.5 hr commute from LA.  But Phil's BBQ made my day.  I have to admit, though, that it wasn't love at first bite.  The ribs are perfectly smoked and the rib meat disintegrates off the bone....but my problem was that their barbeque sauce is skewed a little toward being sweet and tart.  It has some fruity infusions.  I felt like it was missing an edge. But, then I looked on the table and saw that they had some cajun seasoning.  After sprinking a liberal amount of that on my rib, I involuntarily smiled, my eyes dilated, and I lost track of everything else in the room.  The cajun seasoning adds the kick that is lacking in their bbq sauce. The only drawback is the wait.  On my first visit here, I was lucky to get away with a 15 minute wait.  But the wait was 30-40 mins on my latest visit.  I opted, instead, to go with a phone order and I ate the ribs at my hotel.   As for side dishes....the onion rings were good, but I thought they were too crispy.  I loved the potato salad as it had the perfect blend of spices.  It had dill, but I can't pinpoint what else it had.  Their corn also is great with butter and their cajun spices.   Anyway...this place definitely is worth checking out.   And for $18, u get a full rack of ribs and two small sides...definitely not a bad deal!

This was my very first time trying Phil's and I had a long, but great, encounter. The talk about the lines had been right. When I arrived, the line was to the parking lot. I would extremely recommend calling in your order. Turns out they don't prepare your food until you arrive, so it is fresh out of the kitchen. There was a separate line for call in orders and there was nobody in that line when I arrived. I was able to go straight to the counter with no wait. I cannot comment on the dine in encounter as my order was to go. But the dining location was large and loud with all of the people there. I ordered the baby back ribs and chicken dinner and it was almost certainly the most tasty BBQ I had ordering from a restaurant. Most restaurant BBQs are dry and have no flavor. The ribs were juicy and flavorful. They gave me a chicken breast and I was afraid it would be dry as sand, however it too was juicy and not overcooked. The cooks at Phil's surely know how to cook BBQ.

Thursday night 9PM - 20 minute wait in the cold. Huge list of menu items outside, good. Its nice to have something to read while you wait and there is no excuse for not knowing exactly what you want when you get to the counter. First employee contact: welcoming and informative. The director of human traffic told us exactly what to do and where to go in a very pleasant manner. The counter experience: once again very friendly. The cashier took our order, took our money and gave us our buzzer. Looking for a table? Good luck. The other half wanted us to pass on the one nearest to us in a high volume area, so we went into the heated and covered outside seating section. We knew it was going to be busy so no surprise there was little seating to be had. What was surprising was the number of empty tables outside that had not yet been cleared off. So back we went to the table right by the counter (just in time, some scallywags were about to purloin it!!). Our buzzer buzzed and my other half went to get our food. Mine:  the full rib dinner(baby back) with 1 huge coleslaw side. Hers: half rib dinner with two sides of fries and sweet beans. The sides were huge. My coleslaw was so big I had to get a box to go. Coleslaw to go? Yes, it was that good. The other half praised her fries and beans. Upon inquiring about the meat portion of her meal she replied "the ribs are good but I don't absolutely love them". Love? Ribs?? Who LOVES ribs???. I do. They were delicious. And no, it is not just the sauce (even though that was exceptionally tasty). The meat was succulent and tender almost falling off the bone. I finished the whole rack and had to stop myself from licking my fingers. I was seriously tempted to get some to go just so I could have them for breakfast. Overall it was a great experience for a reasonable price. We spent $40 for the two of us including tax but not tip. The service staff and food were both excellent and my only minor complaint was the number of empty tables left uncleared for over 5 minutes. But hey, this is a very busy place with a very high turnover and for good reason. The food is superb.

Let's be honest for a minute here... I have been known to harp about Vegan this, Vegan that... but as human's we have evolved into meat eating creatures... If your working out at all.. Meat is a must. Beans dont cut it for protein. Nevermind how friggin tastey it is. I never understood how a man could forego bacon for any reason anyway. Im working in the area & I'm back in town for the long haul it seems. Phil's has always been good. Stopped in before visiting friends & I got the baked beans with the ribs. The friggin sauce is grub. Soppin it up with a biscuit. Corn on the cob.. Yup...Beer's good. Too bad they dont make a BBQ sauce flavored beer. Probably the best BBQ in town. Check it out.. No need to call Phil for an appointment, drop in & git you some... Oh, try not to wear a white T shirt...

Pork rib platter on the wall, tell me who is the most OVER-HYPED BBQ JOINT of them all...? +sound of whooshing and pig squeals+ "Yelper Josh.. trust your instincts, for they do not lie, there is only one restaurant that I spy.. It's name is known throughout the land by hungry woman, child and man.. Phil's is the place of which I speak, and only its HYPE makes it unique!" ...but magical pork rib platter, why is this place hyped-up so much? "It's lines are long, its sauce is lame, and when it comes to smoking meat, its chefs have no game. I see no clear reason for its fame.." I dunno, pork-rib platter. It -was- bland and crappy, but can 10 million people be wrong? "Dude. Save your freaking money (because Phil's is pricey) and go to Bull's. LOLZ. Srsly."

The. Best. Meal. Of our entire. USA. Trip. Very rarely am I compelled to wish for more than five stars, but I was completely overwhelmed by my instantaneous love for this place. And that's not even influenced by bias, as there's a huge sign outside shouting 'Thank You Yelpers!' Well, Yelp has helped make this place one of the Top 10 Restaurants in the whole of the USA, but it never needed our aid in this. Phil's RULES. My fiancé and I were looking for things to do for the rest of our holiday around San Diego, Portland and Seattle. Yeah, we wanted to do cultural things, and yup, we wanted to be cool... but we also realised something. We're greedy gluttons and we facking well love food. So what did we do? We Wikipedia'd all the episodes of Man V Food to see where our dear friend Adam had headed in all of the cities we were visiting to eat ridiculous things. Right away we made a mental note to check out Voodoo Doughnuts in Portland, but there were nearer things to attend to. Phil's BBQ in San Diego. The tri-tip sandwich. We headed out to what kind of looked like an industrial estate - the area couldn't be further removed from Little Italy where we were staying or Gaslamp, as rather than nestled amongst little boutiques and indie restaurants, it's out there near Target, In N Out and a whole bunch of other chains. Considering where it is, the fact that it was stuffed to the gills on a weekday, early afternoon, was a sign and a half. And it knows its audience. A mat outside known as a Tweet Spot? A fun photo booth? The word barbecue painted all over the beams in many different languages, dialects and slangs? Gosh, this place is fun. The ordering system is spot on too. You're greeted by a friendly host who talks you through what to do. Go up to the counter where uniformed experts are hard at work, place your food order, take your cups for soft drinks and find yourself a seat. Anywhere you like. You'll be given a pager and you'll squeal with excitement when it beeps, because this is food worth waiting for. The tri-tip sandwich on a keiser roll is an all-round winner. The bread is soft with a delicately crisp outer crust, the BBQ sauce is everything it promises to be and more... sweet, tangy, rich and deep, and the meat. Oh, the meat. Soft as butter, tender and yielding, and quite simply some of the best beef I've ever had. We shared this alongside what we thought would be a little taster dish - the chicken tickler, which actually came with four generously portioned hunks of juicy chicken, marinated and barbecued to perfection with more of that superb sauce, perfect fries and colossal onion rings that live up to the name. I made my onion rings last the whole meal, they were that good. Even the coleslaw is worth shouting about! I know I'm filling this whole review with hyperbole, but I genuinely think Phil's is worth  going back to San Diego for. Last night I watched a documentary about a sushi genius where I learned that three Michelin stars are awarded to a place you think it's worth visiting a country for. Well, perhaps Michelin is a wee bit posh for a BBQ joint, but I'd give Phil's the award. Utterly epic.

Wow I've lived in SD a while and finally made it to PHILS!  I've been missing out. My GF and I called in our order as we are pulling into the parking lot.  There was about a 10 minute line, by the time we get to the front to pay for the food, its READDDYYYYY!   We came here on Superbowl sunday, seems we weren't the only ones thinking that. We had a full order of ribs, full bbq chicken order, a few sides and it was about $30 for 2!  What a deal!   Instead of buying ribs at Costco and doing the hassle, make the call!  Phils is one of our new FAVS!!

Really...I don't know what more I can add. The food is delicious. We had beef ribs, baby back ribs, chickless (chunky pieces of chicken breast in BBQ sauce), onion rings (HUGE), french fries, cole slaw, macaroni salad, and  corn on the cob (steaming white corn in its husks). All of it was fantastic. Definitely call ahead and order. They will not have your food ready when you arrive. They pack your food as soon as you have paid/arrive. So, the wait is about 15-20 minutes but the food is fresh. Here's where I would take off 1/2 star or so...PLEASE MR. PHIL, add some cornbread, or some sort of other bread to your menu. This girl loves her bread and I was really hankering for some!!!

Huge portions, great ribs, great sauce, amazing flavor! This is a BBQ spot were you will not go home hungry. I was expecting a hole in the wall bbq joint but it turned out to be a huge place. Food: Beef ribs- Gigantic ribs with flavor that matches its size, super tender and tasty Baby back ribs- ribs with tons of meat that fall off the bone Chicken- good but the ribs are better Must Try!

I hate when good restaurants become overrated for me. All my friends' hype and the long line built up so much anticipation for dinner that there was no way that expectations would be met. We only waited for 40 minutes on a Saturday night, so the wait was completely bearable. For three people, we ordered 7 baby back ribs and 3 beef ribs, accompanying them with coleslaw, macaroni salad, and gigantic onion rings. The baby backs were fairly good, I wish they had been warmer when we got them. The beef ribs were just massive, but they were a bit too charred for my taste, and not quite as succulent as I had hoped. The BBQ sauce, though, was not the best experience for me. Phil's sauce  has a certain zing to it, stemming from a tangy tomato base that lingers on my lips long after I've eaten my last piece of meat. I guess I'm not as fond of that flavor; it didn't capture my imagination like I thought it would. The onion rings were the best part of the meal. They were massive, they were actually large slices of onion, and the beer batter was so good. The ranch made it so much more unhealthy, but made it so much delicious. Next stop: Bludso's!

I love their onion rings. I wish they had a smaller portion. Eating a whole order is way too much. Most people fantasize about their beef ribs, I, their onion rings. I'm not the biggest fan of BBQ, but Phil's is great. I usually order the baby back ribs tickler, which comes with cole slaw, 2 onion rings, and plenty of fries. The last time I went to dine in, I waited in line for over an hour. You can also check the approximate wait time on their website, but it was down on this particular night.

Hmm.  I don't really get the hype about Phil's. If your rating system is volume per dollar, it's a good deal. That said, I thought the ribs were just ok.  The bbq is very sweet, not much complexity. I guess it's a good family place, but not worth waiting in line for...

If you have never had BBQ before or if you are seasoned veteran, this place has the MOST amazing baby back ribs ever!  My husband is from Texas, so BBQ is not a new thing for us.  I have to say the best compliment to Phil's is that we rate ALL baby back ribs to theirs.  Texas doesn't beat them. So onto why I only gave four stars.  The line is ALWAYS long.  If I had a line that long, all the time, I would get the hint that I needed to either expand, which they can't because the parking is so slim as it is and they share a lot, or build a second establishment, because obviously it would have business.  It also SUPER loud there all the time.  I mean always.  I have two kids and one on the way, so I'm not all about waiting in a line. The way they do things work really well though.  You walk up the restaurant, stand in line, a nice person takes your really long order, because you absolutely have to get the onion rings.  I mean it...  Then you find a table, yourself.  Remember to go get your own plates, forks, napkin and drink.  They also have bibs, wippees and paper towels.  Such a great idea.  You wait till your number is called or your buzzer rings and you go get your food.   The bussers that run around are super nice and if it's your birthday (which we came for my hubby's a few years ago) they will hide a cake, cut it up and come sing with your family.  The bussers are really amazing actually and unlike some places, seriously deserve a tip for all the stuff they do while you are there.   Lucille's is pretty good, but it doesn't beat Phil's any day of the week.   PS.  If you don't like pepper in the beans, don't get theirs.

I've heard about this place a couple of years ago from some friends.  Since I spent most of the day kayaking in the deep sea, I thought it would be nice to reward my self to some great southern BBQ !!!! I even skipped lunch and had to work extra hard on the kayak! Lol Omg! The line was wrapped around the building. I swear 150 people. My friend went inside to the bar area and sat down immediately and he called me to inform me that our bar booth seating was available! Yippy!!!!! No wait for me baby!  We met a local to my right and another to my left. Both dine by themselves and gave us the 411. The lady knew Mr. Phill himself and told us stories about how he started the business. Both were nice people. I'm thankful for meeting nice locals!! We ordered the shredded BBQ pork sandwich topped with cabbage . The best shredded pork ever and they crammed a lot of meat inside the sandwich. We also ordered the Half beef ribs and BBQ chicken and was able to pick a side item with that so we had to order the fries. I sprinkled the fries with this amazing Cajun seasoning that smoked up my killer fries!! It had great flavors to it!!!! Both chicken and beef ribs were tender and grilled to perfection ;)-

Recently went to Phils for the first time. The line wasn't that bad, and they had a guy posted up slanging cold beer outside, which was genius.  It made me completely forget about standing in line. "line? what line? I gots me a cold beer, bishes!" Before I knew it I was knee-deep in BBQ. bbq chicken. bbq ribs. onion rings. fries. mac salad. bbq baked beans. It was very delicious. Tasty, tangy sauce, tender meats... I put in work, like a bawse. If i'm ever on death row and had one last meal request, i'd say "Gimme some Motherf***ing PHILS, bish!" (like.a.bawse)

Ok the ribs... Are good. Only thing keeping them from 5 stars is customer service. We called in for a pickup order and was given a timeframe. Got there. Waited extra 15mins. Asked a manager. Funny lady mngr said we should tell them over the phone that we don't care if the food was cold. That would get them to speed it up. I mean, she was nice and all. Food came out without the ribs. Need I say more? I'm giving 3 stars instead of 4. Customer service is key lady!!

2/26/2012....... Today after walking around the Swap Meet, I was treated to lunch at Phil's. We got there twenty minutes after they opened and didn't wait too long to order and be seated. I had the BBQ Broham Sandwich and a side of baked beans and the food was DELICIOUS....and the portions were HUGE!!! The only reason I didn't give Phil's a Five Star Rating is because two different items myself and another person in my group wanted, would have delayed our party of sixes' entire meals an additional twenty plus minutes; so we ordered items that were not on the "time delay menu". The atmosphere was great, and the both we had for our party of six sat us all very well. I recommend Phil's BBQ to anyone who loves BBQ.

My review for Phil's BBQ has been long overdue. I've made the 1 hour 40 minute trip down to San Diego 6 times in the past year, 2 times specifically to eat at Phil's. The meat on the ribs comes right off the bone; the pulled pork in the BBQ Broham is juicy and not dry; the fries, slaw, & macaroni salad are must tries; and and the employees are ridiculously friendly. Long wait time, but for good reason. Chicken is dry, but can be cured with more BBQ sauce! I love Phil's! Still contemplating whether or not you should try this place out? Just read the other 3,520+ reviews...

Its ok. The BB ribs were really good, almost worth the wait. The sides were mediocre. The staff was great. The salad was awful. I know, thats what I get for ordering salad at a BBQ place. The bbq sauce was.a little spicy for my taste, but still good, only one flavor sauce. Regular fountain drinks, nothing that you cant get at McDonald or Jack in the Box. Overall, not worth the hype or wait. Famous Dave is a lot better.

I came here twice...one of the best BBQ places I've been to.  However, I had a few issues with the place and thought i should give you guys fair warning. The minor issues: the line is usually pretty long and the wait for food seems just as long if you're starving but is worth it for the food The major issues: A pitcher of sangria is $20 while a glass is $5.  I ordered a pitcher but for some reason the bartender didn't hear me and proceeded to fill 2 glasses with sangria.  When I corrected her as she was filling up the second cup, she shrugged and poured the glass and a half into a pitcher, filled it with another scoop of ice and handed me the pitcher. WHAAT?!  So I just paid $20 for something that should've cost me $7.50 (equivalent to a glass and a half of sangria).  I'm not sure if this was a good or bad thing as the sangria tasted horrible as well. Moral of the story: DONT ORDER THE SANGRIA and if you must...ORDER BY THE GLASS.

For all those people in the Las Vegas vicinity: Phil's is in line to open a location sometime in the near future. Sing praises of Hallelujah, and pass the napkins! What this means to you: No more over priced, overly sweet BBQ! There shall be COMPETITION. Actually, Phil's is so heads and shoulders above any BBQ in Vegas there will BE NO competition. And the Phil's I went to, twice ( Hey, I was only there for two and a half days ), was everything I look for in great BBQ. It has generous portions of great tasting dishes for a reasonable price. Not easy to accomplish all three. So if Phil's does what it does best. Vegas will gain a BBQ winner. At this Phil's, I went once when it was just opening and once when it was a madhouse. And I hate lines! But remembering the juicy goodness, the mouth watering spicy pieces of BBQ wonder made me venture forth and actually not mind the snaking line. Even the sides are great here. The onion rings are fat and stay together when you bite them. The fries where simple and done just crispy right. The slaw is a good counter pause to the tangy BBQ sauce. The sandwiches are these heaping mountains of meaty heaven. The chicken is plump and tasty. And the Pork and Beef are the penultimate BBQ meats. Go baby backs or go home. This is a Nirvana of Fats and Meats and Sauce. But can they keep the prices down in Vegas? Rent is high and location could be a problem. Can they keep the right atmosphere? Outdoor seating may be problematic. Can they keep the same caliber of food? Vegas is smack dab in hellish desert. This all remains to be seen. I hope they do it and do it right. Otherwise, every chance I get to be in the San Diego area. I'm going to Phil's. As often as I can.

Boy was it horrible when we came here right after UCSD's graduation. ugh, learned our lesson. It was my cousin's graduation, and she decided to take our family here, and so we did. Our moms and dads stayed in the car while we youngin' were waiting in like for about an hour and a half... I have never been and but heard from friends that this place is amazing and that the wait was well worth it. When we got to the front line, I was super tired...Wished we were here on a freakin' weekday. Alright, enough of my venting, when we sat and got our food, everything was good until I got the pork. Did not like it. Get the beef ribs! Those are way better. I will come back when it's a weekday, never a weekend (unless I come early)

I figured with so many reviews, I should definitely try Phil's before I leave town... so when I got called off from work tonight, I said now's as good a time as any. : ) I decided to call in my order and take it home (since I'm not a fan of sitting in a busy restaurant by myself). I went with the Baby Back Rib & Chicken Dinner Combo with fries & macaroni salad as my sides. I was glad that there was a separate line for phone order pickups. It took me 2 minutes to pick up my order. After 10 minutes drive home, I dove in to the deliciousness. The ribs were yummy as promised. The meat falls off the bones and melts in the mouth. The sauce was good, but as others have mentioned, I could use a little more of a spicy kick. The chicken was also not bad. It made my poor kitty salivate and beg while I dined. The macaroni salad was okay. The fries, unfortunately, did not survive the 10 minute drive home. They were lukewarm and soggy. Maybe they'll be better reheated?

Came by for dinner the other night and I think I missed the boat. Arrived slightly before 6 pm as I've heard about the long lines. Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted by an expeditor. The cashier was also friendly. As were the bus boys and waiters. The half-rack baby back ribs for $11.25 were okay. The ribs were mainly tasteless except at the edges. The BBQ sauce was too strong and had too much of a vinegar taste to it. The onion rings were bland and oily. They seemed fresh but were cold by the  time I ate them.. All in all, an okay place for baby back ribs and onion rings. ...definitely not worth a wait...

This place is really famous for their bbq in san diego, but I don't think it is 4 or 5 star worthy. I do like their ribs here, but I have to say that I have had better bbq elsewhere. But the sauce they use for their ribs is delicious, so it is worth coming here for that. A side note, there is usually a really long line, so if you want to save time, you can call in your order ahead of time and just pick it up to go instead. I have done that on occasion because I hate waiting in line!

Nomizzle. Please, don't let my 5 star review tell you how awesome Phil's is. Just go and see for yourself. There is a line, that goes out the door and around the corner, and if you don't believe, go online and take a look at their camera for proof(no worries, get it to-go, the line is MUCH MUCH shorter)! Anyways, came down to SD to visit a friend and try Phil's definitely no regrets. Well maybe one, I wish I ordered something with more ribs. I got the pork ribs tickler, which was pretty huge and tasty. Here are my thoughts: -The BBQ sauce had a strong kick and definitely took some time getting used to. -The sides were a bit much for me, I wish I had more ribs instead. But then again, it was a tickler. -The Cajun seasoning was BOMB on the fries. And the coleslaw is pretty tasty and light too! -Apparently the potato salad is not that impressive. I would suggest skipping it. -Please don't table hog until you've ordered. Kthx. -Get in line. Order when you get to the front. Get a beeper. Find a table. Wait for the beeper. Get your food. EAT. :) Btw, they have free cucumber and lemon water outside. Yummy!

Great BBQ at a affordable prices. What's not to love except for the wait which is typically 30 mins average. Opt for To Go and you'll let your grub without long queues and within 5 mins of ordering. Full baby back rib dinner at $20 and change after tax is the best deal for me.

Yummmyy!! After a few hours of walking, my friend and I finally worked up an appetite to head over to Phils. I still wasn't hungry perse, but waiting another 45 minutes somewhat helped. The line was long, but surprisingly, it moved kind of fast (relatively so anyway). We placed an order for the best of both - beefy ribs and chickless dinner, and a quarter baby back ribs dinner. For sides, we had steamed veggies, cole slaw, and potato salad. It seemed like a lot of food, but we wanted to sample everything! My question was, why isn't there an option for "best of 3 worlds" that offered chicken, beef ribs, and pork ribs?! After we ordered and found seats, we prepared all our paper towels and put on our bibs shamelessly (boiling crab taught me the necessities!). Our food arrived shortly, and you know what the crazy thing was? We actually almost finished everything! It was so good that it stimulated my hunger even though we were saying there was no way we'd finish it. Yah we're some crazy gals that can eat. Sauce was quite tangy and not too sweet, and the meat was delicious. My favorite was the baby back ribs! The beefy ribs were good too, but not as tender as I expected it to be - but still pretty tender and juicy! I was disappointed with the chicken though. It was kind of dry, so word of advice - stick with the ribs! Sides were decent, potato salad was pretty good, but the others were just okay. Hence, I take back my best of 3 suggestion and say that Phils should just offer the real best of both - the beef and pork ribs. :)

The wait was long, about an hour outside. Once you get inside you put in your order at the counter and find your own table. The only complaint I have about the food is that it's waayyy too drenched in sauce. I had the chicken which was really good, a bit on the dry side..but definitely some of the best bbq i've had. If you happen to be in SD definitely try this place out.

Phil's BBQ is a MUST go to!  The wait time is ridiculously long, but it is SO WORTH IT!!!  I got the half baby back rib dinner which was around $14, but it came with godly tasting ribs, and two sides or 1 big one.  For my sides I got macaroni salad and potato salad which were both equally delectable! Seriously Phil's is worth the price and the wait!

I have found my favorite place to eat BBQ. The only disappointment to me is that I have not been there as soon. Phil's BBQ in San Diego, California is best hands down from their finger licking ribs, to their over the top filling tri- tip . It is delicious!! Ever since I was a child I spent my vacation with my family in SD. To get to the downtown Gaslamp District, I would pass this BBQ spot. The line would wrap around the building just to get inside. Last year my mother demanded that we must investigate the hype of this Phil's BBQ. We arrive in the late lunch period of time before dinner and we recognized there is still a crowd outside the build just to eat with markings on the wall posting: 10 Minutes and 45 Seconds from this Point. Although the wait is long, it is definitely well worth it. I have a huge problem with most BBQ I have eaten do to this fact the inside of it is usually dry. If it is moist, the smell of BBQ does not exist in the taste. It turns normally out as false advertisement. I ordered the El Toro which is the tri-tip Sandwich with an order of colossal onion rings. As well I had tried some of the ribs. I sit and at my table hungry and ready for the big anticipation. It was delicious. No, more than delicious, it lived up to all my expectations in BBQ. From the smokiness, and the hickory taste of BBQ going straight through, it is the best juiciest BBQ I have eaten. The colossal onion rings were huge and super addicting. I could of probably eaten them on my own because they were so huge. This place a 5 out of 5 stars to me due to the fact I never had better BBQ. If your in San Diego I highly recommend to go to Phil's BBQ. It is a well worthy food coma you deserve.

Why is the meat at the top portion of the ribs missing? If I look inside of the cow...will I see no meat on the top of their ribs? So how did that meat vanish? Ribs are great...but... Top half is bone... Bottom half is a lump of meat... First time here... yaaaay The hostess points me to the counter.. Where there's a whole buncha cashiers.. Not that big a wait... Hell....I don't know what I want... So I had just three very delicious ribs! I ate my beans and ate my friends beans! Cause he didn't like them... I wish I had several tummies... So I could eat a little of this and a little of that.... Nothing like a ride home with the windows open... I don't know what's worse... Smog n exhaust fumes... Or those healthy Phil's BBQ spicey beans after effects... A very special thank you to Lori I from Honolulu, Hawaii who kept recommending this place to me.  And a very special thank you to Tim E. of South Pasadena who recommended this place too.. Now I have enough gas to make it home....putt...putt....putt....putt.....putt.... and Benny (my Jack Russell) gets the bones

This is my favorite BBQ place in San Diego.  They have the best beef ribs I've had and the ribs are huge.   There is always a line to sit and eat there.  I usually call ahead and take it to go to avoid the line. The price is pretty high but it is totally worth it. I would recommend anyone coming to or living in San Diego to eat here

My Ratings: Quantity: 5 - Great Quality: 4 - Yum Price: 4 - It was alright Location: 4 - Big enough for the crowd Service: 5 - Amazing Speed: 3 - Good Overall:  Service is amazing and food was delicious but the wait was too long.  I might go back for to-go or phone order. My Opinion/Story: Attempted to try Phil's twice during my stay in San Diego and the second time we went there, we really waited.  Wanted to see what the fuss was all about.  We got there around 5pm and waited for an hour.  With friends and family around, the wait wasn't horrible.  Got to the counter and ordered our meals and we even got a table saved for us so we didn't have to look for an empty table that would seat 11 guests. Ordered: The Best of Both, (includes 2 small sides or 1 large side) Baby Back Rib & Chicken Dinner $12.25 (4 Bones and 1/4 Chicken BBQ'd). I wasn't able to finish my food because there was just too much of it.  The BBQ sauce is a good mixture of sweet and tangy and there were condiments to add to the spiciness. Meat was so tender that it practically falls off the bone.   I would have given 5 stars if not for the loooooong wait.

'1 hour, wait-worthy, good ol' BBQ Ribs" BBQ fans must go to Phil's at least once; if not a hundred times. The servings are plentiful. My more normal friends split a full rack between 2 ppl. I, on the other hand, polish off a rack to myself, with a large serving of fries - OH YEAH! The prices are fair, and here is the faire I've had: *Baby back ribs - yes please! Meat falls off the bone. The sauce is layered, with a perfect balance of tang, sweet, smoke and vinegar. *The Toro (Tri-tip sandwich) - good luck eating with your hands. Perfect for mesquite lovers; has a rich smokiness to it *Coleslaw - not my kind of slaw. Really thin slices, and the dressing could use more body *Fries - you really have to try hard to make fries I don't like. These are thicker, bar fries. *Baked beans - I'm not a bean fan (haha), but everyone else seems to like them. To give some descriptors- (minds out of the gutter please) they are firm, fresh tasting with good texture. *Onion rings - tasty. You can actually bite through the rings and the onion doesn't slide out. I really enjoy the batter, it's not too heavy. The small order is enough for 4 ppl. *Potato salad and macaroni salad - not offensive. *Chicken - really? suck it up and get the ribs! *Salad - just order more ribs...

Great Beef Ribs, Pork Ribs, and Baked Beans. Much better than Lucille's BBQ in my book. There is a long line daily for a reason.  Great food, Large portions, Decent price. However, what made this place super special was that all of the staff, from the hostess, to the cashier, to the busboys are warm and nice.  They are serving you with kind smiles and they try to make sure your family is well taken care of.

You ever think that a certain kind of food doesn't taste that great but everyone raves about it? Then you all of a sudden try it somewhere and then you find yourself strangely in love or obsessed with it? That is my experience with ribs at Phil's BBQ. FOOD: AMAZING. Ribs were underwhelming anywhere else I've had them and I never understood it. I didn't even care much for bbq sauce either. Then I came here and wow. Just wow. Their ribs are exactly what ribs should taste like. Everyone should follow their example. Every place that makes ribs should be like Plankton from Spongebob and try to steal the secret recipe. Beef Ribs, Pork Ribs, it's all great! Their Potato Salad was good, but not great. Their French Fries were sooooo frickin' good when dipped with the bbq sauce. I didn't realize that I liked bbq sauce until I couldn't stop dipping my Fries in them. The Onion Rings are gigantic and pretty good too. I'm pretty damn sure that the food they serve here is the stuff they serve in heaven. It's simply, divine. Oh, except for the Healthy Boneless Chicken thing...I think they're called Skinless Chicklets or something (it's been a while, I forget). Those are just whatever, I could have done without those. ATMOSPHERE: It's a loud place as it's very crowded and reminds me of a sports bar. It might be one, not sure. My group sat kinda in the corner in a different room away from the crowd. SERVICE: I don't recall seeing any waitresses or waiters. I think you just line up to order your food, you pick it up, and go find your seat. Everything you need is around you or at a station where you get your drinks. Overall, I hate that this place is 2 hours away from me. I hate that I've only been here once. I hate that the wait can be really really long (though it didn't feel that long that day as I was with good people). I can't wait to come back though! It haunts my dreams and whenever brings up San Diego, I IMMEDIATELY think of this place. It's like, pretty much the reason why I would even go down there.

I think it was good place. If I have a chance to go there one more time, I'll go there absolutely. I highly recommend it! First of all, the food I ate was fantastic and very tasty. Also, the wait time was not too long even though many people were waiting. However, what I had an unsatisfied feeling was barely understandable menu. It was hard to decide which item was the proper thing for me. Also, the table and chairs were a little bit uncomfortable. There was not enough room between the table and chairs. In spite of the fact that it has a few demerits, I'm into the restaurant. Reasonable price, kind staff, good atmosphere, all these things were fascinating.

Just tried the ever so easy take out option at Phil's. We phoned it in and waited 10 minutes or so. Upon arriving at our humble abode I started to worry about the bread maintaining its freshness and the soggy, sloppy thoughts started to haunt my taste buds. HOLY BAT SH*T BATMAN! Its still good! The onion rings were still crispy and hot. The fries on the other hand steamed a lil' in the box. The Broham maintained its deliciousness and that my friend is effin' take out!!! P.S. Keep in mind... Phil's is located in Sports Arena... I live in Tierrasanta!

Oooh boy, Phil's is great. The meat is so delicious, tender and fall of the bone. And the sauces... good stuff! I honestly can't say much about the service because I'm always busy stuffing myself when I'm here and then food coma'ing right after. But I do know the service is efficient and great for all the people they get! Anti-hype? Psh, drop it and eat here (wear stretchy pants and loose shirts)

I first was introduced to Phil's a little over 2 years ago and it is now my favorite BBQ joint down in Socal. I live in the bay area, which is already about 8 hours away, and on this visit to Phil's, I was actually visiting my best friend in Loma Linda who is also from Hawaii. Little did I know they opened a Phil's closer than the Point Luma one which was about 2 hours away! How disappointed I was coming to find this out along the way... -_- First off, I am honestly not sure when the line around the restaurant begins, BUT if you have internet near you and possibly a laptop (not sure if the software will be read on a phone), go to their website before heading down. They have a link called "BBQueue Cam." This link leads to you a live feed of the restaurant along with real time estimates of the wait along the areas AROUND the building. I would say my best friend and I waited about 20 to 30 minutes for lunch during the week of spring break. The staff was very nice. Because it was my best friend's first time here, she didn't know what to order. The lady at the door entrance greeting customers gladly helped us with that though. During this particular visit, I believe there was a Cubs game going on, and they had several flat screens playing it especially on the bar side of the restaurant. So I can tell this is a popular place for sports fans as well as foodies. Now to the good stuff, the FOOD! The baby back ribs are really good here! When you bite onto the meat, it falls right off the bone. So I ordered a a full baby back rib dinner with potato salad and sweet baked beans along with a side of onion rings. My mom alway told me that I ate with my eyes because I was definitely overwhelmed by the amount of food I ordered. The potato salad had a lot of flavor, but the sweet baked beans was a surprise to me. I have never tried it nor do I like beans on any occasion, but I was proven wrong. It was actually really good possibly because they were so sweet.

So this place does have fall of the bone tender ribs. And yes, the lines are long. I called in the order to take to go since this was my first time here and I didn't want to be disappointed in standing in a 2 hour line. I think calling in was the best idea, you can eat these anywhere. We got the baby back ribs which were super tender. The beefy ribs were surprisingly good and tender. El toro- the tri-tip sandwich wasn't bad either. It has a strong hint of charcoal smoke taste. Onion rings were huge, extra batter coating which was crispy, but a but too much shell for me. Fries were ok. Sides: baked beans, cole slaw and mac salad- the slaw was probably the best tasting, the rest was ok. Overall, if you want the full on experience, I guess you can stand in the line and wait, or come at the right time for a shorter wait?? Calling in was just fine for me. I can't say it's the best I've ever had since I haven't had all the bbq meat in the world just yet, but so far, this is high on my list of bbq goodness.

WHERE: Sports Center Blvd (right by Red Lobster). I know this because gps was giving us a hard time, so we were circling the premises for about 20 minutes! WHEN: 11am-11pm, son! WHY: Ahhh!!! The previous reviews were the truth. ABSOLUTELY UHHHH-MAYYY-ZINNGGG!!! WHAT: Our tour guide/older cousin took my brothers, the youngsters, and I to the destination! GPS wasn't our friend at the time, so we pulled over to ask someone where phil's bbq was- he said it was straight ahead!! We circled and passed it for nearly 20 minutes!! When we parked and got there, I noticed the restaurant was pretty big! The line wrapped around the place like an amusement park ride. Funny thing, when you got to one of the corners of the line, there is a sign above that said "you have 21 minutes & 14 seconds from this point" -HILARIOUS! WHAT WE HAD: (I had to take a bite out of everything that I personally didn't order for myself) -Broham Burger: bbq pulled pork & coleslaw! Amazing!! (Of course, my pick) -Beefy Ribs & chickless dinner: this was my brother's pick. The beefy ribs were BEEFY ALL RIGHT!! I would surely come back for this!! This is my recommendation as a first timer! -Baby Back Ribs & chicken dinner: my other brother's choice. The ribs too, were falling off of the bone!! Another recommendation!! -BBQ Cheeseburger: my younger cousin's choice!! Great choice, the burger was pretty huge!! That definitely got her 100 percent full!! -Onion Rings: perfectly battered & made. Great big rings!! A large plate can feed the table!! -Macaroni salad: This is one of the sides you are able to choose from. I'm pretty picky with my macaroni salad, and this was YUMMY! *NOTE: Remember, if you are a first timer, I undoubtedly recommend the beefy ribs!!! My number 2 pick would be baby back! Also try some macaroni salad & onion rings if you still have space left in that tummy of yours!! Have fun PHILing yourself up with BBQ sauce & quality ribs!! =D

This is probably the best BBQ you're gonna get in California and pretty close to quality/taste when compared to restaurants in the South. We arrived at around 11am and luckily got a spot near the bar (first come first serve).  The chicken and ribs were fall of the bone tender and the baked BBQ beans went well when dipped with french fries.  If you're in SD and craving BBQ, Phil's is definitely the place you should go.  Get there early for lunch or wait 45-60 minute, especially over the weekend.

This place deserves all 5 stars!! Yesterday was my first time there and I have to say, this place is AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS and the service from ALL the staff was very very great, super attentive! I very much recommend this place for anyone who enjoys BBQ. The ribs are fall off the bone AND tasty, the tri tip sandwich just melts in your mouth, the potato salad is made w red potatoes (my fav) which gives it a way better taste, & the onion rings are A MUST have!! I will make sure to come back when I'm in San Diego, from LA. Folks, please don't be scared of the line, (like i was at first) I almost left as i looked for parking, it's huge but trust me it's worth the wait!!

Phil's BBQ is simply excellent all around.  I have been here over 30 times and tried just about every food item except for the salad.   Everything is delicious... Last night my wife and I went to Phil's and had our usual, a 3 beefy rib plate with corn a 1/2 chicken plate with slaw and beans, sangria for the lady, and a couple beers for me, all for under $40.  The food was delicious.  The sides were good, the chicken was juicy, and my teeth were tearing through the ribs with ease.  The BBQ sauce is mouthwatering good and complements the different meats. Perhaps the best thing about Phil's is the service.  It can only be defined as exceptional.  The staff is friendly, polite, and they will do everything they can to make you happy while you are there. The one problem with Phil's is the crowds, but this is a problem that any great restaurant will have.  If you're worried about a crowd, check their web cam before you go (and enjoy the squeaking pig on their website), or go a little early/late for dinner and you'll be fine.  Can't do that?  Then phone in an order to go. Overall, Phil's is an outstanding BBQ.  Now, I've heard people say that  "Phil's isn't as good as my favorite place in (Texas or KC or etc)"  While that might be true, it is hardly helpful or relevant to a BBQ discussion about San Diego.   4 star food 5 star service

An uncle from the area suggested for me and the boyfriend to try this place while we were staying in San Diego. It was a Saturday night around 6 pm and the line was past the restaurant. According to the employee who was outside, we came in at a good time as it can go past the restaurant and wind down other stores during the weekends. Our wait took almost two hours. Boyfriend and I split a half dinner of the Beefy Back Back Ribs and their onion rings. Then we each had their El Toro Sandwich, which is their BBQ tri-trip sandwich. The portions were big, so we ended up packing both our sandwiches and onion rings to go. If you like tangy BBQ, that's how the food tastes. It's a place to visit at least once when visiting San Diego.

BBQ is the god-king of all American food. I had the pleasure of coming here this weekend with my fatty-licious LA friends and one Austrailian. I had the pleasure of proudly exclaiming that Phil's BBQ was the best BBQ in SoCal and watched as our Austrailian guest's eye's widened when he recieved his tray full of baby back ribs, macaroni salad, and fries. "Why are the small servings in America the size of large servings in Austrailia?" he asked. Because PHILS IS BOMBTASTICALLY AWESOME and gives with tons of food for a reasonable price. The baby back rib rack is sharable between two people - soft, succlent meat with a tangy bbq sauce. ASK FOR EXTRA SAUCE ON THE SIDE - you're going to want more to drizzle your sides with and drip your fries in. I don't know what it's made of and don't care - it's sweet tangy deliciousness that fills your mouth with utter JOY. The choice between beefy ribs and baby back is a personal choice. The baby back ribs are easier to hold and eat. Macaroni salad here is MUST.

The first thing on my mind after waking up Sunday morning was, "Who's down for Phil's?".  Surely, my buddies and I arrived 30 min before the store opened and there was already a line outside, but not a long line..  The dinner line is far worse cuz I've seen! I like to go all out for these types of rare occasions so I ordered a full rack of baby back ribs with coleslaw and sweet bbq beans all to myself, along with a full order of crispy onion rings with ranch to share with the buddies.. And wow.... The ribs were hands down tasty, had plenty of meat on each bone, and was tender...  You can definitely acknowledge the time put into the food..  What more can you ask for? Oh and the amount of sweet/tangy bbq sauce drizzled on the ribs was perfect, just enough so you can taste the flavor of the meat with each bite.  And yes, ribs were conquered... I paid less attention to finishing my sides but the coleslaw and sweet bbq beans were a great combo with the ribs..  The crispy onion rings were also good but too oily IMO.  Ranch was good too. Why are you so far? I want more!

We drove over 100 miles to eat at Phil's! OK, well, we did have some other business in the area, but at the end of that 100+ mile drive nothing sounded better than heading directly over to Phil's for some of their top-reviewed BBQ. We arrived about 12:30 on a Wednesday afternoon. The place was indeed packed (except for the outside seating area, it being an unusually warm day), but there was no line. The smiling hostess explained the beeper system to us and directed us to an open cashier. (I'm not sure if you can tell by the pix, but Phil's is a BIG place, with a row of cashiers taking orders from dozens and dozens of hungry customers. It's clearly a huge community favorite.) Mary went with the BBQ Broham (Pulled Pork Shoulder) for $6.95. "Seasoned and char-grilled, on a bed of cole slaw. Topped with BBQ sauce." She also opted for a "small" serving of the Macaroni Salad for another $1.50. I ordered the Baby Back Rib & Chicken Dinner for $12.25, described as "4 Bones and 1/4 Chicken BBQ'd." This comes with two small sides, and I chose the Sweet Baked Beans and Potato Salad. We found an open table and got our drinks (nice big cups). The food came up and our beeper went off in less than 10 minutes. Mary loved the pork and the macaroni salad. I did take a taste of both and they were indeed delicious! She deemed the cole slaw "good," which is a big concession from her as she thinks only her mother and the Colonel (KFC) know how to make cole slaw just perfect. My baby backs and chicken was fantastic! The meat was all falling-off-the-bone well cooked, but very juicy and flavorful, and slathered all over with Phil's excellent sauce. The beans were very tasty, and I really enjoyed the potato salad. It was really special. I couldn't help but eat it all up! Phil's has clearly discovered the formula for cranking out one delicious meal after another, and their master chefs deliver the goods time after time with yummy consistency. We'll be back, no doubt! Even if we have to drive 100 miles again to do it! I also want to give a shout-out to Aaron for stopping by to chat with us for a while. Great food, great service, great folks, and all topped off with Phil's fantastic BBQ sauce. That's a 5 star experience to me!

By far the best BBQ I've ever had.  If they were compared to cars, it'd be the Rolls Royce compared to a Honda.  This place just knows how to make their ribs.   First off, let me tell you about how popular it is.  Its so well known that there is usually a super long line all of the time.  I don't know about weekdays, but for weekends the line is usually 2 hours for both lunch and dinner.  Being someone who's never heard of Phil's BBQ before, I would be thinking these people are stupid for waiting in such a long line for just a piece of meat.  But I bet that once that person try's it, they'd be back for more.  Definitely worth the wait!!   Me and my girlfriend arrived for lunch at around 12:30 and there was a huge line.  It was going to be about an hour and a half wait.  There were two couples in front of us and I overheard the worker tell them that the bar is open seating and that there were seats for couples in there.  Next thing I notice, both couples found seats inside.  We waited a little longer and then the worker asked for couples of 2 and took us in right away to sit at the bar.  I was thinking "OMG this can't get any better".  Avoided an almost 2 hour wait.  So if your in a small party of 2, give the bar a try, just as good as a table. Now for the food.  I ordered the Beefy ribs and also the Baby back ribs for me and my girlfriend.  We also both got a corn for the side.  Those beefy ribs were huge.  This pig must have been taking steroids.  For anyone who comes here they basically need to order the ribs.  They were cooked to perfection.  I could taste the BBQ flavor from the ribs and the combo of the sauce just made it explode with flavor in my mouth.  The corn was alright, it was just a plain corn on the cob, but it was good to eat with the meat.   Overall, if you don't have the time to read all of this, AMAZING!  I would definitely come back here again and I hope they start expanding.  Could be a little bit pricy, but worth the wait and the price.

AS ADVERTISED. I've been here once, and that one time i went I actually drove from Los Angeles to San Diego just to eat this meal. My friend was hyping it up so much I just had to go EAT some ribs. I waited a solid hour during dinner time, as you stand in line you will gaze at the Red Lobster on the other side of the restaurant and you will want to give up and go there. DON'T DO IT. I finally got up to the front and I was so hungry from all the waiting and driving so I ordered a full rack of beef ribs and paired them with macaroni salad and french fries. My friend got a half rack of baby backs and man, they looked so puny next to my big beef ribs. If you go with a big group of guys and you get the baby back ribs and all your friends get the beef ribs, you will feel embarrassed... don't be that guy. The beef ribs were charred just the right amount and very juicy and tasty. The macaroni salad was the perfect compliment to these fine pieces of meat. I had one of the baby back ribs, it wasn't much more tender than the beef ribs, just get the beef ribs, trust me. I eat a lot, and boy did I try to finish that meal... but I'm glad I didn't since it tasted just as good the morning after. Fantastic meal that costs just over $20 (full rack + drink). If you are in San Diego and in the mood for BBQ, just do it.

Not the best BBQ I've ever had.  No lie, my dad makes better ribs than this.  I think he might have to open his own restaurant soon!   I just didn't care for Phil's.  Sorry Phil!  It's decent and I like the outdoor patio seating availability, plus the open sinks to wash and dry your hands after eating ribs is an awesome idea, but it's not as good as it was hyped up to be. We tried the chicken, ribs, onion rings, and more ribs - and all of it was pretty dry.  It's a little overrated.  Actually a LOT.  People were telling me, "When you go to San Diego you HAVE TO try Phil's!"  Well my friends, I found a better place for BBQ.  Yes it's a little bit of a drive from North County, but hey, I'd drive to Coop's instead for some real BBQ in Lemon Grove.  The 21+ minutes I waited in that long ridiculous line could have been spent driving to Lemon Grove for some http://bomb.com BBQ.

This is the best in San Diego. We are from Kansas City, so we know good bbq. The ribs are falling off the bone and the onion rings are perfect! I take my family here when they come to visit! The only downfall is you could stand in line for 40 min, but in the end it's worth it!

I know, I know.  Everyone seems to LOVE Phil's.  I just don't think the line is worth the wait.  But then again, I'm spoiled by all the smoking and grilling that my hubby does at home.  Be prepared to wait over an hour in a line that wraps around the restaurant on a busy night.  Not my style.  I have MK's BBQ.

Good and Tasty BBQ I would do take out and never wait in that line. The line was out into the parking lot and around the building. Amazing, that you can walk right to the front (left side)and get your BBQ in about 5 minutes and eat wherever, or wait for like an hour and eat inside, kinda silly. Get the Pork Ribs, I felt they were much better than the burnt beef ribs. Also were more tender and less fatty. The chicken was very good. Even the sides were really nice. Good corn in December? You bet.. Veggies Good. Small menu but they seem to do it right. More sauce options would also be good. Next time in San Diego we will try some other BBQ joints.

Phil loves Phil's BBQ! The 5 stars isn't just because we share the same name neither. If a restaurant over 500 miles away can continue to force saliva out of my glands then it def deserves 5 stars. And even though there's already a plethora of reviews for this place I still feel the need to add my two cents: 2 minutes = our exact pre-order wait time. Skipped the whole 1-2 hour-wrap-around-the-building-line, ordered, and was eating within 5 minutes. My MO: a full rack of pork ribs sided with fries and coleslaw. #Crack. Tried my friend's beef ribs. #Crack. The sauce itself was #crack; tangy, savory, smokey, zesty, zingy... #LiquidCrack. Our server was on point and even gave us free dessert. Aside from the occasional moan of satisfaction, you could almost hear a needle drop as our group of 9 was in deep concentration, inhaling our food in unison. Not a single soul was disappointed. Walking out of Phil's to see that the same group of people (that were in the very back of the line upon our arrival) STILL haven't ordered = priceless. Our special VIP experience combined with crack food was enough to exceed 5 stars, easily. At last, a place that's hyped accordingly.

What can I add that the other 3,500 reviews haven't? Look, we went there in a deer-headlights-in-the-eyes, out-ot-towner starvation fog. We weren't expecting much. I mean, think about it, how many times in your life have you heard, "This place has the best ribs!," and you go there and you're like, "Meh." Right? Right. This place has the best ribs. No, really. Incredible. The sides, the sauce, the.... yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just repeating the previous 3,500 reviews, aren't I? So let me offer this to any newcomers: The place is, like, CRAZY BUSY, and when you come around to the entrance there's a line about two hundred people long and you'll think you're NEVER gonna get it. But, believe it or not, that line actually moves pretty fast and before you know it you'll be sitting down. Somehow they move an extraordinary amount of people through without you ever feeling hurried. I think it's because, if you break the menu down, they don't really have a lot of different foods on offer. It makes getting you your meal, and you moving along, that much easier. But really, the ribs are SPECTACULAR. We took the extras home and attacked 'em cold the next day like a pack of wild dogs. It've been scary if it hadn't been so DELICIOUS.

Best BBQ in California, hands down. Be prepared to wait in line for a while if you go at peak hours, otherwise try going between 2 and 4 to avoid a line, or get take out. The beef ribs, Chicken, Mac salad, and woopie pies. Can't beat them.

If you are visiting San Diego and you are a ravenous BBQ carnivore, Phil's is a must-go.   As you can see from the other reviews, there is always a massive line come dinner time, so be sure to take out or get there super early.  You go in, pay for your food at the cash register in the front, and seat yourself.  They give you a buzzer that tells you when your food is ready, and you can get your own utensils, wipes (trust me, you'll need them), and plastic bibs at a nearby counter.  Surprisingly efficient! The waiters are very friendly! At my friend's birthday dinner, three of them agreed to sing happy birthday for him (I don't think they usually do that).  Speaking of birthdays, PROTIP: sign up for their newsletter online and you can cut the line with (I think) 4 other people on your birthday! I've been here so many times, and it holds a special place in my heart (where my arteries are presumably getting clogged). The Baby Back Ribs and the Beefy Ribs will never fail you.  The meat is so tender that it basically falls off the bone, and paired with Phil's delicious BBQ Sauce, it is irresistible.  The chicken is alright, but the ribs are what brings people back time and time again. The first time I went here, I ordered the Quarter Rib Dinner of Baby Back Ribs (9.95).  4 bones may not sound like much, but add in the 2 small sides, and I couldn't finish the plate! Now I usually get the Baby Back Rib Tickler (6.75).  It comes with 3 bones, 2 onion rings, cole slaw, and fries.  In my opinion, it's a much better value and you get to sample the best of what they have to offer.  But if you're a heartier eater, do not hesitate to order half ribs, or even full ribs! You won't be disappointed.  I've got to say though, not a big fan of the onion rings. TIP: There is seasoning on the table.  Add that gratuitously to your fries and you won't regret it. What? Are you a vegetarian? Don't worry, Phil's makes a mean BBQ veggie burger (or so my vegetarian friend says, I've never tried it). Phil's even caters for events! Our club banquet had Phil's catering. Yeah, you're jealous. TL;DR: Come here for yummy BBQ noms that are reasonably priced and generously heaped onto your plate, you won't regret it!

The further west you go in the United States, the harder it can be to find really great BBQ.  Fortunately, Phil's bucks that trend. There are a few things I really love about Phil's.  With some BBQ places, if you come at an off-hour, the meat can taste like it's been on the smoker for a little too long.  Never at Phil's, always moist, with the perfect amount of flavor. I also like in the middle of the two BBQ camps of dry and wet.  I love both...and well at Phil's the BBQ sauce is absolutely top notch.  There's a good chance I could probably eat almost anything if it had Phil's magic BBQ sauce on it.   The one thing keeping me from giving Phil's 5 stars is I'd like to see one or two more sides in the way of a corn bread, mac 'n' cheese, or maybe some cheesy grits.  Something along those lines.   Otherwise...keep it up Phil's, you guys are awesome.

400th review goes to Phil's b/c Phil's is bomb.   If you're looking for a place to sit down and pick up a quick bite to eat, this is not the place for you.  If you don't mind standing in line to get SD's best BBQ, then you've come to the right place.   The food here is simply fantastic.  I prefer ordering the beef or baby back rib dinner.  The beef ribs comes with 5 ribs and the baby back ribs with 10-12 bones.  Both choices give you one large side or two small sides.  It's enough to feed 2 people or in my case...my second dinner.  Phil's covers any amount of ribs you need, so pick one that suits you.  They really are the best ribs I've ever eaten and I've tasted a lot of ribs. My favorites sides are the fries, coleslaw, onion rings, and baked beans.   I have eaten the BBQ chicken here, but I'd rather have slow cooked, fall off the bone, and melt in your mouth ribs.   If ribs aren't your bag, then turn to the sammies!  The pulled pork and tri-tip are the way to go.  They give enough meat in those for 2 sammies!  I haven't tried the cheeseburger, turkey burger, chicken breast or garden burger, but this is a BBQ place...why would I order those? FYI:  Park on the left side of Phil's.  That area is always less busy.  Try going during non peak hours.  I prefer just ordering take out.  Take out is usually faster and you could get your hands dirty in the comfort of your own home.

I live in San Diego. My family come from the Santa Maria Area of CA. Which is well known for their Santa Maria Style BBQ.  I've Been to Texas and Missouri and had other real BBQ. What can I say after almost 3000 reviews of this place most of them with 4 and 5 stars? Wow, just wow.  This place lives on hype alone and people who know nothing about true BBQ joints.  When people mention this place I ask if they have had any BBQ outside of SoCal 90% say no. The other 10% laugh at this place. If you like overpriced tasteless small portions then this place is for you. At best this place should never get more than 3 stars.

The side portions are huge.  The onion rings are THE best I've had in San Diego.  The only bad thing about this place is the ever present 50 person line that wraps around the restaurant.  If you live nearby, call in the order for take out and eat the meal on your couch at home.  Call in orders are usually filled in 15 or 20 minutes.

I'm not a big BBQ lover, but my BF is and so I went for him. Only knew about it because of all the Yelp reviews and when visiting San Diego wanted to check it out. At around 9pm the line was wrapped around the place on a Saturday night. We had no idea it was going to be crazy like that. We called to ask how long the wait was and we were told it would be best to go the bar area which is "seat yourself"... since it was just 2 of us.We got lucky and there were 2 spots at the bar when we walked in even though the take-out and dine-in lines were 30 to 45 mins. Got the boneless ribs which were awesome and the potato salad w/ fries. All awesome and I loved the flavor of the BBQ sauce. Also, great prices for the amount and quality of food.

THEY ARE CLOSED ON MONDAYS. just a warning. There is ALWAYS a wait. But if you have internet access, you could try and see the live video of the line. But just a heads up, the line will usually go around the corner. If your group considers the option to buy and eat somewhere else, there is a much less of a wait ordering to go! Personally, I am not a meat person. I will eat the occasionally chicken, fish, and seafood but I'm not going to be the one to announce my craving for ribs, because I probably won't ever haha.   A lot of my friends come to San Diego just for Phil's in mind so who am I to change their minds. I've always wanted to try their veggie burger and although a little ironic ordering the veggie burger at a rib joint - it was pretty good! The girl that i ordered from responded to my order a little taken aback as I wasn't ordering a half rack or full rack of ribs but she told me that she just had a veggie burger for lunch and it's one of her favorites on the menu. I can believe that. With an onion ring and what i think is some rice in the patty, it's pretty scrumptious. (SO. If you are a vegetarian and your group of friends want to go to Phil's - give the veggie burger a try!) Phil's BBQ sauce is now at Costco. They are expanding!

It's hard for me to judge what REAL good ribs are... but if you've tried bad (stuck to the bone, lack of flavor, hard meat), you will be blown away by these ribs. The meat is extremely tender, moist, and falls off the bone easily. It is well worth the wait when you are craving some good ribs.

==Phil's BBQ== Avoid the line. Call in your order, walk through the pick up line to the left (No people rarely), pay, and wait a few mins and your order is ready to-go! 1] Try their Macaroni Salad. It's DELISSSSSSSS. 2] BBQ Bake Beans. Don't leave without getting some of this PS: Ask for extra BBQ sauce on the side. You get a free little container with every BBQ order :) For the dunk lovers, like myself. Love thy sauce !

Loong lines, even we arrived at around 430pm it took 1.5 hours to get seated. They are nice enough to offer iced water and onion rings during the wait which helps ease the pain of waiting. We had all three meats: baby back ribs, beef ribs, and chicken , as well as cole slaw, potato salad, and fries. Can't handle the onion ring as there are too much food even thought I'm a big fan of it. Portions are big. Just one dish is probably enough for two people while I have waited for so long its better to get more just so I can take home and eat one more time, lol. I like the beef rib the best, it's beefy and tasty. Baby back ribs are good, while not like crazy good or something. Like their sauce as it's not too overpowering. Chicken is just normal chicken, nothing special while their chicken breast is quite tendor and juicy. I would say leave the stomach for beef or baby back rib. I like the red skin chunky potato salad. Cole slaw is good, while cole slaw is cole slaw. Fries are good, while quite normal as well. Service is super friendly. They help me find a table when we were looking around for one. Is it good? Yes. Worth the 1-2 hours wait? Maybe. Yes if you are not busy and crave for BBQ on any given day.

Best BBQ on the west coast!! I love their Baby Back Ribs, they are super tender and practically fall off the bone. Their fries are fresh and taste great with some dirty ranch(ranch with lots of Franks Red Hot) There is always a long line but it is well worth the wait! If you are in a hurry you can learn the secret way to sit without standing in line but you'll have to go there to figure it out. If I lived close I would be here weekly!

I ordered the half BBQ chicken half ribs combo with macaroni salad and coleslaw as my sides. Everything was so amazing that I cannot find words to describe it!! The chicken was very tender and basically fell off the bone. The ribs were delicious and worth the mess! I am always looking for the place with the best macaroni salad or coleslaw and Phil's easily won me over with their sides. There was very minimal conversation throughout dinner because everyone was too busy eating so you can imagine how good the food was!

Where should I begin on how bad the food was here. The one star was for the glass of wine I had that was good. Whenever you see places featured on food network or travel channel it can be hit or miss this was a miss. I cannot believe I waited 20 min for tasteless BBQ. I had the baby back and chickless combo with fries and coleslaw. The fries and slaw were nothing special. The chicken breast was dry and overlooked with no seasoning. The ribs tasted like they came out of an oven. Neither meat had any smokey BBQ flavor. The sauce reminded me of open pit out of a bottle. I would never come back here again. I have had better ribs at Applebees.

The very fact that this place has 4 and half stars as an OVER ALL rating is straight STUPID. RIBS: They sucked, period end of story.  I judge my BBQ based on two dishes served at the place, brisket and ribs, and they dropped the mother FN ball on the ribs. Where's the smokey flavor that bbq is supposed to have?  Wheres that delicious dry rub? The sauce was mediocre, the fries were limp, and on top of that my ribs came out cold. Let's just say that my ribs came out hot, it still wouldn't make up for the lack of flavor, smoke, and care that was supposed to be in the food. Sides: Macaroni salad was average not going to hate. Fries were sorry! limp as hell. I tried something else too but it must not have been worthwhile cause I don't remember what it is. Overall: If you have not grown up eating bbq, If you have not had GOOD bbq then HELL YEAH you will love this place because the prices aren't bad. HOWEVER, if you really love your barbequed meats done the right way, steer clear suckas cause you will come hungry and LEAVE PISSED.

Hands down, THE VERY BEST Ribs!!! THE HYPE IS TRUE! My girlfriend and I stopped here on our way back to Los Angeles after our stay in San Diego. We saw this place on food network, and read the amazing reviews on Yelp. We were anticipating a very long wait, but, luckily, there wasn't one. I'm sure that's because it was before noon, and on a Tuesday. We ordered the baby back ribs/chickless dinner, with macaroni salad, and baked beans as our sides. Plus we wanted to try the onion rings, Corn on the Cob,  and the El Toro sandwich. We weren't able to finish all of it. That's damn near impossible! The onion rings weren't worth another bite. The corn was good. The sandwich was good too, but the ribs and chicken were BETTER. We decided next time we go (cuz there will be a next time!) we'll just stick with the dinner plate and sides. There was more than enough food to go around! The atmosphere is great! The bbq food is amazing! It's too bad it's all the way in SD, but it's defo a stop worth making on future trips! Enjoy your meal :)

Nothing bad to say about this place.  The line stretched out the door and around the restaurant but it moved fast.  We split a bunch of different meals so that we could try a few things, the baby back ribs were awesome, chicken was awesome, the pulled pork sandwich was great but a pretty messy, and the onion rings were delicious (and freaking huge).  The fact that I was able to get a pint of Red Stripe for like 6 or 7 bucks to go along with my food made me pretty happy as well.

Not much I can say that hasn't been mentioned but Phil's is freakin' great. A very well oiled machine with some of the best customer service and wait staff I have seen.  Yes, the line can be atrocious so you may want to plan your day around Phil's and not the other way around.  Weekdays are always your best bet either before or after the lunch rush and on weekends?  Ha.....go early.  Like....when they open early.  If not, you my friend will be chillin' in line.  But, that's not too bad cause guess what?....while you wait, they sell beer and wine.  Whoa....that rhymed.   Anyways, I usually get the El Toro (Tri Tip sandwich) and it is one of the tastiest things in SD.  Onion rings are good, Baby Backs are delightful.....hell.....just get everything.  As some of said, and I would agree it's not authentic BBQ but lets not split hairs here.  They could cook all their meals on a Foreman grill and I couldn't care less.  Just great food and with great prices and great service. Go Phil!!

The Famous Phil's BBQ... The beef ribs were VERY tender and tasty, but the Baby Back rib's didn't seem that much different than the ribs at other joints.  The sides weren't awesome-- we had the beans and fries.  They didn't have mac and cheese!  I thought all BBQ places had mac and cheese! We arrived about 15 minutes before they opened for lunch, and already there was a huge line.  Fortunately, once the place opened, the line moved pretty quickly and it wasn't long before I had bbq sauce all over my face. +fast service, very tender beef ribs! - long lines, forgettable baby back ribs

I'll list the review starting from the beginning to end. The parking is god awful, but I'll blame the Swap meet for that. Next, I waited 2 hours in line so I was anticipating  some good BBQ. The "greeter" said "Hi" to me and just looked away, so I was a little confused and just walked to the nearest cashier. I saw one table available and went for it though it had some of the dirty mess from the previous group that sat there. I just assumed someone forgot to clean it but I didn't care for it too much. What really annoyed me was that not once did the guy come to our table, he just ignored us all together. But I'll get to that later. My order of pork ribs came in and they were burnt to a crisp. At first I asked if I could get ribs that weren't to burnt, but was told from a friend that if I asked I could replace them. They replaced the ribs with more burnt ribs with no sauce, I was just confused. I asked the guy walking around providing napkins for people for some extra sauce as my ribs were a little dry (I had to go out of my way to get his attention by running up to him). I never got the bbq sauce, so I went up to the front to get some sauce. Not surprisingly the guy never brought the bbq sauce. I wasn't sure what he was getting paid for. In summary, after hearing how great this place is, what I experienced was poor service, dry/burnt food. ****EDIT**** Came here a 2nd time and had a completely different experience, the busser (Zach) was probably one the busiest workers I have ever seen. He made sure we had plates/forks even if I didn't ask for it and continued to check in once and a while.Right when I finished my food it was off my table instantly. The baby back ribs were delish, the meat falls right off the bone. This is the phil's bbq ive heard fondly of. I recommend it.

Best BBQ in town, and no crazy lines like others.  Value not bad, but a little expensive.  Pulled pork is the best!

One of the Best and the most Awesome BBQ joint in SoCal! The girls ordered "The Best of Both": Baby Back & Bone-in Chicken (which was only $12.25!) and I had the Beefy Ribs dinner (little fat, extremely tender). We go our order within 10 to 15 mins. Food was definitely cooked to perfection! Smokey, Tangy, and a little bit spicy...SO DELICIOUS!!! Meal comes in a relatively large potion so if you have a small appetite, there's probably gonna be left overs. If you do have left over ribs, wrap them in tin foil and use oven for reheat to keep meat tender. The restaurant staff was very nice and attentive. The line was huge but worth your while!

Phil's makes me homesick for the Carolinas. Not because the food is so incredibly good that it reminds me of home, but because it makes me wistful remembering how much better real barbecue is back home. While Southern Californians and transplants from other parts of the country may assume that any backyard gathering that consists of meat cooked over fire and drowned in sauce, this simply isn't so. Don't get me wrong, Phil's has excellent sauces for their ribs, pork, and chicken, but the meet is supposed to be falling-off-the-bone, melt-in-your-mouth tender and succulent, and this is where they fall short. Add in the fact that there's always a ridiculous line to get in, and it makes me long that much more for the tiny, off the beaten path barbecue stands that dot the state routes and highways of the South.

I highly recommend this BBQ joint if you are in the San Diego Area. Anywhere near the beaches or Sports Arena. Really good BBQ spot. It's actually on my top 3 places to eat BBQ. And is the best in San Diego! When I lived in San Diego I would eat here at least once a week. The bar seating is the best place to sit. Lots of TV's. When it's really busy, the bar is a key place to eat. They take your order at the bar so you really don't have to wait in line. I always get the same thing when I eat here. I get the Rib Tickler & the El Toro. The Rib Tickler consists of 3 baby backs & 1 large onion ring. The ribs are tender & savory. The onion ring is crunchy and really good with the buttermilk sauce (ask for it). The El Toro is my favorite item there. It's a tri-tip sandwich on a bun. The beef is really tender & not fatty at all. They put plenty of BBQ sauce on it & a lot of meat. There's so much meat on the El Toro that there's enough to eat with a fork when the sandwich is done. The BBQ sauce tastes really good too. Sweet and savory & has a unique flavor. They sell it in the restaurant. Although, I've also seen it for sale at the local Costco at a better price.

Tasty, but not "real" BBQ. Been to Texas a few times before, and smoke meat at home; so in my mind, BBQ's about the flavor in the meat, not about drenching it in high fructose corn syrup and vinegar and calling it 'BBQ'. 3 stars for phone-in/take-out efficiency, flavorful sauce and crispy/battered onion rings. (Only) 3 stars for meat that is "cooked and slathered in sauce" rather than smoked and flavored, and for the high price for what you get. San Diego, you guys need to venture outa state and taste some "real" BBQ. Really.

It wasn't my birthday, so I didn't get to hop the line at Phil's.  "Don't worry," my pal K-Chan promised me, "there's an In-N-Out across the street; we can eat a Double-Double while in line."  Though it ended with me holding the line while my amigo ran off for a pre-dinner burger, I'm glad I stayed.  One look at the heaping piles of meat laid out in front of me, and I was instantly full.   To get the full taste of Phil's, we got the (smaller) half rack of both the beef and pork ribs, and sides of both corn on the cob and onion rings.  Did I mention this was post K-Chan's Double-Double?   The servings are huge -- five, foot long beef ribs are given in the half order.  The pork ribs aren't much smaller, either.  While K-Chan liked the beef ribs for their gamey texture and fatty juiciness, I was more partial to the pork ones.  I know, leave it to the Jew.  But really, the pork ribs were cooked perfectly with a crispy, almost flaky texture on the outside, and well flavored, fall off the bone meat on the inside.  The sides on the other hand were mediocre -- the corn lacked the crisp flavoring of fresh corn and the onion rings were overly battered -- and took an obvious backseat to the BBQ.   So why the three stars and not more?  Call me biased, but Phil's BBQ sauce just isn't up to par.  Though tangy and flavorful, it lacks the depth and heat of places like Oakland's Everett and Jones.  My NorCal pride runs deeper than K-Chan's stomach.

After two months of living here, I can finally say that I'm a true San Diegan. I remember all the freeways, I know how to get to the airport by heart, but most importantly, I've undergone the initiation that is Phil's BBQ. Long story short, I got the 4 Baby Back Ribs & 1/4 BBQ Chicken Dinner with fries and macaroni salad. All of this after waiting in line for at least half an hour, which is well worth it. Pros: - The setup of the restaurant is very convenient. You order, find a table, and your food is ready in no more than 10 min. No having to deal with waiters, taking orders, etc etc - The ribs fall right off the bone and are extremely tender. - When you order a small serving of fries, it's really more like a super sized McDonalds portion, except much tastier - Macaroni salad is delicious and goes very well to contrast the BBQ Sauce - Very kind staff who are on top of their work Cons: - The BBQ sauce is pretty vinegary, so getting some ranch or just a lot of water cancels it out pretty well. - The chicken is a bit dry, but quite managable - Hard to find a parking spot on a weekend evening To sum it up, it's not THE BEST BBQ I've ever had. That title will always go to my dad. However, it's definitely some of the most tender and juicy meat I've eaten. Worth the 30 min wait? I think so!

Phil's BBQ has to be one of the best restaurants I have gone too. I always heard about this place and gave it a try. I was completely blown away. You do stand in line for quiet a while. There's even a sign that says your 20 minutes away from ordering your food by the entrance. I ordered a Beef Rib Dinner. It comes with three (3) ribs and either two (2) small sides or one (1) large side. Decided to go with the 2 small sides and got the fries and macaroni salad. The ribs were huge. Nice and tender. Not really a fan of BBQ sauce. I prefer dry rub. Phil's is a rare exception. The sauce was sweet and it had the right amount of spice. The fries were crispy and the macaroni salad was great. If you are a local to San Diego or just visiting, you have to go to Phil's BBQ.

All the reviews are correct, there are no ways to describe this place except for 5 stars.  I spent 3 days in San Diego, 6 meals and of those, 2 meals were at Phils because it was so damn good.  Yes, there is going to be a wait, but if you are patient enough, the wait is worth it, I guarantee it.  I waited for about 1 hour the first time I was there, 6 pm on a Thursday and I got there before opening on Saturday, 1045 and there were already people in line.   Amazingly tender and tasty ribs, every single side is great, there was nothing bad I had at this restaurant.  Normally, I am not a fan of coleslaw and I even loved that, seriously the best coleslaw I've ever had.  I loved it so much, I bought their take home spice rub and BBQ sauce for my own ribs that I make at home. This place is amazing, and if you are ever going to San Diego or ever in the area, you must try it.

I know that Phil's BBQ is a gem because the hype didn't ruin it for me. When people told me that it was the best BBQ ever, it literally turned out to be the best BBQ ever. The meat is tender, juicy, and flavorful. The sides are spot on and the sauce is out of this world. I got beef ribs, which were huge by the way, and the meat was literally fall off the bone (something you dont usually get with beef ribs). Look, I can go on and on about why this place is awesome, but I would lose you somewhere in the midst of all that. So to keep it concise, Phil's BBQ is literally as good as it gets. 5 stars, hands down. Be ready to wait in line though, that line is not kind..

After trying the Phil's BBQ in San Macros, I thought that maybe my bad experience was just with that location. Maybe this location was better- after all it has an hour long wait. Clearly, it must be good. AHAHAHA, no. The wait just makes me feel like an idiot for waiting so long for food that wasn't that good. Yet again, the sauce was deathly vinegar-y. It's like they're trying to pickle my insides! Luckily, I got the sauce on the side so I didn't have to suffer through it. My Big Sis and I split a Pulled-Pork Sandwich with coleslaw. Holy cr-p....there is enough meat on this sucker to make like 3 good-sized sandwiches?!?! Which would be great...if it wasn't on the dry side. And had some large, tough chunks to chew through. I guess the dry issue could be fixed by pouring their vinegar sauce on it... -_- With a bit of sauce and a heap of coleslaw, the sandwich was okay. Nothing to rave about though. The two-star rating pretty much sums up my Phil's BBQ experience- Meh. I've experienced better.  This place seems to built on a lot of hype and not a lot of results.

As a transplant from Virginia and Texas, I'd given up on finding decent BBQ here in San Diego.. until a friend took me to Phil's way back when it was in Hillcrest.  Thank goodness!  While it isn't PERFECT by southern and Texas standards, it is definitely perfect by San Diego standards.  I'm not a big fan of the line but the new location in East County will (HOPEFULLY!) remedy this one problematic detail.  Frankly, I'm lobbying for a third location so that I'll go more often.  Keep up the great work, Phil!

Despite the heavy amount of positive reviews, I personally find the restaurant average. I found that my order of baby back ribs was heavily over-sauced, with the actual meat lacking any of its own flavor. I wish I had more sides to down the ribs with, because after just a few bites, it became almost tedious to eat. What I do recommend, however, is the combination of beef ribs and chicken with a side of corn. In this case, the ribs do have its own flavor and are not dependent on the sauce. The chicken also provides a different texture and flavor, and the corn is juicy and delicious. Unfortunately, everything else did not fit my palate.

My husband and I came here on our vacation to San Diego.  Yes, we came from Texas...to San Diego...and went to a barbecue place.  I wasn't too thrilled about the idea but it was definitely worth it.   The line wasn't too long when we went, which was definitely a plus, but if there was a long wait, it wouldn't have been a big deal.  We both got the ribs which were very moist and fell off the bone.  We decided to share an order of onion rings, which was also a good idea.  I believe we got the small order and we didn't come close to finishing them...and we're not small people by any means.  They are huge and have the perfect texture: crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.   The service was also very friendly but not overbearing.

It's just not all that it's hyped up to be. Coop's BBQ in Lemon Grove... THAT is some good bbq. You know a bbq place is good when they serve it to you by the pound on butcher paper! Phil's BBQ is good food. Good Service. It's just not worth the (sometimes) hour long wait.

I have been here twice so far and loved it both times. The first time I had Phil's was through the take-out. I was working for a judge and the whole chambers had Phil's for lunch. You know that if the Judge likes a restaurant, then it has to be good. Twice I have gotten the baby back rib tickler with the 3 baby back ribs, fries, onion rings, and coleslaw. With the price being under $7, it is such a great deal. I am not a big meat eater but those ribs are unforgettable. I appreciate how the meat just falls off the bone, especially when I am in my work clothes and don't want to eat like a total pig. The coleslaw is well-balanced but not the best version out there. The second time I went to Phil's, I brought my boyfriend and we dined-in. We went on a Thursday at 12:30pm, prime lunch time. I guess we had to wait about 10 mins in line and another 10 mins for our food. Not too bad of a wait time. I loved the Creole spice on the table for the french fries. It made them so much better than just your typical fries. Also, had some of the broham, which was delicious and incredibly hard to eat. Then, two days later a friend came over to hangout and brought, you guessed it, Phil's with him for his dinner. He shared his full rack of beef ribs and they were sooo good. Definitely a Phil's fan.

Finally...The Top Raw Man... Has come back!.... To San Diego. And, waited 21 minutes and 14 seconds (just to eat at this place). Well I'm not Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson to make such an electrifying statement. But I've finally tried this BBQ spot and overall I must say I'm quite impressed. For $46.00 split between five people (roughly $10.00 each) we got the following: Main Dishes -Full Beef Rib Dinner (with one large side) -Pork Rib (Half Baby Back Potions only) -Colossal Onion Rings -El Toro Sandwich Sides French Fries The El Toro's tri-tip had a nice char. Which also gave out a nice smoky after taste and with Phil's signature BBQ sauce it was superb after every bite. The Pork ribs were a lot smaller than the Beef ribs but it was just as succulent and moist, the meat fell off the bone and it was delicious. The Beef is probably well worth the money out of everything. Large in portion, juicy and moist like the Pork. Reminds me of my favorite spot (Matiki Island Barbeque, Anaheim, CA), just prepared differently and a bit more expensive. With the sauce it takes the flavors to a whole new level, with a bit of tanginess, spice and sweet. The Fries were filler but it was nice and crisp and the Colossal Onion Rings are bigger in portion (as opposed to Umami Burger's pricier and smaller version; various Los Angeles, CA locations) and had a nice deep fried crisp to it. Would a lot of people consider this overhype? Probably, but to me at least it delivered. Pricey? Too an extent, but it's worth trying at least once. Would I ever come back? If I ever get to revisit SD (which wouldn't be for a while again). Cheers, you earned my five stars.

I have lived in San Diego 20 years and finally went to try Phil's today.  I have always been scared off by the mile long line but we had friends here from out of town who had heard about it and wanted to give it a shot. We stood outside for only about 30 minutes and this was at 1:30pm on a Sunday afternoon.  Not too bad for a weekend I guess. Once you get inside you place your order at a counter and they give you a pager to come pick it up when ready.  Took about 15 minutes to get the food which was reasonably priced.  I think my husband and I spent $30 and we bought a lot of sides to try them out. I ordered the 1/2 chicken meal and my husband got the veggie burger.  As for the chicken it was tasty and tender.  the sauce is high on vinegar and a bit spicy.  It honestly didn't agree with my guts and i have been fighting with it ever since.  My husband's veggie burger was a disappointment since it had nothing on it except sauce and a onion ring.  The fries were basic french fries, nothing special, the macaroni salad was tasty and they peppery cole slaw was good.  I was not a fan of the baked beans which tasted nothing like the bbq sauce and were really mushy.  Consistency of refried beans.  The onions rings were pretty amazing. Service was great.  People at the front counter were funny and chatty and the guys busing the tables were very eager to help with anything.   All in all it was a good experience but I personally won't get going back.  For us it is not worth the line since the veggie burger was kinda gross and the sauce jacked up my stomach.

This is a must read review!! So I was looking for a good bbq joint to cater my little dinner party of 15 people. I like Phil's so I decided to chose them to cater my function. I was a little questionable choosing them because I will need to pick up the food at 4pm on a Sunday (ultimate peak hours), but I decided to have Phil's anyways. I arrived at Phil's about 5 minutes early and was pretty scared that I would get my food late because it was incredibly busy.. I mean SUPER busy.. But right smack on the dot at 4pm they were ready with the food and it was perfectly packed. I ordered 15 dinners of the beef bone ribs with coleslaw and potatoes which did not end up being as expensive as I thought. It was a very reasonably price! The ribs we VERY neatly packed in two big trays and was put into a bigger Styrofoam holder which kept the meat hot for a very long time!! The coleslaw and potatoes were also neat in their own trays. There was many bowls of extra bbq sauce and had plenty of hand wipes! I was super surprised by how organized everything was.. AND IT WAS ON TIME DESPITE HOW BUSY IT WAS! I do advice you to order a few days in advance like I did. I very much recommend them for catering your parties! And don't get intimidated by how busy they are.. You will be pleasantly surprised. Bravo Phil's, bravo

Phil's has amazing baby back ribs and beefy ribs. The staff here is also really friendly as well. If you come on a friday night or during the weekend, this place tends to get really packed. Don't be surprised if you have to wait in line for over an hour. But, if you go before the lunch rush, before 11:30ish, the line is pretty short. This place is, by far, my favorite place for ribs. I even brought my parents here before as well and they loved it too! The meat is really tender and flavorful. Their portions are pretty big as well!

Phil's has this "MUST HAVE" BBQ restaurant business down to a science. From the  readily visible menus posted all over the waiting area to the signs announcing the wait from that point to the no-nonsense lady directing you to a cashier, you get the feeling they've had plenty of experience with a daily crush of humanity. But alas, the food here did not merit the excitement. I had the quarter ribs with potato salad and macaroni salad and nothing stood out except the sauce. The sauce is excellent- sweet yet not overwhelmingly so. I'd pick up some of it by itself, but would choose a different meat. The sides were extremely disappointing. The potato salad had a skewed ratio of potato-to-dressing--far too much potato and too little flavor in the dressing. Reminded me of red potatoes at Denny's, except Denny's might've had more flavor. Macaroni salad was also unfortunate- my dining compatriot barely had more than a spoonful and I wouldn't want to try it again. Will I give Phil's another shot? Certainly. It's a bit pricey, but the experience was overall a good one and I liked their extensive drink selection in both alcoholic and nonalcoholic options (although I don't know what they were thinking with using a FUSE dispenser for "southern-style sweet tea." It ain't anything close to that). But I'm not convinced it's even the best BBQ in San Diego.

At this point in it's Yelp career, posting a review seems pretty frivolous.  What with nearly 4000 reviews and making Yelp's top 10 of 2011.  But, whatever, I felt the need to post about the best BBQ place I have found to date.  The food was absolutely delicious, however, with it's popularity, acquiring it can be a bit of a chore. I don't recommend trying to eat it there on location.  Chances are you will be in a lengthy line for well over 30 minutes.  When you do finally get in, you will be subjected to a crowded arena filled with lots of noise.  Call ahead and you can walk right past the snaking line and straight up to the counter.  Being BBQ, everything has been cooking for hours upon hours before the thought of BBQ had even crossed your mind, so getting your food even if you order take out right there is exceptionally fast. Phil's BBQ is absolutely delicious, and so are the sides.  Avoid the french fries though, but, nearly everything else was divine.  Hands down the best BBQ restaurant I have come across.  Clearly I'm not alone in this, but, I still highly recommend it.  Just order take out!

It was the BEST BBQ I've ever had!! We went TWICE during our 3 days 2 nights stay in San Diego! Even my old-fashioned-asian parents LOVED the food (I was extremely surprise because they usually only like asian food!!). The line was ALWAYS LONG!!! It was weekdays and rainy and the line was really really long!!! Both times, we waited for about 1 hour to get in!!! Most people like their baby back ribs.. but we actually loved the Beef Ribs better.. and there were LOTS of meat on the ribs!!! I can't wait until my next San Diego visit to go to Phil's.. it's so delicious..I don't mind the long wait!

Phil's is a restaurant in San Diego that everyone needs to try for the experience, have to find out what the hype is about. The customer service is wonderful, but the line is like waiting for a ride at Disneyland only to be satisfied, not astounded, by the end of it all. The chicken is alright, it can definitely be juicier. The beef ribs are dry and chewy, and mostly huge bone - go with the baby back ribs. The baby back ribs are soft and Phil's BBQ sauce is drizzled all over it, but it is also a little dry and not as fall off the bone as many claim. BBQ should be about the meat not just the sauce. Phil's is really just about the sauce and it really isn't for everyone or the best. The sauce is mild, sweet, yet tangy. You don't have a heavy, smoky, spicy BBQ flavor that I personally enjoy. This is like the really toned down version Dad's make for their kids - so I guess it's "for everyone." I think I've had every single side here. The coleslaw, potato salad, fries, corn, and everything else is really very average. I personally like the macaroni salad and baked beans; they're much lighter in flavor and not too rich or sweet like most you'll have. The onion rings are worth a try but expect overly battered, thick onion rings that you will probably get tired of after just a few so split them for sure. Go for the experience, let your own taste buds tell you what's up if you survive the line.

I share the full pork rib dinner with the bf and it is HUGE.... we don't ever leave here hungry that's for sure.  It looks like they don't give enough bbq sauce but it's actually just the right amount so don't bother with ordering an extra side of sauce cuz you really don't need it.  The flavors are intoxicating, they are just amazing ribs...i'm salivating just thinking about it. For our sides, we enjoyed the beans + slaw... oh many, those were some sweet, smokey beans!  I gobbled them up, they were divine.  and the slaw was standard...we contemplated fries but since id had some earlier in the day i opted out.  but they're good and they have this seasoning on the table that go perfect with them.  we also got a full order of onion rings...YUM!!  But even with 4 people chowing, a half order would've been fine...we had way too much food.  we ate it all, not gonna lie, bc them rings were crispy, light, and super tastey...too good to leave one behind! beer selection is good, solid local selection + standard domestic stuff.  full bar is cool too... IF you can make room for dessert... GET A WHOOPIE PIE!!  oh man, i have to finish my meal with this now whenever i'm here, it's SO dang goood!

I know, another five star review for Phil's BBQ.... But...I can't deny the deliciousness of everything here. There are so many reviews here I'll just get straight to the point, the colossal onion rings, pork ribs, and macaroni salad are awesome. Only bad thing about this location is that the lines are always pretty long, the San Marcos location isn't nearly as busy if you are closer to there. All in all, you will truly regret not going to Phil's and I will go as far as saying you are not a San Diego native until you have tried it.

Too much hype. The Good: The potato salad is an EXCELLENT side, they have VERY AFFORDABLE food options, they give you LOTS of fries. Baked beans were sweet, flavorful, and very enjoyable. The Bad: Semi-long line, but bearable. Sauce on the ribs was REALLY tangy and a LITTLE salty. The Ugly: Hype, hype, hype, hype, hype. I wouldn't kill anyone to eat the food here. The Verdict: Don't get me wrong, they have great food here. I DEFINITELY want to come back to try other things and hopefully be impressed by other main dishes.

Went here yesterday to lunch with my coworkers, I went here because two had not been here before even though they have grown up here in San Diego. Phil's claims to be the best BBQ in San Diego, and I believe that it really depends on what you consider BBQ. Personally I don't believe that that Phil's has good long slowly cooked meats in a wooden smoker that imparts particular flavor to said meats; rather I would say that Phil's is a good place to get good ribs. That being said, although the food is not inexpensive the portion sizes dwarf most anywhere else that one can go for lunch, and some of my coworkers complained that they had to much food. Hearing that was more of a praise IMHO. As I had said before this is a Rib place, not a BBQ place, IMHO. I say this because all their meat is slathered in their sauce, thus not allowing the customer to taste the meat. IMHO real BBQ shouldn't need sauce if done properly. Either way, my co-workers enjoyed their first time at Phil's, especially given that there was no long wait for lunch as there normally is for dinner.

After seeing the rave reviews about Phils I had to make it a point to check it out while visiting San Diego for the weekend. I made the mistake of arriving after noon time on a Saturday. The line wrapped all the way around the building pass the sign that said you have a 21 minute from this point. I thought to myself this is insane so I walked passed everyone and went right to the bar where there are seats open. After starting off with a cold Stella beer I ordered the half rack of baby backs with beans and mac salad. I thought the system here was unusual BC you have to pick up your own food when it's ready - there are no waitresses here. The male and female bartender were attentive and you could see they worked their tails off trying to keep up with everyones thirsty needs. I've experienced BBQ in Texas, Alabama and Georgia not to mention places I've forgotten. OK back to the food. My buzzer went off after around 15 minutes and I made my way to the pick up line where there was no wait and I carefully maneuvered my way back to the bar. The portion was generous and my ribs were tender but lacked a smoky flavor which I feel is mandatory for great BBQ. My beans were tasty but nothing spectacular and was a generous portion. The mac salad was flat tasting so I used the Cajun seasoning to add flavor. I tasted the onion rings which were very good - large, firm and not greasy. The fries were soggy and Cole slaw lacked flavor which I also seasoned. The beef rib was tender and meaty tasting but lacked any smoked flavor. Overall my take of Phil's was above average BBQ although I've have had better and I would not wait in line as so many others do.

If you are going to eat there then definitely get the pulled pork...it is amazing and you can definitely taste that it was smoked for quite a while. Although, I was very disappointed with the baby back ribs because it lacks the smokey flavor, it is more on the tangy side and I'm not too fond of that. However, the meat is tender and the people who work there are always happy & pleasant...A BIG PLUS! The sides are mediocre and the baked beans lack umami, coleslaw needs more flavor, and fries should have the option for some type of seasoning. Expect to stand in line for at least 45 minutes during meal times. If you are short on time, call it in and pick it up...much faster that way.  Overall, I would only dine here for pulled pork.

This place should be called Finger Lickin' Phil's cuz, damn... after Phill you will always have to lick each of your fingers! The lines are loud and the dining room is noisy, but thats all part of the experience. The best part about Phil's is that Phil knows how long the lines are going to be so he gives you a full stocked bar! The bartenders were nicely interactive and the manager on staff was an extremely awesome, fungi. He was so down to earth and chill that it felt like we were hanging out on the patio having a few brews with the dudes. Phil's is everything "they" say it is. It was like a blessing in my mouth, MmmmMMmMore...  every time succulent Phil's BBQ slowly dripped onto my taste buds... I felt like I was at Danny K.'s!  From the tasteful cowboy decor in the dinning room, the amazing manager, and the fully stocked bar... Phil's is BY FAR... the best. Ye-haw! Woohoo! As good as it gets! PS. Phil's, I have to tell you a quick story... I was reading over this review and I read the part where I wrote, "blessing"... thinking it may be over the top, but not minding enough to change it... I finished my review and then looked to my right to read previous ones... and I noticed that there are a lot of "religious" phrases or word-ology in the reviews... (ie) choir of angels... So now I've come to the conclusion that Phil's is the guardian angel of BBQ. Cheers!

45 plus minutes to stand in line and wait to get inside this amazing BBQ joint.... It doesn't matter if you have to wait 45 minutes in line to eat BBQ at Phil's!!! *in my The Rock from WWE voice*. Everything about Phil's is worth the wait. Plus, if you're lucky, you can skip the line and seat yourself at the bar if there are seats available. The environment is energetic and the staff is so upbeat and funny. Our waiter was very helpful and hilarious. Great place to enjoy some Sunday and Monday night football. I ordered the BBQ ribs with chickless chicken, a side of baked beans and fries, with a super cold Coor's Light. By far the best reins I've ever had in my life! Thick, juicy, and meat falling off the bone with every bite. The chickless chicken was boneless chicken breast smothered with their famous BBQ sauce and was delicious and filling. The baked beans were perfect and the French fries were bomb because I topped them with creole seasoning. The pricing of food ranged from $10-$18 and the appetizers ranged from $4-$8. Phil even sale his signature BBQ sauce in 29.5 oz bottles for only $6. Overall, I am jealous that he hasn't extended his BBQ chain to Las Vegas. I'll even move to San Diego to enjoy this food for my lunch breaks and occasional dinners. This place will definitely grow on you after your first visit and will make you remember it forever if you can't enjoy it anytime you please as the people of San Diego. I'll definitely make another 6 hr drive for this BBQ.

What can you really say about a place that every local in San Diego knows. I just know this is one of the greatest restaurants in San Diego. Everyone I know has ate here and I haven't heard of a single complaint from anyone I know. Phil's is known to be the best BBQ in the whole San Diego. Yes there are BBQ alternatives but nothing near the landscape of the original Phil's.

Best baby back ribs you will ever have. I would know....3 time "International Rib- Eating-Champion" I may be only a buck-o-five, but I know my ribs. I can't seem to find any place that can compete with Phil's. Here is a tip, when you see the line out the door, cut. Cut and do not pass go, head to the hostess stand and ask if there is room at the bar. If you are hungry enough...you won't mind sitting in the bar and enjoying your meal there.

A lot of people I know have said this place is amazing and they cannot get enough. So one day I came with my brother, family friends, and boyfriend (who has lived somewhere in the South for a while). First of all, the line was too long and customers were being very rude and trying to squeeze through the incoming line (but this review isn't about the customers). Anyways, let me tell you now that the long wait is NOT worth it. When we finally got to the front, I felt rushed to order. It was most of our first times there, we're not regular even if we are native San Diegans. So I ordered the chicken, and my boyfriend got the ribs and I can't remember what everyone else got. The chicken was so dry, and I asked for more sauce over and over and the sauce made it worse. It was too tangy and down right sticky for my taste, not enough of that real "BBQ" sauce taste. I think backyard BBQ chicken from any household is much better. Also, my boyfriend's ribs were insanely dry as well. I was pretty embarrassed because I could tell he was not at all satisfied. Honestly, I could make better ribs than this. He expressed how this BBQ was nothing compared to what good BBQ should taste like. In my opinion, not worth the time and money. I don't really care if this is San Diego and we don't know what amazing BBQ should taste like, but I promise you this is not it. You can't just give credit based on region. A 5-star review should be based on customer service (which, well there was none), the meat (it was DRY, I can't stand dry meat), and the sauce (I personally didn't enjoy it but you may like tangy, sticky sauce). I suggest going to that hole-in-the-wall place Coop's West Texas BBQ if you're looking for some great BBQ.

Okay, disclosure up front: I'm a Texan and like my BBQ to taste a certain way. Phil's was good; however, for me personally it was too "smoky" in the flavor.  I still think it was good bbq and can see why the line goes around the place at times, but I can't say it is the best I've ever had and I wouldn't order it for my 'last meal' but it is still good BBQ.

There's not much to say but juicy, tender, and absolutely DELICIOUS. The meat falls off the bone, and the bbq sauce is tangy and doesn't overshadow the meat! The coleslaw and french fries were just okay -- I like how they had cajun spices available though. I came here at 5:30 and there was only 15 minutes of wait. When I left at 6:30, the line was 45 minutes long, so COME EARLY!!

This BBQ place is one of the best places in California for baby back ribs!!! I took my boyfriend here for the first time a few months ago. He enjoyed it!!! We both ordered the baby back ribs with a side of baked potato. The meat on the baby back ribs just melts in your mouth and the sauce is delicious. We went around 3pm on a Friday, so the line wasn't crazy long yet! Love it!!!

My girlfriend and I drove down to San Diego on the Fourth of July, hoping to sink our teeth into something patriotic. As we approached Phil's BBQ, we spotted a long line of people out the door. At the corner, there was a sign that read the approximate wait time from that spot: 21 minutes and 14 seconds. Ha. We've stood around longer for crappier food, so we dove in without hesitation. My girlfriend and I ended up getting half a chicken, a half slab of baby back ribs, a small potato salad, small coleslaw, and a small order of onion rings. Let me begin by saying that THIS IS WAY TOO MUCH FOOD FOR TWO PEOPLE! We should've just stopped halfway through our meal and taken the rest home like responsible adults, but we were already in the zone, that stomach-says-stop-but-brain-says-keep-eating zone. Anyway, the barbecue chicken was not very impressive. While the flavor was great--smoky, sweet, and tangy with a light kick--this is attributed more to Phil's original barbecue sauce (which is slathered on everything) than anything else. The meat of our chicken was quite bland and the skin, while nicely blackened on one side, was anemic and unappetizingly flabby on the other. We ended up eating what we could and discarding the rest. The side dishes we ordered were decent. The coleslaw had some nice texture, but the potato salad could've been better. Giant chunks of potato almost a cubic inch in size place the emphasis more on "potato" than "salad," which is good or bad depending on user preference. Personally, I prefer it a little less chunky. The onion rings, which come with a side of ranch, were a hit, and were probably our second-favorite thing on the table. The baby back ribs, obviously, were the highlight of our meal. You know that feeling you get when you search through an old pair of jeans and find a five-dollar bill that you didn't even know you lost? Translate that feeling into a taste and you'll have Phil's ribs. Yes, they are that delicious. The pork has this perfect char, not overly done as to dry out the meat, but just enough to seal the essential savory juices inside. I would definitely order this--and only this--whenever I come back again!

SOLID bbq joint w/ a SOLID WAIT! good thing our friends let us cut in line! I felt like I was at Disneyland when i saw the "approximate wait time from this point 21 minutes & 14 seconds" just get in line (which you can see live on their website), order up front, & you will be seated as you are waiting to pick up your food! I shared the 6-7 pork rib order that comes w/ 2 sides w/ my friend! I THINK we would have been fine sharing the 4 rib order because we were STUFFED the bbq isn't amazing, but its fall of the bone tender! i think i would order the ribs dry next time since the sauce is tangier than I prefer! the macaroni salad & coleslaw were mediocre, though the fries reminded me of In N Out. ON TOP of our order we got the "small" onion rings. WELL if that's a small i don't even want to know how big the LARGE is! these were hands down the BEST ONION RINGS IVE  EVER HAD w/ that crispy light batter!!!! P.S. i am loving the reasonable prices!!!

This place is THE landmark of all of San Diego county.  Need I say more? Yes. They also have friendly service and awesome ribs. But you probably know that already. After all, 3200+ positive Yelp reviews can't be wrong. Do you still have doubts? How 'bout this, if you don't like this place I will personally come to your house and let you kick my ass. Now stop reading and go out and get some ribs! Their line isn't going to get any shorter any time soon.

Here's the trick if you want to grub: GO STRAIGHT TO THE BAR AND SEAT YOURSELF! The wait was long but my bf took me by the hand and led me through the bar door and we just took a seat. The server was there to take our order and we just gotta go pick up the grub ourselves. Easy Beezy. Now... that the wait is over, their baby back ribs are in fact one of the most succulent melt-in-your-mouth POWS I've ever experienced. I love it!! Order it with a Mac Salad! DONT ORDER the pulled pork sandwich... it could not measure up to the ribs at all. It was kind of dry and I've definitely had better pulled pork before so just come here for the famous ribs! Get messy ~

My husband wanted to go see what the hype is all about for this joint. Personally I would never care to wait in a long line that wrapped around the parking lot. 2 hrs later we placed our order: 1. half baby back rib dinner w/side of fries & sweet baked beans *rib was moist, fell off bone, fries were like any ordinary fries, beans were good 2. beef rib dinner w/sides potato salad & macaroni salad *rib was moist, fell off bone, both salads had the exact same mayo sauce - nothing special 3. el toro tri tip sandwich *thinly sliced tri tip sandwich was good & tender 4. colossal onion rings *ginormous size fried onions, a little on the greasy side 5. 1/2 chicken *very moist & tender Phil's bbq sauce is a little too tangy for me and it was slightly on the salty side. Overall, it was a good meal. The staff were friendly & attentive. Not worth the 2 hrs wait. I wouldn't wait more than 35 minutes when I return in the future. Way too hyped.The ribs that comes out from my family's grill taste just as good, maybe even better, cause it  falls off the bones & melts in your mouth & our bbq sauce isn't overloaded with vinegar. **TIP, to AVOID the LONG wait, if you have a small group of less than 4 & 21 yrs of age or older, you can walk straight to their bar & order your food there** Learned this after we waited 2 hrs. Another tip - this is not the greatest place to take your child when long waiting is involved. Our 9 yrs old son almost cried from waiting in line so long. It'll be our first & last time we ever make him wait that long for food lol!

You know it's not normal when you're willing to drive 90 minutes just for BBQ. I've been here about 3 times now and it never fails me. Yeah the wait is 40 minutes but the hype is all worth it in the end. I always get my beef ribs (OH MEAT HEAVEN!) with beans, fries or potato salad. I always struggle to finish it and feel nasty by the end but it's all worth it. The workers are very nice and are always willing to help out. I dont know if anyone else does but I like to leave them a little tip for their help. As much as I'd love for it to expand North because nothing says San Diego better than Phil's BBQ.

I tried it for the first time a few days ago and it was ok. I was expecting the best that I have ever had but its ok. The cole slaw was great and the beans tasted better reheated, but it wan't as hyped up as these reviews had me thinking. I am still on the quest for authentic BBQ. But if you like touristy fast BBQ this is your place. The people were really nice and helpful.

Your looking for a quick meal? This ain't the place because the wait is at least 30 minutes! My first impression of the place "HOLY CRAP LOOK AT THAT LINE" I would say its a little overrated and not something I would be willing to wait an hour for.....and yet I do for reasons I do not know -_- Get ready to get your fingers dirrrrty because your ribs will be marinated with intense amounts of bbq sauce! Their baby back ribs are the best! HANDS DOWN! :) I haven't been there in forever but its a good place to go with a big crowd. I hope i'll be able to go before I go back to LA for summer vacation!

Phil's BBQ is the best! I'm not a huge fan of bbq really, but Phil's is SOO GOOD. Like omgah. I usually order the bbq chicken or the ribs, I can't pick a favorite because both are delicious. Love the bbq, love the macaroni salad, love the onion rings! Definitely a must have. The portions are huge, too, so be prepared to get super full! I try not to go here when it's poppin, because the line gets really long and I don't like waiting, haha. So I usually go late, like around 9pm, or early like 4pm to avoid the long line. If you're visiting SD, or live in SD but haven't been to Phil's, GOOO. It's worth it :) I know so many people who don't really like bbq, but they give Phil's the exception. :)

We are still a fan and drove over a hundred miles to eat at Phil's BBq. Unfortunately this time they poured bbq sauce over our baby back ribs and killed the taste. Sorry, but we still ate them and all but not as great as last time. The service also was not as good clearing the tables but maybe they had new staff.

San Diego is famous for surfer dudes, Sea World, my house, and Phil's BBQ!   Waiting in line at Phil's reminds me of waiting in line at Disneyland. The line winds all the way around the restaurant.  In fact, they even employ a motivational guy who is there is answer any questions you may have about the menu, the restaurant, and to convince you that the ridiculous wait is worth it. What I would order here: Entrée: BBQ Short Ribs Appetizer: Onion Rings Small Sides: Macaroni Salad, Potato Salad, Cole Slaw What I would skip: Entrée: BBQ Chicken Small Sides: Fries I was disappointed that our BBQ Short Ribs and Chicken was cold.  Portions were huge so it's definitely good to share.  Dinner for three came out to $36.00 including tax (no tip required here because it is self seating). The wait: If you call in and ask about the wait, it will most likely be an inaccurate estimate.  We arrived at 6:15 PM on a Thursday and was told that the wait would be about 35 minutes.  The actual wait?  A whopping 1 hour and 10 minutes.  They lose.

I love Phil's BBQ.  Started going to Phil's when his ONLY location was in Mission Hills.  Back in the good old days there was a line any time of the day or night.  Nothing has changed.  No matter how many locations and how big the restaurant Phil's will always attract a line.  Nothing ever changes.  Not even Phil.  When I met him back in the 90's he was grateful for every customer.  He still is.   Love you Phil.

Again my theory on places with long lines out the door are usually great places. Our line was out the door for 25 feet. It took only 20 minutes which we were warned may happen so we arrived before we were really hungry.

This place is all around amazing. My boyfriend and I didn't want to sit in traffic one day so we decided to stop off and eat at Phil's BBQ. Even though it was a Wednesday night it was obviously packed, but we still walked straight up to order our food and the lady who took our order was hilarious and was full of great conversation even though we interacted for less than a minute. We couldn't find a table for two, not uncommon so it didn't bother me. The only table we could find in the actual dining room was next to the bathrooms and sinks so we asked someone who worked there by the name of Rafael if we were allowed to sit in the patio dining area (we weren't sure if they were having a large party coming in or something). He told us that we could definitely sit there and with no hesitation scooped our plates up and helped us outside. I felt a little awkward having him carry my dishes since it's not the type of place where they wait on you like that, but it was such a kind gesture to help us. He even brought us extra hand wipes, which are definitely necessary. When it was time for us to get up and get our food Rafael told us to stay seated and brought our food out to us! Again, completely unnecessary, but so kind! He even kept coming back to check on how we were doing and if we needed anything. There are times where I go into actual restaurants with servers who don't give me that type of service! I had the El Toro which is always delicious. Get it with cheese, it just makes the sandwich better. I'm not a fan of onion rings, but the ones at Phil's are so good! All in all, it's amazing food with even better service!

I suggest three things: Come on an empty stomach, make sure your waistband is mostly elastic and don't wear white. Phil's BBQ is by far the best place to get BBQ'd foodgasms. I am not a fan of waiting, but I have already subjected myself, more than once, to waiting for more than 40 mins just for a bite of Phil's meat (laugh all you want, perv but it's true). You'll need a bib to read the rest of my review... I've gotten the Broham, which is delicious pulled pork topped with coleslaw, slammed between a bun and the Rib-less Dinner, which is chunks of pork shoulder smothered in sauce. Both times the meat has been BBQ'd to perfection and is never greasy. Sides I've devoured: (Not all at the same time and shared with the bf) Macaroni Salad: macaroni with a creamy sauce- pretty good Potato Salad: red potato chunks with celery and mayo?- needed salt Corn on the Cob: sweet delicious corn on the cob- amazing Coleslaw: generic coleslaw, not too creamy- pretty good Fries: too well done and tasteless- not recommended The seating can get a lil sticky, but the host is there to regulate and she's not afraid of kicking out people that stake out tables before the rest of their party orders the food. So be warned!! If this review wasn't convincing enough, go down to Phil's BBQ and consider your life changed.

WHY NO PHIL'S IN BAY AREA?!?! Couldn't stop asking this as I was leaving Phil's. EVERYTHING is soooo good here! We had a little bit of many things. The ribs, broham sandwich, fries, onion rings, macaroni salad, and beans. The food came out fast and the service, even though it's self serve, is pretty awesome. They are there to clear everything, get you more sauce, and point out the restrooms to you. I love you Phil's.

Just like the other 3000 reviews, Phil's BBQ is AMAZING.   The onion rings are divine. They are so crispy and so delicious. I absolutely love onion rings and these were probably the best I've ever had. I'm salivating just writing this review. I ordered the half rib order dinner of baby back ribs with a side of fries. I thought 6-7 ribs might not have been enough, but they were more than enough and the fries were good and plenty. I'm pretty everyone tried really hard to finish all their food. Portions are def worth the money. I went for lunch; the line was about a 40 min wait, but also def worth it.

I thought all the BBQ was good, but nothing so amazing it was worth standing in line for however long we did.  One thing I did like was the gigantic beef rib.  Not a lot of BBQ places have that so it was a nice surprise.  This isn't the fall off the bone ribs that most pork ribs are.  They're chewier and take a little more work to eat, but I love them.  The pulled pork sandwich was overflowing with pulled pork, so you'll definitely leave with a full belly. Overall, it's hard to live up to any hype, but I'm glad I got a chance to try this place.

Christina (maybe a manager) and Brad (bartender) were some of the most helpful people I have ever seen in the restaurant industry on a busy night during the holiday season!  Thanks Brad and Christina!! Oh ya-- AND the food was there FAST, was hot and they had a great beer selection. Fantastic experience! We'll definitely be back.

!!!!!!! So yum! I ordered the "Broham Burger" with a side of macaroni salad. The Broham is a burger overfilled with succulent pulled pork drenched in their homemade barbeque sauce. (You can buy a bottle of their sauce, too.) I asked for the coleslaw on the side but it's usually sandwiched inside the burger. The pork was really juicy and tender. The coleslaw wasn't too overwhelmed with mayo either, just the way I like it. The burger is about $7 while the sides are $1.50 for a small serving and ~$3 for a larger size. The "Broham Burger" is definitely a must try item on the menu. It will fill you up.. I could barely finish half! You can't go wrong ordering other stuff from the menu though (i.e. rack of ribs, chicken, veggie burger, etc) because everything is delicious at this joint. Did I mention that their onion rings are massive and are about the size of half of my head? A must-go place if you're visiting San Diego! P.S. They're closed on Mondays.

I just ate here for the first time on a chilly Tuesday night. My boyfriend and I waited in line to order for about 30 minutes, but that was fine considering how long it took us to decide what we wanted. The waiting caused much anticipation; I want my ribs!!!!! Finally we placed our order and were left to scavenge for a seat. The latter is the reason I bumped off a star. I hate having to fight for a place to sit. Lurking by a occupied table that you think may become available is not a fun experience for either party. However, the ribs were amazing! My boyfriend and I ordered beef ribs and baby back. I preferred the beef over the pork but not by much. They both had fantastic flavor and texture. Furthermore, the service was great too! The employees were so nice and accommodating even in the midst of crowds of hungry people. I can't wait to be back in San Diego so I can eat here again!!

This place sells really good ribs and calls it bbq.   Do not go here expecting North Carolina style, Texas style, Kansas City style, or even california style bbq.  It's just ribs smothered in bbq sauce (definitely not memphis style either).  The crowd is thick and diverse.  Everybody loves this place.  Eat at the bar if you have a small party or are in a hurry.  Is this place way overhyped?  At this point I don't even think it matters.  Also, remember that ribs are expensive.

My German friends came here, and we took them here. They loved it!!! We also got the BBQ sauce with the beer guy outside while waiting in line. They have really good customer service. My German friend wanted to buy 4 BBQ sauce, and so the guy wanted to get us a good deal. He called his supervisor and they gave us 2 free gooba dust! Awesome! I marinated ribs for 4th of July using their gooba dust and their BBQ sauce, it was delicious, tastes just like PHILS!!! (without the wait) Everyone at the beach was looking at our grill, smelling the nice BBQ ribs. Germans really loved it. Thanks Phil!

HOT DAMN!!!!!! This is great BBQ!!! Ever since I moved to the area I've been dying to try Phil's. But their perpetual line that wraps around the building has always deterred me! But when the sis and her fam came in for a visit, they suggested we order some Phil's for pick up---per their friends' suggestions. And it was DEE BEST idea ever! We called in our order and were back at home within 20 minutes with bags full of bbq. Although I didn't go inside to pick up the food, the sis said it was extremely efficient---and she's a freaking tough cookie to please! I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the pull pork sammy without any sides. It was GINORMOUS! Easily the size of my head with tons of succulent and flavorful pork piling out of the bun! My sis also ordered the same sammy so we decided to just split one and have the other as leftovers. Between the both of us, one sammy was plenty!!! My only suggestion would be to order more bbq sauce because I prefer my pulled pork sammys to be smothered in sauce. We also had the baby back ribs and bbq chicken that were both a hit. Ribs were tender and chicken was super juicy! Prices are extremely reasonable----especially considering the serving size! This is a MUST try! And if you're not down for standing in lines than do what we did and take out! :)

Best BBQ I've had. It might not be saying much since I've only had BBQ in California, but man this is some finger-lick'n good ribs. It's a shame I ordered the ribs to go, but I'm gonna go there in person soon. Even take out, it was delicious. Opening the Styrofoam container, I came upon a half rack of tender pork ribs drenched in their tangy, smokey, tasty, BBQ sauce. The sides weren't anything special though. Definitely worth it to go to this place. I'm not looking forward to the line though. Get the ribs for sure. I can't imagine them fresh.

The place to go for the best barbecue in San Diego! Meat, meat, glorious meat. We had a ridiculously wonderful experience eating barbecue recommended by both people standing in line and the restaruant staff. Yum! I love this place. We ordered the pork rib dinner and it was pork-tastic! It was cooked to perfection and had all the characteristics of pork ribs you only see on the food network: melt in your mouth tender but not so much that it falls of the bone. The barbecue sauce has just heavenly! We also got the Tri-tip sandwich called El Toro and the pulled pork sandwich called BBQ Broham, Both sandwiches were recommendations from a long term follower who we met while waiting in line. She's was right about the sandwich being a great value!  There was what seemed like a pound of beef layered on top of slaw. It was heaven in a bun! We also got a side of onion rings, baked beans, and macaroni salad upon the recommendation of the cashier. It did not dissapoint! Our experience began as we got out of our car. The smell of barbecue was enticing. As we were seduced into the building, we were shocked to see a line that went out the door around the side of the buliding. It was surprising because we got there at 3:40pm on a Sunday afternoon. It was during a Chargers - Vikings game, no less. Then again, the line wasn't all that suprising given there was over 3,000 Yelp reviews and the place still ranked 4.5 stars. The food must be really good....and it was!!! The line moved rather quickly. Once you get to the counter you place your order and found your own table. We were told that sometimes people hover until they get one. Fortunately, we were able to find a table without any waiting. The servers were also very helpful. There was the person who points you to an available cashier to place your order, then there was the cashier, the bus boys, and the manager. They were all very attentive and friendly. They were also very alert to whether you were a first timer to the restaurant. Rarely do you find a gem of a place where it seems like all the food they serve is really really good. Even, rarer is the place that has staff that seems to be happy to be there and to help you maneuver through the barbecue choices. If you want to have excellent, mouth-watering barbecue, and, a really good dining experience, come to Phil's. You'll be glad you did!

The line was preeeeetty long. Average weekend during winter time and the wait was ~45+ minutes. But it was worth it . Ribs were exactly the way I imagine them in my dreams. Soft, tender, peel right away from the bone without being overcooked. Side of macaroni was delicious. Service was good. Go here and you will have 0 regrets.

What can I say that already hasn't been said about Phil's?  I've visited San Diego on three separate occasions and eaten here four times.  Coming from an island where we don't have that many "good" BBQ restaurants, perhaps I'm not the best person to judge the quality of BBQ food, but all I know is that the food here is delicious, the portions are humongous, and it is quite inexpensive for what you get.  I used to get the Baby Back Ribs/Chicken combo, but the last time I went with just the ribs and it was Fantastic. The other thing besides the food that people mention is the long lines.  The last time I went around 600 and waited for about an hour.  The craziest thing was that we finished our meal around 830ish and the line outside was just as long as it was at 600...and this was a Wednesday night!!!!  I'm not even sure when the best time to eat here is.  I think it's best just to go there knowing it'll take 30 mins to an hour and plan accordingly, or you can call ahead and take it to go, but it just isn't the same as being there. Would I go back? Every time I'm back in town....

Hodad's can hold its own while battleing in its own weight class. Though many skeptics out there think: Rocky's, Canada Steak Burger, and The Neighborhood all got robbed out of the Burger's Championship belt. The competition, pound for pound, dollar for dollar, against Phil's BBQ is a losing battle. Phil's is the reigning champion of San Diego foodies. Unless you are a tree hugging vegetarian...but then you wouldn't be comparing burgers to BBQ, anyways. Phil's, the best place to eat in San Diego.

After all these reviews, need I say more about how awesome Phil's BBQ is. We arrived in SD around 230pm. Perfect time to come because there wasn't a line and I've heard it gets pretty long (wrapped around the building). Got in and ordered, sat, food was ready in 10mins. their fries are soft on the inside, crispy on the out. Yumm! Colesaw is delish, not drenched with mayo. And the Ribs, woooh....so good!! Enjoy!!

This place is pretty good. The down is that the line is ridiculously LONG. My boyfriend and I waited for about 2 hours. It was like waiting in line for splash mountain at Disneyland or something! However, the food paid off. BBQ ribs were BOMB! The meat just slides right off the bone. We ordered BBQ ribs, BBQ chicken which is okay...kinda dry... with 2 sides, baked beans and fries. YUM! oh yeah when youre near the front, you'll see a sign that says "22 mins 14 sec from this point" sign (i think)..LIES. I waited for another 37 mins. But i guess its okay because they had a worker to entertain us.

What can I say that hasn't already been said? Yes the wait is freaking ridiculous but even so, people still line up; a testament to the good food right around the corner, like all the way down, then left then allll the way down, right, then right again into the doors, yeah right there! If the average hour and a half wait doesn't whet your appetite, then the pictures of juicy ribs circulating on the flatscreens near the door will. After surviving your journey in a line rivaling the Star Tours grand opening, you will be greeted by a very friendly host who will direct you to the cashier to order. Food portions do not disappoint and are priced very fairly. The most expensive thing on the menu is $20, so get your grub on! Beef Ribs, Pork Ribs, BBQ Chicken, try them all! The sides are awesome! Potato & Macaroni salads definitely win points. Slaw is a bit on the sweet side, but if you like sweet then that's a good thing. Fries aren't as crunchy as they look, so that was kind of disappointing. The BBQ baked beans definitely saved the day though. All kinds of delicious, and the my fellow passengers had hell to pay on the ride back. Oh yeahhh, can you say bean, beans the magical fruit? Bottom line, bomb BBQ & bomb service. Protip: Come early to avoid long waits. Like early early. Like 3 o'clock early.

I am visiting my friend & the First thing he did was take me to this place. The smell of this place is mouth watering! Okay, so we ordered the baby back ribs (a whole back), Two half of BBQ Chicken, BBQ pulled pork sandwich, got Corn on a cob (large side) so we can feel we are trying to eat our veggies, & a BBQ cheeseburger!Yes we were starving! It was soooo good! I was so in love and in massive food coma. The baby back ribs were perfect! What bones? It slided right off. The chicken wasnt dry at all! Oh & the pork sandwich....OMG...Makes me drool just thinking about it. As for the cheeseburger, I can take it or leave it. Idk Why I got a cheeseburger at a BBQ place. But whenever I see burger on the menu, I gotta have it! There was honestly barely any food left once we attacked it, only one half chicken was left. But we picked on it hours later. It was one of the best BBQ I ever had!

It reminded us of the bbq we would get when we visited in Austin, TX but with superior sauce. The girls split a rack of pork ribs with the sweet baked beans and cole slaw, friend had the pulled pork sandwich and I had the corn on the cob. We all split a tiny order of onion rings. Leading it off having a couple of drinks and our bill came up to just under $40. There was so much food that we struggled to finish and still weren't able to finish. I'm typically skeptical of corn on the cob from restaurants but this was fresh and sweet. The ribs could have made just a little much more flavor, but the pulled pork was nice and smoky. I missed the pineapple bits inside the cole slaw, however it was still tasty, as well as the beans had been a excellent balance of sweet and zesty.

Super long line. At least it gave me time to decide what I wanted because it was one of the hardest decisions I've had to make in a while. Watching the people through the windows devour their food as you're helplessly waiting in line did not help either. I ordered the best of both Beefy Rib with 1/4 chicken and a half rack of Baby Back ribs in addition because I wanted to try everything. The ribs were so good I wasn't able to make it to the chicken. Good amount of BBQ sauce, super tender and juicy meat, and delicious sides. I'd wait an hour just to have these again. Definitely a must-try if you're in the area. If people are waiting outside, the food must be good right?

I've been to Phil's twice.  I have to say, I just don't get it.  A lot of folks rave about this place, but I'm not seeing it.  Portions are good, prices are reasonable, food is good.  There's just nothing that makes me think I'd want to sit through the line for.  I've had better BBQ elsewhere; to me, their sauce is a bit too sweet, I prefer my BBQ sauce more on the smoky side. It's very good, but not great.  Just my $.02

1) the lines are LONG. out the door long. there's even a "starting here wait time is 30 min" sign that gives the whole place a very amusement park touristy attraction feeling to it all. You can call in or order to-go for much faster service, though; we ordered enough food for a family of 9 and got it all in 15 min. 2) pretty slim veggie options. no fish; there is a veggie burger, though. you can get it bbq style w/ an onion ring or with lettuce & tomatoes. 3) the onion rings come in a child's sized shoe box so one box is definitely enough. Also, if you're ordering to go, start eating them in the car because onion rings just have to be eaten hot.

Phil, wherever or whoever the heck you are,  Y U SO GOOD OKAY yesss phils is SUPER overhyped, but what!? its still good :) I got the tri-trip sandwich along with a full rack of babiesssss! alright, beef ribs are bigger and chunkier and all, but gahhh i love babybackribs! they dont overuse and overpile sauce on the ribs, but they give enough so that it stays marinated and covered, without it drying up. the meat is not too chewy. the ribs fall right off from each other clean. the tri tip was awesome. its good. not worth the money, but phils is not too much about getting whats worth the money...no matter what you get at phils, you're bound to overpay. the babybackribs were realllly good. i liked it a lot. OKAY HONESTLY i dont remember too much about the food because i came here a week after taking out my wisdom teeth..it was incredibly difficult to eat, but i still tasted everythaaaang muhauha.

Fall off the bone tender baby-back ribs. The sauce is well-balance, with a rich smokey flavor and a slightly spicy twang to it. Best ribs I've had in Cali, hands down. I wished I lived closer so I could also try their beef ribs. The sides we ordered weren't spectacular. The fries got MUCH better once they soaked up the rib sauce but the mac-salad was just too peppery. Tip: Skip the loooong-line by getting take out; I was in-&-out in 5min with a heaping plate of ribs.

Seriously great place for BBQ. Another awesome find thanks to Yelp! Really sweet prices and huge serving of food. It's like a fast-food style restaurant where you order at the counter and sit down wherever you can find a seat. The lines here can get ridiculously long, but you can always order take-out. It makes the wait much much shorter. We normally get the baby back rib dinner with two sides and a kid's meal (Phil's ticklers) for me. The ticklers are seriously a great value if you're not a big eater. You get 2 huge perfectly breaded onion rings, so good cole slaw and a large mound of fresh cut fries. With the baby back rib tickler, you get 3 bones and with the beefy rib one, you get one bone. Trust me, it may not sound like a lot with only one to three bones of meat, but you will leave satisfied! The slaw and macaroni salad are our favorite sides here. The slaw goes so well with the meat and the macaroni salad has a great punch on its own. Slightly sweet and tangy, so creamy and delicious. We've tried both the beefy and baby back ribs, and I think we both prefer the baby back. Both are good though and fall-off-the-bone tender. I've yet to try the famous Broham (pulled pork) burger but that's definitely next on the list.

Amazing Barbecue! Let me add to the list of commendations for Phil's. I am originally from NY, and have had barbecue in Georgia and Kentucky- neither of which match up to Phil's. Great barbecue, ok fries and gigantic onion rings. Prices aren't phenomenal, but its not super expensive. Store can get crowded- you definitely don't want to eat in, but pickup is fairly quick, and they seem to have a good method. Also, Ask for extra sauce.

"Nothing bad to say about Phil's. I've been coming here since they were on Goldfinch. My favorite is the Broham with a side of onion rings. The chicken is moist and flavorful and the pork ribs are excellent. The bar has made this place even better! Beer and BBQ can't go wrong with that!

All I can say is this place is seriously LEGIT! After running a relay race from Huntington Beach to Coronado Island, I wanted to get my grub (and drink) on like you couldn't even imagine.  I had heard about this place and knew it would satisfy my carnivorous cravings.  How can it not? Phil's, you did not disappoint me in the least.  I ordered the full rib dinner, with cole slaw and beans as well as the tri-tip sandwich.  Told you I was hungry.  The sandwich was a mound of thinly sliced, deliciously smoked tri-tip with just the right amount of BBQ sauce to top it off.  The bun was steamed and oh-so-soft.  The ribs were fall off the bone good, again with the perfect amount of sauce.  Not dry, not drenched ... just perfect.  Even the sides were delectable.  Washed it all down with a couple Yellowtail Pale Ale's and I was a happy camper :) The line was out the door when we got there, but a quick tip ... you can bypass the line, sit at the bar and order your food from the bartender.  They give you one of those little buzzer number thingies when you're food is up at the pick-up window.  GENIUS!

Oh, Phil's. I always leave your place in a food coma, barely able to walk... there is so much to say about this joint, but I'll keep it nice and short. Every time I come here they never fail to please, honestly. Although sometimes there's a long wait, I know the reward is way worth it. I always order the best of both worlds, chicken and ribs. OMG they always give me big big big pieces and I TRY TO FINISH IT.... never happens tho :( My stomach never agrees with me after, pooey. I don't think their prices are too over the top, considering I always get big pieces. The staff is very friendly and willing to accommodate your group always. They carry a pretty good selection of beer and beverages. I would def return.

Reviewer.... #40-- O.O... #4066 What can I say that hasnt already been mentioned 4,065 times? I do drive two hours, 120 miles, across over 100 BBQ restaurants to go to Phil's BBQ. Yes, despite the 1 hour wait, 1.5 hour wait, 2 hour wait, I still continue to stand in line for this BBQ. "WHY?!?!?!?!?" You demand to ask, shaking me back and forth. BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE BEST GOSH DARN HEAVENLY BABY BACK RIBS EVERRRR!!!!!!!! WHAT IN THE WORLD DO THEY DO TO IT?!?! I have no idea. But their baby back ribs are succulent, juicy, and topped with the most flavorful barbecue sauce in the entire state of California. The pricing is JUST right, not too expensive and not too cheap. You can get their dinner combo where you choose the different amount of racks and then you can choose two sides or one large side. You walk up to the cashier, order, pay, take a seat, wait for the ringing machine to vibrate, walk up to the counter, get your plate of heaven, then... DIG IN. Yes, their baby back ribs are delicious but everything else is not as great to be honest. NEVER.... NEVER... come during dinner time... NEVER... NEVER ... come during weekends. Lines are literally always 1-2 hours. I got smart after the first two times and came here on a weekday at 11am. There was still a 30 minute wait, BUT its way better than 1-2 hours. Parking is easy peasy. Never had trouble because they have an entire parking lot for it. Staff is great. They are very welcoming, enthusiastic, and friendly. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_…

I'm from California so a lot of people say I don't know real BBQ, but this stuff is goood! I don't care what other say, this is seriously good food. I've waited anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour in line but it's worth it. Once you order your food it doesn't take long before it is ready to eat.

Best bbq EVER.   Had the pleasure of eating Phil's again this weekend.  The line, as always, is disgusting and long.  But the ribs are worth every second, minute, hour you wait. The meat falls off the bones.  I can literally eat a full rack.  That is what happened last time.  This time, I had to share, so I was nice about it.   Don't skimp out on the sides like corn, slaw, rings, and fries. Word to the wise.  If you don't want to wait in line, call in your order ahead of time.  You'll feel like a million bux bypassing the line and grabbing your order.  However, you cannot eat inside, so google the nearest park and have your self a swell picnic.

This place has exceptional food! If you're looking for some good ol' ribs then this will definitely satisfy your craving. It sure did for my friends and I. We ordered the Baby Back Rib Dinner which included: 12 bones, potato salad, and fries. The ribs are delicious, tender, juicy, and the meat effortlessly falls off the bone. The sides were also great (we loved the potato salad). Last but not least, I strongly believe their popular BBQ sauce is really worth the hype, as it was great paired with everything on our table.. yes, the potato salad too lol. Prices are decent and if you're with a group, even better.  Service was good, which was slightly surprising considering the large volume of people they had to serve. My only gripe is the line you have to endure before getting into the restaurant. Obviously a lengthy wait is anticipated at any popular place, but the food is worth it.

I guess living in South Carolina has made me unable to fully appreciate this place. Wasn't worth the wait, in my opinion. Fries were stale, bbq sauce left something to be desired, the onion rings were just plain gross, and no self-respecting bbq establishment worth its salt leaves corn bread and mac and cheese off the menu. On a positive note, the baby back ribs were great and would've been over the top if the bbq sauce was better.

Going to Phil's BBQ for the first time was like losing my viriginity 14 years ago...I knew it was going to be great, but I didn't know how insanely and wickedly awesome the experience would be. Like that "special solo activity" every young male does regularly before losing the Big "V" and becoming a man for the first time, eating non-Phil's ribs is 2nd class once one has had the truly orgasmic experience of eating Phil's Baby Back Ribs.   THE FOREPLAY: No 30-60min of kissing, feeling and caressing; but there is a 30-60min wait as you and fellow patient customers discuss BBQ and look through the windows jealously watching people slobber on delicious BBQ... THE BLITZ: You finally get to the cashier and place your order, and wait impatiently for your food to arrive, your heart races, you sweat...faster...faster!...FASTER! THE CLIMAX: That 4-5 second moment of ectasy when your brain explodes with euphoria from the first bite into Phil's Baby Back Ribs...AAAAAaaaahhhhhh....MMMMmmmm.... THE CUDDLE: After your first ravenous bites, you slow down, get into a steady tempo, relax, and calmly savor your yummy food.  When you are done, you settle into your fatty food coma...ZZZZzzzz... I'll never order ribs anywhere else...

I'd rather smother myself in honey, lay in the desert and let ants eat me slowly than return to this place.  It's the Southworst of food establishments.  I don't fly Southworst.  Why on earth would you if you could choose a carrier with less stress and better service?  It's the same with restaurants.  Phils = Southworst Airlines.  Seriously. Their policies bring out the absolute worst in humanity.  There are hungry people waiting in a line, trying to jockey for position and sneak in to get tables, holding places for others who have not arrived yet (like standing in line for a Southworst flight - or in line at MacCarran to check your suitcase but everyone is pissed because they are going to miss their flight) or in this case - might not get a table - so they go to drastic measures to get help.  There are intimidating stares, couples yelling at each other, children crying, for what?  It's so loud and intense in there you can't even hear the cashiers mumbling "next in line" and you can't see over the masses to even see if it's your turn. I went through this hell for what?  Some decent pork ribs and nasty greasy beef ribs, some potato salad I could have made at home, beans that taste like they are fresh out of the B&M can, and some chicken, plus you get to sit on a hard bench with loud obnoxious people all around you.  Really people?  Is it worth it?  HELL NO it's not.  Not even a little. The prices are high, the food lousy to mediocre, and the ambience more than horrific.  If they posted staff to monitor the line - one at the back and front of it, and a couple of people to usher you to seating I would think I could bear it and could bump this to about 2 or 3 stars.  Alas, that didn't happen and I won't be back.   If you're thinking - "Wow everyone talks about this place and waits in line for food so it must be good" you're wrong.  It's not.  People convince themselves it's worth it because they had to wait in line to eat.  Plus, Americans can be dumb - give them fatty meat with a sugar glaze and you've got a hit!  I'm going to open a restaurant with some crappy food and design a rediculous ordering and seating system so that people will wait in line and convince themselves my establishment is worth it.  I'll make millions!

Lived up to the ridiculous hype. Having lived in Texas for two years, I was fairly certain I had already had the world's best baby back ribs. I was wrong. The ribs here are spectacular. Throw in some giant onion rings, cole slaw, and the the best macaroni salad to top that off, and you have a glowing 5-star review from yours truly.

Dude... I just don't get it.  I mean, the food is pretty decent-ish, but there is f-ing no way I would stand in line for this place.  I mean, I wouldn't turn it down if someone put it in front of me, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this noise. I dunno man... is BBQ sauce supposed to be sour like that?  Is it supposed to be a color reminiscent of sweet and sour sauce?  Perhaps all this is just a matter of preference though.  I like mines with the taste of whiskey and brown sugar... maybe throw in some molasses or something... maybe you add in some love.  But what the hell does a Vanilla Manila 2nd generation San Diegan know about BBQ anyway?  Not much probably.  But after hearing so much raving over this place for years n' years, I am vely disappoint.  Yes, vely disappoint. Don't get me wrong.. the food is not bad by any means, it's just not really worth my time.  I'd rather go to Chili's.

Phil's needs no introduction. It's so good that I'd drive down to San Diego just to eat at Phil's. My must haves on every visit: I like the tangy, not too sweet sauce on the side. 1. Baby back ribs - nice, juicy and tender with smoky flavor and CHAR   2. Beef ribs - excellent smoky flavor, amazing char on the outer edges and moist and tender when you bite into them 3. Onions rings - perfect texture, not soggy (unless you take it home), crispy 4. Mac salad - great texture,  good consistency, doesn't taste too mayonnaise-y I don't think no other BBQ place in Southern California can beat Phil's. Phil's provides great service, a casual atmosphere, friendly people working behind the back despite the fact they're constantly busy, and tasty food; it's a perfect combination.

Stopped at Phil's on my way back from San Diego on a Saturday night. Luckily I went after the dinner rush and only waited 20 mins in line. After my 20 minute wait they announced that the credit card machines were down and they would only take cash. They directed all the cashless people to the ATM where I had to pay $4 in fees to have enough cash for dinner. I wasn't too happy about that. Neither were the many other parties that didn't carry enough cash. I took off a star for that. As for the food. I gave the Broham sandwich a try after reading some yelp reviews. You definitely get a lot of pork for your money. The sandwich is almost impossible to eat with your hands. The BBQ sauce was delicious but without it, the pork would be too dry to eat. I would say that the sandwich is more quantity than quality. The side of baked beans was good but not much better than a can of Bush's baked beans. The restaurant is clean and service is very good. I would come back and try the ribs next time. I probably wouldn't order the Broham sandwich again though.

"He could tell I was only here for his meat." I walked into Phil's thinking this was going to be an eating experience just like any other.  The room was bright.  There were a lot of other suitors with one thing in mind:  to get their hands on Phil's meat.  The anticipation of gorging on the best of his kind in San Diego was well worth the 20 minute wait.   "Phil" musta suspected that he wouldn't be enough for me, so he sent in a very cute and VERY friendly female sidekick.  She suggested I try to taste some of her Ipa.  That flavor was not to my liking.  So she cleaned up and gnabbed me some Amber to warm me up. Got an o-ring. Like I said, not more than 20 minutes into the foreplay finally came the main event!  As soon as the meat was in my face, I couldn't resist.  Into my mouth it went with such ease, me ripping all the meat off his -- er, its -- bone!  His ribs were firm enough for me to hold onto and quickly devour the sexy plate of goodness. -------- okay ,so i'm no good at writing a trashy porno review.  tried my best though.  gotta work on my euphamsisms. At any rate. Got pretty drunk and visited Phil's with two of my guy friends on a....... Saturday night.  One of the guys said it would be busy as F, but it wasn't at all!  Actually, quite the contrary.  We simply sat at the bar, ordered a beer or two, ordered the baby back ribs with two side orders to share, and left within about 40 minutes.  That's pretty damned awesome quick. I like Phil's. I never liked onion rings before, but theirs were amazing. Not a fan of barbecue pork ribs in the first place...... or eating meat off the bone... but. oh.  my.  goodness. can you say mastecation induced orgasm.

You've heard the saying, "Procrastination is like masterbation..... it's fun until you realize you're fu**ing yourself." Well I was really screwing myself over by hesitating to get in here. On a hung over Sunday I was racking my dome for an orgazmically delicious eating experience close to home. After searching, I was shocked to see that the most reviewed place on Yelp was one that I had never been to. Feeling randy for some Q after reading the feedback, I headed out for a round of hot Phil- atio. I'm now a believer of the hype. It is about as good as the reviews say it is. The bro-ham is a delicious experience that one must certainly try if they are in the Point Loma area. Yeah, the line can be a bit unreasonably to wait through, but you really can't blame them for being busy. Good things are totally worth waiting for, but if you're the antsy type calling ahead is always an option as well. The service is really friendly, and everyone you encounter is wearing a smile with their Phil's uni. I guess it's tough to frown when you get to smell the aromas of this place all day long.   What more is there to really say about this San Diego classic? Over a 1,300 reviewers couldn't be wrong, so don't procrastinate like me. Get in and see for yourself how much this place rules.

This is so good even my vegetarian wife likes to go here! (for the fries and corn-on-the-cob).

You know the roll of paper towels they put on your table to clean yourself up? I didn't use them. I licked off all the sauce. PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY UTENSILS Leave all your etiquette and proper eating habits at the door and enjoy ribs the right way: all over your face and hands. There are sinks behind the pop-dispensing machines which are great for when you are ready to clean yourself up and step outside of Phil's just in case there's a line in the bathroom Phil makes a mean rack of ribs that are so tender and delicious.... and potato salad and macaroni salad and coleslaw and beans everything tastes as good as it looks Catering is quite organized, they equip you with all the necessary utensils and awesome trays that make it easy to feed the masses. The worst part is the long lines but after you order, pay and get seated....and wait for the pager to vibrate harmoniously to inform you that your gluttonous feast is ready, you can't help but look at the surrounding customers enjoying their ribs while you are silently clenching the pager, anxiously waiting for it to ring....it might seem like an eternity, but it isn't. Within fifteen minutes, the order is up, you pick it up at the counter and bring it back to your table and let the inner-neanderthal out and consume your food as barbaric as you can possibly be. and after you have eaten, prepare yourself for the best food coma ever.

"All normal people love meat.  If I went to a barbeque and there was no meat, I would say 'Yo Goober!  Where's the meat!?'.  I'm trying to impress people here Lisa.  You don't win friends with salad." -- Homer was always a very wise man...And yes, the endless line around the building supports the notion that you don't win friends with salad. the people come for the ribs. and the ribs....they are good. You smell the smokey, meaty, tanginess in the air for a good mile surrounding the building. but im not here to talk about ribs. you can read over 1,000 other reviews to hear people's thoughts about ribs. im here to talk about BEANS. ...baked beans, to be exact. i know, im crazy. i get absolutely obsessed with the most random things. and the latest is Phil's BBQ baked beans. i pat myself on the back for selecting that as one of my sides. holy-freaking-BBQ sauce, Phil. what the hell do you do to those beans to make them so sinfully creamy and delicious? yes, creamy...i can't think of another way to explain it. outstanding. any place that puts that much awesomeness into the sides as well as the meat gets my kudos. one note: if doing the "best of both" - i wouldn't recommend getting the chick-less. yeah, i feel a bit stupid. it is LESS that the standard boned chicken...at the same price. and come on now, Phil's represents the most american of attributes: Gluttony and Bang for your Buck. I come to phil's to eat way more than I should and get my monies worth. Oh and though comical to me that the whole experience felt like I was at disneyland...down to the huge hanging sign as you shuffle through the line (which boasts over 1,000 5 Star reviews on yelp), I gotta give it to them....they do a damn good job with efficiency. And I was amazed at the friendly and personable experience with the order taker. Felt like I was at trader Joes. They don't rush you and even enjoy a bit of chit chat. so maybe with most people, Phil wins their love with meat. but for Heather, you won it with baked beans. mmmm.

Inching their way to the 2,000 review mark I am not going to say much other than Phil's has some GOOD Q! Good enough to wait in their usual long @ss line that wraps around the building? YES! *note: I lucked out as when Lucy Y. and I arrived @ 12:30ish on a Tuesday there was only 5 people in front of us. Good enough if you are craving Q and it is early enough in the day that you would make the drive from El Lay to SD for dinner? YES! I had the half rack of Pork Ribs (6-7 bones) with a side of Cole Slaw, Sweet Baked Beans and I added a large side of Mac Salad. Ribs were charred and spiced to finger lickin-lip smackin perfection. My mouth was on fire but I like that. Great sweet sauce that was not overly thick. I am a sucker for sides at BBQ joints and all the sides were awesome. My only knock is that they did not have Sweet Tea but good ol Hi-C Fruit Punch did the trick for this BBQ meal. Who's hungry? I am! Phil's?? I'll drive! That Prius of mine gets good gas mileage.

Um, WTF?! How is it that I haven't already reviewed this place?! WHAAAAAT?! Probably because I had a major food coma from their amazing ribs, onion rings, fries, and just knocked the fuck out afterwards. I fell head over heels in love with Phil's about a year ago, and seriously, it was love at first bite, baby! :D Just pure L-O-V-E. I don't think I have to say much about this place since 1,000+ already said it all, with nearly a perfect 5 stars, this place is just pure heaven! Phil's is always, always, ALWAYS hella crowded with lines wrapped around the restaurant, then again, are you surprise? 'Cause I'm not, with all the hype, of course this place wins the title of "most popular". Food is FUCKING DELICIOUS! Their full rack of ribs is so tender and juicy, omg, I'm talking about "fall-off-the-bone" GOODNESS (well said, Chuck F.) And omg, their ginormous onion rings, so goood. Although, I only eat the batter, because I don't like onions, haha, I know, wtf right? What a waste, but whatever, the batter is sooo tasty and crunchy, just the way I like it! I love Phil's and I will gladly drive 85+ miles from OC just to eat here again in a heart beat!

I hail from the Zion of BBQ, and I'm quite proud of that. To say that I'm a snob when it  comes to BBQ would be like saying Tiger Woods is a little promiscuous. Keeping that in mind, I think Phil's melted my brain with all it's insanely delicious food. The ribs were nearly fall-off-the-bone tender and saturated with the BEST (yes, seriously) BEST sauce I've had west of the Mississippi, possibly the best I've had outside of my beloved Mason-Dixon line. Cole slaw, onion rings, and fries are among the best I've had ANYWHERE as well. Speaking from extensive personal experience I can say that Phil's would hang close if not surpass many of the BBQ places in any of the many Southern Meccas of bar-be-que, even cities like Memphis and Atlanta. As far as food goes Phil's is far beyond anything I expected to find in San Diego when it comes to authentic BBQ. Impressed is an understatement. I can most certainly see where all the hype surrounding this place comes from. My only regret is that I didn't try it before now. Of course I've got to put my two cents in concerning beer fare. Phil's offers San Diego's finest on tap in the "Beer-be-que". They also offer bottles of other great San Diego breweries in the unlikely event they don't have anything you want on tap. I have two minor, minor problems: 1. No cornbread. 2. No REAL sweet tea. This doesn't change my opinion of Phil's at all. Other than that, this is as perfect BBQ as you can get in San Diego and stacks up well with anything I've had period.

I always get the baby back ribs! They're soo good!! Even though the wait takes awhile, I'm always more than willing if BBQ Ribs await me at the end. The format of the restaurant is lining up to order at a counter, find a seat somewhere, then pick up your order when it is ready. I've never really had a problem with finding a seat since the food does take about 5-10 minutes, where there's BOUND to be a table leaving within that time frame. Other things I recommend: -onion rings (crunchy & golden!) -BBQ Broham (pulled pork sandwich).. DELISH!!

Phil is getting Review #2000 from me :D!!! Sigh, yup, I became another fallen, stuffed victim of this infamous SD food landmark.  What took me so long to finally eat here is that I'm absolutely NOT a fan of BBQ, particularly its sauce, EXCEPT on chicken. Guess what, after roughly 30 min. in line & approximately 5 minutes post-order-by-counter, my dinner consisted of the $6.45 Chick Tickler, while my BFF got the $6.45 Baby Back Tickler. 1st I'll mention the included sides.  The coleslaw was crisp & so held together, i.e., you're not eating such icky, runny cabbage w/ watery mayo (which is, ewww, really yucky to me..).  The fries had the similar texture (by bite, not appearance) as In-N-Out's version: not that crunchy & not mushy.  Finally, the onion rings may be too rich for me, but the crunch sound was harmonic to my ears. Now on w/ my pickiness on BBQ & chicken.  At 1st the portions of my chicken seemed smaller, but my BFF advised that it'll fill me up.  True ^_^.  But what I was disappointed with was the poultry's dryness.  To make up for that, I requested the helpful & attentive server for more BBQ sauce, which now brought up this... I had (HAD) no heart for BBQ sauce, okay?  Well, Phil's BBQ changed my attitude towards it.  I was quite afraid & cautious that it'll be more sweet than tangy--which is why I dislike BBQ sauce in general.  Not this one; the sauce on my chicken was exceptionally tangy & I didn't notice any sweetness.  What's even better news, somewhat, was that I sampled my BFF's off-the-bone, moist baby back rib, & that made me LOVE baby back ribs--well, only Phil's version.  And I mentioned "somewhat" b/c it means that I'll have to painstakingly be patient to go back to hometown SD some other time & head to Phil's BBQ & face the viciously inevitable long line. Despite giving 2.5 stars exclusively on the chicken, the rest of my delicious & affordable meal; the exquisitely organized, welcoming & attentive staff; and the overall value easily condemned that setback to 4.5 stars.  Phil, thanks for giving me an appreciative outlook on BBQ sauce, & I'm definitely looking forward to order your Baby Back Ribs when I'm down in SD!!

All I can say about this place is ... BEST BBQ in San Diego, hands down. This place gets really crowded and the lines do get long, so be prepared. If you have a larger party, a hostess will usually help accommodate you but if your party is smaller, you have to find your own table.

My second visit here and was disappointed the line to get in was probably double from my last visit. The disappointment was mainly because I got a good whiff of smokey deliciousness just as I opened the car door. Oh well,  price you pay for a popular place with good food. The line moved along at a steady pace and the wait was perfect for conversation with the group I met with and catch up on the goings-on of the day. Had a chance to learn a few things during the conversation too. I discovered that 200 bucks for True Religion jeans is a great bargain. I've not ever seen these jeans first hand so I'm assuming they are sewn with real gold thread or use platinum buttons. I've spent 200 bucks for jeans... total for the 10+ pair I own, that is. Also discovered Phil's webcam. As my FB friends can attest, my web presence is lacking, so more photos or video is great! We ordered several items so our group could share and sample. Everything was great. Crispy rings, tasty chicken, but the beef ribs... wow. Tough to share a rib so I had one all to myself. And, I'm a cave man and ate with my hands. No one had any interest in sharing once I got my mitts on it. I felt guilty for .001 seconds...Too bad... more for me!!! Juicy and flavorful. That's a must-have for my future visits.

2.5 STARS Let me put things into perspective, 4.5 star rating @ 1000 reviews?? That means this bbq must like melt in your mouth?!? You guys are taking crazy pills. It didn't and wait there's less. Actually, Phil's is ok but it feels like the McDonalds of BBQ. You order up at the counter and your food comes out in less than 5 minutes. Seriously, fast food bbq is an oxymoron. The look and atmosphere is all TGI Fridays/Bennigans with some blues music playing in the background. Gimme some more flair! Ordered up their 4 pork rib and 1/4 chicken combo platter ($12) with the mac salad and baked beans side. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The ribs tasted like they were baked and were just OK - no pink smoke ring and no smoky flavor. The meat flavor was overpowered by the bbq sauce. The bbq sauce had a taste similar to that brand, "Bulls-eye". Unfortunately, the chicken was super dry. I took a bite or two and the rest was inedible. Might as well ate my sock. Also had a taste of their beef ribs. They had a charred flavor and were tender but weren't juicy and also overpowered by the sauce. I'd have to say pork ribs over the beef but I'd rather find a different bbq joint. http://static.px.yelp.co… No mac and cheese, no cornbread? Are you kidding me? C'mon even Friday's has those...

Get the Broham!!!  It's the most amazing pork shoulder sandwich (and Southern style with cole slaw on the bottom).  Amazingly delicious, and less than $7. ...but you have to get the onion rings, too.

I just received the most inspiring Blackberry message (BBM) right now.   After months and months of convincing my dear friend Irene S. that Phil's cooks up THE BEST RIBS on this universe, she finally gave them a try, proclaimed her love for Phil's and deemed me a hero for this god-send of a recommendation over BBM, all the while leaving my mouth watering and my stomach pining for Phil's BBQ pork ribs.  And all I can do right now is Yelp about how fabulous Phil's is -- woe is me. While I loved the intimate and local hidden gem feel of Phil's old Goldfinch location, this new location is much bigger and well-staffed, meaning the service is efficient and I get to dig into my ribs much faster.  This location does, however, make Phil's seem a bit commercialized, like a TGI Friday's or Chili's, but I still love it to death. The meat is guaranteed to fall off the bones and the tangy BBQ sauce is guaranteed to make you want to lick your plate clean.  This is a Diane P.-approved and Irene S.-confirmed San Diego recommendation you do not want to miss out on.

I've gone here over 20+ times and I always leave incredibly satisfied. Make sure you join the mailing list (with your real birthday) and get a front-of-the-line pass on your birthday week (this is SO useful). Also, avoid crazy busy hours. It sucks waiting sometimes...but it's always worth the wait. I also think the Rib Ticklers are such a DEAL (I believe it's like 6.95?). The 3-4 pork ribs are CHUNKY too. You get a good portion of food and make sure you ask for the fries on a different plate to get more! you NEVER disappoint me, Phils. Thanks for existing in SD.

I really appreciate all you people who stand in that looooong line.  It makes it easier for those of us who like to call in our order on our cell phones (sometimes from the car on the way over, sometimes from the back of the line, if we need to peruse the menu).  Once the order's placed we walk right up to the front and pay, and our food comes out pretty quickly. Sure, we have to enjoy our ribs and onion rings in the comfort of our own homes, with craft beers from our own refrigerators--missing out on the soothing din of college students and young families--but it's a small price to pay for streamlining what can be an arduous process.   Oh, and that's what you should order: Ribs and onion rings.  With sides of ranch.  Delish.  And if you can't understand how "Rib-less Dinner" = rib meat without bones, I don't think those sweet kids behind the registers can help you.

I bookmarked Phil's BBQ a while back and couldn't wait for Comic-Con weekend to take the family there while we were in San Diego.  We decided to go to dinner early and arrived at Phil's around 4:50 pm.....I'm glad we did.  When we arrived, there was nobody in line and we were able to walk right up and place an order. I ordered the Baby Back Ribs & Chick-less (boneless, skinless white meat chicken) combo with Fries and Potato Salad.  The Better Half ordered a Broham (Pulled Pork) Sandwich with a side of Slaw, and the kiddo ordered a 1/2 Chicken Dinner (All White) with a side of Beans and Mac Salad.  Based on the recommendation of the cashier, I also ordered Onion Rings for the table.  I went to the bar and bought a bottle of wine for Wifey and me. While we were waiting, I noticed that the line had grew considerably since we arrived.  It went out the door, down the front of the building and around the corner down the side of the building!  I was amazed!  I also couldn't wait to try what everyone was willing to wait for. Wifey & I enjoyed the wine while we waited.  After about 15 to 20 minutes our order was up.  I anxiously brought the food to the table and we dug in.....all I can say is that the first bite into the Baby Back Ribs was HEAVENLY!  Wow, easily some of the best Ribs I've ever had.  I gave a Rib to the Better Half & Kiddo to try and she gave me a piece of the Broham.  They both loved the Ribs and wished they ordered it.  However, they were very satisfied with their entrees.  I thought the Broham was very tasty too.  The Chick-less Chicken was pretty good....but I should have ordered a full rack of Baby Backs. As far as the sides....the Potato Salad kicked ass, the Beans, Fries, and Slaw were OK....not great.  The Onion Rings were very good....thick, beer-battered rings.....very delish.  I'm glad I ordered the bottle of Cabernet as it went well with all this meat. We finished everything!  Also, we saved room for to try the dessert....Moon Pie....which is basically a soft Oreo Cookie-like concoction which is slightly larger than a hockey puck.  We split one and it was awesome too! The service was also very good here.  When our food arrived an employee offered to take a picture of us and the food.....very cool.  He also made recommendations on what to try next time and asked us if we were satisfied with our food. Overall, it was an awesome experience from beginning to end. Will I return?  Do you even need to ask!?

I agree with what that one guy said. Phil's BBQ is, "OFF THE MOTHAF**KIN HOOK!" Best place hands-down to get a large plate of meat-fall-off-the-bone-ribs with a large heaping serving of macaroni salad, and a beer. This place is so hardcore for barbeque, they even have a trough-sized sink for washing off your bbq-blessed face and extremities. The only drawback: the lines are FREAKISHLY Disneyland-In-The-Summertime-Six-Flags-Wait-for-­Hours LONG. Can you blame them? It's freaking worth it!

I think with all the hype I was expecting a little more.... But it was still pretty good. Baby back ribs were good and tender, but the meat was more smokey and charred rather than juicy, greasy, flaky & drippy. Not that it should be, different folks different strokes, but that's how I like mine. However, I bumped them to 4 stars for: Macaroni Salad: BOMB, not what I expected. Small, al dente pasta and not too creamy. Fries: Mounds of them for a small side Onion Rings: Great airy batter and thick onions Beef Ribs: BIG PROPS. Beef ribs are different, the texture is tougher and the flavor more robust so they're not for everyone but I love em, and Phil's does an awesome job on them. Suuuuper tender, perfect chew, not overpowering flavors. Beans and Cole Slaw though a bit of a let down.

I can't miss a trip to Phil's BBQ when I'm in San Diego!  I met up with my cousin for dinner during my most recent trip.  The line was extremely long, however since he got there early, he was able to save me 15 minutes of the wait time.  =)   The total wait time was approximately 45 minutes and we finally got to the front of the line and to the counter.   My cousin ordered the Half Baby Back Rib Dinner with sweet baked beans and fresh cut fries.  My friend and I shared a Full Baby Back Rib Dinner with Steamed Veggies and a large order of colossal onion rings.   The Baby Back ribs were so tender that the meat just came off the bone.  The Onion Rings were crunchy and were fried to perfection with a golden color and not overly battered.  The Steamed Veggies were a mix of broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, carrot and squash.  I felt a little better since I had something healthy on my plate.   Again, I must say that the prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food that you get.   The staff were very attentive by coming to our table and offering wet naps at the end of our meal.   I'll be back when I'm in town!

Best meaty, tender ribs, it's just awesome!  It's definitely a must try.  The ribs were my favorite.  It's a fun place to chow down with friends and family.  Although the beans were too sweet for me, everything else was great.    You can pick up your order once your beeper buzzes. Our server was attentive.  He picked up our order for us and all the utensils too.  He came by twice to see if we liked the BBQ.  We tipped well for his excellent service.  We will come back on our next mini vacation in SD .

This is more for the people who only eat chicken rather than ribs but you're stuck going with your friends anyways. Outdoors: There is always a freaking long line at anytime of the day. It sucks, but I guess it's a good strategy for the the restaurant to keep everyone on point. Minus one for the long line, but I do like the fact that they've hung up Indoors: Always crowded which is a bit irritating, but it does add to the food's personality. I would much rather pick up food than have to wait in line for an hour. It is a good hangout place though if you do have the patience. Food: I actually don't eat ribs, but I do eat chicken. Their Chick Tickler is pretty bomb. The sauce that they slather on top is quite tasty. The fries are alright unless you put a bunch of seasoning. The onion rings are delicious and very crispy. There's nothing worse than a soggy onion ring :-/. I personally don't think the coleslaw or potato salad are anything wonderful, but to each his own. Price: Like I said, I don't eat ribs so I'm not sure how much theyre supposed to cost, but the food I have eaten wasn't very pricey. About 7 bucks for a filling meal.

At first I didn't understand the line wrapping around the building, but after trying Phil's it is all clear.  Get the ribs.  I'm telling you GET THE RIBS.  I tried to be healthy and get chicken, which was tasty too, but my brilliant husband got the ribs.  I ate half his plate.  The meat melts off the bones.  The sauce is spicy and sweet.  Just get the ribs.

My second attempt to check this place out was a success! We got here at 3 in the afternoon on a Sunday and the line was still long but it was moving. Right as we pulled into the parking lot I made a dash to the end of the line. Good timing because a handful of people followed right behind me. This restaurant isn't your typical waiter service type, the line we stood in is to order your food. After they'll hand you a pager when your food is ready. We didn't have a problem finding a table after we ordered. There are signs saying you can't save seats before you put in your order. We ordered a full rack of baby back ribs with steamed veggies, one beef rib sampler, and a beefy rib tickler comes with one beef rib, fries, coleslaw, and two onion rings. When I got paged the manager took back my order of the beefy rib sampler saying it didn't have enough meat on it. I waited a couple minutes and when I got the new order they added another beef rib on the house! Now that's awesome service and I didn't even complain about the wait or anything. The beef ribs were full of flavor and very tender. I liked that the bbq had a slight kick to it but it was a little too tangy for me. I wish I ordered the sauce on the side. The baby back ribs were good too, our batch wasn't really "fall off the bone" tender but I enjoyed them. If I had to pick I liked the beef ribs better. The onion rings were good but kind of oily. The french fries were nothing special and a little soggy because the rib was right on top of it. I did like the coleslaw a lot and usually I don't care for it. This time I actually finished it. Next time I'm in San Diego I'll phone in my order, get the El Toro, and take it back to LA with me. As Seen On TV: Man v. Food - Travel Channel

I waited in line for over an hour. the line was so dreadful, my friend and I just had to treat ourselves with beer from the beer stand. what better way to kill time. I got the Best of Both Worlds: Babyback Ribs with boneless chicken. Ribs tasted like ribs, chicken was very tender and juicy. The bbq sauce didn't stand out to me at all. it tasted like Honey Bbq to me. The fries were fresh, Macaroni salad was bomb. I got a small side of Ceasar salad.. that shit was pretty big so it filled me up that I barely touched my ribs. *Very fast service, pay and seat yourself type of restaurant. I really don't know whats the hype all about though? I think it's probably because the ribs are inexpensive here compared to most rib joints and they are very generous with their portions. One plate could easily feed 2 people. Or maybe it's just me, i think all ribs taste the same. I wouldn't come back here again.

Many of you thought the line at businesses such as Blue Bottle Coffee, Saigon Sandwiches and Bakesale Betty were long. You should see the "super-long" line at this place. Line:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… These people are waiting for a table and many of the parties have like 2 or more people. Luckily, I was by myself and the lady, working there arranging the tables, told me that the bar was empty and I can be seated immediately. "Hey, it's not bad dining solo after all".   At the somewhat empty bar, I placed my order with the attentive bartender; I ordered the "Beefy Rib" meal and an iced cold glass of Budweiser. For $13.95, I get three humongous Beef Ribs and two sides, in which I took Red Potato Salad and Red Beans and Rice. The beef rib was so tender that the spicy meat falls right of the large thick bone. The Barbecue sauce was seasoned very well. My Red Potato Salad had some chunky pieces with a tangy sauce. All this meal with a refreshing iced cold glass of Bud for $4.00, makes my dinner complete. My meal: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… My beer: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Of course at all BBQ place .i.e. Phil's, you'll get messy and need a lot of napkins. Nonetheless I also like the sink close by near the bar to wash up after your meal.   Credit cards are accepted, but I paid my meal with cash. This Barbecue place is one of the hottest businesses in San Diego, and a must go when you're down there.

We use to like Phil's but lately, the services is way too slow and not worth it. There are other good restaurants in the area. On Friday we attempted to try it again. We stood under the porch for over an hour. We did not move a single step at one point for almost 1/2 an hour on Friday 4/13. It was too ridiculous and in no way worth the wait. They only had 3 registers open (we could see through the windows) so the line was literally at a stand still forever because one cashier was busy helping to go customers, which only left two cashiers to help everyone else. They had so many open tables. Literally, in the corner by the window there were three open tables together (2 booths and the table next to the booths) as well as other open tables all over the restaurant. It made no sense to have such slow service early evening on a Friday, other than to say, bad,bad service. When we arrived, we started out by the purchase photos camera on their porch and an hour later we had hardly moved. We finally made our way to the location where the photos come out and that is when everything just stopped and we stood there forever, until I finally said, this is ridiculous. Everyone in front of us was complaining and some wanted to leave but they had a group that could not make up their mind what to do.   We finally left after about an hour and 20 minutes to go enjoy a very delicious steak in PB, with no long line to deal with. I was so glad we left. Maybe move to a bigger location, open another location in a near by community or open more registers. I don't know what the solution is but what I do know is this place is not worth that kind of a long wait, especially when the line is short. Again, it had nothing to do with the line being long, it was way too slow, due to poor service. Sorry, your  food is not worth that long of a wait so you get one star from me.

Thank goodness I didn't give up barbecue for Lent. I can go 40 days without Grey Goose. Maybe not so much the succulent goodness. Could you imagine 40 days in the desert without barbecue? What if you were all in the desert like a honey badger all walking around eating snakes and bugs and then you rounded a cactus and there in front of you was a Phil's? What then? Honey badger dilemma, methinks. I had never been to Phil's. My sweetest Yelp friends swore by it. I bookmarked. Then, today, as I was in SD, I ventured. Holy cow. As I've said in similar spaces, I fancy myself an aficionado. Not an expert per se of the smoky flesh and sweet sauces. Just a mighty big fan. Phil's stuff is crazy good. At lunch today I had: a beef rib a babies rib a tri-tip sammy macaroni salad beans sweet tea I'm a fat you know what right now. The ribs from the babies back were my favorite. I like kids a lot more right now than I used to. The sammy was my second favorite, sauce so sweet and hot, most perfect bun ever. Beef rib third best, but still better than any I'd ever et before. The joint is popular - I arrived 15 minutes before the 11AM opening time and the line was already 20 deep. But the staff are efficient and the crowd eager so who cares if you get closer to them than you'd otherwise like. There were small children in line at the start, but I never saw them leave. Hmm. Maybe I ate them. Thank you then, those of you who made the yummy children. Keep em coming.

Game Freakin' Over! Phil's is some great freakin' barbeque.  Seriously, this stuff is finger lickin' good.   Lookin' at the meat drippin' off the juicy, soft, tender ribs can drive you to insanity.  Why insanity?  The wait is at least 45 minutes whenever I come here!  Doesn't matter what time, if they are open, there's a wait.  I only come here when I'm starving or craving some ribs.  I wish I was a diligent planner and could come here an hour in advance of my planned hungriness, but that isn't happenin' anytime soon. I'm surprised that others like the new location better.  It's larger and more accommodating, but loses it's charm in the process.   I can only give it 4.45 stars though.  Other than the ribs, I can't find much else to rave about.  Everything else on its own merit would be a 3 star affair. Bammmm Suckaaa! 50th Review.

There's only two ways to eat at Phil's: 1. Calling ahead and picking up your order to go. 2. Sitting at the bar. Our hero would rather not wait half an hour or more in line during peak times to sit down at a table and sup on the finest BBQ in San Diego.  If you simply must eat in, come with no more than 1 or 2 other people and sit together at the bar.  You can order food from the bartenders and enjoy some beer or sangria while waiting for your food. It's funny how the sinks near the washrooms are used more often by people trying to wash BBQ sauce from their hand than people who just went to the washroom.  Rolls of paper towel on each table and at the bar are a godsend as well because there's no better way to eat ribs and sandwiches than with your hands. If you can avoid the horribly long line and you haven't had Phil's yet, it's a must try for BBQ in San Diego. PROS: - Pretty much the best BBQ in San Diego, with spectacular ribs and a killer pulled pork sandwich. CONS: - Lines out the wazoo.  Don't be a sucker waiting in line for a table here. - The sides are pretty average and there's definite room for improvement in the salads and baked potatoes.

Whenever my boyfriend and I travel down here from L.A. we always make sure to pig out and overeat because who knows when we'll be here again? Although the line always looks so long, it moves pretty fast.  We arrived around 1 PM on a Saturday and we only had to wait about 15 minutes.  And if you're one of those fidgety folks who hate waiting in line, they have a makeshift bar halfway up the line so you can have a beer while you wait. This time we got a full rack of the beefy ribs, the BBQ Broham (pulled pork sandwich), sweet baked beans, and macaroni salad.  Amazing!!  It's like they put crack in their BBQ sauce -- it's so sweet, tangy, savory, and just a little bit spicy.  I can't get enough of it!  Good thing the beefy ribs were soaked in it!  The beefy ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and simply scrumptious.  The pulled pork sandwich was even more tender and was a bit tangier than the ribs.  I vaguely remember ordering BBQ chicken here the last time we came and I was not as impressed. As for the sides, the sweet baked beans were exactly how it sounds.  It perfectly complemented the tangy BBQ.  The macaroni salad was forgettable (sorry!) but provided a necessary carb component. I love that they have Fresca at the soda fountain.  If I didn't want to completely gorge myself out on BBQ I would have taken advantage of their bar as well.  During one visit I had a few beers at the bar and it completely derailed my food coma plans so I don't do that anymore.

The obligatory review of Phil's BBQ: Phil's BBQ is simply irresistible. Since my first dining experience at Phil's BBQ's Mission Hills location, this has been one of my favorite restaurants in San Diego. For the past couple years, I have come to Phil's almost religiously. Trips to Phil's average once every two weeks or so; and at times weekly. Lines at the door around dinnertime, especially on weekends, are perhaps the longest for any restaurant in San Diego. For this reason, I usually just call in and place an order for pick up. The usual: Broham (pulled pork sandwich) with extra BBQ sauce and cole slaw on the side. The break-from-the-usual usual: Half rack of baby back ribs with extra BBQ sauce and a small order of fries. The feeling-like-a-Broham-but-also-want-fries usual (or what I like to refer to as the "Broham-asada fries"): Broham with extra BBQ sauce and cole slaw on the side and a small order of fries. Throw the buns away. Dump the pulled pork, extra BBQ sauce, and cole slaw on top of the fries. A Phil's version of carne asada fries. Delicious. Phil's menu items I avoid: Rib-less dinner: Looked like dog food, tasted far inferior to the regular baby back ribs.   Beefy ribs: These things are too huge for me - one of the bones looked like it could have been from a dinosaur. Slight gripe regarding beer: When this location first opened, Widmer was the hef most commonly offered. Now it is Windansea Wheat from Karl Strauss. Although the support for local brew is commendable, I prefer Widmer out of these two. Side notes: Their website features a BBQ Cam where you can see the line outside the front door in 'real-time.' This is one of the only restaurants I've seen that has a sign on the side of the building that advises of the approximate wait time at that point in the line (see photo); similar to a roller coaster line at a theme park.

FML!!!!! Motherfucking Phil is off the motherfucking HOOK! I used to live in SD and didn't even come here once.  Isn't that odd when you live somewhere and don't go to some place and only when you visit do you actually try it out... maybe I was broke - prolly was though since I was living in SD from 1-16.  Anyhoo.. Just order any and fucking everything!  Shoot you've been in line that long anyway... have a feast bigger that King Arthur's table of knights...  I'm serious!  Trust me, I'm eating ribs DRY, yeah I said it - DRY, sucking the bone marrow out type of shit...  Fucking 2,000+ reviews....  these aren't trolls hyping up a joint anymore, it's some serious people making serious reviews.... FML!!!!!  I'm craving some Phil's SON!

Anyone who knows what real BBQ is will not give Phil's anything more than 1 star... If you do, you're being generous, back home Phil's is on par with Dickey's BBQ (A Cr@p BBQ chain)... Listen if you're from California, I don't blame you (Especially in San Diego, which has no good BBQ, with the exception of the few small catering companies up in North County and all those guys rock, maybe Phil's can borrow a cue), as you may not know any better (but please head to LA or NorCal for some good Q). But if you are from outside of California and hail from a BBQ state (Texas, the Carolina's, Kansas/Missouri or any where in dirty south), please do not eat here, it will only lead you to a dinner/lunch full of complaining & excessive b!tching... I've been in the BBQ business for quite some time and Phil's is terrible.

Not sure where to start! Lines are long, so anytime you show up, expect to wait. Not a problem though, I knew to expect that. What I didn't expect was the place being packed like a sardine can. Not a lot of room to move around, horrible to maneuver a small/compact stroller and rude people in a rush to get their to go orders out the door. I would hate to see the chaos if there was an emergency evacuation. Now the food. I ordered the brisket sandwich, a side order of fries and the pork ribs/ boneless chicken plate with steamed veggies and sauce on the side. -The brisket was an odd shade of red. Not smoke ring red, but something artificial. Most people have sauce on their sandwich, so maybe they don't notice. Looks like the brisket was soaked in some kind of color/flavor solution. The smokey flavor I expect from brisket was sadly missing. The meat was shaved thin and tender, but it didn't have that meaty, smokey flavor I enjoy in a good brisket. -The chicken was really difficult to cut with the knives they provided. It was rubbery! It didn't have much flavor and I couldn't stomach the texture and spit it out. -The veggies on the side were supposed to be steamed, hardly. I wouldn't even call them blanched. The broccoli and cauliflower were tough and the carrots were just as bad. Zucchini and yellow squash were decent, not too crunchy, but not soggy either. -The fries were soggy and needed to be heavily doused with malt vinegar to make them edible by my kids. -The pork ribs were the only redeeming part of the whole meal. They were tender, fall off the bone and flavorful. With sauce on the side, I was able to control the amount of tang I wanted. And yes their sauce is TANGY! It would be great if they had bottles of extra sauce on the tables though. While in line, the humane society was doing a March promo with a dog they have at the center. The dog was gentle and they even asked for pictures of my friends son and the dog. Even if I wasn't impressed with the food, I was impressed with the passion Phil has for man's best friend and I enjoyed seeing that first hand. I'll be willing to go back and give Phil's a second chance, but I'm not hopeful.

It was my second visit here with Phil's. It was a late evening on a Friday and wifey was having a craving for some BBQ food! Where else should we go? We allowed our stomachs to guide us here again. For locals, the best time to come here to avoid the lines is very late. We strolled right in and anticipated on what to try this time around. I went for the pork ribs and 1/4 chicken combo with french fries and macaroni salad. Wifey went for the short ribs, but I knew she would be biting off my plate. In addition, we couldn't resist not going with the onion rings. The buttermilk here is to die for. I'd swear if I was Michael Jackson and the doctor ran out of "milk of amnesia", then allow Dr. Phil here to inject with with that buttermilk. Hmmmmmmmmm... Our service was excellent. Due to the fact there wasn't that many people around they were even super nice and answered our questions. We enjoyed the late night dinner and shared among our plates back and forth. Just about when we were finishing up, one of the managers started passing out pulled pork samples. However this wasn't no sample. It was a plate of freshly cooked pork. Hot and steamy, we elected to take it home with us. One of the employees asked if we needed TO GO containers. Please, we appreciate it. He commented that it was his idea to pass off these freebies of food since it breaks his heart on the amount of food that is wasted in the evening. The fat: To avoid the rush, come here after the rush! The skinny: Hang around in the wee hours...you may leave home with another snack!

GOTTA TRY THIS ONE if you're in San Diego. THE END. Does this place really need a 2,226th review? Probably not. With a 4.5 average rating, how can 2000+ people be wrong? Ryan M. highly recommended this place, so I made it my mission to try it.  My initial impression was that Ryan must be crazy. I've never seen so many people waiting to eat at a restaurant. Lucky for us, we called in our order. We called in our order at 5:00pm on a Saturday. The guy told us our order would take 45 minutes, and that we would probably have to wait about 20 minutes once we got there.  That was sort of annoying at first...because I think they don't even bother to put your order together until you show up, even if they know what you want. We got there at 5:30pm and over 100 of the above mentioned 2000 people were waiting in the line which wrapped around the restaurant when we got there.  I couldn't even find a parking space so I dropped off my husband and went to the grocery store to buy the drinks. Half an hour later we returned and he was still in the take-out line!! Yes, don't get in the wrong line!! There is the line to eat in the restaurant (which can be over 2 hours long), and then there is the other line to pick up your phone orders (which was about 30 minutes for us). Normally in my regular life, I would NEVER wait in a line that long for anything.  But I was on vacation and I had my best friends in my rental mini-van to entertain the kids and we were having a good time driving down the 5, searching for VONS etc...while we waited for our food. This place has a web-cam so you can see how long the line is before you drive down there...there are signs like at Disneyland that say http://www.yelp.com/biz_… so you know how much longer you have to wait.... We ordered: 2 Full Racks of Ribs which were the softest, juiciest, fall-off-the bone ribs that I've ever eaten, here's a borrowed picture: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… all smothered in Phil's famous BBQ sauce (which can be purchased in the restaurant or at Costco in San Diego, btw). http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 1 Half Chicken plate which was surprisingly moist and juicy. Most BBQ places tend to make the chicken too dry, or they burn the outside. Phil's chicken was just perfect. Here's another borrowed picture: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 2 Broham sandwiches, which are pulled pork and coleslaw sandwiches. You can't really eat them with your hands, those suckers are waaaayyyy too big. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Our sides were: baked beans, corn on the cob, and fries.  The baked beans are a definite WINNER. The fries I could do without next time. Double up on the beans!! I didn't bother to take any pictures because we were too busy eating. Thanks Ryan, you are not crazy after all. BEST BBQ place EVER.

This is probably the best bbq joint in California. When in San Diego I would definitely come here to check this place out. I rented a car for 5 hrs just to drive here to try it. Again, Diane P's "must" when in San Diego. Why only 4 stars? That's because I have actually had better. When you are making food for the masses it is tough to be great. It's sorta like eating at a nice wedding banquet in a very nice hotel. It's good but it's never going to be great. It's just the way it is. Don't get me wrong.......this is still a great restaurant. We ordered two full racks of baby back ribs and 1 full order of the beef ribs. Corn on the cob, macaroni salad, cole slaw, french fries, 4 drinks for a total price of 79.00. Not bad. The corn and macaroni salad were awesome. The fries were ok and the ribs were borderline being perfect. I cannot stress how important it is if you want great ribs, you have to go to reno's best of the west rib cook off on labor day at the Nugget Hotel's parking lot. Thanks for the tip Diane P.

I can't believe I have not reviewed this place yet!  Well, obviously, they have the best BBQ here.  The ribs are amazing and so are the fries and cole slaw.  I usually dislike cole slaw at most places because it's just dripping with mayo or whatever it is they put in cole slaw, but the slaw at Phil's has flavor and texture.   Just recently I have reverted back to my mainly vegetarian lifestyle due to a 10 day cleanse that had left me uninterested in the flavor of meat.  So when I went back to Phil's this last time, I pondered what I should order.  I decided to go with the veggie burger.  OMG!!  It was amazing!!  It comes with an onion ring, cheese, gardenburger patty, and of course their famous BBQ sauce.  I could not have asked for a better burger.  So if you are a vegetarian and all your friends decide to go to Phil's, don't fret, they got something tasty there for you too!!

This place lives up to its hype. One thing for sure is the line. However, I'll tell you a secret. Order via phone or head over to the "take-out" line and your order will be finished in 10-15 minutes. Then take your "to-go" ribs and find a place nearby to sit and enjoy nature. Your stomach is happy and most importantly you save time (which equals money). For a party of 3 we ordered 2 full slabs of baby back ribs and a small order of onion rings. Each full order comes with 2 small sides or 1 large side. We opted for 1 large french fry order, 1 small potato salad, and 1 small macaroni salad. Ribs: The ribs are fall off the bone and very tender. Full of flavor and I can tell the ribs were well cared for. However, I was disappointed the with the sauce. The sauce is kind of on the spicer side and doesn't have that molasses taste to it. I prefer the sauce at Lucille's. Onion rings: EXTRA crispy and were all battered with perfection. None of that soggy stuff. French fries: also very crispy. The french fries are nicely deep-fried and also contain some of the potato skins. Not as well seasoned with salt like McDonald's so adding some salt may make it more flavorful (just not too much, watch out for hypertension). Sides: Potato salad was nice and cold. Potato wedges neatly cut and were not overcooked to the point of being mushy. The macaroni salad wasn't anything special but it had less mayo than the ones from L&L Hawaiian BBQ, so that's good. Overall, a must visit for anyone visiting San Diego and is craving some BBQ. It may not be the best I've had but it certainly is close. The best BBQ I can have would be of Phil's ribs with Lucille's BBQ sauce with Phil's french fries and Lucille's biscuits with apple butter. Regardless, Phil's I'm glad I have met you even if it's been 3 years since I heard about you. I may not frequent you much but I will always think of you. I'll try my best so that others will also appreciate your presence.

It's about time I update and add a star for Phil's. Why? Because for some strange reason, it's addicting. Maybe it's the Sangria, or the great service at the bar. It might even be the fact that it's really three meals so I don't have to cook for two days post-visit. But whatever it is, I keep going back and I didn't think I would. Phil's I did you wrong. I'm still not going to say this is the best BBQ ever, because in my opinion, it's not. It's a pretty good option for San Diego. Plus, it's closer to my house than any of the other BBQ joints, and I love the sangria. Please don't get rid of that.

This place gets 5 stars for HOSPITALITY!   So many other big restaurants could learn from this restaurant on how to treat your customers and make a popular place as efficient and friendly as possible for a pleasant dining experience.  Especially for large groups! Yeah, the line is long, but the sign that tells you how long it will take to be seated is fairly accurate.  I noticed everything about this place was really clean.  Before we even got inside, someone asked us how big our group was and started to reserve a table for us in advance. And as we got to the front of the line and in the door, the greeter helped group us and send us to the cashier to give our order. The food is very good.  Just NOT 5 star good... I honestly think it was because I came away with the sauce tasting overly vinegary.  The price was right.  I got the half chicken and half ribs, I think that was the best value meal.  The sides were good too, beans and potato salad, although I would have liked some bits of meat in the beans.  Even the meat was well cooked.  But just cant say it was the one of the best for BBQ with that dry, vinegar after taste I had.   I'd still come back because they really do their best to satisfy.

Came here at 11 am and waited in line for a bit . My friends and I ordered a full rack of ribs , half a chicken,and 2 large sides ( macaroni salad and french fries). All this for 32 dollars what is there not to like?!!!! The rack of ribs were delicious, very moist and well seasoned and dressed in bbq sauce. The chicken breast was sort of dry, but it got better when you started to eat the other parts of the chicken like the drumstick, wings, and etc. It was also well dressed in  the bbq sauce. As for the the sides, french fries were normal and the macaroni salad was gooooodddddddd! Not too heavily dressed with mayo. Overall the food was really good. Service: Waited in line for about 2-3 mins and the cashier took my order. This place is a do it yourself type of place so there really is not much to comment on. However, the waiter did frequently come by to take away empty plates and etc. Final Verdict: I now understand why this place receives such high ratings. The food is amazing, one of the best bbq restaurants I have tried. Furthermore, if I lived in the SD area I would come here more often. It will definitely be worth the wait and if I am in the area I will be coming back for more !

I'm not mad at Phil - whoever he is. ...The deal here is the tang in the sauce. The sauce is tangy to the 15th power. It's on some Tony Roma's ish. The baby back ribs I had were fully cooked and then quick fire-grilled I'm guessing. They slather on the sauce and the next thing you know ol Phil's a millionaire! Go here.

3 1/2 stars! I've been here twice.  I know I ordered the Baby Back Rib Tickler my first time, which had three ribs but I don't have a good recollection of my experience. All I know was I wasn't that impressed. Nothing special really stood out for me. Maybe cause the place was really overhyped for me. I came back a second time a few weeks ago and ordered Baby Back Rib & Chickless Dinner. It included 4 ribs and a few chunks of boneless chicken. The baby back rib was really really tender. The meat kind of just slid off, which I loved! However, I thought they went a little overboard on the BBQ sauce. It was to heavy and overwhelming for me. The chunks of chicken weren't that great either. It was a little dry. I had a side of Macaroni Salad and Fresh Cut Fries. Loved the Macaroni Salad!!! Fresh Cut Fries were good too and portion was huge!! I also had a chance to try the Onion Rings. Yum! Tasted just like Funions!! Oh and I tried a bit of the Beefy Rib, but I don't recommend it. It's not as tender as the Baby Back. I'd come back again but I'd probably just order Baby Back Ribs this time.

Wow. I was super disappointed when my Thai place was closed for dinner on a Tuesday (wtf, right?) during my visit to San Diego. My friends asked if I liked BBQ and, having had and loved REAL BBQ, I was super skeptical. But WHOAH, BUDDY! Phil's is just delicious, culinary categories and bahbekew snobitude aside. It's good, just really really good. The pulled pork sandwich is the way to go (share it, even!!) but I definitely enjoyed the ribs/chickless combo as well. The fries, slaw, and tater salad were all awesome. Top it off with a nice IPA and you are in food coma HEAVEN.

I'm not a big BBQ fan but I was dragged to this place by my boss and co-workers.  I had the half chicken and steamed veggies and they were nothing to get all hot and bothered over.  My chicken was pretty dry even though it was drowning in BBQ sauce and my veggies were inconsistant.  My broccoli was a little too crisp and the squash was mush.  I didn't hate my meal but I didn't love it either.  I guess what I'm saying is I just don't get the hype. I'm giving it 3 stars because my co-workers seemed to enjoy their meals including the poor guy who had to eat vegetarian because of lent.

Grade A+ categories: * Baby back ribs - tender, delicious (but too much sauce and not the best) * Fries (In-N-Out style) * Coleslaw - fresh & crunchy just the way it should be * Reasonably priced (The two of us ate well for $25, excluding beer) Grade C categories: * Bar is separated from the dining room. You must order from two places if you want food and beer * You can order food and beer at the bar * Onion rings saturated in oil * Service - don't expect a greeting or "thank you" except from the excellent busser staff (bartenders and cashiers aren't helpful) Grade F (for failure) categories: * All white meat chicken was very dry. Be sure to have water or beer ready because you might choke on the dry chicken. Better yet, don't order it. * The wait is not worth it; come back once the crowd disperses (not worth waiting 30+ min for Phil's)

Call me crazy, but I waited almost 2 stomach-growling hours this past weekend for Phil's BBQ, and I'm already craving it again. I'm no BBQ expert but I've tried BBQ all over SoCal, and I know what I like. The 5-star rating is mainly for their heavenly fall-off-the bone baby back ribs. I have dreams about their ribs on a weekly basis. I'm a huge fan of them, and I've had it both with and without the sauce slathered. Ultimately, it's much better with the sauce on the SIDE. I think their BBQ sauce overpowers the taste of their ribs. Make no mistake, they put a LOT of it on your rack of baby back ribs. Even though I love their sauce, too much of the tangy flavor may overwhelm the meat and natural juices. With the ribs "dry," you can taste the tender meat, charred edges, and that oh-so-smoky flavor. They serve the BBQ sauce in a plastic container, so you can just dip a rib in there. It would be great if they had a squeeze bottle, for optimum BBQ squirting coverage. Of course it's not "true" Texas or Memphis BBQ -- they don't have cornbread, sausage, or brisket -- so it's really naive to even compare. In those states, BBQ is their livelihood. For hundreds of years, they breathe BBQ 24-7, all day and night. This is SoCal. Bottom line, good BBQ is hard to come by, no matter where you're located or where you're from. Combine good BBQ with friendly service and great prices, I'll keep coming back. Even if the approximate wait time is always longer than 21 minutes and 14 seconds. I can't wait until they open in San Marcos. Less time driving, and more time eating.

3rd time lucky. Visit 1- THAT line. Forget it. Red Lobster is OK and right next door Visit 2- Closed.....Why? Throwing money away they are, With these big lines, open 24/7 and make hay while the sun shines Visit 3- Got there before 5, but STILL had to wait. I mentioned all this to a guy I met at Golf who ad been here before. "Is it worth it?" I eagerly asked him. "Not really" he said. So, was he right? In my opinion...Yes he was. It was good tasty food, but not worth waiting an hour for in the cold, not worth 3 trips, not worth waiting my own tables, and not worth the prices. To expand. This isn't a restaurant. It is a fast food place. You order your food at the register, you collect it yourself, you get your own drinks, make your own doggy bag. There are staff managing the process, to stop fights over tables I expect, and very much needed they are. That's it. At least you don't have to leave tips. For ribs and fries; it is expensive. it was $17+tax +drink+sides. That is a lot for fast food. So, if I was hungry and passing I might go in, but experience tells me I would also have to be prepared to wait for quite a long time. So I doubt I would be back. I bet Phil doesn't care though. He has got them waiting around the block to get in his place, so good luck to him.

How have I not written a review about this place?! As all SD-ers (and friends of SD-ers will tell you), this place hits the spot! I literally crave Phil's every week, and I gotta tell you, I didn't particularly like BBQ until after Phil's. Even my native Texas friend thought the BBQ here was on point! If you've never been there, I suggest you go and experience Phil's BBQ. Make sure that you get there before 5pm though, or you will incur the wrath that is the Phil's BBQ long line. I ALWAYS order the same thing at Phil's: -Best of Both Worlds (1/2 chicken & 1/2 Baby Back Ribs. BBQ sauce on the side) w/ fries and macaroni salad sides. I love the BBQ sauce here because it's got a tangy kick to it instead of all sweet. -Sometimes if I'm feeling especially bad, I'll get the onion rings (which are the best onion rings I've ever tasted! They are HUGE and don't do that thing where the entire onion comes out with one bite). Other note worthy things to order: -pulled pork sandwich -potato salad -everything (haha) The people there must get paid hella $$$ because they are all so friendly! Imagine working in a restaurant that is busy all the freaking time and still having a smile on your face. One time I even got free ice cream here =) So, what are you waiting for? Do you really need to read the other 1,870 reviews for you to decide to go?! Just GOOOOO. (Unless it's a Monday, because they are closed!)

Can you give a place 6 stars?  I came back into town for a conference in October and on the plane ride out of town I remarked to my friend that I was sad to be leaving Phil's.  She clarified, "do you mean sad to be leaving San Diego?"  And I said, "well, I guess so but mostly I'm sad that I will be so far away from Phil's BBQ."  I meant it.  She laughed. 3 friends and I went on Saturday night to visit Phil's new stomping grounds.  The new location on Sports Arena doesn't offer some of the same charm that the one on Goldfinch in Mission Hills did...but it does offer way more room for cooking staff and customers.  Which all equates less waiting time!!!  And although I had waited many times before 1.5 hours for some ribs I'm happy to not have repeated that experience again. Now there is *no excuse* for San Diegans not to visit Phil's at least once a week (well, maybe those vegetarians out there but you will have to PM me so that I can more fully evaluate your claim). That night at dinner, we were served DELICIOUS B-B-Q.  The four of us were able to share fall-off-the-bone-tender beef ribs, pork ribs, and grilled chicken, with large sides of onion rings and steamed veggies, and sodas all around, for under $50 and with only a 20 minute wait. I got a little teary when our food was ready.   My only complaint was that the large side of veggies were actually quite small. Other than that the experience was top notch.  We had food to spare and I'm happy to report that Phil's beef ribs make for an excellent, next-day breakfast!

Woo hoo! As good as it gets! Honestly, this place means BUSINESS when it comes to BBQ.. you can literally see it wrapped around the building as you pull up, but don't let the daunting line scare you away. It moves by rather quick, and before you know it, you'll have BBQ heaven on a plate in front of you! I'll keep this short and simple: the 1400+ reviews with 4.5 rating is spot on. Every meat we tried was ridiculously smokey, tender, and piping hot BBQ perfection. They don't fill you up here with bread, because it's unnecessary! The sides were clearly house made, some standing out over others (ONION RINGS, potato salad, macaroni salad) and even their whoopie pies are made fresh. The pricing here is also extremely reasonable considering the amazing quality.. screw paying $25 for a full rack of mediocre ribs (ahem, Lucille's). I'd rather use the difference in price to make the drive down here for real BBQ instead. My favorites: Baby back ribs (completely falls off the bone), BEST beef ribs I've tried (extremely meaty and delicious), and pulled pork (which I'm not usually fond of but is SO good here). The chicken is also great, but the intense smokiness and flavor from the other meats kind of outshines it. My only minor complaint: they slater on the sauce like no other here, so I'd ask for light sauce next time because it's only supposed to enhance the flavor, not drown it out. Although, did I mention they have a million different drink choices for you to choose from as well?! Literally any drink you want is available here. Oh.. and the staff, despite the madhouse they work in, are EXTREMELY friendly and hospitable! They were happily offering a helping hand to anyone with a sincere smile on their face, but not to the point where it was a bother. We had a worker help pack up our leftovers and clear our plates, and you could tell he truly cared about our first time experience there.. It's rare to feel such warmth and welcomeness inside such a crowded dining environment. Since it is self seating, you don't feel compelled to tip.. but I think these guys really deserve it, so we happily tipped 20% of our check which gets split, but in all honesty, all the workers truly deserve it. Phil's is one reason why I'm sooooo glad I'm a carnivore. haha! and it's a MUST on my list any and every time I make it down to SD as it should be for you too!

hello yumlicious, its like Dave's famous bbq here in the Bay Area (which I heard was coming to San Jose soon!) There's no doubt that this place is happening, there's hardly any parking and I came during the busiest time of night (prime dinner hour) and had to wait in line outside. The line wrapped around the side of the building all the way to the back. The line moved decently but it was by no means fast. However, the end result is worth it, you walk up to a counter and order what you want. You should definitely take a good look at the menu in advance to make sure you're ready to order and know exactly what you want. The ribs are ABSOLICIOUS and a must order. Their BBQ sauce is extremely flavorful, and I love the spice! I would recommend the full rack meal if you can share it with someone because it's definitely worth it, but their chicken is also not bad and the brisket is YUM. (or maybe it wasn't brisket, I can't identify meats sometimes, I just know its downright good!) Tips for this place would be to get there early or call in to order to go. Eating in means after you order you have to try to stake a table somewhere, which can also be a pain when it is busy (and it's almost always busy).

Once is too much.  Never again!   I am late in writing this review, but I guess it'll be like the titanic in ghostbusters 2 - better late than never. When I first moved to SD a few years ago, I asked where I could get some good BBQ.  Everyone I talked to said to go to Phil's.  One day at lunch I took to trip down there and had lunch.  The food was ok and I would have gone back, but what did me in was right after my meal.   I went to the bathroom to wash my hands as they were all sticky.  Getting your hands dirty is required anytime you eat BBQ.  So I was at the sink washing my hands and there was an employee in there pissing at the urinal.  As I was washing up, he finished up, zipped up, and walked out.  I stood there dumbfounded.  Don't we have laws that require employees to wash their hands?  I mean this guy just got done handling his equipment and now he is going to handle someones food.   I don't know,,,maybe he used a sink elsewhere because I was at the sink in the bathroom, but damn from a customers point of view, he is one sick puppie.  All I can say is that I was in the bathroom for a minute tops and by the time I left he was back at the counter taking orders.   Not a good first impression and never again will I ever eat from Phil's.

I do my hungry hooligan dance while waiting in the massive line here.  It helps me stay calm in preparation for the ultra messy, foodgasmic feast that is to come.  Make sure you come here with people you are comfortable with so you can act a beast with your food. 40 min later, we ordered the Beef Ribs dinner with coleslaw and fries, and the Baby Back Ribs & Chickless dinner with coleslaw and fries.  Total was ~$28. My personal rankings: 1.  Beef ribs - Huge bones with hunks of tender meat melting off smothered in a sweet, tangy bbq sauce.  My fave!!  5/5 2.  Baby Back ribs - Smaller and less flavorful than the beef ribs, but still bomb dot com in my book.  4/5 3.  Boneless chicken breast pieces - Tastes just like how it sounds.  It's chicken in bbq sauce.  The "healthy" option.  3/5 Get your wet naps ready for some scrumptious finger lickin' fun!!  I love you Phil!!

Less than 2 weeks later, a repeat visit from this West LA resident?  Oh yeah! A group of 17 Yelpers came from Northern CA, West Los Angeles, the South Bay, and San Diego to meet for Q on this Labor Day Sunday.  New friends were made, Pub Cakes were shared, and lots O Q was had! The wait was a shorter-feeling 50 minutes, and Phil's dude Steve even passed out frozen Otter Pops to the line.  Which was nice, considering how HOT it was in the sun!  When he saw that our group wore our Yelpers' name tags, he made sure that a table for our group was ready once we made it through the front door. Once we got to the cashiers, Heidi expertly took our order, handed us our pager, and in 10-15-ish minutes we were bringing our trays of food to the table: Me: Beef Rib Dinner w/coleslaw and potato salad ($13.95) - 3 GIANT, saucy, beefy ribs with red potato salad and coleslaw.  AMAZING!  The meat was charred in all the right places and perfectly fatty.  These beef ribs are still my fave here! Steven L: El Toro (tri tip sammich), no bun ($6.95) and 1/2 slab Baby Back Ribs, meat only ($10.95) - talk about a meat lover's paradise!  A PILE of tender, smoked-pink, saucy tri tip, and a huge half slab of perfectly cooked pork ribs.  YUM! Dessert: Whoopie Pie ($3.00) - a giant, fat chocolate whoopie pie with marshmallow cream filling - so big, everyone at the table who had tummy space after their Q got to try a bite!  Chocolatey and moist cakey, this was an AWESOME sweet ending to the meal! For all this food and a couple of bottomless drinks, I'd say that $42 and change was a DEAL.  We've got leftovers and happily filled bellies, and awesome memories of BBQ on Labor Day! Thanks again Phil's!!!!  We'll love you long time - heeeeheeee!!!

Filthy Phill's BBQ...!! Have been goin to the Goldfinch location for quite sometime now...and I just had a chance to check out the new Sports Arena location..This is what I think.. The place is like quadruple the size of the previous location with tons of flat screens mounted on the walls!  There's a dozen cash registers now compared to only 1 at the other location...BIG PLUS!...but even with the more registers, there still seems to be a long line that wraps itself around the building! Crazy!  Wait time for your food is no longer 45 min to an hour..more like 20-25min..which is a huge improvement (less wait+good food=happy customers)..Finding a table can still get a little tricky even with the larger dining area and outdoor seating, but who cares.. Anyways...The ribs are still on point, especially the beef (brontosaurus size) ones...also, ya gotta have the sweet baked beans with the donut-sized onion rings..they both compliment the meat very well..I never had the chicken at either location, but thats what my wife gets most of the time and she says there the best!   Unlike the Goldfinch location...The Sports Arena location has a separate bar area with flat screens everywhere as well which is awesome and a great addition! Pro's:  - Same great taste and food selection!            - Great location; huge dining area            - A bar area to get drunk at            - Less wait (compared to other location)            - More places to park Con's:  - Still a wait...even with more registers, but not too bad..             - Not next door to my place.. FOB Rating:  da ribs ar burry ten der...dey mehlt in mai mouts..

Earning every star Phil's is definitely a gem in SoCal.  Yes I will have to agree with some reviews that it doesn't trump southern BBQ but as a stand alone estate especially in California,  Phil's is amazing! The service is above and beyond but of course the food is the cream of the crop.  My only note to others is the sauce can be a bit tangy for some so choose wisely.

If a friend from out of town is visiting, I ALWAYS bring them to Phil's BBQ. This place is simply too awesome. If you haven't been here before, it's a must have experience! If you are new to Phil's, this is what I recommend: -Best of Both Combo - Baby Back Ribs and Chick-less. This should give you the general idea of what Phil's has to offer. The ribs are amazing - the meat comes off the bones! The sauce is alright - I've had better from Kansas City - but it does the trick. -Sides: I guess this depends on what you like. I usually like potatoes as a filler - so I recommend the fries/potato salad/etc. PROS: 1) Amazing food. 2) Smart bathroom - mostly everything is automatic. Ribs can be messy. 3) With the expansion and move to Sports Arena, they now have beer. CONS: 1) Lines - It's usually out the door, because of the design. I hope this review helps.

Phil's BBQ is spectacular whether you live in Texas, Memphis, North Carolina, Kansas City, or any other location that snobbishly puts forth the notion that BBQ is a purely regional cuisine.  While it is true that I have had better BBQ is many of the aforementioned places, I have also had plenty worse BBQ in all of those locations as well.  So I'm going to give Phil's a relatively healthy 4 star rating.   Let's get to the important part of the review.  Phil's serves impressively large BBQ beef ribs.  While I will readily note that this is not a common order from me (I prefer pork ribs), I did find that the enormous ribs at Phil's were suprisingly tender and flavorful.  The sides at Phil's, however, could use some work.  None of our sides necessarily stood out as either good or bad, but part of that was due to our surprise at finding good BBQ close to the California beach.   If you are looking for something somewhat different on your next trip to San Diego, you might want to stop by this local institution that clearly has gained an appreciable amount of notoriety (970 Yelp reviews and counting!).

Okay, maybe i don't rate it as high as other Yelpers. . . We went here on a day off for me. So we were able to get in line before they opened and we were still at least 10 peeps back. But as soon as they opened, the line moved quickly. We met the greeter and she is cooly cool. It was our first time, so ...we wanted to get a good taste. The cashier was attentive in getting our order. All good, got our pager for when our food is ready and we went to get a booth. In hardly any time, the food was ready. We picked: Full rack baby back ribs. Sauce on the side for me. I judge my bbq without the sauce to see where the seasoning is at. Great flavor. Tasty seasoning. Pork ribs cooked to perfection. Nicely charred on the outside and tender on the inside. Dipped some on the side, sauce was pretty good too, even for a non-sauce guy like myself. The sides I got were: potato salad - nice flavor without the over-powering taste of Dill. Also got baked beans - very tasty stuff, not too sweet. Boo got the El Toro - Tri tip sandwich smothered in the house bbq sauce. It was also tasty and the bread was delicious. The onion rings and fries were huge for a small order. Both, crispy and, well, what can we say...fried goodness! The staff is friendly. Taking your dirty plates and making sure all is cool with you. Place got packed fast. We can see that line kept on getting longer. We were so glad we finally got to experience this bbq place that people have been talking about. One thing I do wish they had was rib tips or burnt ends. You get a 3.75 stars for the tasty ribs. But for the sides selection is a 3. No burnt ends, rib tips or short ribs either? Wow. 2 in my book. Maybe they would have some if I asked one of the staff. Next time, Phil's...next time.

Definite 5 STAR! Man those ribs are delicious!  Hands down the best ribs I've had in town....the portions are huge, it may look like just bones at first, but once you take that first bite, wow, there is plenty of meat to fill that tummy up, LOL!  Its more denser in good ole' flesh than you think! I brought a couple friends here and they were idiots and got burgers instead of the ribs because they had bad experiences with bad ribs here in town, so I let them try a piece and they were amazed at how it tasted and how much meat there was on the bones. Its cool how you just seat yourself and order like a fast-food place.  They will give you a pager device that will flash and ring once your food is ready to go.  Soft drinks are also self-serve. Service here is great!  We sat outside and got asked by 3 different staff people if we needed the heater turned on and if there was anything else they could provide for us.  That is enough to make me come back to a place with service as good as that.  I left the last guy a fat tip because he was prompt in taking the plates off our tables and being super friendly. No other place in SD compares to Phil's for their ribs!

Floyd in NorCal has one thing right - and it's not about Northern California being the mecca of barbecue! (Never heard that one before!) No, he's right on the money about the sauce. What is a BBQ joint without its sauce (or, in some cases, its rub)? Phil's sauce is indeed red and looks/tastes/has the consistency of cheapo Chinese sweet 'n' sour sauce. Where's the molasses?! If I took my friends from Memphis to Phil's they'd laugh in my face. We had the BBQ chicken (nothing spectacular), beef ribs (disappointingly dry), and a few sides, which were okay (baked beans were as bland as the sauce, fries were decent, coleslaw was all right). We sat in the bar and the service was good, as were the prices on the beer. Bottom Line: If you've eaten BBQ *anywhere* else, prepare to be disappointed -- especially if you're caught waiting in the incredibly long lines.

It's been a few years since I've had Phil's. Recently, I went on another outting. As usual, the lines were ridiculously long, but I've opted to call in my order and take it to go. I never find waiting in such a long, crazy line enjoyable. The wait was bad when Phil's was at its original spot. Now it's just down right terrible! I've given up hope of ever trying to eat there. To their credit, the barbecued meat is nice and fall-off-the-bone tender. The generous combo deals are pretty good for the price. The sides are just alright with the onion rings being super greasy. But, after having a taste of Texas style BBQ, I now find that their BBQ sauce is a little to sweet, tangy and a bit too sticky for me. For me, it's all about the sauce and Phil's just doesn't do it for me anymore. I have seen the light.

I'm usually not a big fan of BBQ. The first time I tried this place, I had the Baby Back Rib & Chicken Dinner with a side of fries and beans. Everything was very good. The rib meat literally just slid off the bone. THe chicken was super moist. But nothing really blew me away. The fries were just ok. The onion rings were good, but I couldn't have more than one since they were so heavy. The second time I visited, I tried the Pulled Pork Sandwich. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!! I liked the pulled pork SOOOO much. Based on the pulled pork sandwich I give this place 4 stars. If I ever go back, I will try the burger. Private lot. Expect to wait 45+ minutes

Its very tragic that so many people have not tasted real BBQ. (makes me die a little inside) Phil's is okay for the average, uninformed and certainly unenlightened BBQ eater. This place is best geared for the individual that thinks vinegar and spiced ketchup taste's great on "grilled" ribs. I suppose the sauce is the only thing dragging the ribs across the finish line for people.   Personally, I think Phil's is worthy of consumption as long it's processed for dog food.

Not sure why I'm wasting my time writing yet another review about Phil's.  Who knows though, maybe there's some bonehead out there that hasn't gotten the hint after more than 250 5-star reviews that this place kicks ass.  The only complaint there really is to make about this place is that it's crowded.   Well no shit.  Honestly, I prefer it that way.  I'd rather have one GOOD location than a chain of mediocre locations.  Dont waste your time with the sandwiches.  Hit the ribs.  The baby backs are great and I recently tried the beef ones and was amazed by those too.  If you're looking for brisket, take your ass back to Texas.  This is San Diego jackass.

I am a girl who orders ribs on a first date. Phil's are the best ribs I've ever had, and I've had ribs at every restaurant I've been to that serves ribs. They are awesome. Also one time when I went there I had the BEST corn ever. But every other time the corn was normal. I like their fries too. Especially when some BBQ sauce gets on them. We would always call ahead and order, then drive and pick em up. Once I ate there and I thought the place was really cute. It's a house converted into a restaurant, so you can sit in the den, the living room, etc. Very interesting. When I go to SD this is one of the two places I always go.

It's very simple, just eat at Phil's. If you go for lunch get the El Toro, best bang for your buck. Any time you want a full meal the ribs are amazing, but I honestly can't go without their chicken. BEEFY RIBS AND CHICKLESS DINNER PLEASE! You'll get much more meat from the 20 cent difference of the beefy ribs over the baby back. If you don't like beef ribs this tip isn't going to help you out though haha. If you've never been to Phil's and are in San Diego often, you cannot miss out on this joint!

The wait sign said "Approximately 21 minutes and 14 seconds," which was an understatement.  While the line was long, the ribs were absolutely worth it.   Baby Back Ribs- the meat was tender, flavorful and really did fall off the bones.   Coleslaw- I can usually do without this side, but their coleslaw was light and complimented the BBQ sauce Macaroni salad- meh Onion rings- a little too much hype for what they were...I took a bite and was over it.  (Maybe because I prefer thick, crumbly battered onion rings.) Sangria- Don't waste your time with this, just order beer. While we were in line, there was a foreign couple in front of us that became restless and started to leave.  We managed to convince them to stay for the ribs.  After they were done with their meal, they found us and thanked us for telling them to stay because they really enjoyed their meal!  So, moral of the story: Patience is a virtue.

This is going to be one of those five star reviews where everything has gone right and the stars aligned perfectly.   Thanks to Yelp Wifey/Daughter Ciara G., who loved this place so much last time she and Lucy Y. ate here that she had to make her very own UYE.  LY and I made our way to Ciara's place, we piled in the Prius and headed down to SD to muscle up on some good old fashioned BBQ at Phil's.   We pulled into the parking lot and saw that the line had wrapped around the building.  Judging by the incredible smell wafting from the place, we had a pretty good idea why there was such a long wait.  Thankfully Craig R. and his bride to be Kim had gotten there ahead of time and saved us a place, otherwise our wait would have been considerably longer.   As it was, even with Craig's good lookin' out for the rest of us, we waited approximately 50 minutes before we were seated, but the time did pass quickly thanks to the company which included Lucy Y, Ciara G, Craig R, Kim, Hugo C, Isabel F, and the many SD Yelpers who came to show some love.   Steve from Phil's BBQ came by, offered us menus, chatted us up, and, given the afternoon heat, even gave us frozen Otter Pops while we waited.  How many places have you ever been to that would actually take the time for and/or care this much about customers who haven't even been seated yet? We ordered and our food was delivered fairly quickly considering the staggering amount of people being served.  I really appreciated the well-oiled, machine-like precision and efficiency with which the place was being run.  Big big ups on that. I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs with a side of tri tip.  The price was right, the portions generous, and the food was OMG-esque delicious.  The ribs were falling off the bone perfect, and the tri tip was sliced super thin and dressed with a generous amount of their tangy, spicy tomato-y sauce.   LY got the beef ribs and those were soo tender and flavorful.  She also got a chocolate whoopie pie that was very good, if not a tad sweet for my liking.   The service at the end of the meal could not have been better.  We had multiple people coming by and asking if we needed anything, taking our dirty dishes, etc. Phil's is a textbook example of how to run a successful restaurant:  make a top shelf product, treat people like they matter to you, and run a tight ship and the world will beat a path to your door.   Phil's is the new king of BBQ for me on the West Coast. Hail to the king, baby! Baby Back Ribs:  5/5 Stars Tri Tip:  5/5 Stars Beef Ribs:  5/5 Stars BBQ Sauce:  5/5 Stars (one of the best I have ever tasted) Whoopie Pie:  4/5 Stars Service:  5/5 Stars (I'd give them 6 if I could) Ambiance:  3/5 Stars (crowded and noisy but clean and well kept) Parking:  4/5 Stars (shared center parking; scarce) Value:  5/5 Stars Overall:  41 Stars / 9 = 4.55 Stars Rounded up to 5 Stars

Ribs and chick-less dinner was the bomb, the meat was cooked perfectly, not fatty, and can't say enough about the sauce it's the perfect mixture of sweetness, vinegar, and just enough spice.  I don't like onions but I actually ate multiple onion rings too.  Also tried the tri-tip sandwhich and it was a bit smokey for my taste. We got there about 15 minutes after it opened and had about a 20 minute wait and even though it was quite busy we got a table right away. Will definitely be back.

Took my dad here for Father's Day...EXTREMELY long line (waited over an hour) but totally worth it. Had the El Toro sandwich and LOVED it!! My dad had the Rib-Less dinner which he loved as well but he preferred my sandwich over his dinner but he still said his meal was fabulous so we did good. Can't wait to return and enjoy that El Toro sandwich again! MMM!

I came here twice over the summer. A friend swear by their ribs and I think I have to agree with them. The first time I came I had the half rack ribs with a side of steamed veggies. The second time I had the same thing but with the sauce on the side. The reason why I had the sauce on the side the second time was because I am not a huge fan of saucy foods, I prefer to be the one in control of how much sauce goes on top. Regardless, the ribs are still perfectly delicious with or without sauce! The meat slides off the bones until you reach the cartilage at the top/bottom of the rib. The veggies, were just plain steamed veggies. I stole some fries from my friend before he drowned it with seasoning, and those were pretty good too, but then again, they're just fries to me. Instead of my usual ketchup, I dipped my fries in their delicious BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce does not have the "fresh out of the bottle" taste which is fantastic!! Phil - please make a "small side" for veggies because I really want to try your other sides in small portions.

Visited San Diego for the wife's sister's wedding and had to stop here because It looked awesome on travel channel. Made sure got there early (before 5), because nothing is worst than waiting in line and being hungry. It's like waiting in a bathroom line for a sporting event :) Line took 5 minutes and we were off to ordering. You order your food and find a table yourself. Don't worry, there's plenty. Got a beer and some wine-in-a-cup and waited anxiously for our food. Food came quickly. I had the BBQ Broham Pulled Pork samich. Damn good pulled pork and coleslaw soaking with all the juices and bbq sauce in the bread. Potato salad was okay . Big chunks of potatoes with lighter sauce. Wife had the ribs and chicken combo. Ribs were great, if not the best I've had. Tender, flavorful and smoked perfectly. Chicken also was good with same smokey flavor, but I'm more of a fried chicken guy. Fries were yummy as well...Needed a lot of napkins, because good food while eating with your hands always gets messy...Service was pretty good and prices were cheap. Food was badass. Must go...go later than 5 and there will be a line that goes around the building.

Phil's is downright mind-blowing! Yes, there's gonna be a long ass line, but damn it, the food is sooo worth the wait! After waiting in the Disneyland style line for an hour and a half, we finally made it to the counter. I got an order of the best of both worlds with 3-4 baby back ribs and BBQ chicken, while Hugo C. had a full rack of baby back ribs; we also had a side of corn on the cob and a small order of colossal onion rings. It took a while for our food to be ready, but we passed the time looking at the poor suckers still waiting in line. When we got our food, we couldn't wait to chow down. My ribs were fantastic! They literally fell off the bone, my chicken was juicy and tender. And OMG the onion rings were fantastic! Crispy and true to there name, colossal. The corn on the cob was okay, not great but not bad either. Besides the amazing food, what will bring me back to Phil's it's the ambiance. Think along the lines of southern hospitality, the employees are friendly and ready to help when necessary. For all the traffic this place gets, the restaurant is fairly clean. Plus they have service staff constantly wiping down tables and cleaning the floors. If you're in San Diego, stop by Phil's!

Good Lord! It was barely 5PM and the line already wrapped the restaurant and down the parking lot! Don't let that massive line dissuade you from giving Phil's BBQ a try. I almost did but I'm happy my friends took the initiative to come up with a backup plan. Although they say the line wait is only about 20 minutes we really didn't want to keep ourselves from 20 minutes of misery so we decided to get our food to-go. I got the baby back ribs and chicken with a corn on the cob. If you don't like your food swimming in a sea of sauce then ask for the bbq sauce on the side. The meat had that smoked bbq taste and everything literally fell right off the bones. Prices are great especially for what you're getting. Everyone on staff is surprisingly hospitable and friendly. I don't know how they do it. I'd be strangling someone if I were in any of their shoes. If you're leaning towards ordering to-go, go inside and steer to the line on the left. They spit out orders really fast. Definitely worth a visit if you're ever in the area!

BEFFY RIBS!!! They are the bomb! I love them from there! My Pops made me beef ribs all the time since I was a baby and I was super bummed I was never able to take him here but I always have fond memories of papa when I go here.   The only gripe I have is that they wouldn't seat us until everyone in our party came.  We literally were sitting at the front of the line waiting for two people.  The kids were super hungry too. Eh they were quite happy when we sat down.   I of course ordered the beefy ribs dinner to enjoy with the boy.  Which we did.  The meat was of course falling off the bone.  They are such large portions I always get a meal and split it between the three of us.  I always get a small order of onion rings too they are awesome from here.  Crispy and light berry berry good! Ask for extra ranch and barbecue if you like :)

Phil's is without a doubt the best rib joint in San Diego, period.  Great sauce, great service, great food...  Everything there is done well.  After Phil's, all other's truly pale in comparison.   I've had the baby backs, the beef ribs and the chicken which were all excellent, but my favorite is the El Toro tri tip sandwich.  An enormous El Toro with a side of extra sauce, an order of their bomb ass onion rings with ranch dressing and a Yellow Tail Pale Ale makes Beau a happy boy indeed!   Nothing more need be said about the great food here...  Just go and if you have a BBQ loving bone in your body you will be completely satisfied and then some.   Of course you will get those nay sayers who complain with all the "Oh I've had better in Kansas City," "There's this better place in Austin" or some such bullshit, but I would venture to say this is the best rib place you will find in Southern California.   Phil, you are my hero but I blame you for the extra weight I'm trying to lose you bastard!

Sorry but this place may be the most over rated place in all of San Diego if not California. I have competed in bbq competitions and have eaten at all of the great bbq spots such as Memphis, NC, Texas, and KC. This place would not last  2 weeks in business in any of those places. Anyone that knows what real bbq is would not be impressed at all. You could learn how to cook your own bbq in your backyard with a little training way better than Phil's or any other bbq place in San Diego. I think it is a joke that there are no good bbq places at all in San Diego which is the 8th largest city in the US!

Came here on a weekend with some Phil's BBQ "virgins". HA! Given its popularity, we decided to come here right when they open to avoid the long wait times. Gladly, it worked!!! Our party waited about 10 mins before reaching the head of the line. The hostess in the front was super friendly and mentioned the opening of the new San Marcos location. I was real excited as this would only be a 5 min drive for me! WHO HOO!!! Christopher C. and I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and the half rack baby back ribs with a large fries. I have to say, the pulled sandwich was good, but had a smokey flavor to it (which I didn't care for). The BBR were devoured. The meat was real tender and came right off the bone. Annalee S. ordered the quarter BBQ BBR, and Art C. and Gina J. ordered the the BBR and Chicken. Needless to say the "virgins" are now "de-virginized", and we were in BBQ heaven. I ended up getting a 2pk of BBQ sauce for $12. NUM, NUM, NUM...

What? I haven't written a review for Phils? No way! I've been coming to Phil's BBQ since their previous location! Can you believe I had to beg my boyfriend at the time to come with me? Oh did he regret ever saying he didn't want to go. I've been to the Sports Arena location since it opened. The Line: Yes at times it can be massive but it's so worth it! Make sure you don't come here too hungry because I don't want to see you drooling while I'm next to you in line for an hour and a half. The Food Oh now this is finger licking goodness! Baby Back Pork Ribs are fantastic. The meat slides off the bone so clean. The meat is so tender. The BBQ sauce so tangy I love to spread it over my fries. Yum! Drool!

Over 3,000 reviews and 41/2 stars should say something about this place! Went here last week and waited in line for about 20 minutes or so. The line wasn't too bad and actually went by pretty quickly. There ribs are fall of the bone tender and the macaroni salad is delicious. Only if I lived closer but since I don't, I will come definitely come whenever I'm in town.

GOOD CALL! It was up to me to pick the nomming spots on a trip to SD with a couple of friends. The first placed I check was my bookmarks and Phil's was the only place that I had listed (not sure how I found out about it). By the time we got to Phil's we were hungry from the drive from L.A. But I was scared when I saw that long line outside, but not to worry, they had a sign up that said the wait was like 21 mins. The staff is super friendly. From the guy that walks through the line chatting it up, handing out menus and making suggestions to the lady directing traffic at the front.   The four of us coordinated our orders, with everyone opting for an entrée we had... 2 orders of pork full rack with large sides (one macaroni and one fry), 1 order of beef ribs and 1 pulled pork sandwich (The Broham), and four sodas.  It was more than enough for three guys and a girl. In fact, we probably could have cut out one of the full racks and went with a half or nothing . Our orders came up quick and we had already prepped ourselves with bibs, paper towels in the lap, etc. Digging in was like a kid on Christmas morning (at least that's how I felt).  It is now my favorite rib joint in California. I didn't care much for the beef ribs. The pork ribs were excellent. I liked the bit of heat they put in the sauce.  Fries were typical, but good and macaroni was great.  Pulled pork was good as well. Our total, including tax, was $76.41.

Phil's BBQ is hands down, the best BBQ in San Diego and perhaps all of Southern California.  Once you have tried it, just the thought of it will make your mouth water.  Located on Goldfinch in the outskirts of Mission Hills, it is not too far from downtown, relatively easy to reach from the 5 Freeway, and parking can be found on the street or in the paid lot.  This restaurant is an absolute MUST visit for natives and visitors, a great casual date spot, and even a good night out for a family; kids will love eating with their fingers and licking all the BBQ sauce off.  The menu consists of variations of a Rib and/or Chicken BBQ dinner, which come with your choice of sides including Fries, Baked Beans, Coleslaw, and Corn.   When it comes to pricing, this is the perfect place for a cheap date.  You could easily share a Full Rib Dinner complete with 2 sides for under $20.  After picking up your food from the counter, you find a spot in one of the many booths equipped with a plentiful amount of paper towels .  An added bonus: if your date is boring you, you can zone out to one of the several TV screens, which usually play The Simpsons, Family Guy, or sports. HOW TO ORDER LIKE A REGULAR: One of the most important things to remember about Phil's, is that the line to order is out the door every night except Monday (the only day they are closed).  Having said that, there are a few things that regulars know that will make your experience more enjoyable: 1. Phone in your order.  Grab a menu, walk away and phone it in with your cell phone.  Then, go for a walk, maybe schedule to pick it up after a movie, etc.  When you go to pick it up, you skip over that HUGE line out the door and your food is hot and waiting for you.  Once you have picked it up, you can still go back and find a seat or maybe take it somewhere else to enjoy. 2. Don't complain.  It is possible (crazy, but still possible) that you might not like the BBQ sauce.  If you complain to him, much like the soup nazi, he will simply take it away.  However, if your order is wrong, the staff is more than happy to correct it if you ask nicely. 3. Order the fries in a separate box.  Their fries are really good, but if you don't specially order them that way, the ribs are dumped on them and they are drenched in the sauce.  Some people prefer it that way, but I enjoy them plain.   Regardless of whether you adhere to these rules or not, Phil's is a restaurant you are sure to enjoy, especially in these hot summer months.

My first experience here in all the years of living in San Diego, only to find out about this place from a friend from San Jose (Thanks, Carmen!).  Go figure?! What a coincidence that one of of good friends wanted to celebrate his birthday @ this place.  For those that came out to enjoy the festivities...  Let's say it together, "Hooray for Ray, Happy Birthday!"   After reading all your praises & accolades, I was really looking forward to come...  And they did not disappoint =) The Parking:  Good luck =( The Restaurant No reservations.  This place was too crowded (wrapped around the restaurant) for my taste but very understandable (a victim of it's popularity). The Staff Very friendly and accommodating.  The waiter asked since we had a relatively large group, she asked that I reserve the table and we rotated when ordering our food.  Great recommendation =) The Food An abundance of riches for the carnivore.  Starter:  A generous portion of Onion Rings (tasty and crunchy but yet soft in the middle).  Entree:  I went for the their most popular dish.  Full Rack of (pork) Ribs: Slow cooked "fall-off-the-bone" goodness.  The sauce had a fantastic blend of sweet molasses & peppery spices.  Sides:  Baked beans and Corn on the Cobb.  Oh so good, I ended up ordered two =)   My 'final' thoughts after eating my ginormous meal...  "Oink-oink, says the pig!" The overall experience:  Loud & crowded.  Too much food for what we ordered.  Extremely full & content customers.  The way a night with 'great' friends should be...  Thank you, Phil's BBQ you've got another satisfied fan in me.  I'll be back...

Question:  What's tougher than Chuck Norris? Answer: The meat at Phil's BBQ This is my second review for Phil's BBQ, since my first review was flagged and removed.  Apparently it "lacks a substantive firsthand experience." My first review was this: Phil's BBQ is all hype and carbohydrates.   "When reviewing, please describe your actual experience with a business." Okay so here goes.   A group of us visited Phil's one evening as a farewell dinner for my sister before she left for college.  They waited in line for a good 45 minutes, and once we all arrived, we were practically pushed to the registers and rushed to place our order.  I understand trying to keep the line going, but I felt like we and the rest of the people in line were handled like a herd of cattle.  My poor boyfriend was pressured into ordering something off of the menu that he didn't really want, you know, just to keep the line moving. Inside the restaurant: crowded, chaotic, loud, impersonal... sort of reminded me of a high school cafeteria, from hell.  Were we trying so hard to recover from our horrible line and ordering experience, but it was nearly impossible in such an environment. Luckily, our server was amazing. That was the only good thing that I can say about Phil's BBQ, our server, I wish I can remember his name.  He was positive and upbeat, and I definitely give him credit for being able to keep his cheerful demeanor in such chaos. Now the food.  I have to say, the BBQ sauce is pretty good.  The meat on the other hand, not so good.  The ribs were tough, you would think, at a place that has nearly 4.5 stars on yelp, the meat would fall right off of the bone.  Nope. I ordered the "Chicken Tickler".. I expected chicken with a side of french fries.  What I did get french fries with a side of chicken.  They weren't kidding about tickling the plate with chicken.  That chicken was scarce! I truly wanted to enjoy my experience, because seriously, (and I don't know why) EVERYBODY and their mom likes this place. I'm sorry I can't say that I feel the same way. I've had Phil's BBQ before and it was great, but I'm thinking their quality has just gone down the drain ever since it was on "Man vs. Food" because they know people will keep on coming. If you've never been to Phil's BBQ and you see that line that wraps around the corner.. you ask yourself "Is it worth the wait?" - NO. That's pretty much it, and I hope it adheres to Yelp's "yelping" requirements.

parking is tough.  Food is fabulous.  Been here over 10 times and never had to wait in line  sorry yelper's secret :) highly recommend the rib tickler for biggest bang for ur buck.    Beef broham highly recommended, onion rings with ranch, and the El Toro! I'm glad that they've designed this place where sinks are readily available and automatic.  Great service and hospitality. 5 stars, never disappoint. also a great place to catch any sports game. Glad to see this place succeed from the old day's in the smallest spot ever in Mission Hills!  Congrats Phil's!

Even after reading 35 extremely favorable reviews, I was still skeptical about this place. Hubby wanted to try it so I complied. I'm not a big BBQ kinda person so I thought, okay, we'll eat here, maybe treat it like an appetizer and then perhaps go down the road to the Japanese place I saw when driving to Phil's and get a bowl of udon or something. So we get to the counter (it was surprisingly uncrowded as I thought we'd have to wait forever), I ordered very conservatively: a half slab of ribs with 2 sides and 1/4 chicken only. I figured if we didn't like it then there wouldn't have THAT much to eat and if we did, then we could always get more. We waited about 15 mins for the food. It was late... we got off to a late start so it was around 8.45pm by the time we got our food. The crowds had started to flow in and soon the place was bustling. The beeper they gave me buzzed and I quickly got up to grab our food. I brought it back to the table (everything packaged as if 'to go'), ripped it open and gave lil guy a rib. I was afraid he might not like it, but I prayed for the best. He took one bite and he declared "YUMMY". A sigh of relief. I thought, this is a good sign. Then, hubby and I dug in and to my surprise, it was really good. I added some Frank's hot sauce to my portion and it was just outta this world. The coleslaw side was also fantastic. I'm a huge coleslaw snob and this has gotta be some of THE best coleslaw I'd ever tasted. Hubby got the potato salad (again I'm not a potato type of person esp not potato salad) but these were also awesome!! Lil guy ate most of our ribs while hubby and I shared the 1/4 chicken. What totally impressed me was the fact that Phil himself came out and greeted his customers and chatted with them. What a guy!!! I'm a total convert now that I've had a taste of Phil's! I now like BBQ a lot!!

I came back here for a late night dinner and it was perfect!  I think this is the best time to go (around 9:45) since there were only two other people in line before us and there was immediate seating available. For two ticklers and two drinks for less than $20 bucks, I'll forever be a fan of Phil's.  It also took ten minutes for our food to come out...it doesn't get any better than that!!

YUMM! If you are ever in San Diego, you MUST try this place. And if you live in SD and have never been, you are missing out! The food is hella bomb! So good I usually order a full rack so I can eat half then have half for leftovers! I always get the baby back rib dinner or the best of both baby back ribs & chicken dinner. The ribs are tender, the bbq sauce is great, and the dinners come with 2 sides (I really like the potato and macaroni salad). The COLOSSAL ONION RINGS are amazing too! They're huge, crispy, and somehow Phils has mastered the art of making onion rings in which the entire onion doesn't come sliding out upon the first bite, leaving you with an empty fried shell. Other things worth trying--the broham sandwich (pulled pork) or the beefy ribs (huge). The workers are extremely friendly and efficient too! No complaints except it's so popular the line can get reallly long. If you're starving in anticipation of your amazing bbq and the line wraps around the building, just get the number off the menu and phone in your order from the parking lot. Then you'll only have to wait 15-20 min in your car and you can skip the line to pick up your order! :) P.S. If you're craving Phils on Mondays, you're out of luck. They're closed :(

OK I had NO Idea what we were getting into when I decided to come to this place. I was in SD for a Seminar which I will be attending 3 more times this year and I vaguly remember hearing about "some BQQ place" so I searched BQQ near out hotel. Notice lots of reviews and didn't even read them just said lets go there. Arrive at the restaurant and there is a line with over 100 people out the door. A sign that states 20 minute wait from the corner made me think we were at Disney or Magic Mountain. I was a little apprehansive after this large display of Hype and lines. After 50 mins of wait we got in and ordered. We had large order of beef ribs, full rack of baby back ribs, onion rings, half a chicken, baked potato,  potato salad, mac salad, and a pulled pork sandwich. Not one thing was bad!!!! To top it off they had Stone Smoked Porter which is my favorite new SD discovery for beers. Perfect for BBQ or chocolate and so I had to get a whoopie pie to go along with a botttle of that excellent sauce.   Believe me this place is totally worth the HYPE!!!!Heidi and Steve both rocked it with customer service. I mean usually at a place of this magnitude the service is hit or miss but we got all HITS on service that night. I expect to be back next trip to SD!!!!

Well, it's not like Phil's REALLY needs another review, but what the hell... When I worked across the plaza at Cafe India, the smell from Phil's always found it's way into our restaurant.  By the time Phil's came into the neighborhood I was a little over Indian, so the smell was welcome and at the same time torture while I was working!   I didn't give into the hype until after the first month or two.  I couldn't understand the appeal and why there were infinite lines out the door (affecting the lack of tables I got!).  I also didn't want to betray the owner's of my restaurant... I finally gave into the smell, and didn't even have to wait in line!  I ordered (and have ordered every time I've been back) the "rib tickler".  It comes with 3 or so giant ribs, coleslaw, fries and few huge onion rings for only around $7.  Very filling!  They have great barbecue, but I still can't comprehend waiting in line for it...

ABSOFANTASTILUTELY DELICIOUS! baby back ribs FOSHO. Whichever one of my friends who told me Phil's BBQ was overrated, we're no longer friends. BEST baby back ribs I've had for awhile that's better than Lucille's. I like the fact that you wait in line for max of 20 minutes, order your food which has individual portions (half baby back ribs with 2 sides), find seats which are pretty easy, and then your order arrives within 5 minutes for you to pick up. I'd frequent this place absolutely, which is completely efficient with its dining structure. Wish I could take some to go before I leave!

Holy smokes, Batman, 1800 reviews... Amazing!  This place has never disappointed me.  I'm always coming back for more.  I love how the baby back ribs are wet with bbq sauce and how it falls off the bone.  I love their macaroni salad.  Even those long lines don't deter me away.   I still love you and forever will.

Be prepared to wait a ridiculously long time (4 of us came here on a Saturday night around 9pm and still waited 40 minutes), but it's worth it! I got the rib combo meal with white meat chicken, and it was super delicious.  The white meat chicken was good and tender, but I think going forward, I'm just going to get the ribs because those suckers are amaaazingly good. I also tried the onion rings and steamed veggies (you know, to balance out some of the fattiness), and both were delicious -- even the steamed veggies. I'd definitely come back for the ribs and to try the beef ribs, but it may be worth it to call ahead and get a take out order if you don't want to wait in the long ass line.

I've had ribs in Nashville and thought nothing could compare with a true southern style ribs. Phil's BBQ was comparable. Baby back ribs so tender that it falls off the bone and your don't even have to chew it. Smothered in a smokey, tangy sauce and just make you salivate more. Delicious, fantastic, orgasmic. You already know its a great place because there was a line forming as soon as it opened. Omit the fries, but do get the onion rings...its the best I've ever had. A must try when you're down in the San Diego area.

Very tasty! An excellent place to eat with friends and have a good time. They have a very large selection of dishes and the portions are generous, be sure not to harass the the cooks (according to the warning sign). I've only went once so far and I'll go back back again. The only real negative of this place is the long wait in line, so come in early!

Have you ever tasted something SO GOOD, you FORCED a burp just to TASTE it AGAIN?  ...Yup.  That's Phil's. Friend #1 [Male]: "Anyone wanna go half on a full slab w/ me?  I don't think I have the stomach to eat it all..." Friend #2 [Male]: "Nah, man - I'm getting a full slab... just order more and save it for later..." Friend #3 [Male]: "Doode, you're going to want to get as much as you can, seriously... It's DAMNED good..." Friend #1 [Male]:"I dunno man... how much are you eating?" Friend #3 [Male]: "Full beef slab o' ribs...!  Just share with one of the girls, they don't eat as much..." Friend #1 [Male]: "Sharon, wanna half one w/ me?" Me: [hesitates] "Ummmm... why don't you half w/ ur gf?" Friend #1 [Male]: "She is getting her own and doesn't want to share with me..." Me: "I hate to tell you this, but I was gunning to get the full slab baby back rib dinner w/ two sides..." All guys: "DAAAAAAAMMMMNNNN!  She put YOU to SHAME!" Friend #1 [Male]: "Are you SERIOUS?!" Me: "Sorry, buddy... I'm hungry..." We got to our tables and everyone dug in.  I caught "Friend #1" glancing up from his 5 bone portion to see if I would actually finish the baby back ribs... I figured I'd eat as much as I could [to add salt to his wounds] and save the rest for drunk food later - but by the time I noticed I was getting full, I was already 3/4 done with the damned meal, so I finished up the rest of it, and sat back with a smug arrogant smile on my face as I rubbed my fat belly... I ordered the baby back full slab dinner with fries and macaroni salad... The ribs were cooked to tender perfection, and it makes me ache to have one here in the bay area.  We did several things over this past weekend - but as interesting as it all was - the BBQ was the HIGHLIGHT of my trip... [food excites me].   Service here was fantastic.  We received our food no less than 5 minutes after we ordered, and that's UNHEARD of from where I am from.  Servers were always checking in on you to help assist you with wet nap refills, utensils, and to clear away the loads of empty plates that accumulate.  They're nice enough to change the channel if you request a sporting event, however they cannot do wrestling or fights... [bummer.]  Hell, the BBQ is so damned good, that downer still couldn't drag my score for this place down. The bf and I love BBQ, and we go as often as we can... this place reigns supreme of the few places we've been, and I think it's going to be hard to beat... Seriously, $18.99 for a full slab of baby back ribs - that's unbelievable because I'm used to paying $25-30 - so you locals shouldn't even gripe about the price.  If the bay area can match this, let me know the name of the place, and I'm GAME.  =D This place was HUGE - and the line extended through the width of the store, and out the front entrance - only to wrap around the side of the building and extend all the way down to the other end of the restaurant.  Yup.  I was pissed at first, but after assurances that the line would move quickly, I patiently sucked it up to see we were seated within half an hour.  [That's an amazing turn around when standing in a line of 50 people for BBQ...with a party of 10.] - and every bit of agonizing pain from not eating lunch before dinner was worth the damned wait, because I was able to stuff every morsel of goodness into my mouth while it was still hot.  =D

A couple weeks ago, I went to check out Gorilla's Barbeque up in the Bay area.  Rumor had it that it was the NorCal version of  'Phil's BBQ.'  Naturally, I had to give both a try to see who wins in the bbq battle. As we neared the end of our daycation, the fella and I decided to go to Phil's for dinner.  Being that it was a Tuesday, we didn't think that the line would be that bad.  WRONG!!  As I drove into the parking lot, our jaws dropped at the sight of the long line.  Immediately, my counterpart said, "Well, I guess we won't be trying Phil's tonight!"  WRONG again!  I'm not the most patient person, but if I'm promised delicious food, then I'd waiver that impatience.   After approximately 35 minutes, we finally got to the counter.  Phil's is quite efficient with their service: you place an order at the counter, take your buzzer, find a table, and wait to pick up your food.  This way, there's no waiting for a server nor a table! About 10-15 minutes later, my buzzer buzzed away.  We grinned from cheek to cheek at the beautiful sight of a pulled pork sandwich, cole slaw, baby back ribs, fries, and sweet baked beans.  The baby back ribs were AMAZING!  With a little flick of the fork, the meat literally slid off the bone.  Moist, flavorful, and finger lickin' good!  I especially enjoyed the cole slaw!  Crunchy, slightly sweet and tangy, and very fresh.  It almost reminds me of the traditional cole slaw from KFC, just not as watery. So, after a taste bud duke out between Gorilla and Phil's, I'd have to declare Phil's as the BBQ champ!  Meat that literally slides off baby back ribs deserve 5 stars all on its own!

AHHHH SHIT! Not another overrated establishment!! WHY YELP WHY?!!??! I do not understand your hype sometimes! 50 minute wait in line 100% not worth your mediocre BBQ. I got the rib and chicken combo... Chicken, dry as month old dog shit failed to be picked up by the typical, neglectful teenager. Their BBQ sauce was SUB PAR, and ribs where ok, but have had WAY better at Lucile's WITHOUT THE WAIT!!! Everybody that rates this high.. is a hypebeast.. plain and simple.

I'm a native San Diegan and all my life I heard about Phil's and how great the BBQ is.  Perhaps I should have eaten here before I traveled and ate better BBQ in Florida and even Vegas. I was sadly disappointed, as we have been looking for good BBQ here. This isn't it.  The only good part was the soda's. The meat was not generous nor tender and was overwhelmed with something called BBQ sauce. I'd like to say the service was great, but it wasn't.  When we walked in we (wrongly) assumed that you get seated first then order. A rude waitress told us otherwise as we apparently violated the sacred rule of ordering first. If you want good BBQ: 1) travel outside San Diego 2) read my reviews!

Great onion rings, but I will never be able to eat BBQ again- not after eating at Phil's. My friend and I got takeout for dinner on the 9th and I was sick with food poisoning until the 12th. I have never been so violently ill. I know it was their pork ribs because I hadn't eaten since breakfast and my friend ate everything that I ate, except instead of pork ribs he had beef. It makes perfect sense after reading other reviewers' stories of experiencing food poisoning or witnessing employees failing to wash their hands after using the restrooms. Note: If you write a negative review, be prepared for the owner to message you- another Yelper mentioned this, too. He'll probably offer you a refund. I hardly think $40 makes up for losing 3 days of my vacation.

OMGWTFBBQ! Came here with Christine C for a late lunch after Warped Tour. It was a Tuesday afternoon so there was zero wait! =D Honestly, have never heard of Phil's BBQ until Christine C mentioned it. Looking it up on Yelp I was wowed by how many reviews this place has, it has more reviews than Porto's! I didn't double check the info and we actually went to the old location first. =( The old area seemed like a nice neighborhood, but the newer location is definitely made to handle the amount of customers this place gets. This place is all built on efficiency. Once you order they send you away with a little buzzer beepy thingy, that way you don't have to wait around for a number to be called or have someone deliver the food to you. Once you place your order and pay, you are on your own. Drinks are self served and takeout containers are stacked up to the side for you to grab. There was enough seating to go around on a weekday, noticed quite a few large parties. Though booths were supposed to be only for parties of six or more, I saw a couple sit at one. The prices were pretty average for a BBQ place. A full rack of baby back ribs was $16.95 and a baby back rib & chicken dinner was $11.95. My best of both worlds dinner was awesome, I got so much food! It comes with a quarter chicken, about 4 ribs and two sides (I choose French fries and sweet baked beans). The beans in the sweet baked beans seemed to be on the small side and mushy. It was ok. I really, really liked the fries though, natural cut and crispy it was perfect with the BBQ sauce covering the chicken and ribs. The rib meat was soft, just a little bit before the "falling off the bone" point which is good I like my meat to have some substance. The sauce is the real winner, its' slightly sweet, just the right bit tangy and only a hint of fire. When I make BBQ I tend to make my own marinade/sauce from scratch and it's Asian style. =p But if you are a true fan of Phil's BBQ you should pick up a couple bottles of their signature sauce they have on sale.

4 star food, 3 star setup and service. I can't stand find your own seating places and this whole pick-up-your-own-food at the counter; yet, I still have to give it 4 stars...why, because somehow it just works. This method keeps cost low and turns tables quickly. I will argue and complain, but at the end of the day everyone just wants to enjoy some good BBQ. The meat is tender fall off the bone tender and the sauce is so freaking good...how good? Its just perfection, I can't say anything more. The sauce is sweet with a hint of vinegar and certain french fries are lucky enough to bath in glory of the BBQ sauce smothered rib. The french fries are good, but are freaking amazing with the BBQ sauce. The only question you have to ask yourself is, when do you switch between Ribs and the groovy sides you ordered? I just don't know.

Don't get me wrong I LOVE to stuff my face at Phil's BBQ. The meat falls off the bone and my mouth waters every time I think about this place.  The service is also awesome and fast.  The ranch is EPIC too.  I always get really sleepy after I eat here. -_- 4 Stars because of the flavor and the service.

Phil's B-B-Q is D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!! Wait time is not long at all (compared to another BBQ place...let's say Lucille's) even thoe it was Sunday at dinner time. Come in, place your order at the counter, grab a pager, find a seat. Food was ready fast. Right after I grabbed my drink, my pager went off already. They don't offer a huge selection of meat menu items, but what they lack in variety they hugely  make up for in taste! The main items are ribs (pork and beef) and BBQ chicken. The pork ribs were "OMG-fall-off-the-bone-goodness". Covered in a not too sweet yet savory sauce. The chicken was tender and flavorful with a hint of smokiness. Their side dishes were a knock out too! Onion rings were awesome, Ginormous and perfectly golden fried with a side of ranch. I really like the potato salad too with the red potatoes and dill. Baked beans were good. Not too crazy about their fries. Staff was super nice and genuinely friendly. Just they way a dining experience should be. I look foward to visiting sometime again!

Best BBQ ever!! Thanks to Man Vs Food. At the end, man won =P I've been wanting to try this place for the longest! Heard so much about this place and we finally came here this past Saturday after a day at the Zoo. We got here at about 730-8PM w/ a group of 15 people. The line was ridiculous! We considered leaving but decided to stay and good thing we did!! I think we probably waited for about an hour and a half..yikes Good thing one of the worker walked by and offered us to try the fries =) yummmmo We ordered the bbq broham, el toro, baby back ribs, onion rings, and fries. All were good! The baby back ribs were the bomb! The meat comes right off the bone..delicious. I liked the bbq broham (pulled pork) better than the el tore (tri tip). The bbq broham comes w/ cole slaw so put that into the sandwich and it's perfect! The meat on the bro ham was tender and not too overpowering and the cole slaw was just right. The el toro was good but I think it had too much bbq sauce so it was a bit overdoing it with the bbq sauce. The onion rings and fries were delicious too. I really don't have anything bad to say about the food cause it was all good. The long wait is really worth it! Must try! We will be stopping by again  every time we're in SD ;)

Everything you've heard is true. This place definitely lives up to the hype. The food was absolutely delish! It took me so long to check this place out because of the fact that the line is usually around the building and about 60+ people deep... We came on Tuesday around noon and we waited in line less than 10 minutes and received our food in about the same time...excellent if you ask me! We ordered 2 el torro sammies which were incredibly delicious and my bf got a full rack of beef ribs. For the price, quality, quantity and experience this place is unparalleled! Everything we ordered tasted superb!

I came here expecting "OMG, super delicious, to die for" food because of all these 4-5 star yelp reviews & the opinion of one my bffs.  WOW oh WOW, this place is BEYOND OVERHYPED!!!! Not to mention the line/wait is RIDICULOUSLY long.  NOT WORTH THE WAIT AT ALL... BUT, if you request to sit at the bar, & they have seats available, you can skip that unending line cause that's what my friends and I did over the weekend. Their menu is very small.  I ordered the half order of the baby back ribs. The baby back ribs are your typical BBQ ribs. Yes, they're good, but there's NOTHING special about them.  I honestly prefer Lucille's ribs, but probably because I know Lucille's would never have a wait that wraps around the building only to find out you're in for a lunch/dinner that serves your mediocre meal.   All I have to say is OVERHYPED & OVERRATED!

Went to Phils tonight because anytime we are over off Sports Arena we can smell the wonderful BBQ aromas and had yet to try it. I certainly have NO clue what everyone is raving about. Had the pulled pork sammy and it was nothing to write home about at all. The quality of the meat is nice but the 'sauce' is really gross. Its more like BBQ grease because for some reason it is transparent. Oh and not to mention how artificial it tastes. Total liquid smoke overload in there. Wasted my carb/fat count for the next week on nasty sauce and an overly sloppy soggy sandwich and am in need of BBQ redemption ASAP.

After living in San Diego for 5 years, working literally 3 mins drive away for the past 1.5 years, and hearing my friends from LA/OC rave about how much they love this place, I finally made my way to Phil's BBQ. The restaurant is closed on Mondays and consider yourself warned: the line is ATROCIOUS on other days. It literally wraps around the building, but most people find the 45-minute wait worthwhile. They don't take reservations, either. But if you sign up to be part of their club, you get to cut the line on your birthday (and if it falls on a Monday, well... I don't know what to say to that, haha). I was hesitant to come here for two reasons: 1) I hate heavy food (especially things like burgers and BBQ) 2) I don't like eating anything containing bones or shells (it's just too much effort for food) 3) Every time something is hyped, I'm always disappointed because it falls short of my expectations But Phil's BBQ proved me wrong on all three points. VERY friendly service- the waiters were VERY helpful in aiding me since it was my first time here and I was pretty confused. They were also very quick to clear the messes off the table. The menu isn't all that extensive, but there's no need for it to be. Baby Back Rib Dinners: At first glance, it looks pretty much like your standard baby back ribs. But the meat was fall-off-the-bone good. Very tender, seasoned well, and Beefy Rib Dinners: The bone definitely contained a LOT more meat that pretty much fell right off the bone. I'd have to say this was my favorite, but that's because I like beef more than pork (my friend argues that the baby back tastes better). Half Chicken Dinner ($8.75): Chicken is chicken. I would NEVER suggest that anybody order chicken. The chicken is on the dry side, slathered with BBQ sauce. Definitely not as enjoyable as the pork and beef. If you have to order chicken to try it out, I'd suggest eating the chicken first. Fresh Cut Fries: I wasn't blown away, but you pretty much have to have this if you're eating BBQ (or at least, I do). Fresh Cole Slaw: Surprisingly full of flavor (and probably fat, which I don't want to know about). Macaroni Salad: Again, very delicious (and no doubt chock-full of calories, but hey, I already screwed myself over eating everything else listed above, so why not?). I got pretty excited when I saw Phil's BBQ sauce at Costco the next day. Whether or not it's as OG remains to be seen (all my friends are guessing it's not going to be as good). Parking is not too bad, as Phil's BBQ is located in a plaza with plenty of parking on both sides of the restaurant. The good thing about this place is that it's open relatively late- 10 PM or 11 PM depending on the day. Next time, I'm definitely going to try the sandwiches. My OC/LA friends have already put in requests for me to bring Phil's up with me on my next trip. With that being said, see you on Friday, Phil's!!

Definitely the best BBQ we've ever had. So good, we even had our wedding rehearsal dinner here! The service here is some of the best you will ever encounter at a restaurant. The staff will bend over backwards for you, even with our large group of 25+ people! All of the food here is soo good. Beef ribs are probably our favorite: Gigantic slabs of tasty beef on huge ribs! For sides, macaroni & potato salad are our favorites. Finish off with a Whoopee pie!! Yum! Tip: if you can find a spot to sit at the bar, you can skip the line & order food from there.

Well apart of my SD trip from la i had to go to this spot as everyone raved about it .. My friend and i waited probably an hour before getting to order and seated .. Damn spot is too famous that the line wraps around the building .. But that's all gravy as the wait was worth it. We ordered a full beef rib and a full baby back rib and cole slaw, fries, and mac salad sides. What were we thinking? Lol .. Goodness gracious the portions are very large, but delicious! Fall off the bone meat on the baby back ribs and the beef ribs were just full of flavor/fat/meat. Good sauce that they use to. Not too sweet, not too sour/tangy. I liked it :) This spot made me want to come back .. Better yet .. Try to find other BBQ spots to try and beat it .. So thanks phil's bbq! I'll definitely come back when i come back to SD.

Seeing the long line outside was a bit reassuring, but almost turned me away. Almost, because who wants to wait in line forever when you're hungry? But I am glad that I stuck it out. Despite its length, the wait wasn't even bad at all. This place was not what I expected at all. I didn't expect to go up to pay and pick up my order, but I can see how that makes things so much faster. People are in and out of there with good turn over times. I ordered the Baby Back Rib Tickler, which comes with 3 ribs, slaw, fries, and two onion rings. I was a bit disappointed that I wasn't able to substitute (which does make sense if they are going for speed, I suppose), as I am not that big of a fan of cole slaw, but when I got my food, I was no longer disappointed. The problem with braces is that it makes eating certain foods rather difficult. Stuff gets all stuck in them and getting the food out is such a hassle. This place did not give me that problem at all. The meat just falls off the bone, so I could just easily get it off with a fork and knife to cut into braces-friendly portions. Seriously delicious food, and what a great deal. The fries were heaping and really good with the cajun seasoning at the table. They sort of remind me of thicker cut In-N-Out fries in texture. I really liked the cole slaw, which is saying a lot because I don't normally like it. The onion rings were crunchy and oily deliciousness. I would give this place 4.5 stars, rounded up. I just wish I could substitute! I've been searching for a good barbecue place and am rather bummed that I would have to come so far to get it, but if I'm ever back in town, I want to come back for sure!

Theres a reason why this place is so packed all the time; Its because it is freakin' DELICIOUS! for such a good price. Theres a long line, but if you come early, before peak hour, then it aint so bad. You may not even have to wait in line if you get lucky. I've tried the Macaroni, Potato salad, fries as sides before with baby ribs before andi believe some of the other meat too (obviously at separate times because the portion is enough to get me full!), and yummmmmmmm. I've tried the pulled pork sandwich before; it was pretty good, but i got jealous of all the ribs around me, so i prob wouldnt get it again. But something that I do like doing with the sandwich now is to use any of the left pork to put into my fries, and it makes for some pretty good fries too. Double the treat. Also, for the ppl that spill all the time, they also have bibs and places to wash your hands or toilettes. Even just making this review makes me crave it.

I'm not ashamed to confess that I've traded Phil's BBQ sauce for a place to stay when I'm traveling. It's that good. And Oregon-ites love Phil's. Especially Oregon-ites with spare rooms in which I can stay for free. So...if Phil's sauce has this much power, imagine what his meat can do. Hmm, awkward. But you get the picture.

If you're EVER in San Diego visiting from somewhere else - you HAVE to eat here. I lived in San Diego for 4 years and I'm very sad that I did not discover PHil's BBQ the moment I moved there. PHils' BBQ is DELICIOUS and SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD prices are completely fair and reasonable service is excellent Food is DELICIOUSSSSSSSSSSS and mouth watering and so yummy the only thing that is a slight negative is that there is always a hellllllllllla long wait. EAT AT PHIL'S! IT"S SO GOOOOD

Pros: Baby back ribs, french fries, pretty good deal for the amount of food you get Cons: Long lines if you don't show up at the right time, chicken is a little dry Went here with Kristin C. when we were visiting San Diego and I was definitely impressed.  We showed up around 11:30 am on Sunday and there wasn't too long of a line.  When we left around 12:30, the line started to wrap around the building. Anyway, after trying the food, I can see why.  I ended up getting the "Best of Both, Baby Back Rib & Chick-less Dinner" for  $12.25.  It comes with 4 bones and a couple pieces of chicken. Phil's probably serves the best baby back ribs I've ever had.  Fall off the bone goodness. The meat is nice and tender and the BBQ sauce has the right amount of kick.  Their french fries are actually pretty good too. I was kinda disappointed by the chicken because it's kinda dry, but it's still pretty tasty. Not sure if it's worth an hour wait based on some of these other reviews, but it's definitely worth a try if there's not too long of a wait.

There is definitely a crowded time with Disneyland lines. But I think the restaurant does a hell of a job with its efficiency. Luckily I ordered and sat down in 10 minutes during Lunch. The Best of Both Worlds with BBQ Ribs and BBQ Chicken is the MUST HAVE! Onion rings were also crispy and delicious.

Maybe my standards for BBQ are too high being someone who lived in the South, but when my friends took me to "the best BBQ in San Diego" I was not only disappointed, I was still hungry after because I couldn't even force myself to eat my nasty BBQ Chicken. Tasted like Vinegar with Cayenne powder, and the chicken was incredibly dry and the sauce slapped on top (not marinated at all, no flavor in the dry chicken).  Not only was my chicken terrible, but whatever side I had was inedible.   I got dragged there one more time and had the same experience.  How this terrible excuse for BBQ is considered anything but crap is beyond me.

Now, I'm not a big fan of BBQ sauce because it's generally too sweet to me, and Phil's BBQ sauce definitely falls into that category.  That being said, the food was only worth 2 stars to me.  We had the baby back ribs, El Toro (tri tip sandwich), onion rings, and a side salad.  Honestly, I think the salad was the best part of the meal, and it was just spring mix with some tomato wedges.  None of it was bad, just not particularly good.  I much prefer the Tri Tip sandwich at Firestone's in San Luis Obispo, but I guess that's a different review. Now, the service was 50 times better than the food!  I almost want to give this place 5 stars just for the service, but I can't say that "I'm a fan" (4 stars) or that it's "as good as it gets" (5 stars) because I had to wash down that sickeningly sweet BBQ sauce taste from my mouth with tons of water.  Anyway, our server, Kenny, was amazing -- the best server I've ever had.  Seriously, the best.  The kids described him as "tall, fast, and funny" -- he's 6'9", was quick on his feet, and can charm your pants off.  I will definitely look for him if I ever come back. Other notes: -The line was ridiculously long (expected based on previous Yelp reviews), but moves relatively quickly.  It probably took about 40 minutes to get to the counter to order on a Sunday evening around 7pm. -They came around several times asking for parties of 6 or more -- I wonder if that means you get to order first and be seated earlier?? -They came around and offered Otter Pops to the kids while we were in line.

There's nothing else left to say about this San Diego favorite, so I'll just leave you with a few tips: Check your dining etiquette at the door. Utensils are optional, wet naps are a MUST. Don't take your date here if you're looking for quiet and romantic. Ribless dinner with beans and onion rings - hell to the yessssssss. There is a reason why people will line up around the building as if they're about to enjoy an amusement park ride.  If you haven't been yet, I suggest you get in line.

SOOO freakin' tasty!  My brother took me to this place because he said it was one of the best bbq places he's ever tasted!  We waited in line for about 1 hour and we finally approached the front.  What stood out here the most at this place was their customer service.  The cashier, host, and bus boys were super friendly and attentive!  I really didn't think I would receive that kind of service at a place like this.   My brother and I split the full rack of baby rack ribs with two sides (18.95).  We ordered coleslaw and french fries as our sides.  The meat slid right of the bone and it was nice and crispy on the outside.  mmm delish!  The coleslaw was also tasty..not too mayonnaise-y like some places.  Everyone needs to come here if they're headed to San Diego. =)

This review is for their CATERING services only! My bf was throwing a surprise party for his dad and asked if I could pick up the food since he'd be at work. Phil's said they'd email him a form that I'd have to bring when I picked it up. They sent it that morning, which was after I last saw him. He wrote me a note explaining that I could use his credit card and to pick up the food. I had never been there before so when I arrived, there was a line out the door and down one side of the building. I went in the front door, which is NOT where you go for the catering services (it's the side door). when I approached the counter, I was greeted by a friendly cashier who started to ring me up/put together the order. ****A PLUS**** even if you cater your food, they don't start packaging your food until you get there. It's not sitting for hours in an oven. They have so much constant business that they are able to do that! There was an issue with the note my bf wrote as it wasn't the order form they emailed him. There was a manager involved and some photocopying of my DL. While I was waiting for the mess to be sorted out, the friendly cashier from earlier offered me a cup for a drink and insisted that their sweet tea was the best. She was the friendliest person I've encountered working in a restaurant in awhile! All in all, it  worked out. The food was boxed up and i even got help taking the boxes to my car.

MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BBQ SPOT in all of california hands down. Around dinner time, there's almost always a long line. but it is definitely worth the wait. the portions are HUGE. I always have to share my plate with a friend or take home the leftovers. the side dishes are amazing as well! this place is a MUST-TRY if you're in san diego

Awesome food and even better prices. If you go to phills try the toro sandwich, its the best thing in the menu in my opinion. The only proble, get there at least one to two hours before, this place gets packed!! I've never waited so long for a sandwich, but it was worth it. I live in Los Angeles but the next time I'm in San Diego I will definitely stop at Phils!!

One word sums up this place:  AMAZING!  I have been to this place twice and have tried their Baby Back Ribs, Beefy Ribs, and BBQ Chicken.  Regardless of the kind of meat you order, they all taste delicious.  The meat has just enough BBQ sauce to add a lot of taste but not enough to completely take away the delicious meaty taste.  Not only that but their sides taste pretty good as well.  The two times I went, I had Corn on the Cob, Fresh Cut Fries, and Coleslaw and all I could think was that they were some of the better sides I have had in a sit-down restaurant.       The only drawback to this place would be the fact that the wait is always a long time, ESPECIALLY during dinner time.  I remember going at about 7:30 and not getting to the ordering counter until about past 8:45.  Nonetheless, the wait is usually worth it just b/c of the sheer deliciousness of it.  Also, although I have never tried it myself, I imagine the phone order will be pretty fast, especially considering that they have a separate line just for phone orders.       One last thing to note:  the price is very reasonable.  I ordered the half chicken half beefy ribs and I ended up with two pieces of each as well as two small but reasonably sized sides, coming out with a slightly bigger gut, the fatigue feeling that accompanies food coma, and made my wallet only about 14 dollars (including tax) lighter.       Bottom line: If you are in San Diego and craving some American BBQ, this is the place to go.

Seeing the long ass line at 8:30PM blew my mind... Tip: get a spot at the bar and for go the line.. have someone wait in line and have someone stalk the bar like a hungry vulture... throw dem bows if you have to.... They have a cam (smile!) They have an approximate wait time outside They have heaters for those waiting outside in line They have amazing BBQ They have plates of just pure meat fall off the bone goodness They are super speedy with service The prices are ridiculously reasonable for the amount of food you get I got the Baby Back Tickler for two reasons... 1. The name made me giggle 2. It is a really good value for what you get (3 ribs, 2 huge ass onion rings, a huge pile of slaw, a large portion of crispy fries) Others in the party got racks of ribs... these things look like something the Flinstones would eat. They have tons of combos, sandwiches, sides all with some kind of red meat with BBQ sauce... Shout goes out to Louis who was waiting our area.   Perfect Friday night.

I really wanted to get there before the lunch crowd.  Glad we did arrive at 11:30 on a Saturday.  I liked how there were many menus throughout the line so that we didn't have to squint or walk up to the front to see. The Drill: - two lines: left for takeout, right for dine in. - order food and pay - then grab an empty table - when pager buzzes, go back to front to pick up food - chow down!!!   Baby back ribs & 1/4 BBQ chicken w/sweet baked beans BBQ pulled pork sandwich w/coleslaw It was finger licking good!!!  Meat fell off the bone of the ribs...BBQ sauce was smokey, spicy, and sweet.  They give a lot of pulled pork in the sandwich.  Coleslaw and sweet baked beans were tasty!!! Got a whoopee pie too.  Soft Cookie cake sandwich with cream in the middle.  A bit too sweet for my taste. Just the BBQ I needed to start my July 4th.  Highly recommended!!!

Let's just say... Phil's BBQ lives up to all the hype that you hear!! It's cheap, and the meat was so tender that if I were a cartoon character, I can probably put the all the ribs in my mouth and come out with only bones -- the white ones without sauce!! It was definitely worth the two hour drive, and I would definitely drive another two hours just for it!   Tip: Come on a weekday so that the wait isn't long.. My friends and I went on a Tuesday evening so we didn't have to do much waiting.   Next time I come, I will be sure to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauce!

Went again a couple weeks ago.  Great flavorful baby back ribs and excellent crunchy tasty thick cut onion rings.  Pricewise I didn't notice any real change from several years since I last went.  I give 5 stars for great food at affordable prices.  I just wish we had something like this in the east coast near DC.

Okay, so I really want this to be a five-star review, because my wife and I loved this place. There is nostalgia there, and she was able to make it to the new place in Point Loma, so that's cool, too... Christ, Phil. Can you please nail down my all-time favorite? Your delicious onion rings, that is? Come on, man. When I first tried your place out, years ago, during your brawl with your pissy, prissy neighbors, I decided I liked it very much. It was a proud day when I delivered that CityBeat award to you. The ribs and the chicken (of course the sauce) was just part of it, though... The onion rings made you my wife's choice. They were beautiful, golden, tasty, done but not over-fried, crispy but hearty. Then things changed. Why have they turned into armored onion loops of mouth-cutting hatred and vileness? Why? I mean, occasionally they are light and golden with tan highlights, but usually it's just not so. They have mutated into something chunky, brown with very dark brown highlights, the onions dripping not juice but grease. They have become painful maw-scarring bites of hardened disappointment , and mouthfuls of regret. Why do your onion rings have jagged edges? How is that? Regardless, I will return and keep buying your food, even hoping beyond hope for the odds to improve on some decent onion rings with each buy. But I don't know. Volume is king now. Maybe there is just not time to do that awesome barbecue and keep those rings on par. Man, this should be a 5. But I just can't. Despite that disappointment, it really is the best chicken and ribs in the county and likely the state. Try it, folks. *sigh*

Phil's BBQ is great. It is in incredible. It is the best damn restaurant in San Diego. That is, if you enjoy standing in line for 20-40 minutes, ordering your food at a counter, finding a table on your own, filling up your soda at a machine, getting up to get your food from the aforementioned counter, and leaving promptly after you finish. Yeah, if that all sounds like an awesome experience, then Phil's is your place. Unfortunately for me, I hate everything about Phil's except for the food. Call me old fashioned, but when I sit down to gorge myself on BBQ, I want to enjoy myself. I might want to have a conversation with my friends before ordering. I expect someone to show me to my table, and tell my waiter will be right with me. I want that waiter to take our drink order, make some suggestions and then return to take our orders. I want this waiter to bring me my damn food, and clear the plates when I am finished. Yes, when eating at a restaurant, I expect the basics. While the food is great here. If I wanted to wait in line to order, get my food, eat and leave, I would go to In-N-Out, not a restaurant where you pay $25 per person. Phil's food is five stars. Everything else deserves one. My Yelpulator says that equals 2.

I guess the saying, will drive for good food would definitely an understatement considering where I am from, but it was definitely worth the travel. I guess this is just another 5 star review for such an awesome place...Definitely worth the hour wait. The meat from the Baby back ribs just literally fell off the bone. If I was an animal, I'll quiet happily walk to the slaughter house if I knew my meat would be going to this awesome place. Highly recommended.

UPDATE (3/11/08) MY SECRET IS OUT:  You can no longer order your food to go & roll up & eat it there.  They have rules against it.  This was the only way for me to bypass the long wait 'cause I can't wait that long for Phil's BBQ - I have low blood sugar.  I don't know who told, but I'm never telling them another secret again. What's to say that hasn't already been said? Phil's BBQ is delicious.  The sauce is an explosion of sweet, tangy, & spicy.  I like to lick the bone because I love the taste of the burned parts mixed with the sauce.  I usually order the beef ribs w/ potato salad & onion rings.  The potato salad is very good & the onion rings are to die for.  They're beer battered so that makes them even better.   It's always busy here, but ask the staff and they'll find you a seat.  The staff is very efficient at clean tables and finding seats for everyone.

You already know from the bajillion reviews this place has that it's the bomb. If you haven't been here, go. Now. Unless it's a monday, when it's closed. Or unless you're on a diet. But everyone else, no excuses. Here's a really useful hint if you A) Are 21+, B) Are waiting in line during rush hour, and C) Don't mind eating at the bar: When you walk up and see that HUGE line, don't wait. Walk straight up and you'll see an EMPTY line that says "phone in orders." Walk down that area and ask to be seated at the bar. You can then order your food right there without waiting in the huge line. Most people are either with family or want to sit at a booth so there's usually VERY little wait at the bar.

Really what can i say about Phil's that you probably haven't already read yet? Amazing food and BBQ sauce!. Be prepared to wait in line when you get there ... it can look pretty intimidating sometimes but is worth the 20-30 minute wait. If you don't feel like waiting for dine- in there's always to-go ordering which is much faster. I usually get the ribletts dinner combo which has always left me with left overs (still not bad to eat next day either!) and is overall a pretty good value. Highly recommend for people looking for some good San Diego food hot spots :)

I rated it 2 stars at first, but that was just thinking it was overrated.  It deserves a 3.  Yeah, the shredded pork is tender. You know what the best way to make pork tender and shredded is? BOIL IT FOR 4 HOURS! Doesn't make it bbq. This little thing called "flavor" is what makes bbq. The white meat chicken chunks are a bit dry. You know why? They're white meat chicken chunks. Healthy bbq? Gimme a break. Grill me a thigh or a drumstick, IF you need chicken. Fries, beans, onion rings, and slaw ranged from decent to yummy. But nothing about any of it screams BBQ. If there wasn't any sauce on anything, I wouldn't know it was supposed to be a bbq place. Here's what I'm tired of. First of all, people who decide San Diego has no worthwhile bbq because the masses say this is the best and it's not too great. Yelp is usually reliable. In this case it's not. To paraphrase another yelper, going here and condemning San Diego bbq is like going to Red Lobster and condemning San Diego seafood. San Diego isn't Memphis when it comes to bbq, but go give a try to Wrangler Family BBQ in el cajon. THAT's good, authentic, smoked (imagine that) bbq. EDIT: Revised from 2 to 3 stars, because I think that's what it deserves. Changed my mind about penalizing them for not living up to the hype. Not their fault. Also upgraded my opinion of the sides.

Went there at 3 PM on a Sunday afternoon and suprised to see the line went around the corner at such an odd time - apparently they're giving away free food, althoug our local friend said that the line was usually that long during lunch or dinner hours. She told us to order to-go instead and voila - the line is very short compared to the dine-in line. Ordered the beef ribs and onion rings - the ribs were huge, well seasoned while the sauce compliment the seasoning. Onion rings were also big and went very well with the ranch sauce provided.

Call me crazy but I wasn't super impressed - maybe this is because we got take-out?  Or maybe because I've been spoiled my whole life with a family of awesome barbecuists (is that a real word?). Surprisingly, I hadn't heard about Phil's until recently (and I grew up in San Diego).  Everyone swears by this place, so I was pretty excited to try it.  Got the BBQ ribs and there was nothing wrong with them but nothing really memorable either.  The meat was tender enough so it wasn't chewy or anything... but not fall off the bone, melt in your mouth awesomeness.  Also, I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce.  Not my personal taste, and sauce makes a big difference with me when it comes to ribs. Overall, I'd eat here again if I were in the neighborhood or someone were picking it up for me.  But I wouldn't go out of my way or wait in line to eat here again.

The line looked daunting, around the corner, with 10-15 people behind the sign that says "21 minutes." However, the 4.5 stars and 1600 reviews were backing me, I was ready to conquer. After an hour, my boyfriend and I were ready to order. We decided on the full baby back ribs dinner with macaroni salad and fries $18, as well as the full beef ribs only $18. The portions were with about 5 for the beef and 12 for the baby back ribs. There were also a myriad of drinks to pick from. like, 7 different types of iced tea? i was so indecisive! Food came relatively fast, within 10 minutes of ordering. The portions were a little too much, even for our starved stomach. I did see a lot of people taking them home, but since we weren't gonna take it back to LA anytime soon, we forced ourselves to finish it. The two of us managed to annihilate the meat, and the macaroni salad, however the fries were hardly touched. it was also cold and a little soggy by the time we finished out meat. The baby back ribs were sweet and tangy, eat with hands or knife, the choice is yours. i thought it was a little too saucy and sweet for me, hence both my bf and i preferred the beef. which had a more distinctive smoked flavour, and wasn't sweet. Very juicy and tender meat that slipped out of its bone with a ease. The macaroni salad was a much needed break from all the meat. Unfortunately, the fries were light and nicely browned, but were cold by the time we ate some meat. Ambiance and service were all satisfactory. The seat and table of the booth is a little close together though. *** Tip: Share to try both beef and baby back, unless you are planning to take out, a full with sides and a half is enough for 2 people. beef if you're more savory and pork if you like sweeter tastes. line is about 1 hour long on weekends. The line was still long at 3pm, although it might have only been a 30 minute wait. Favourites: Great quality bbq. the beef. Do not want: long wait. too, too much sauce at times. Last words: If you love bbq, the line is worth it. if you're not a huge fan, try it just once.

I hope I don't get stoned for writing such a sucky review of Phil's. Well, maybe getting stoned would be kinda nice now that I think about it. Here's the deal....I am a BBQ snob.  I was raised in the south.  Yes, where it's hotter than hell in the summer and the ONLY way to cook meat March thru October is outside.  The vampires that kidnapped me at birth from the hospital (I'll refer to them as my family) brainwashed us with the belief system that we HAD to eat meat and that flesh is our life force.  My family hasn't changed much over the years, except now they suck the life out of me too.   Anyway.... On this particular day, the wait line @ Phil's  was 1 1/2 hours-2 hours deep, so I called in an order from the car and it was ready immediately.  If I would have waited in line for any amount of time, for this quality of meat...it would have been freaking anarchy.   The baby backs were far superior to the full ribs. But, in comparison to the ribs that I've digested as chunks of decaying flesh in my gut throughout my life...Phil, my darling, listen. You need a trip to Austin, Texas.  They could show you a few things.   And also, where are you buying your beef?  Are they porking up these cows with ho-ho's and twinkies? Burnt fat is not tasty. So, the star break down: One star for not having to wait.  Even though a car picnic was not what I had in mind, I appreciate opportunity to save time. One star for the nice guys at the counter and the really unhealthy but delicious homemade whoopie pie.

If I could describe the food in one word it be "YUM!" the babyback ribs literally fall right off the bone. The beef ribs are also Really good if I could I'd get both haha. I usually get the half dinners and that always fills me up even if I don't finish the sides. They also have a separate station to wash your hands! Which I think was smart of them. The employees are also super nice. Great service and even greater food. The only thing I don't like about phils is that there also seems to be a bigass line. The wait is horrendous on weekends. Last time I went was on Thursday around 230 so we didn't have to wait too much. Anyway if you're in SD you should definitely drop by.

First off, let's silence some of the detractors and identify what Phil's is not: authentic BBQ. Yeah, I said it, Phil's BBQ, the best BBQ in San Diego, is not even really BBQ. I've been to KC (the city, not the dirty establishment in downtown) and had "real" pit BBQ and yeah, it is amazing. Does that mean Phil's isn't good? No, that just means you are a food snob too high on your horse for your own good. When it comes down to it, call it whatever you want, it's still delicious. That being said, I have been a Phil's devotee for more than 7 years and frequented the small, cramped location in Mission Hills long before they opened in the Sports Arena area. Over the years I have turned on dozens (literally) of friends to the establishment and can't say I've ever had anyone say they were disappointed. As far as the food goes, they have more than maintained the quality from their previous location and I still can't get enough of their sauce. The Ribless Dinner is my personal favorite with tender bites of boneless pork smothered in that sauce. A side of fries to soak up the extra sauce and some baked beans make a satisfying meal. The Sports Arena location is obviously a lot bigger than the old Mission Hills location and is very nice. My only complaint is that they have stopped allowing phone-in orders for dine-in. I always thought that it was a nice way of rewarding the loyal customers, those who knew the ropes, by allowing them to beat the one and a half hour wait. As much as I love the food, I find myself going much less often because I can't find the time to endure the wait. If Phil has made the decision to cater to the tourist crown who will visit once and never again, so be it, but I am afraid it is at a cost of some of his long time repeat customers.

Damn near perfect ribs.  The barbeque sauce they use is the perfect combination of tangy and spicy.  I wish I had a larger stomach.  For my sides, I got the fries and potato salad.  The fries were pretty standard, but the potato salad was really fresh - possibly one of the best potato salads I've ever had.  It's not the pre-packaged, reheated kind.  They actually chop up their potatoes and make it.  Delicious.   Like others have mentioned, the line can be ridiculous.  It's extra hard to stand around and wait when you're starving, and watch as everyone else enjoys their mouth-watering ribs and sides.  However, that won't deter me from revisiting this establishment if I ever make it back down to San Diego.

Most people are inclined to give this place 4 or 5 stars because they think that they're supposed to or something. Or because they waited in some hour long line with freinds of there's who couldn't stop ranting and raving about this "new" place they found. Whatever the reasons, I don't think I'll be joining that elite group of Yelpers. Yes...Phil's was better when it was in that tiny little hole in the wall up in Mission Hills/Hillcrest. The food was fresher, the atmosphere was quaint, and you really felt like you were in one of those tiny shacks you happen upon while taking the 2 day drive through Texas. Now that Phils is in the Sports Arena area, it has lost 75 percent of its quality, 95 percent of its charm, and 110 percent of its character. The employees have ZERO personality. (I apologize if any of you Phils employees are reading this) They all act like they haven't slept for days. The one's that ARE awake spend more time talking to fellow co-workers, and they all kinda have this low frequency mumble dialect they speak in which is hard to hear. The food is mostly prepared to order, but the stuff that isn't, REALLY isn't! The beans, the slaw, the dreadful potato salad, all taste like they are from yesterday or even the day before. The BBQ sandwiches are still good and so are the ribs, but at the prices they are asking, they HAVE to be. The decor is so tired and worn out. Road House Grill, Famous Dave's, Lone Star, Chili's even. They all have that same southern backwoods corregated metal shack look that doesn't impress me anymore. I don't think it ever DID, but back in the early 1990's it was stylish as hell. Should you try Phil's? Sure. You may really like it. But please go in there with an open mind and a critical eye.

I think the reviews are inflated because by the time the customers actually get to eat their food after waiting in line they're starved out of their minds and anything they eat tastes exponentially better. The bbq here is pretty great though. The sauce is sweet and tangy, and the meat falls off the bone so easily. The onion rings are also delicious. Everything goes down so easily when it's oily and bbq/ketchup dipable. Really friendly and helpful staff, despite the long waits. Btw: the "Tickler" = greattt deal. 7 bucks for 3 sizable ribs, 2 onion rings, coleslaw and a heaping load of fries? I'm sold!

Every time I come here it gets better and better!   You can always expect to wait in line when you arrive-thats a given- but now there is an outside bar (!!!!), they serve you French fries and other snacks in line and the heat lamps (which I'm not sure if those are new) keep you warm and toasty while you wait.  They want to keep you happy before you enter the door, during your visit and after  which is OK with me. The staff is always friendly, which is impressive because BBQ joints can sometimes attract rowdy unpleasant crowds (I've been witness to it).   I don't visit Phils too often because it is a time commitment, but when I do I always have a great time and would recommend this place to anyone looking for good BBQ.

Why are these ribs so damn tasty?! Its like these beef ribs come from happy cows, and happy cows only come from California.  The beef ribs are to die for. I have gone to Phil`s multiple times and have tried the beef ribs. Most times they are so succulent that the meat falls off the bone with the gentlest touch.  On the other hand, the baby back ribs are not even on the same level as the beef ribs. These baby back ribs are analogous to good ol` tony romas (which suck).  You can choose 2 small sides or 1 large side to go with your 3 rib dinner.  The fries are mediocre, onion rings are the smooth kind which taste like air (fried nothingness), the best thing to get is the pasta salad and bbq beans. It sucks waiting in a long line but that's all part of the Phil`s BBQ experience.  As your stomach is growling, hunger pains hurting, and mouth is watering, you watch people in the patio like it's a thanksgiving feast from an episode from Family Matters. You can smell the special BBQ sauce smoking out of Phil`s chim chim chimney chim chim charoo.  Its a pregame strategy to order with your stomach and not your mind; so by the time you get up to the front of the line you`ll end up ordering the full rack (5 ribs) of beef ribs instead of the 3 rib beef rib dinner. Its genius on Phil`s behalf. When you're feeling for a tangy and sweet beefy fill, Phil`s BBQ got yo baby back (not the ribs haha or not...). If you don't feel like waiting in the long ass line, order ahead and walk past the line of sweat dripping from the tongue peeps to pick up your order. Just don't try to phone in your order and sit down like you waited in line, cuz I did that once and they said not to do it again or you`ll be forever banned from tasty goodness.. jk but they said its ok this time cuz its not busy but whatevers. Great flavor and beef rib tenderness! Phil`s BBQ is on my top 10 eateries just north of the border.

Literally, as good as it gets! Phil's catered my wedding at the La Jolla Cove Suites and did a superb job.  From the first contact, they were professional and responsive.   At our tasting we noted that we had 'special diet' guests.  Sarah came up with several delicious and filling options for our veggie/vegans. Not only was their food top-notch, their service is second to none. Every time I was in contact with Phil's for any reason, they gave me complete confidence that I was working with professionals.   Oh, and ....everyone RAVED about the food!  Thanks, Phil's!

Came here after hearing a lot of great things during my visit to San Diego.  When we first arrived, the line was out the door, so I was a little discouraged because I didn't want to wait that long, but a sign said it was only a 20 minute wait from where we were standing which was very accurate. They have menus all over while you wait, and again, I was disappointed when I saw they didn't have brisket, just ribs and chicken.  I thought it would have more variety but that's ok, ribs will do.  Then I was disappointed when I saw that there was no wait service at your table, and you order at the front and seat yourself, like Armadillo Willy's.  :( Ordered the baby back ribs with beans and potato salad and hot diggity dog, those were some damn good ribs.  Tender and plenty meaty.  I was satisfied completely.  The reason for 4 stars is that they drown their ribs in sauce, which they freely and proudly advertise, and I prefer mine dry.  They do offer to serve the ribs dry with sauce on the side but I was being a dumbo face. I will stop by again next time I'm in the San Diego area.

I am updating my review.  It's unfortunate I have to also, because it was something so dumb.  Their food is still as awesome as before... but one thing really bugged me.  We waited 1.5 hrs for dinner.  No problem.  We were seated and enjoying our meal and the Laker game was on.  Two minutes left in the game and they changed the channel.  No problem.  We asked them to change it back.  Their response was that people was not leaving so they couldn't play the Laker game.  WTF?  One TV behind us was on... so we turned around to watch the game.  Wow.  I actually had to stay longer because I couldn't eat and watch because the game was behind me... so disappointing... Morale of the story?  Don't come here during a Laker game!

Let me start this out by saying something.... I don't like barbeque sauce. Actually, I really don't like it. I avoid it at all costs. So Wilmar D. told me that he wanted to take me to Phil's BBQ. So I said okay, I like BBQ. We waited in what seemed like a humongous line, but the line went very fast. There isn't a lot of seating on a busy day like Saturday, but we were able to find a table luckily and soon after we were seated, our food was ready (wow, ridiculously fast). I ordered a quarter portion of ribs. To my dismay, it was smothered in BBQ sauce (I don't know why I didn't expect this). But I'm willing to try pretty much anything, even though I had my doubts. um. It was SO good. Yea, I'm not a fan of bbq sauce. But their sauce was tasty and tolerable, for a hater like myself hehe. The meat was REALLY REALLY good and fell right off the bones. It was soooooo yummy. SO so SO so SO delicious. I didn't think I would give this place 5 stars. But it really surprised me (the whole BBQ sauce thing). And their service is very fast. And their meat is REALLY good. Go here. I know I'm gonna come back :)

Rvw #524 on this place....amazing place.  Rather than bore you with the details. I'll be brief.   - The line was quicker than I had originally imagined. - Hostess was hella cool.  Large African American woman with the coolest personality.  She kinda reminded me of that comedianne Monique?  She even kicked out the laggers that wouldn't leave, but in a polite way.  She seemed to do it with style.  We were celebrating my birthday and I had 14 people to sit.  Well these ladies were just shooting the shit,  taking their sweet ass time after eating their meal . - Got me a Phill's BBQ shirt and gift card as one of my presents.  Thanks Mike and Bev! - Best of both world's.  Good item for the novice rookie. - Drinking beer (from the bar) in line while waiting.  Classic

My 2-star review is ultimately meaningless amongst the 960 reviews already here... Anyway, after being on 30' boat for over 24 hours (we caught 12 ahi tuna, 1 yellowtail, and 1 mahi, woohoo) I was stoked to have some hot, delicious food.  My friends were talking this place up, but frankly, I was not impressed. First off, the line didn't look that long, but I was deceived by the sign overhead claiming "wait time from this point, 21 minutes and 40 seconds" or some crap like that.  Try almost 40 minutes... Anyway, I got a half rack of baby back ribs and 1 extra beef rib, with baked beans, cole slaw, and onion rings.  Upon tasting my food, I immediately wished that I had gotten all beef ribs and no baby backs.  The pork ribs simply were not tender enough... I still had to rip the meat off the bones with my teeth . And their BBQ sauce -  WAAY too much of it, and WAAAY too much vinegar in it!  The sauce was overpoweringly sour, and I didn't care for it... I would rather have had no sauce at all.  The baked beans were lukewarm (but tasty) and the cole slaw was great.  I must admit, the onion rings were pretty awesome.   With the main attraction being the meat, I was not impressed with the food.  For less than $30, I feel like this place is a great value... but if only they did something about that BBQ sauce, I'd actually want to come back.

Hey San Diego BBQ lovers, this is THE spot! 45 minute wait out the door on a Saturday night but it's worth it! I ordered "Best of Both" with half order of ribs and chicken. Love the tenderness, love the spicy barbecue sauce. There is also a full bar and sports section divided off from the restaurant. Friendly service all around and southern hospitality! Never disappointed when coming here. Heads UP: CLOSED ON MONDAYS!! (Went on a Monday before and was HURT!)

Okay, maybe it's because my father hails from St. Louis, THE place for ribs...and maybe it's because my dad makes the best ribs EVER, but I don't get it. Don't get me wrong, the BBQ was okay, but mind-blowing? Really? The BBQ sauce just doesn't have the balance of spicy and sweet and tangy that I'm looking for. And the ribs were just a bit too oversmoked. Again-balance. I didn't find that in these ribs. The fries weren't that great, in fact they were kind of soggy/stale and the baked beans were also "just okay", though honestly the best part of the meal other than my iced tea. There was quite a line when we arrived and that line was doubled when we left. We decided to skip it and sit at the bar where the service was alright, but at least much faster. You do have to get up and get your food yourself, unless apparently you're snobs  visting from Mexico City then the bartender will make an exception and retrieve your food for you, along with your drinks...Sorry, I'm all about great customer service, but  I'm also about equal customer service. I don't know. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again and I see all of these five star reviews and wonder what people are comparing it to. Phil's just didn't do it for me.

Good bbq... the wait in line to order was a bit of a pain, but the search for a seat was not as bad as I expected.... esp for a group of like 18. :) Ordered the bbq baby back pork ribs and 1/4 chicken, cole slaw, potato salad, onion rings. The bbq was good... meat was good.... I think i like my bbq more smokey like in the meat... it relied on the sauce a bit, thought it was still good. The chicken wasn't dry but it was on the border. The sauce was tangy and sweet (honey-ish). I like my sauces more tangy than sweet and this was to my liking. The slaw was decent, but then i'm only so-so when it comes to cole slaw. The potato salad was good (like the dill) with good texture and not overly mayo/mustardized as some can be. My friend said the mac salad was better, but i didn't try the mac salad myself... thought it looked awesome too. I loved the onion rings. Light crispy batter. The order was huge. fyi... portions are pretty big... maybe too big for one, maybe big enough for 2 moderate eaters.

I never believed in ribs til I tried Phil's famous half-rack of ribs. I never ate ribs that my mom used to make for me as a kid. I hate getting my hands dirty and am not a believer of finger food, especially at public restaurants. The ribs here thankfully are so soft and tender, that it's so easy to eat with a fork and knife. Call me high maintenance, but it's a lot easier to eat and a lot less messy! The half rack always satisfies. I'm a small girl, but the half rack does the job. If you're not that hungry, get the tickler. Sometimes, I order the half-rack and my friend orders the tickler and our dishes look identical, give or take one bone. Lame... I try to stay healthy so I order the mac salad and cole slaw as my sides. I try to stay away from the french fries but I sneak them into my order occasionally. They go so well with the fries seasoning, yum! The onion rings are a hit or miss. Sometimes they taste like paper machet. Though I've never tasted paper machet. The lines are ridiculously long especially on the weekends. But I forgive- the wait and anticipation makes the food taste even more delicious. Mr. Phil, I'd just like to say thanks for introducing me to ribs that are out of this world. Sincerely, E.

This place has great BBQ. I love BBQ and this is a place I can see my self coming to over and over again. We drove from L.A for 2 things this day, The Whaley house and Phil's BBQ. I gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons. 1. The line was ridiculous over 1 1/2 hours, lines at Disneyland move quicker and 2. The BBQ itself, they only use one sauce it seems like and it is way too acidic for me since I have acid reflux and heartburn. The best thing I think on the menu was the onion rings best I ever had and yes we will be going back.

- Baby back ribs - My fav!  Very tender!  I'll stick to this next time! - BBQ chicken - Good, but too bad the white meat was dry. - BBQ pulled pork sandwich - Good, tons of meat piled on. Their sauce is nice and tangy.. I like!  Fries, potato salad, macaroni salad, and cole slaw were all good as well.   Some tips: - They give a lot of more food when you dine in instead of takeout.   - They put bbq sauce on everything, so you'd have to tell them if you don't want it. - Line moves pretty fast.

Thank you fellow Yelpers! I have found THE PLACE to get my BBQ fix. You start off in a line that wraps around the building, but don't let it fool you. The line moves quickly. When you get close enough to the ordering counter, someone from your group should split off and reserve a table. The menu is advertised throughout the line so that everyone usually knows what they are ordering way before they reach the counter. You order your food, receive a buzzer that will buzz when your food the ready. You pick up your food at the pick-up counter and the rest is history. LOVED: the baby back ribs. Doesn't matter whether you get it in a half rack, full rack, in a chicken combo... JUST GET IT! You won't regret it. So flavorful and tender. The onion rings are a must have. Thick, crunchy exterior. Sides I tried were the potato salad, fries, cole slaw, and beans... all yummy. It's safe to say that you can order anything on the menu and won't be disappointed. I'll definitely be back for more!

On a day trip to San Diego, my boyfriend and I researched and through the help of yelp, we decided to check out this joint. We love BBQ so we were sure this place would hit the spot.It sure did. First off, be prepared for long a$$ lines. We waited for a good 20-30 minutes until we were finally seated. To my surprise it's like a fast food joint. You basically order your food and get a number and find your own seat. You get your own drinks and wait for your number to be called. Once it's called, you go and pick up your order. They definitely do not bring the food and serve you like a sit-down restaurant. This wasn't a huge deal to me but I was just surprised that's all. The ribs were alright. I have had better ribs from other joints in the past so these were nit my personal favorite ribs to have. I am not a huge fan of their bbq sauce either. But their chicken was very good and tender and juicy. I was really sad to hear they do not serve mashed potatoes or mac and cheese. I was kinda craving it with my ribs but couldn't have any. BOO! So I ended up getting a turkey BBQ burger while my boyfriend got the chicken and ribs with fries. Everything tasted ok, but just not the best we've ever had. But the major plus is the fact the food is so cheap. I think for 2 of us we spent less than $20. That's a great deal for BBQ food.

Phil's is YUMMY! I don't usually enjoy BBQ, but due to the super high ratings, the episode of Man v. Food, and my husband's love of the stuff, I decided to give it a try. Upon our arrival, we were met with a line wrapping around the building.  My husband decided he didn't want to wait in such a long line, but I talked him into it since we were only in San Diego for a few days. When we moved a few spaces up in line we saw a sign that quoted a wait time of less that twenty minutes...kind of like the signs you see at amusement parks to get on a ride.  The sign turned out to be pretty accurate, as we managed to sit down and eat relatively quickly. The staff at Phil's is friendly and fairly attentive even though you're responsible for placing your order and picking it up at the counter.  They still come around to your table and make sure you're doing alright and will get you almost anything you may need. So, as for the food....because of Phil's, I can now say I love BBQ.  They're sauce is tangy and the meat is moist and tender. The sides are super delicious, too.  We got a plate of the beef ribs with chicken and a plate of the baby back ribs.  All of the BBQ was yummy!  For the sides we got the mac salad, the fries, and the corn. I think the mac salad is some of the best we've had...it was light and flavorful.  The corn was sweet and complimented the meat nicely.  We ate the fries with ketchup and some of the BBQ sauce that had dripped off the ribs which was super yummy. After we had nearly finished our meal we talked about trying to get back to Phil's once more before returning to SF. Unfortunately, we were unable to make it back on that trip, but will definitely revisit the next time we're in SD.

The Good: Tender, tasty, saucy ribs for a good price including sides that are all awesome!  The place is wide and feels like a real barbeque, filled with music and tv's for sports.  They make it quicker than other rib restaurants and the quality is absolutely better.  The employees are there are also very nice and will do anything to make your meal more enjoyable. The Bad: The wait.  So, once you arrive, be prepared to stand in a line, vaguely resembling something you would stand in for a rollercoaster ride.  The wait averages from 15 to 30 minutes just to get inside and order.  But it's worth it. Try: Baby Back Ribs. (obviously)  That is what they're good at, so go for the ribs.   All the sides are also delicious, but my favorites are macaroni salad, baked beans, and cole slaw. Don't Try: Ordering a lot of food just because you're hungry.  They actually give you a lot of food, so you might even consider sharing.

With all due respect to the fine employees that serve in one of the busiest restaurants in San Diego, the success of Phil's BBQ seems entirely propelled by the bandwagon mentality of its patrons rather than the quality of its cuisine. Truthfully, after standing in a 30-minute line for a basket of food, most of us would be hard pressed to admit the whole experience simply wasn't worth it. But having been raised on legit southern cooking, I owe it to myself to declare this place the Applebee's of BBQ. Everything is suffocated in sauce, and although fans of Phil's will contest that it can be ordered on the side, the meat really doesn't hold its own. Admittedly, my heart has always had a special place for that smoky Texan flavor, but the goods here are often overcooked and really don't taste like anything. Hence the growler of crimson gravy dumped on every plate. Still, I gotta give credit to the staff members that bust their ass at this joint. I was at the bar until just after they had locked the doors and not one employee seemed to mind. Everyone was really pleasant, despite working in what must be a very tiring environment. Quality service bumps my rating up to A-OK.

Phil's BBQ is the place to go in San Diego, or so I've been told (along with Extraordinary Desserts). My friends and I took a road trip down to SD on a President's Day weekend, giving me the opportunity to finally try this place. Being the foodies we are, we braved the ~40 degree weather and waited patiently for 2 and a half hours, instead of chickening out and finding refuge at an AYCE Chinese buffet place in the same plaza. It was tempting though. The line wrapped around the building and only grew longer as the night went on. We ended up playing a dozen or so rounds of Connections while waiting. Even for people dining in, orders are taken up at the front counter. Everyone's given a remote control-looking pager to let them know when their order's ready. Pretty neat contraption, imo. People who buy drinks are given different colored cups, but we shamelessly just used our water cups to pour ourselves beverages from the fountain tap. I think the wait staff is pretty lax about it too. I ordered the Baby Back Ribs & Chicken ($11.95), with sides of potato salad and cole slaw. I was a tad disappointed by the portions (4 baby back ribs and quarter breast of chicken) because my plate looked sort of empty. The pork ribs totally owned the chicken though, but there was way too much bbq sauce slathered onto the meat. All that smokiness and tang overwhelmed the flavors and juices of the barbequed meat. Potato salad was alright, but I thought the cole slaw was a bit soggy. Everyone else ordered variations of chicken, pork and beef ribs. I can't comment on how the beef tasted haha. My friend and I split colossal onion rings ($5.95), which came with ranch dressing dipping sauce. I don't particularly like ranch or milk-based dressings, so I just drenched these perfectly-fried onion rings in ketchup. Perfect amount of batter on these large onion rings. They made my day. Verdict: BBQ chicken is one of the world's most perfect food combinations. But given all the hype, I expected something so flavorful that it would induce a food orgasm, for the 2.5 hour wait. It's a good experience, all in all. That's all I can say about it.

Is it really necessary to write another great review for Phils?  I think, sure why not!!! We have been going to phils for years and have enjoyed everything from their menu including the bro potato (baked potato with pulled pork and cheese)  which was a special during restaurant week a few years back.  Have found phils sauce at Costco and has made me verrrrry happy that i can use on whatever i want.  The most unusual thing i have ever done with my leftovers is cut the meat off the rib bones, add some sauce and use it to fill a huge omelet.  Thank you for opening a bigger location, but please open more so we dont have to always wait in line.   One suggestion : BRO-FRIES  =   Fries with pulled pork, bbq sauce and cheese!!!!!

Wow, I can see by reading a good amount of the reviews that I'm not gonna fit in on this one, but here goes: Phil's is overrated and average at best.  I'm giving it one star because I had expectations, and they came crashing to the ground in a ball of bland flames known as the BBQ sandwich at this place.  I used to live around the corner, and I can smell hickory burnin' from a mile away, so I walked over to Phil's, sat down, ordered a sandwich, and started reading to kill the time.  After a while my sandwich arrived. And I nearly gagged as I noticed that the bun upon which my sandwhich came  was whole wheat.  I can't really say much more, I managed to choke it down.  It was nothing special.  Not awful, not great.  Average.  Whatever.  I was just crushed from the start.  You don't give someone a sandwich you're calling a "barbecue sandwich" and have it delivered on a whole wheat bun.  You just don't.  I know this is Southern California, but that's just wrong.  Wonderbread bun.  Buttered Texas Toast.  Those are the only acceptable options.   The ribs, never had 'em.  Won't spring for 'em.  The burger, not half bad at all.  Came back a few times for the burger.  But for a sandwich, I'd rather go to that place up in Encinitas, Big Jim's I think.  Half the hype, a third the price, and just as good.  O yah, and none of the crushing disappointment.

Nothing to write home about. First off, I love barbecue. Absolutely adore it. When some people recommend Phil's, I had to go! When I was told that there would be a long line, I didn't expect the line to wrap around the building. I thought that was a good sign. I shouldn't have had such high expectations. I was not blown away from the barbecue. I wasn't even impressed. There wasn't even that, "I'm-so-hungry-that-anything-is-going-to-taste-­good-must-eat-now" sense of satisfaction of having food in my stomach. The chicken, okay. Beef ribs, definitely had better. Onion rings, light batter, almost tempura-like, interesting. Sweet baked beans, outright watery and bland. Maybe we went on a bad day. I sure hope we did. Good: At least the employees were nice. Bad: The line, the food. Final: There are great barbecue places, this is not one of them.

Went skydiving and this was our destination after... and boy am I glad we came here... There was a line wrapped around the restaurant when we pulled into the parking lot, but it went pretty fast as this is a cafeteria style restaurant .. order, get a beeper, find a seat, get your food, sit down and devour! luckily, we had a party of 6, so we managed to be seated first before the line even got into the door. (I got to sit down versus the rest of the group and them having to stand there in line, tee hee) I go the half rack baby back ribs with fries and cole slaw, while the BF got the half rack and half boneless chicken with fries and macaroni salad. The ribs were delightfully flavorful and cannot be compared to Lucille's or any other places as this was way better. The fries were spectacular and I tried my best to finish all of mine. Luckily, I wasn't that hungry to finish my entire plate so I was able to have some food for lunch & dinner the next day.

Not that Phil's BBQ needs any more referrals, since this place is crazy BUSY, and even more so after being featured on the Travel Channel (Man vs Food). Business was bustling back when it was on Goldfinch St and Washington Ave in Hillcrest (except on when closed on Mondays). I swear that I'm going to try different menu items, but I can't get away from the usual food I love (more often than I should perhaps, i.e. my pic). My only wish list items are: 1) that the fries should be crisp like their onion rings, 2) that they add beef brisket on the menu, and 3) that they relocate in the sports arena to accomodate parking and dining room space for more hungry foodies. This isn't a debate over any BBQ bias from "traditional" areas in the Midwest and Southeast regions.  Just understand that people don't mind standing in line for food they really want. The line to place an order for eating in the dining room is out the door and stretches around the building. They'll occasionally check on the line to see if there are huge groups so they can organize tables in advance before the group's food order is taken. The atmosphere is casual and can get noisy at times because of the large crowds and good times being had. Don't want to stand in line to enjoy the full Phil's BBQ experience? If there are barstools available, you can bypass the line and sit down to place your order and eat at the bar. The other option is to call ahead and take it to-go. When you pick up a large catering order, the disposable aluminum pans are stored in stackable styrofoam containers for easy transport, and they are happy to help you load your car.  They'll ask that you return the styrofoam. Everyone there is friendly and the people buzzing around the dining room are promptly clearing off tables. Even though there are no actual table servers, there is always someone around to check on your from time to time to see if you're ok or if you need help with to-go boxes because you ordered too much food, again. The line can move like molasses, so be patient. Enjoying the full Phil's experience with friends is well worth the wait. Don't forget the wetnaps when you're done enjoying the BBQ love.

I LOVE Phil's BBQ! I love it to the point I drove 80 miles there on a Tuesday night for my birthday dinner. Is that not love? It's pure commitment to delicious beefy ribs and, awesome perks of cutting in line. How? Sign up for Phil's newletter (http://philsbbq.fbmta.co…) they send you an email the week before your birthday to jump to the front of the line for the whole week of your birthday. guy: EXCUSE ME! there's a LINNNNE me: i know, it's my BIRTHDAY Phil's employee: (waves me to cut and lets me order) /end scene Another funny story...you know you've been to Phil's too much when you phone in an order and they know you're name and that you order Brohams...scarrrry! They've finally caught on that people order via phone and eat their "take-out," -in to avoid lines. Innocent mistake O=) Get...anything here. Really. I use to only get baby back ribs, then it was the Broham crazy (to the point that I would bring it on the plane with me, and have others stare at me with jealousy) and now it's the beefy ribs crave. Too bad their mac salad and potato aren't that good...and they shut down the original location that had board games... but that is easily forgiven with the addition of a bar and big(ger) screen TVs. Ah, the good life!

This place is great by all means, but does not warrant the five stars that everyone seems to be giving it. When I finished my meal, although I was satisfied, I didn't leave wanting more. As for the positives, I ordered the baby back ribs which were good. They were a little oversauced for my tastes. The side dishes were also pretty good. I didn't care for the machine like atmosphere however. It was like a giant factory of overweight people.

THIS TIME, THE LINE WAS OUT THE DOOR AND AROUND THE CORNER ON A SUNDAY NIGHT! PLEASE READ MY PREVIOUS REVIEW. I've gone back 4 times since then but forgot to review it. Pros: -Same great comments as below. As always, they have a great and friendly staff. -Ordered their ribs with sauce on the side, sooooo much better! -Had the, pulled pork sandwich... PACKED with meat and topped with coleslaw. Great smokey flavor. -Also the the El Toro (tri-tip sandwich). The meat is thinly sliced, almost like deli meat. The flavor or aroma was to DIE for! When the sandwiches came to the table, everyone around me couldn't stop looking! Even after they got up, they said, "LOOK AT ALL THAT MEAT"! -BTW, their teas are yummy! -The line is long but it moves quick. Cons: -Pulled pork was very much on the dry side! Sadly, I was expecting a little better.  It was so dry, it was almost like shredded jerky. -Still not very fond of the honey-cinnamon bbq sauce flavor but it's good on the side.

Normally any "BBQ" that doesn't sport a plume of smoke coming from a metal drum or smokestack causes me to drive on by. I gave Phils a chance because they had so many yelps. Got there and stood in line on Sun am for 30 mins. Another no-no. In Chicago there places that serve three times PhilS customers on a daily basis and they have figured out how to get them in and out quickly and convenieBntly without inconveniencing the customers. The food is also good enough that they don't need "long lines" that are prefabricated to make people think the food is to die for. I was a little concerned that about 30-40% of the yelps were negative. Too much sauce, dried out chicken, long waits not worth it, etc.. But curiousity got the best of us. So here's our experience. Wait IS TOO Long. I guess in Cali everyone is so laid back they don't mind it. Get sauce on the side. Sauce is good but did notice that it's important to ask for it on the side. I have Never liked BBQ that didn't come from a smoker. It doesn't here. The chicken was not overcooked but it also seemed boiled and reheated. Macaroni salad highlight was mayo. Onion rings were "typical". Ribs were ok. I want to know who's list they are top 10 in America. The beaming recommendation of the valet at the Hilton was " maybe not the best anywhere, but the best in San Diego, I started to wonder. Arthur Brian's in Kansas City, Smoque in Chicago, half a dozen Memphis pits and many smoker bbqs all over the U.S. beat the flavor. They simply don't have the yelps. So for all those little smoker bbqs in America, here's a Yelp for you.

I love Phil's BBQ especially the onion rings. I order half a basket because the full one is huge and usually doesn't get finished. I would not recommend going during the weekend there is usually an hour wait. I usually go around 3-4pm week days. I would recommend the "El Torro" sandwich it is perfection.

The food here is definitely really good. The Beef ribs are tender and delicious. The BBQ chicken is awesome. One of the best things about this place is the sauce, the bbq sauce has that classic bbq flavor. Add some tabasco for heat, and its perfect. The only set back about this place, is that is it always crowded. I suggest you call ahead and take it to go....TAKE IT TO GO....CALL AHEAD....It will save you at least an hour...

I heart Phil's BBQ! I'm a San Diego native (rare thing, right?), so perhaps I don't know what qualifies as "authentic" BBQ.  All I do know is that this stuff is always good, and seriously addictive.  Everything I have had is oh-so tasty.  I usually order the Rib Tickler, which comes complete with 4 ribs, cole slaw, and 2 beer battered onion rings on a bed of fries.  Can we say guilty pleasure?  Oh my. The new location is awesome because it's large (there is always a crowd, day or night), there are tons of wide screen TVs playing baseball, basketball, soccer, and football, and they have patio dining and a BAR!  Oh, I almost forgot... blues music!  You can't go wrong with that, and nothing compliments some ribs better than some low down dirty blues. Not only is the food delicious, but the staff is so effing friendly and helpful.  If you go there regularly enough like we do, they greet you by your name and help you find a table.  Phil is always there and just about the nicest guy -- go say 'hi'.  He must be doing something right:  Great food + great service = loyal customers Oh, final bonus.  They stay open to like 11pm.  We go there late on a friday and the place is still packed!  Finger lickin' good.  In fact, I think I know what's for dinner tonight ;)

Yummmmmm! Ok that's all. Ok I must expand a little more than that.  I am definitely not a vegetarian and love Phil's because of this.  It is all meat and the meat is really good.  I love their pulled pork sandwich and the babyback ribs.  The meat is so tender and delicious.  Don't let the long line intimidate you, it goes really fast.

I have heard about Phil's BBQ for years. However, as I am not a huge BBQ fan, I never had the urge to go. But this week is restaurant week, so I thought I'd stop in and try their special. Let me first say that I'm not exactly sure what "BBQ" really means. I mean I know they barbecue the meat and have some special sauce for it. But, there seems to be some synergistic effect of the process of cooking the meat and the quality of the sauce that people are refering to while exclaiming  "I love BBQ!" I'm kind of getting it now. But, I don't crave my meat swimming in sweet tangy sauce. Whatever. Their restaurant week special for $20 was: 2 sides, a ton of meat, and a dessert (whoopie or Nestle ice cream cone). I got the Caesar salad and baked potato for my sides: pretty good. The beef rib was awesome, pork rib not bad, chicken good. The "whoopie" in both regular and red velvet was interesting. It was an over sized cookie sandwich with vanilla cream in between (although weirded out by them at first, I ate quite a bit of them). For not being a big BBQ person, the taste of the BBQ sauce was as good as it could have been. The tenderness of the meat was amazing--meat falling right off the bone. Final notes: decent draft beer selection and friendly staff.

I used to love Phil's until the last two times my beef ribs were really, really dry.  It seems their quality has went down over time.  All I can say is the wait is not worth the dry beef ribs I received in the end.  Their french fries are still good though?  There are other BBQ options like Coop's Western Texas BBQ or Bull's Smokin' BBQ where you do not have to wait hours in line for an overly hyped establishment.  Worth the wait for BBQ you can get somewhere else? On your own discretion.

It's not like Phil's is gonna die without my review, but in fairness, I find myself wanting to go out of my way these days, just so I can drive by and open my car windows.  I've become a Phil's addict.  There, I said it.  I crave the smoky goodness that wafts around that part of the world. My first visit was on Tuesday night.  The second visit had to wait until, yep, Wednesday night.  Good thing I had plans on Thursday.   The other reviews here go into way more detail.  If you want good Barbeque in San Diego, Phil's is a must.  Hey, it's not Dreamland Barbeque, but as good as it gets in these parts. Positives: Large portions of delicious ribs and fixins. Negatives: Long line and wandering around looking for a table. And, yes, I did the bar thingy on my second trip, but that won't work when I start bringing other people here with me. Anyway, enjoy!

The hillcrest location is long gone, I can no longer hang out with my homies.  I miss it, but I'll just have to get used to this new location.  This is bigger and more efficient, but doesn't have the same feel.  Regardless, the food is the same and it is AWESOME. Any good restaurant will have a wait.  It's just a fact of life and a sign that whatever is on the other side is something spectacular. Best BBQ anywhere.  Like best in the world.  The El Torro sandwich and onion rings are what I always get.  I take my friends here that grew up in San Diego and they're always amazed at how good the food is and at the fact that they've never been there before.

I have been to Phil's close to ten times with the first visit being at the old Goldfinch location.  Over the years their food has been consistently good and a safe bet for taking family, friends and out-of-towners out for a decent meal.   There's only been one time when I felt bad about introducing Phil's to the uninitiated.  A couple of friends visited me from Oceanside and happened to be huge pork rib fans.  It was an off-night and the meat was a little dry and to put it nicely, didn't exactly fall off of the bone.  Besides this aberration, Phil's has been solid.   So far I've had the: pork ribs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…), Broham (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…), El Toro, cheeseburger, onion rings, fries, cole slaw, beans and bbq chicken chunks (in Chickless meals).  Unless the quality quickly slides downhill on my next visit, I'll keep on coming back.

Great ribs, great rings, poor value. My friend brought me here in April of 2007 with the intention of introducing me to one of the best San Diego food joints (In & Out was eaten soon thereafter).  I had a sandwich (I can't remember which one) and I didn't understand all the ranting and raving for this place. I gave Phil's another try this last Sunday.  We ordered for pickup and were happy when we arrived to see a line of 50ish people extending around the restaurant's corner.   We got a full rib combo with slaw, fries and an order of onion rings.  The fries were great and the rings were even better.  I was definitely impressed with the taste of the pork ribs but for all that food (not much) it was 25 bucks.  I'll be going back but the value isn't there.

I wish someone told me these few things when I was standing more than an hour in line! (1) The minute you reach the patio portion of the restaurant, YOU CAN DRINK. Grab a beer, get a little wasted, makes standing in line THAT MUCH BETTER! (2) Have a party of less than 4 people? GO TO THE BAR! I FUCKING DID NOT KNOW YOU COULD ORDER FROM THE BAR! You can skip the whole line and park your keester there and eat! Why I always decide to eat here on a Sunday, I will never figure out but if I knew these things first it would make my waiting time that much more enjoyable!

I don't eat red meat, but I can honestly say that I could live off of Phil's BBQ by just eating the veggie burgers and onion rings.  If you're a vegetarian you know that living off of veggie burgers would be a difficult, if not impossible feat. The line is long but if you're smart you'll call ahead and laugh at all the newbies who have to wait to order their food while you waltz up, grab your buzzer and wait 5 minutes for your dinner.  Victory is sweet. And yes, it's not the old school Mission Hills location, but it's bigger and you can drink, so stop whining.

Holy cow...or bar-b-qued cow. Whatever. I used to go to Phil's often when it was at it's Hillcrest / Mission Hills location. It was fabulous BBQ, if you're into that kind of sauce laden meat food that makes your mouth start to water when you catch a whiff of the place from two blocks away. The menu isn't very large in terms of selection, but what would you expect from a place that throws meat in some kind of cooker and slaps BBQ sauce on it. It is what it is, and what it is is Delicious. You can get all forms of BBQed Beef and Pork ribs, along with BBQed chicken, or mesquite grilled chicken. Pretty straight forward. And for those of you that turn your noses at eating meat directly off the bone, as an ex-girlfriend of mine was, there's even a meal selection that involves chunks of chicken cooked with the BBQ sauce. No bones about it. What I think it pretty cool about the place is that they're even vegetarian friendly, with salad selections, and various side orders of corn on the cob, steam veggies, potato or macaroni salad, french fries, baked beans, slaw...normal backyard or family reunion type BBQ sides. For those of you than knew Phil's before they moved from their above mentioned location, if you thought to show up mid way through the lunch hour or on a Friday night for dinner....you may very well have been eating your meal standing up, as the venue wasn't that big. But you stayed to eat your meal standing or you got it to go, because it was that good. Now at their Sports Arena location, Phil's can house at least three times the amount of patrons, and they also are sporting a full bar, complete with beer from local micro breweries. Now, my only words of warning are these...the sauce can get everywhere, since they're kinda liberal with using it.  And, the sauce has a little bit of a spicey taste to it.  So those of you that are overly sensitive to spicey anything may end up drinking a lot of water, beer, etc.

On my way to Del Mar and decided to see what Phil's was about. Parked to find a line around the building, which is what I was expecting. No worries. Made friends in line that gave me and the Mrs. the lowdown and what they liked. 45 minutes later, we were ordering! We shared the pork Rib Dinner with macaroni salad and coleslaw, small order of Onion Rings and the Tri tip sandwich (Matador). Impressed with the service and how dialed in the operation is. Finding a seat was no problem. We have had traditional BBQ, so not sure what to expect. Pork Ribs were meaty and really good! Make sure to order extra sauce on the side to get your fix. The ribs can be a little dry, but that is the way i like it. The tri tip sandwich was excellent! The tangy sweet tastes was smokey and very flavorful. The onion rings were plentiful and so glad we ordered the small. They were crispy and really good! The sides were good too! To ne honest, this was an excellent dinner and was worth the experience. I am still dreaming about those ribs! Make sure to get a Red Velvet Whoopy Pie! AWESOMENESS! I will be back.

The beef ribs and pork ribs speaks for itself. Falls off the bone, sweet, juicy and full of bbq goodness. The side dishes are nothing to write home about though. Who cares if the onion rings are oversized, it's just onion dipped in batter! The coleslaw and fries were just ok too. For those who are hesitant about the long line, don't be! We saw a helpful tip from another Yelper who suggested to opt for Take Out (instead of Dine-in). BEST decision ever!! My friends and I ordered and picked up our food in less than 15 minutes and headed to Balboa Park for lunch at the park.

Mmmmmm.....love BBQ in November. This place is hopping and the ribs certainly are delicious. Tender, fall off the bone. Wish they went easier on the sauce. Two racks, side of potato salad and sweet beans, just a great lunch. Strange, you order in a line, pay and then they give you a pager. You scramble around to find some seats (which you hope isn't too soiled from the previous customers who munched down their food) and then giddily await the pager to go off. It buzzes and you send someone to grab the grub and chow down. No fuss, no muss, just tasty BBQ food.

This is my fourth time ever going to Phil's and my first time coming back after I wrote my review.  I have to say that this time around, the food was exactly what I expected and was exactly like the first time I ever went there.   I again got the usual - Beefy ribs and Chickless ($11.95) After my first review, the owner was very kind enough to write a message to me in regards to my experience.  He suggested that I ask for the sauce on the side and that if the fries or the meat burnt/stale, then to ask the restaurant to make it over again.   So, I did ask for the sauce on the side and the meal was perfect! I got to really experience the tenderness and the true seasoning of the meat w/ the bbq sauce on the side.  It also appeared that the restaurant really took my experience into consideration.  This time around, none of the meat was burnt and the fries were perfect and soft!   As for the service, as always, it was perfect.  Our server was amazing and cute! He was the tallest (6' 9 in) server at the restaurant.   Thank you Phil's BBQ for a wonderful experience and for the delicious meal!

just aiiight.. not worth the wait. But, if there's not a wait, the BBQ chicken is good. I like all the yummy sides too. Macaroni salad, potato salad, fries, corn, beans, and the onion rings. I never get them though. I'm always afraid of becoming a lardo after a plate of onion rings. I would not recommend this place if there is a line. In fact, I'd tell you to head to Bull's. But, if the coast is clear, then by all means, get in, eat up, and get out. The service is eh, the food is eh, the prices are eh. Not bad.. just meh.

I enjoyed coming here and was worried about the hype. It certainly lived up to it but didn't exceed it. I visited on a Saturday a little after noon. The line wasn't as bad as I have heard it to be which was great. Set up wasn't what I expected... more like a corner bakery style place... you place your order, get your drinks, and come to the counter to claim your food. Between my other two guy friends, we ordered two beef rib dinners (which comes with 2 small sides or 1 large side) and a medium pork rib dinner. The beef ribs are gigantic... 2-3 plus a little of the sides could easily get you full (I'm a 190lb guy with a hearty appetite). I really preferred the beef ribs over the pork ones. The sauce was agreeable with my palette. For the sides, we tried the macaroni salad, baked beans and the coleslaw. I remember really liking the macaroni salad (strong red onion flavor if you're into that) and the coleslaw was better than average. Because I don't like baked beans all that much, I don't have much to say. Apparently, their onion rings are to die for. I really enjoyed my first two onion rings, but I can only take so much before I get sick of 'em. Share them with at least 3-4 people! The service here was abnormally great. The cashier did a lot of chit chat with me and even provided me a free drink. How nice is she! The bus boy also came by several times throughout the meal to make sure we were comfortable. All in all, good food, great service! I wouldn't say Phil's is the ultimate authority on BBQ, but they are pretty close!

Dear Phil, You have made another 2 LA residents fans of your BBQ joint. Your staff, food, and restaurant in all are fucking awesome. Love, Me We got there exactly at 11:07 (7 minutes after they opened) and already there was a line of about 20 people ahead of us. The line moved quickly and efficiently. It's smart how its set up for the volume of people who pass through. You're directed by a very nice man to a free cashier, get issued a taser likebeeper, find your own seating and wait for the little beeper to go off and grab your food. I got the Rib-less dinner with potato salad + cole slaw. Meat + sauce was delicious, potato salad a total winner, slaw was a little too sweet and fruity for me. I like it with more vinegar but it was refreshing nonetheless. Every staff member we interacted with gave 5-star service with smiles. The gentleman who was  walking around our section (His name tag read R. Af or something to that effect) made sure everything was in order and was so cool. He even pulled my chair out for me!!! How cute. He noticed my friend was watching her buzzer and me bury my face in the food so he went to check on her order and personally brought it over. I'm looking forward to making the trip down soon.

Great service here! Staff is extremely friendly :) I ordered the BBQ Baby Back ribs (that is pork) as well as the beef sandwich and they tasted pretty good. I'm a bit sensitive when it comes to saltiness, and I felt that the BBQ sauce on the ribs was a bit overwhelming for me, and I noticed myself constantly rubbing the sauce off the ribs before eating them. Nevertheless, the ribs were tender and the sandwich was huge and filling! The potato salad was very good, and the sweet baked beans were tasty. However, because of the crazy wait time, I wouldn't come back that often.

Ok finally made the decision to check out Phi's.  The line as always was wrapped around the front of the building and then around the side of the building.  Of course parking is almost impossible, cars circling like hawks over dead prey! The place is like a zoo, so packed with people.  For as crowded the place is always, there is only one toilet in the men's room!  There was a line of people waiting to use the toilet.  At least they did have a sink outside of the restrooms to wash hands. Moving from North Carolina, I know excellent BBQ.  This is not like a typical bbq place that I have been too. Regular bbq places always have a variety of squeeze bottle of bbq sauce at the table so you can try different types and add or drown your food in it if you so desire!! Phil's had no bbq sauce at the table.  Also they provide you with a cup for your soft drink u get your self and even your own food you need to pick up yourself once the buzzer stick goes off.  What is the sense of having any wait staff?! Overall the food was good, service was putrid.  Got one of the 2 side dishes wrong and no extra sauce bbq as was requested.  It was nearly impossible to get the servers attention.  Was more occupied with getting orders from tables one after another other checking on tables with their meals.   Finally got the attention of the server, but food was all but finished when the extra sauce arrived by the time 4 tables of drinks were served and got the sauce to me.   Be especially careful at the bar area, if you leave to replenish a drink or use the restroom your seat will be poached by people, waiting for a seat.  Happened twice during dinner!  Don't they see the food and drink at the stool??! Macaroni salad was excellent, the slaw was soggy and not crisp, left a lot to be desired.  Not enough bbq sauce on the baby back ribs or chickless.   Chicken was tender, but ribs were fatty.  They ran out of out brewed tea too! Overall mixed results.  May try it another time to see if it does improve.

BEAST FEAST! Great for beast feasts. If you're a beast you have to feast here. It's a great pig out restaurant where you just come to get stuffed and sloppy with BBQ sauce flying all over the place. You know a place is popular when there's a 20minute wait and the restaurant hasn't even been open yet. Got here when it opened at 11am on Friday and there was already a line! Parking lot full...couldn't believe it, but that just made this place seem that much cooler. I would recommend coming here as early as possible, but no matter what you're going to wait. Didn't want to over stuff myself for my first meal in SD, so I chose the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of french fries (instead of ordering the full ribs). It was deeeelicious, filling, and the portions was more than enough to make a hungry dude full. A little too much of their BBQ sauce which was a little overwhelming, but that can be fixed next time. If you're from out of town add this place to your list of places to eat in San Diego.

This is where carnivores go when they die.  This is a meat eaters heaven.  One of the best BBQs I have ever had in my life.   4 1/2 stars for sure. Beef Ribs--Incredible.  Super tender, and they really do fall of the bone.  They are huge, and meaty, and saucy, and cooked to perfection. Baby Back Ribs--Delicious.  Equally as good as the beef ribs.   Chicken (the white meat BBQ chicken chunks)--A little dry.  I would not order them again, but I would definitely try the half chicken. Onion Rings--Made my heart sing.  They come with Ranch Dressing.  They are sliced really thin, but have this thick batter on them.  Crunchy, flavorful, greasy, BIG, flavorful.  These things put all other onion rings to shame. Potato Salad--Fine.   Beans--Ehh, they aren't anything special. Fries--Good.  Really good. Regardless of the dry chicken and a couple of "ehhh" sides, this place is still a MUST GO for all meat eaters in San Diego.  Yes, the line can get CRAZY long, but it's way better than it looks.  And the service is really good.  When they say, "Bye, have a good day!  See you next time", it's like they really want you to have a good day.  They really want to see you again.  And oh yes, they will definitely see me again!

I'm a vegetarian and I LOVE PHIL'S.  the veggie burgers are good, the onion rings, the fries, the potatoes, anything you name it, its good! Before the move to Sports Arena, Phil used to come into my work a few times a week, and he was always friendly and would give myself and all my coworkers discounts to come by.  Even when I see him now he is super nice.  A good friend of mine is actually a manager at Phil's so service is always nice and quick.  There is tons of seating, and its great for kids or large groups.

So my past 5 or so reviews have been "omg, I can't believe I haven't already reviewed this" reviews.  Phil's is probably the most shocking one ever!!  I fell in love with Phil's BBQ about a year ago, been back plenty of times, and never once was I disappointed!!  It HAS to be good if Frankie J. takes his family here!!  Every time someone visits from out of town, I take them to Phil's.  I have friends from Sacramento who remind me all day everyday "take me Phil's again!!!" You don't know what a good rib is until you've had one here!  I wasn't a rib fan until Phil's.  The beefy ribs are HUGE and a bit much for me.  The baby back ribs are PERFECT.  Like everyone else is saying, the meat falls off the bones, LITERALLY.   I ordered the meal with half chicken and half ribs once and wasn't a fan of the chicken, now I only order a full rack of baby back ribs, ALWAYS.  Another must have are their onion rings dipped in ranch!!!  Wowwww..so crispy, so sweet.  I've never had onion rings this good anywhere else! Let me just tell you this; try it for yourself..I guarantee you'll get hooked!  Don't get intimidated by the line, it goes by fairly fast.  But note: they're closed on Mondays!!  I know, bummer...

Really great BBQ!  I didn't expect too much of this place when my cousins and I planned on coming here. I figured, just another BBQ place!  I was sure wrong! Upon arriving, I already saw a really long line that seemed to look like it was going to wrap around their restaurant!  The line did move really quickly though.  It looked about 50+ people in front of us and it took us about 30 minutes till we got to the front.  Not bad!   By the time you get to the front, you order your food and look for your seats. It did look a bit intimidating at first but people eat and leave pretty fast.  We didn't have a hard time finding a table for 5. My cousin, sister and I shared a full beef rib dinner which came with 5 beef ribs and 2 small sides or 1 large, we opted for the large side of potato salad.  The ribs were huge and had a great amount of meat on em!  The BBQ didn't overpower the ribs and were really good!  The potato salad was really good too!  Red potatoes! Yum! We also got a large side of onion rings!  Mmm one of the best onions rings I've had! Also we got a drink! All this for $30!  So for a meal that stuffed us with some leftovers too, we each only paid $10! The service here was great as well!  They are super busy but they come around to make sure often if everything is ok.   I would definitely come here again!  I gave it 4 stars because I absolutely love this place and I'm actually not a big fan of BBQ!

Oh Phil's BBQ.. the secret but not so secret of SD (Thanks Guy Fieri for the publicity! :P) Wait can be long if you go around dinner time, so I like to go around late lunch (2-3pm should be okay). There's also a smile cam on the website so you can check live how long the line is! -Onion Rings: Huge, but lacked flavor. All I tasted with just fried batter.. needed some salt, pepper, paprika, etc. -Fries: Pretty good, fresh cut, and they give a huge portion of it. Reminds me of in-n-out fries. -Macaroni Salad: It was just okay.. not that great. -Potato Salad: Huge chunks of red skin potato w/ skin still on. Okay as well. -Cole Slaw: Usually I am not a fan of cole slaw, but the cole slaw here was yummm-o!! -Ribs: Yep.. they're delicious. The best ribs I've had at a BBQ place. I like that it wasn't too drenched in sauce everywhere. I prefer to be able to taste the grilled meat. -I would recommend just getting the kid's meal b/c its the right portion... everything else on the menu is huge. My only real gripe is that there never seems be enough ribs to sides ratio. I always have way more sides to eat than ribs... and I like to eat my food in a semi even ratio so I don't get super tired of any one dish. The portions are big and price is a lil expensive but just split with a friend (expect to be eating a lot of fries...) Overall, I still come here from time to time if I'm really craving some good bbq ribs or just came back from mission beach (5 minute drive away). For me personally though I wouldn't wait in an hour long line .. but points for being the best in SD :)

4.5 stars. The BBQ here is awesome and the service is really great too. I can see why there's a line that loops partially around the restaurant! First, the lady taking our order saved us about $6 by recommending us to order a full rack instead of 2 half rack orders so that was cool. And, after we ordered we realized they had onion rings so I asked one of the waiters if I can just go to the to-go line and order it instead of waiting in the LONG line again. The waiter instead let us order the rings from her and she immediately came back with our order and receipt! Talk about good service! We left a very generous tip because they did really deserve it :) For our meals, we ordered a full rack of baby back ribs, beef ribs, and chicken. The sides we chose were corn on the cob, baked beans and potato salad. All the sides were very good and they give you a pretty good amount too. The meats were all very tendor and fell right off the bone. The bbq sauce wasn't shabby at all either. We all def enjoyed our meal. But, this place is comparable to other bbq joints in the Bay so I wouldn't take a drive here from Fremont just to have good BBQ unless I'm in the area.

I ordered the BBQ slice beef sandwhich and I recall "seeing the light" upon first bite. I swore I hear the infamous "ahhhhhhh". This place fucken rocks and I can promise you that I will be eating here in the next few days because simply typing this review has got my tastebuds excited.

Something happened to Phil's recently.. either they have a new meat supplier or they are getting lazy? I thought it was a one-time thing, but it's happened twice so obviously Phil's is not keeping up with it's good reputation. Last time we visited their chicken was dry and their ribs were not falling off of the bone. In the past we have had no complaints about Phil's. We may give it one more shot since Phil's has been so good in the past. Come on Phil's!

Phil's BBQ is THE BEST BBQ in San Diego. You can tell from the lines that go out the door and wrap around the side of the restaurant that this is one of the best food establishments in San Diego.   Everyone that I have introduced to Phil's BBQ (including my boyfriend, his parents, and many of my college friends) have said that this place is delicious.  If you're dining in for dinner, the wait may be around 30-minutes to order.  Trust me folks, its worth it. What is good at Phil's?  The baby-back ribs.  They're the best in San Diego, the meat is so soft its falling off the bones, and its covered in the most deliciously sweet and tangy BBQ sauce, you'll want to put the BBQ sauce on your entire meal.  A full rack of ribs comes with two small sides or one large side for $18.95 The other thing that makes Phil's BBQ so good are the SIDES.  My favorite sides are the macaroni salad, cole slaw, onion rings, and baked beans (i never liked baked beans until I had the baked beans from Phil's, now I love them).  The way Phil's BBQ makes their sides is different, and they're the best you'll find anywhere! My boyfriend usually goes for the full-slab baby back ribs meals, but I opts for something "smaller".  I've had the BBQ Broham sandwich, which is a heaping mound of large chunks of pulled pork on top of a toasted bun, slathered with Phil's delicious BBQ sauce and top with an equally heaping mound of coleslaw.  I get the coleslaw on the side.  For $6.45, this sandwich is very filling and sooo delicious. I've also tried the Phil's baby back Rib Tickler, which for $6.45 is VERY affordable and filling.  It comes with 3 bones, 2 onion rings, slaw and fries. They are very generous with their "3 bones," I had more like 5 bones, which was more than enough for.  It came with a lot of the delicious cole slaw and a big handful of fries.  For less than $7, it's a great deal and it'll get you full! One of my favorite restaurants in San Diego, delicious and affordable!  I recommend it to all my friends, and they all agree it's the best BBQ in San Diego.

No matter what time of day it is, Phil's stays busy from open to close. Get there just before they open to avoid a line that'll easily stretch around the restaurant. I ordered the "best of both worlds" chicken and beef ribs plate w/ an extra order of half rack of baby back ribs on the side. The chicken wasn't so great but the beef and baby back ribs more than made up for it. The beef ribs were practically the size of my arm, and I'm not even exaggerating. The sauce is awesome but I do suggest getting it on the side instead because it can get a little too tangy after a half rack of baby back ribs. With great service, a super clean restaurant, and flat screens everywhere, how can I not give this 5 stars?

Well, I guess everyone's had a chance to put in their 2 coppers... now its my turn, "Yay"! What can I possibly say about Phil's that hasn't been said already?  First off, I cannot believe that no one has ever told me about this place.  On the other hand, I would like to shout out a "THANK YOU" to YOU.  Yes, you!  Why?  Because without the many excellent reviews from my fellow Yelpers, I would have never ventured out to find good ole Phil's BBQ.  You're the best. Ok, onto the review.  This place is fantastic!  I was lucky enough to beat the crowd at around 5:30pm on Wednesday.  Oh yes, that's correct.  A Wednesday.  Phil's is so popular that it is hella packed pretty much every night their open; according to the manager.  I could smell the sweet aroma of barbeque from way out into the parking lot.  The aroma was so thick that it was like an appetizer before you get into the restaurant. My GF ordered the ribless meat dinner and of course, I had the full rack baby!  Oh yeah!  Their is only one flavor of barbeque sauce here; Phil's finest.  The sauce is so perfect that there is no need for any others.  We ordered our food, got our little vibrating pager that would tell us when our meal is ready, then proceeded to find our table.  I couldn't believe how fast our pager went off.  Our food was ready to pick up before we even sat down!  Sweet!  Hey Claudine S., you were right.  Super fast service. Our food smelled so good and was so pleasing to the eye that I don't think I got enough camera shots off before I began to devour my food.  The sauce was so sweet, sticky, and delicious.  I was so in love with my ribs that I nearly gnawed off one of my fingers because it was dripping with sauce and I nearly mistakened it for a rib. The portions were more than enough.  The GFs ribless meat dinner had quite a bit of meat.  It actually had more than my full rack and costed $8 less.  We pretty much switched plates halfway through dinner.  She was saying how it is much more fun to eat from the rib.  This was okay by me because her monster chunks of pork sloshed in Phil's finest was more than I could handle.  Our sides consisted of fries, cole slaw, baked bean and the enormous onion rings.  Way too much food for 2 people but oh so worth it. I cannot wait to come here again.  The service was pretty good too.  My GF stopped the manager walking by and asked for a take-out box.  I was all like, "Hey crazy girl.  The take-out boxes are just over there.  We get em ourselves".  The manager told us, "No problem.  Just enjoy your meal and relax.  I'll take care of it".  Whoa.  That was nice of him.  After he came back with our boxes, I watched him bounce around the restaurant helping other customers.  I was impressed. This place is definitely a "5 Star" in my eyes.  I can't wait to tell my friends and family about Phil's BBQ.  Best barbeque in town. p.s. I'm still super stoked over the food at Phil's that I had to edit my typoes and grammar in this review at least 8 times. LoL

I don't understand why this place is rated so high. I guess people in SD don't really know what good BBQ is. For the amount of time I had to wait in line I was expecting a lot more. This BBQ is just ok, the ribs are a bit too tangy and covered in sauce for my liking. It was ok but not fall off the bone good. I had beans and cole slaw as my sides and both of those were pretty typical. As I write this review I can't even remember what it taste like which is a good indication of how memorable my experience there was. I wasn't impressed with the service either. Lack luster at best. to me this is just a typical rib joint, you're better off going to Tony Romas

There's also thousands of review on this place, do I need to say more?  I would give it 3.5, but there's no half stars @ Yelp.  I am not a fan of BBQ food, but this place is good.  I like the spicy salt they have on the table for me to use; it went PERFECTLY with my corn.  I had the BBQ chicken, which was a little over sauced for me.  I don't eat pork, so the only other BBQ I tried was the beef rib, which is way better than any other places I had.  Go try it if you're in the area, but if the line is over 45 minutes wait (we waited for 40 minutes), then it's not worth it in my opinion.   Oh, lastly, don't trust their 21 minutes and 14 seconds sign, I timed it, not accurate.  It was 5 minutes and 12 seconds over the time they said ^_*

If you don't eat meat but want to, and dont want anyone to know - call the order in, go through the bar entrance. + Call in your order and pick up or eat in the bar. + Ribless, chickless and mac salad. * super long lines so call it in and pick it up.

We've been to Phil's before, so we knew what to expect. I usually don't eat meat, but once in a while I can make an exception and this is one of these times. As a European, I consider the 'regular' BBQ plates to big.  If I order one of those, it seems to be untouched after I'm finished.   Therefore the Phil's ticklers are perfect.  I always order the baby-back tickler.  It comes with fries & coleslaw.  There's only one downside, you cannot change the sides with the ticklers. The meat is outstanding!  I tried them all, but I prefer the babybacks. Another thing about Phil's is that it's dirt cheap.  My husband and I had dinner (both ticklers of course) for under $15.  Isn't that amasing?

I love Phils! It is the best BBQ I have ever had!!! The meat is always tender and I love their french fries! I am not a meat eater but I crave Phil's almost twice a month. The lines are extremely long but it is definitely worth the wait. Things I love and suggest: Baby Back Tickler- Cheap and good for one person Sweet Beans are a must! Onion rings are huge and paired with with ranch sauce is awesome! My husband loved the broham sandwich. Bottom Line- Phil's is the best bbq there is in San Diego. The friendly staff are caring and they always have a smile on their face:) Fan for Life!!!

Pre-addendum: I haven't been to Phil's in about a year, and I hear now that the wait is INSANE...but even with that, I give it 5 stars. Best. Ribs. Ever. But before I get into that, a little note to the outnumbered people that say Phil's isn't real BBQ. There are many types and preparations of BBQ: grilled or smoked, rolled in rub or smothered in sauce, light and tangy or sticky and sweet, Korean or Aussie---you get the picture. I'm no BBQ connoisseur, but I know that much. I happen to like many varieties of BBQ, but I understand if you don't like Phil's deliciously saucy style: more for me, then! ;) Back on topic here. I'm constantly depressed that I didn't learn about Phil's until long after I moved out of SD. I mean, we have good BBQ in SF, but it's all of the smoky style (Memphis Minnie's, Bro In Laws)...at least that I've found. In fact, I was nearly in tears when the BF went to SD sans moi as I knew he'd be going to Phil's at least once---in fact, I forbade him to speak to me about it, lest he desire some serious harm inflicted upon his person. (Yes, my life does indeed revolve around food...pathetic, I know). So last time I was at Phil's, I got the rib and chicken combo. The chicken was quite good, but OMFG the ribs! Falling off the bone and not fatty at all. And I just love the sauce. We got our food to go and ate in Balboa park. It was nothing short of heavenly.

Seriously, what's the big deal? There's a line out the door. TONS of military folks (not hating- my dad was in the Navy), and a whole lotta raucous. I give them top marks for service: -The line went quickly. -The prices were very reasonable. -The food came out very quickly. -All the staff was very friendly. -Management came by to check on us. But the BBQ is SUB-PAR, people. San Diego, where are your taste buds? Are they up your butt? Have you never been to the South? You know, the place where good BBQ comes from.  I'm sorry but, the ribs were not that great-at all. The fries were dry. The slaw was pretty good, but: THIS IS A BBQ PLACE AND THE BBQ SUCKS. I hate to be the biatch, but ewwww gross. The meat was tough, and the sauce was horrible- way too acidic and slathered on the ribs. It's fast food BBQ, and the flavor reflects just that. Sloppy work, Phil. The only reason I'd go back is if my family made me go on account of someone's birthday (just like it was today).

I don't know how I have never written a review for Phil's BBQ but its better late than never! I first popped my Phil's cherry after a brutally drunken night at a beach party, meaning..I was waaay hungover with almost no trace of tastebuds in my mouth. Let me get to my point..I had Phil's BBQ as my "hangover" food and it was STILL AMAZING. I have been hooked ever since and I have been back there repeatedly with countless friends and family for a great BBQ meal. Can't decide between baby back ribs or beefy ribs? Ask your friend to get the other and SHARE. Its all about sharing, people :D Personally, I enjoy the beefy ribs more (although the baby back ribs fall off the bone easier). Best sides? Baked beans and coleslaw, but DON'T FORGET TO ORDER ONION RINGS! The "small" order can still feed several people. Phil's is definitely one of the top restaurants to visit if you are from out of town.

I hate Phil's BBQ Sports Arena.  It is closed from January first through the Twenty-first for their annual vacation.     This is the coldest time in San Diego and is not conducive to home BBQ.  Their sauce is hard to reproduce consistantly as it ain't catsup based.  The only thing  can do better at home is give my meat some smoke ring.  So phil's is better because it's easier on me.  Even with the thirty minute round trip.     I want me some pork ribs.  Gimme some pork ribs.  Beer bar looks sweet but I'm in and out. EDIT: bug.  Picking up my food I found a li'l german cockroach on the stainless order counter (-4 stars).  God damn are their beer battered onion rings good (+2 stars).  Fall offa the bone pork so lovely (+1).  I'm not getting chicken here again(-1).  El Toro f*ckamole!(+1)

"Eh, it was aight," said the tourist. I really don't know what the big whoop is was about this place.  I've definitely had better and will more than likely choose to eat somewhere else if I have to wait over 20 minutes to dine.   Had the ribs, which yes fell off the bone, but I did not find the bbq sauce to be so great.  It was a bit tangy.   When we were in line, the attendant warned us that their fryers were not running, therefore they would not be serving fries or onion rings.   No kids menu. BOOOO! None of the sides were too fantastic.   AGAIN, for a place that makes you wrap around the building to feast on meat, I would expect A LOT MORE!  Bring out a dancing, talking pig or something.

After more than 2600 reviews at this writing, what can I possibly add? When I discovered Phil's, back before he got chased out of Mission Hills, I tried telling my friend from Arkansas how good it was.   "Good BBQ in San Diego?" [sarcastic laugh] "I don't think so." Halfway through the meal, he had his head down, working those ribs.   "What do you think, Devin?" "Pretty damn good."

We knew we had to stop by Phils BBQ at least once during our trip in San Diego. My brother tells me about this place every time he comes back from visiting his girlfriend. So the bf and I really wanted to try this place. First thing I noticed when we got there, um hello long line! We waited in line for a good 40 minutes and that was considered "short". Second thing you will definitely notice is the smell from the delicious food! Yeah doesn't quite help when you're super hungry and waiting in a 40 minute line. I chose the 6 piece baby back ribs with sides of coleslaw and homemade baked beans. Everything under $16. What a steal when your meat literally falls off the bones. Yummy! Bf had the beef ribs and omg were those things huge. The four of us (bro, bro's gf, me, and the bf) decided to share a pull pork sandwich on top of our entrees. That was a little too much but it was delicious! Remember to put the coleslaw in your burger, not on the side.   Here's the procedure: -you order your food like you would in McDonald's -they give you a buzzer and will let you know when your food is ready -find your own table (yup they don't seat you!) -*buzz* -get your food and start chomping (warning: it gets messy!)

Just went here last week with the whole family. Everyone loved it. What should you get? RIBS!!!!!!!!!!! My wife discovered beef ribs last month and decided she loves them. She was the only one. Everyone else got pork ribs. They are wonderful! I always want to try the Broham but that rack always tempts me. Maybe next time. I discovered the trick to not waiting in line. Go on a Thursday at around 3. Absolutely no wait!!

This is more of a "dog pile" review. How much more can you add to a thousand positive comments? Undisputed best in San Diego? I think so. Pros - BEEF RIBS (Why don't other places have this? ) - El Toro Cons ( and what cost them a star) - With success and delicious food comes the price of being insanely busy at times. Drive by on a weekend and the line goes around the building. Even during the off hours it's hard to find a free table. Please open another location!

My first, and definitely not my last visit to Phils. I have NEVER seen a line SO long at ANY restaurant. EVER.  But, that's gotta be a sign that it's THAT good.  Funny thing, they have signs for an estimated wait time along certain points of the building.... kinda like an amusement park ride line.  I  went on a Friday night, it was probably a 45 minute wait.  I heard it's ridiculously long on a busy nice weathered weekend. When you get to the front of the line, there are several registers where you order your food, kinda like a fast food restaurant.  You wait at your table and pick up your food at the counter when your pager lights up.  You also gather your own silverware and drinks.  If you want beer or adult beverages, you have to go to the bar and order it on your own.  The beer selection is kinda weak. Basically, you don't have a server, just someone to seat you. I ordered Best of Both: Baby Back Ribs & Chicken - 4 Bones and 1/4 chicken, which includes either 2 small sides or 1 large side.  I got it with the veggies. The portions are spot on with the pricing.  The food was amazing.  I was able to try the coleslaw, potato salad, onion rings, and fries from our groups plethora of food.  I cleaned my plate off.  Everything was seasoned and sauced perfectly.  The ribs were falling off the bone, the chicken- juicy and tender...  both still steaming from being served so quickly.  The "small sides" were actually pretty large portions.  So if you're not super hungry, its easily shareable. I would definitely recommend this place if you don't mind waiting.  If you can't wait, their take out is pretty quick. If I could I'd give this place 10 stars- it's that good.

My coronary arteries lament the day I was introduced to Phil's BBQ.  I must confess I've only tried a few items on the menu, but every time I call in an order my inner fat-boy comes to life. I started out on the BBQ Cheese Burger and BBQ chicken breast for my first few visits.  Both are delicious and could feed a small family. Then I dabbled in the BROHAM.  Extra meat, extra sauce, and no slaw = a monstrous pile of pulled pork that borders on sex.  I'm passionate about food. The meals and customer service have been top notch every time I've given in to my Phil's urges, but I recommend calling in your order instead of waiting in the insanely long lines to get a table (out the door and around the corner).

So so so so so so so yummy!!! D'lish! I've had Phil's a total of 3 times. Once to-go, once at the San Marcos one, and my latest time here and dined in. When I had it to-go, I wasn't super impressed and I think it got a little cold on the way back. In San Marcos, I waited in line for over an hour but I enjoyed it a lot. I was expecting long lines again, but we came at a non rush time. NO LINE AT ALL. We walked in and straight to the register. Awesome! I think I prefer the beef to the pork. Beef is super meaty and tender. They drench it in their tangy BBQ. So goooood. I watched Diners, Drives and Dives after coming here and am interested in trying their tri-tip. But I don't know.. I really loved their ribs and there's so much food, it's not like I can get both! We also got an order of onion rings. Beer battered, and deep fried, not to mention the size of the rings, all amount to perfection. So greasy, so good. Their fries are okay, but are you really here for the fries? I liked their mac salad a lot, but I'm just a huge fan of all mac salads. Cole slaw was average. And I haven't tried their potato salad yet (maybe next time). The meat is just so good. Not dry, super tender. Man, I want some right now! If you haven't been, you have to try it. Unless you go during a random time, expect to wait in line forever. And the staff is always really helpful and nice. Super friendly; it really seems like they like working here which makes the dining experience even better.

Not that Phil's needs my 5 star review but I just have to do it. Thee best BBQ I have EVER had, hands down. BBQ ribs had a perfect crispy texture on the outside but were moist and fall off the bone tender on the inside. Pulled pork sandwich was equally as delicious and they give you TONS of meet. The amount of meat could probably go onto 3 sandwiches. Sides were great too. Macaroni salad, bbq beans  and french fries...all outstanding. The line was per usual around the corner but there were only 2 of us so we walked into the bar and were able to sit down immediately. I cannot wait to go back!

OOkay okay i know this place is for the carnivores && its meat eating heaven but ... i went with the veggier burger. Only one word can describe it; AMAZING. Best veggie burger i have ever had in my life. So if you're a vegetarian that gets dragged along to this place the veggie burger is no joke. instead of lame old boring onions this place hooks you up with the meanest most biggest onion ring ever! the burger is just adgjaklgjajrffklgn goood. && so you dont feel left out as your friends lick their fingers and devour their food the veggie burger comes with a splash of bbq sauce. Along with my veggie burger I got a side dish of potato salad and mmm FABULOUS substitute for  fries. sososo sooooo good. The potato chunks are thick so its not like the norm but it was still pree' good. This place is almost like a fast food type of restaurant, it OWNS.

This is the place to go, when you want good old fashion Bar B Q!  This dance of taste becomes evident the minute you park your car.  With grills fired up, and chops burning, you smell the food just pulling in the parking lot!  This place is a favorite at Lunch, and Dinner, so arrive at 11, if you don't want to wait.  There is no saving of tables, and really no favors shown.  Just friendly people, waiting to give you a tasty treat!   Best Ideas: (1) Phone In your order (2) Go Early ( 11:00 AM ) (3) Great for Games and Gameday (4) Late Night, and not sure what to eat?  Ummm Phils? (5) Great Prices (6) Don't GO MONDAY!  CLOSED!   (7) Go HUNGRY! :)

I'm a bit ashamed to say I only found out about this place my fourth and final year living in SD, but each time I visit I try to make a stop here.  And I'm not even a big bbq fan. The star of Phil's show are the baby back ribs.  They are fall-off-the-bone tender with a refreshingly tangy-sweet bbq sauce.  Their beef ribs are good too, but not as tender and succulent as the baby back.  My favorite side is the macaroni salad.  Generous portions and fast service (at least, once you get through the line).   And for football fans, there are TVs everywhere to keep you updated on the game in case you pause from licking bbq sauce off your fingers.

All the other reviews say it. From someone who grew up in the south, I am impressed. Real BBQ. The line out the door says it all. ADVICE: If you can manage getting there before seven on a weeknight, do it. If not, check out the menu online and phone in your order. However, the line moves pretty quickly because they have about 7 order takers...and then the food came out quickly.

Phil's BBQ is a good CALIFORNIA bbq joint.  I want to emphasize the state because five star bbq is definitely not California's strong suit.  However I did enjoy it and would recommend it for all to try. The baby back ribs are better than the beef ribs.  They are tender and have sauce on it.  I didn't see anything on the menu that gives the customer an option of having them dry, but maybe they do.  The sauce was tangy and a bit spicy which was nice.  But overall the ribs were TOO saucy.  I had to scrape some off  because it became overwhelming after a while.   For the sides, I enjoyed the onion rings and cole slaw.  The onion rings were crispy, not flakey.  You could take a bite and not end up stripping out the entire onion.  Don't you hate it when that happens?   The cole slaw was definitely not store bought at like Costco or something.  The veggies were fresh and crisp.  It's not overwhelming with mayo like the cheap stuff you find elsewhere. One thing if you didn't know, there is no waiter service.  You order at a counter and pick up the food yourself when its ready.  You get your own refills too.  I didn't mind it so much except when I wanted alcohol.  You have to order your alcohol separately in the bar area, which means you have to get in another line besides the food line.

The wait on a Saturday night? Close to an hour, it seemed.   Why is it every location I go to in San Diego had a prerequisite of a minimum of an hour long wait?! With the insistence from my cousin, I waited...and waited...and waited.   To Phil's defense, the line did move rather quickly BUT because of my hungry stomach growling in retaliation, the wait seemed unbearable.  After what seemed like eternity, we finally arrived to the front of the line.   The set up was your basic cafeteria style restaurant. 1) You order + pay 2) You grab your designated pager 3) Pick a spot to grub 4) When your food is ready, your pager will ring! 5) EAT!! Between my cousin and I, we got the "Full Baby Back Rib Dinner" + corn on cob + macaroni salad + side salad. At first glance, the amount of food seemed inadequate for my cousin AKA garbage disposal and I, the food-eating savage.  Luckily, a waiter happened to stop by and we were able to order - on the spot - another (BIG) serving of macaroni salad.   I decided to be a good girl and filled myself up with fresh mixed greens before tackling the big and heavy items on my plate.  Damn, why did I do that? The ribs were MIND BLOWING. Soft, juicy, moist, fall-off-the-bone-can't-get-enough, flavorful and the list goes on. The macaroni salad was bomblicious.  It had the right amount of mayo and it complimented the sweet and tangy ribs perfectly.  Add hot sauce into the equation and you just got yourself the best-darn-BBQ- that-got-your-lips-smackin-in-anticipation-for-­your-next-trip-out to-San-Diego-for-these-AMAZING-life-changing-ribs. OK, I don't know about "life changing" but they were good. reallllly good. I only wish they could set up shop in SF and add MAC & CHEESE to their menu! *hint hint*

I don't know, maybe I just don't get it but I don't love this place like everyone else.  The food is just mediocre to me and the wait is ridiculous.  The food is always drenched in so much BBQ sauce that I can't taste anything but the sauce.  The only thing I've ever eaten here that I've actually enjoyed was an onion ring...go figure.   But, my boyfriend loves this place, so I guess I'll continue to be dragged to Phil's and hope that I discover something that knocks my socks off.

Was not impressed at all! I kept hearing all about Phil's BBQ and how packed it is and it's the place to eat BBQ. 1) They messed up my order and had to restand in line to fix it. 2) The BBQ sauce was gross, very sweet and not tasty. A little like the BBQ packs at Arby's. 3)After wiping the sauce off and added salt, it still was just ok. I really wanted to like it and have a good BBQ place to go. I do have to say the Coleslaw was very very good and I enjoyed the onion rings. I will not be back!

Phil's BBQ - it's like falling in love for the first time. After eating here, you WILL: 1. Compare every other BBQ joint to Phil's - and they will ALL fall drastically short of what Phil's has to offer 2. Every time you eat at a different BBQ restaurant, you just wish it were Phil's delicious ribs and fries sitting on the plate in front of you 3. When friends and family try to introduce you to other BBQ joints, you put on the happy face, smile, and try to enjoy the food... but the entire time you're just wishing you were stuffing your face with PHIL'S!!! Oh Phil's.... you'll always have my heart!

We come here to celebrate! Normally, in a large group. I usually split a Beefy Rib dinner with a friend. It comes with 3 ribs and 2 sides, which is just enough for a pair of small girls. The ribs are gigantic and the meat is tender and comes straight off the bone! Only sometimes, it can be more burnt than usually. There's almost nothing else to say, except that It's just so... good!

So much to write, so little time.  Just go to Phil's, it will not disappoint.  Well, there are always going to be a few people here and there that just don't get it, but the consensus doesn't lie.  This place is great!!! Try the Brohan or the El Toro sandwich, the ribs, the 1/2 or 1/4 chicken, don't forget extra sauce.  Love the combo flavors of sweet, tangy and a touch of spice.  I lived in NC for a couple of years and tried several of the so-called great BBQ spots, but I just ended up craving Phil's after every meal.   One note.....if you order to go, do NOT get fries with that.  They will be soggy and bleh.  If you are eating there however, do get fries with that. They have a classic potato flavor that will leave you wanting more.   Love Phil's, and you will too!!

Geez people - have you ever had real barbecue?  I understand that San Diego is very limited to this type of 'cuisine' but Phil's is not a 5 star worthy restaurant.  Not even close. The new location is far better than the old but it operates even more like a high-production factory.  You can almost see the ribs being assembled in a line by robots behind the register.  Parking is still just as bad because the lot is packed and shared with 42 other businesses. I'll admit the food isn't awful - in fact I think it is well prepared - but THEN it gets doused in a not so pleasant bbq sauce.  This sauce, though sweet, Carolina style?, is also sour and strangely jelly like.  To me, the most important part of bbq is the sauce you baste over it just before its done and Phil's is just wrong.   So yes, I hate the sauce. I hate the long line for a dirty table. I hate the feeling that you need hurry up and eat and get the eff out of there.  I hate the location of the soda fountain and did I mention I hate their sauce?  Their onion rings are the kind where the batter doesn't stick to the onion, so you take a bite and the entire onion pulls out.  Their fries suck...probably Safeway brand frozen fries dumped in a deep fryer.  Their slaw is also probably a food service vat kept chilled in the back fridge because it is nothing to write home about (but I guess I'm writing about it here). I would totally give them another star if they had different sauce varieties and didn't make you feel so rushed after waiting 48 minutes for a table. So my recommendation venture away from San Diego for a bit for some real bbq then come back and right your review...I guarantee you won't give it 5 stars. UPDATE: So someone that works at Phil's writes this message: John So much hate....sorry we couldn't live up to your BBQ standards...luckily we did  for 800 other yelpers with 5 stars.  BTW- fresh cut fries, clean tables, highest quality meats and ingrediants.  We also believe that "real BBQ" tastes great.  If you do venture back try the sauce on the side. Thanks Fred If he has 800- 5 star reviews why does my review bother him so much.   Seriously Fred, don't take this so personal.  Did you invent the sauce? If so, then yah, you should feel somewhat defeated. Telling me to get the sauce on the side is like telling me to order pizza the next time I want BBQ.  Why not just take my criticisms and consider some improvements?   I did say the food was well prepared - except for those fries (Bluck...don't believe they're fresh) and notice he didn't mention the food service vat of cole slaw they serve. (Bluck times 100).  Can you really trust a guy that can't even spell ingredients??? Spell check is easy. And no, the tables are not clean, if you are lucky they are 'wiped down'.

**4.5 stars overall** Came here with Yelpers Sam B., Andrew R. and Paul K. Decor: 4.5/5 -lots of tables, the wait in line moves quickly -heated outdoor seating -large sink to wash your hands near the refreshments dispenser -many menus posted all over the walls and in front of the registers Service: 4.5/5 -one of your party gets seated prior to ordering -food comes out fast! -Kale was my server, whom was friendly and energetic Food: 4.5/5 -Full rack baby back ribs dinner ($18.95): The first half rack was delicious. The second half rack was covered in too much BBQ sauce which made it very salty. Some of the ribs were a bit burnt. -Colossal Onion Rings: Ever had Funyuns? These taste just like it, only better. Don't get the large size for yourself.  Definitely give these a try though -The single beef rib it 2-3x the size of the baby back single rib. -Sides: potato salad and baked beans were Okay. I came here on a Tuesday night @ 7pm and the wait was about 35-40 minutes.

I heard so many great things about Phil's, so I had to try it.  I heard the tickler was a good size for lunch, so that's what I got...even though it didn't sound like much.  Ummm, it was WAY more than enough for lunch.  I got the baby back ribs and they were definitely falling off the bone.  The service was great!  There were no seats available inside, but it was a gorgeous day so eating outdoors was nice.  Also, there was no line when we went...which was great because I have heard horror stories about the wait.

I was so amped up to come to Phil's BBQ after reading all the raving reviews on Yelp, but was completely disappointed after having experienced the restaurant first-hand. I went there after 9pm on a Tuesday night (off night) and while the line wasn't too bad: 15 minutes, it still took us another 20 minutes to get our food After we ordered= wack. Any real BBQ joint in Texas like Rudy's: http://www.yelp.com/biz/… or any of them- you order and you get your food on the spot. It does not mean it's not 'fresh' it just means they prepare for the volume of customers at hand. You would think with how busy Phil's is they would have a more efficient system in place to get your food served and get you out of there. But instead, they try to make it 'fancy' in that they have some busser come around and act as a server and bring you napkins, silverware, etc. but instead of a help, it's really more of a nuissance. Just give me my darn food and let me eat! haha. As far as the food goes- very average. The BBQ sauce had too much of a 'bite' to it: i.e., tangy, sweet. There was only one choice of sauce. And the meat- both chicken and baby back ribs did not have a great taste; at all. The ez-wipes they give you have got to be the cheapest wet naps I've ever seen in my life. They are no greater than 4 inches in diameter and rip at touch=cheapo. All in all my main gripe is the food is just OK and certainly not worth the wait. I've heard they have waits of over an hour most nights= ridiculous. I wouldn't want more than 10 minutes for Phil's. If you never experienced a good BBQ restaurant then Phil's will probably be tasty and fun for you. But if you've eaten quality BBQ then Phil's just doesn't cut it.

MUST-STOP-BY-PHIL'S You know when a joint is crackin when the line to get in runs in around the restaurant outside! Good news is the line goes by fast...because you order your food like a fast food joint and grab your food and find a seat. I believe this is by far THE BEST BBQ I've ever had!  Yes, I will give them that title.  I'm just sad that I live in LA so far away =( Doesn't matter what you order...Baby back ribs, pulled pork sandwich, bbq chicken...the meat is juicy, tender and full of flavor!  You can always tell if someone knows their BBQ by their baked beans- it's not too sugary and served thick.  ONION RINGS are the bomb over here!  San Diego always has a special batter that you don't find in LA... it was thick and crunchy and worthy of an addiction.  Must be the water! Prices are decent and Staff are cool... can't find a bad thing to say about this place- and THAT IS A FIRST for me!!!!  =P

Wowwie wow wow WOW I'm from Montana and have had "BBQ" maybe 3 times in my life while visiting Texas. So I admittedly do now know my BBQ. My husband and I have walked by so many times and nearly died drooling from the smell, but each time we are around the line is so long and we're usually too starving to wait. We made a special trip to go here yesterday, and we were both thrilled. We had the boneless pork shoulder and each piece of meat was jut flawless. No gristle or fat chunks -- pure perfection. Awesome fries. The portions are just massive. I really loved the sauce. It was an excellent meal and I really want to try more menu items soon.

I've been hearing so much hype about this place for many years.. I finally went. In disagreement with most here..I wasn't impressed. This place is overpriced for what was given. The portions are large, but that doesn't make up for it's lacking in quality and flavor..I felt like I was choking on shoe strings whilst eating my my Pulled Pork sandwhich. The meat, extremely dry. The sauce wasn't anything special.. Slaw.. ehhhhhhh..  bland BBQ Beans had no real punch to it.. I'm not a fan of fried food.. but the Beer Battered Onion Rings are the only decent thing I had tried, which gives Phil's my  two star rating. I've had far better BBQ (in National City- BBQ Pit) and will give Phil's a miss ..

I used to get pissed off when Phil would shut the restaurant down for a couple of weeks to go on vacation or when the neighborhood would shut it down because of the bbq scent cloud... this is all when it used to be located in Mission Hills... but I could still always go back and have my bbq with a relatively short line and eat in peace with my friends. Now I get pissed off when I go to Phil's because I don't wait in line for any food for an hour.  Thus, I cannot eat my bbq in peace with my friends.  It's ridiculous.   I started going to Phil's probably about 15 years ago.  Phil's was about one twentieth the size it is now.  I have heard the main reason for the huge influx of people is because it was featured on a food network show.  One night my friends and I went to Phil's on a weekday, took one look at the line and skipped it.  I said let's just go to Hodad's instead (which i've been frequenting for probably 20 years) and the line was around the block!!!  (i've heard that Hodad's was also featured on a show.   I'm glad that some great San Diego establishments are getting so much love... but they're taking away all of my spots!

On my speed dial.  Best ribs in town.   One time years ago at the Goldfinch location, I dropped by in the morning to see if I could buy some sauce for some ribs I was going to cook.  Phil and one other guy were there.  Phil took care of getting me the sauce, then asked me how I was going to cook my ribs.  I told him and then he explained to me in detail how he does it.  Told me everything except the sauce recipe.  Occasionally when I grill, I will include some ribs cooked like he told me and dab some of Phil's sauce on them, and all my friends think I'm the king of the rib grillers. If you know of a better place in town, let me know.  I never order ribs anymore anywhere else.  It's always a disappointment after Phil's.

I have heard a lot about Phil's so decided to give it a try.  Guess San Diego isn't much of a BBQ town.   We had ribs and chicken and neither were true BBQ, the smoke flavor is supposed to be slowly infused during the cooking process, not added as a liquid.  And any true BBQ place offers brisket, kind of like a Mexican Restaraunt not offering tacos.   Guess I will stick to my own smoker and recipes for BBQ...

This place really does have either one of or the best American bbq in San Diego. 4 out of 5 San Diegans will tell you the same. After having it plenty of times after school at Mesa College i'm starting to think its a little too sweet. But still though, shit is good when you're craving some barbeque. Portions are always huge and every side i've tried was good, including the onion rings, potato salad, macaroni salad, slaw, and fries. If you're not into white chicken meat, and you like ribs, get the ribs and chicken "best of both." It really is enough for two, but fuck it, why not enjoy the extras for later? shiiieet niggaaaa Finally, i've had both the beef and the baby back ribs. The beef is overall better, a little more tender and is bigger (that's what she said). Too bad they don't do spare ribs or offer rice as a side

I mean, the baby back ribs and chicken were good, but not 'wait 30 minutes in muggy irritating heat good'. If I needed a fix and opted for the phone-in and pick up, then it may have been a better experience.  But spending enough time to watch a favorite sitcom at a place where you order up at the register, I was expecting some explosive mind-boggling ribs. Oh, and for you hardcore BBQ eaters, NO BRISKET!  That was a big disappointment.  No hot links, either!  And no corn bread nor fresh baked bread!  I needed some evil carbs to soak it all up!

Apparently, based on these reviews, people in San Diego haven't been anywhere else in the county to taste real BBQ. What is real BBQ? Meat slowly smoked over a wood fired pit. PERIOD. Phil's doesn't do this. They cook the meat in an oven then "finish" it on a grill. How can you tell it's fake? - There is no "smoke ring" in the product. This reddish color that can be seen in the first  inch of the meat, and can only happen if meat is slow smoked over wood or charcoal. It may taste good to folks who've never tried real BBQ, and that's OK, but please don't say this is REAL BBQ.   Place is busy, stand in a line, get some semi- OK meat products, slathered in sauce to cover the dry bits.   I'll go as far as to say I really don't think little Sandy Eggo has any real BBQ, except in my backyard.   Come on by - but brings some beers!

We were lucky in the fact that when we hit Phils, it was a slow day in the middle of the week. No lines, no waiting. I don't get why people would wait over an hour for this joint though. I had the ribless dinner and a couple sides. It wasn't bad, but the meat was a bit dry. The sauce a little sweet. Seasoning was good though. The sides were what you would expect. Onion rings were cooked perfectly and my corn on the cob was crisp and sweet. No complaints on the sides. The staff was great as well. From the front counter to the people who clear the tables, everyone was smiling and seemed like they were having a good time. Again, that might be due to the fact that it wasn't busy and it was the clam before the storm. If you're in the mood for some BBQ, go check em' out. But I would avoid the lines during the weekend. Phils isn't bad, but not worth an enormous wait.

We based our overnight stay in SD with the hopes of having some great BBQ from Phil's which we had seen on TV. A Yelp review had us worried about a supposed 3 hour wait about an hour b4 we showed up. We arrived and got in a short line to order. Greeted by friendly staff that asked if it was our first trip to Phil's we placed our order and were showed where to pick up our food when our pager went off. Huge sitting area with self serve drink and silverware stations make it easy to outfit your eating experience the way you like. They had what seemed to be a nice size bar area (which we didn't use) that also had patio seating. There is also another patio area on the opposite side of the restaurant. Our food was ready (quite quickly too) and it looked awesome. As a group we tried the chick-less n rib plate, the broham which is their pulled pork sandwich (my favorite by the way), the toro sandwich, and the onion rings. When I say all of them were great I know it sounds like the usual jibber-jabber but there really was nothing I didn't enjoy about this food that I couldn't get in my mouth fast enough. As I said the pulled pork was my favorite but I am a sucker for the stuff. The ribs were tasty fall-off-the-bone goodness you hope for and the chick-less (boneless BBQ chicken) was a great way to enjoy chicken in a restaurant. The onion rings were a nice touch of crunch with a great batter that went well with the bbq sauce. The enormous amount of meat that dwarfed the bun called the el torro was what we came to experience. It did not disappoint. The meat is juicy and Smokey at the same time with a nice spice kick of an aftertaste. Perfect exclamation point of a signature sandwich. Not only do they offer handy wipes like most BBQ spots, they also have hand washing stations at both ends of the restaurant so you can really get down and dirty into your meal and enjoy it and know a good 'hose-down' isn't too far. As for that dreaded 3 hour wait. No such thing in our case. By the time we were done eating, the line was down the side of the building, but  Phil's seemed to have a pretty good system of greet, order, seat, eat to where a line should move sort of quickly. Maybe waiting for good BBQ seems a lot longer on an empty stomach.

I thought that the food would be to die for after seeing the great reviews and the long line to get in. Was I wrong. After waiting for about 30 minutes just to say we have a call in order... The food was not good at all.  My ribs were hot but were burnt!!! Like crispy black!! I thought that was how they were suppose to be until I looked into my boyfriends plate which looked awesome... The only good thing were the sweet baked beans. If this is the best in San Diego, I hate to taste the worst. Maybe i'll have better luck at Coop West Texas... Two stars: one for the decor and another for the cool webcam on the website.

It's hard for any place with this much local hype to live up to it. This place serves good BBQ, at a great price, but I have to say it's not worth the long waits you have to endure to eat it. The lines are absolutely too long for a person like me who gets grumpy when hungry. We arrived on a weeknight for dinner around 7:30 and waited like 45 minutes to get in, most of it past a dubious sign stating 22 minute wait from here. So, if you are a Zen master, or very patient person don't sweat it. You can call in to-go orders, which I think would be a great option for people like me. Factor in the line for a good experience. Don't be to hungry, or have to go pee or anything. Trust me. They do counter service, after they find you a table. Once seated, the food comes pretty quickly. The bar is completely separated, and you have to order your beer separately from there. There is no table service at all The portions are huge, and both the pork and chicken BBQ is really excellent. The sauce is tangy, and the meat is very tender. It's good stuff.

Baby back ribs....literally SLIPS off the bone. Or the BBQ chicken that is FULL OF FLAVOR and so tender and juicy. My mouth is watering just describing this thing. Besides the excellent BBQ sauce that they come around your table and give more of, it comes on a huge plate of french fries and potato or macaroni salad... I think the sides aren't THAT good, but the ribs/chicken speak for themselves. Warning, the portions are HUGE. Prepare your stomachs. I think I'm full after 3-4 ribs. They also have bomb ass onion rings!! Warning #2.... FOOD COMA UP THE HEEZY. I think I could fall asleep before I even finish chewing my food. LOL, but on my way home, I literally want to pass out and sleep it off. So bad for you....but feel sooooo good. Warning #3... If you don't get there early enough, prepare yourself for at least a 35-45 minute wait. The longest I've waited was an hour and 10 minutes, but it's worth it. TRUUUST. ALSO, there's a wait for to get your food. It's true. But you have a buzzer thing so you can hang out or grab a beer at the bar while you're waiting. Good for groups, esp large ones bc they will help you get a table that big, but if you're only a group of 5 or less, then you're on your own to find a table. You gotta snatch that up quick! ...or someone else will!! i love this place cause you there's a hand washing sink thing near the back so you don't need to bother going all the way to the bathroom. Overall, #1 place for ribs. NO DOUBT.

LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!! the line was ridiculously long when i went.. it wrapped around the corner of the restaurant.. it scared me and made me re-think twice on if we should of gone somewhere else instead of waiting for so long..I am glad we didn't! the line went by pretty fast actually!  I didn't know it was an order at the front and pick it up when ready kind of service that's why. no wonder why the line went by pretty fast!  Next step though after the line is to find a seat amongst the chaotic crowd.  this place DEFINITELY is packed from every corner possible even outside of their patio.  It's funny since they have a sign saying please do not save seats ahead of time when you are in line.. haha. .WHY NOT!!!!! :( .. the portions are great.. good size. you definitely don't need to order ANY MORE than you need to.. a sample plate would consist of fries + ribs + cole slaw for example.  JUICE and DELICIOUS BBQ sauce.  The BBQ Chicken is pretty good but I rather eat all ribs here.  Don't expect to come out of there with clean hands.. make sure you go wash your hands in the bathroom afterwards!! What good is a BBQ Place if your hands don't get down and dirty?

It's no Rudy's if you know what I mean. otherwise, its a pretty good BBQ joint.. but no brisket. Baby back, beef ribs, grilled chicken, sandwiches, burgers, tons of sides.. We waited in line for about 15 minutes on a Saturday night at 8:30 PM. I got the half and half with coleslaw and mac salad. My boyfriend got fries and cole slaw and our friend got a burger. We decided to get a small order of onion rings too and it just turned out to be way too much food. HUGE portions everyone! The meats were covered in BBQ sauce. The cole slaw was mmmm. You can tell its fresh and not stinky. Mac salad was great too, except for some reason I always get headaches (?!?) Thumbs up: cole slaw! friendly service. ribs were good. chicken is juicy. all you can drink fountain drinks, sinks for washing of the hands Thumbs down: fries were nothing special. onion rings were battered way too much and made it oily and not crunchy.

911 reviews?  What is there to say about Phil's that everyone else hasn't?  That it's the best bbq in town? That the rib meat falls off the bone? That you could drink the sauce by the ladle?   Seriously, folks.  Nothing to see here; get out and experience it for yourself.  Just don't get the jones on a Monday, when Phil's is closed. Truly, Phil's is a local institution.  It's crowded as heck, so avoid the rush hours -- though even then, be thankful you have a prayer of finding a seat in the larger Sports Arena digs versus the original Mission Hills shop. And while it's true that there is better bbq to be had in this world, you're not going to find it around here.

I can't believe yesterday was my first tie trying out Phil's BBQ.  No wonder this place is raving and "omgosh!" You can get a decently priced meal with an unexpected amount of food.  I got a 1/2 baby back ribs that includes either 2 small sides or 1 large side.  Being a food fanatic I am, I couldn't decide between getting fries and cole slaw OR corn on the cob.  SO I GOT ALL THREE. For those of you that want to get nice and dirty, bibs are available as well as rolls of paper towels.  For those of you that dont want to get delicious BBQ sauce under your nails, knives and forks are available for your use. I suggest going dirty because it makes it more fun :)

My friend kept talking about how amazing this place is. I've never been here... so today we went for lunch! I asked him how long the wait was... he said that it was usually packed with a line out the door and wrapping around the place. When we went, no wait, no line, just awesomeness. Service was awesome, they're fast! They also came around to ask if everything was tasting fine. Indeed, it was. Got the 6-7 baby back ribs with macaroni & potato salad as my side orders. Let me tell you. You know ribs are cooked the right way when the meat slips off the bone. AWESOME AND DELICIOUS. I wanted more! This place is bomb...

MMM solidly good barbeque.   You can check online via webcam to see the line length..  Calling take out may be a good idea.   So, I've had both the beef & pork rib here.  Both are tasty.  The pork ribs are much more managable though.  Both really tender.   Fries & mac salad are pretty tasty.  Cole slaw isn't bad iirc.   I've never tried the chicken.   Smart choice having big trough sized sinks for handwashing :p.

Still as good as I remember it.  Over the years, the quality and consistency has not changed.  Though now that they have moved out of their original location and practically have taken over the strip mall at the Sports Arena, business is better than ever.  So good that they've even opened a location in San Marcos to cater to the North County peeps.  Wished they opened this location a few years ago when the gf still lived in Rancho Bernardo.  Rhonda is also at the new location to ensure things are set up correctly =(  didn't get to see her this time. This time around we had a group of 8.  We shared the 2 beef rib dinners (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…), a baby back rib dinner (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…), an order of steamed veggies and an order of onion rings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). We have yet to find a better bbq place in LA and I even dare to say Houston.  I just love how the meat on the beef ribs just simply falls off the bone.   Only wished I didn't have to drive so far just to satisfy my bbq craving.

Love the BBQ but hate the wait! Last weekend, I dined-in for the first time ever... I have always had Phil's either catered or called-in because the line is the longest I've seen for any restaurant. It was a good thing I had a little snack before coming to dinner because the anticipation, and the smell, of BBQ makes a hungry person go mad. For a mere $12, I had the Best of Both Worlds (why make a girl choose?) - Pork ribs with a quarter chicken (white meat), with a side of cole slaw and potato salad. If you're a fan of corn, I suggest switching the two (small) sides for a corn on the cobb. Now, I eat a lot, especially when I'm hungry and have been waiting 30-45 minutes for dinner, but MAN, I barely touched my chicken (I ate all my ribs first)! Needless to say, somebody had a tasty lunch the next day. Really, at Phil's, you can't go wrong if you enjoy BBQ. If you've got time on your hands, the wait is worth it. Just be sure to not come when you're starving.

We went here for one of my roomie's birthday celebration.  There were about 10 of us, so seating us took a bit considering the line was starting to wrap around the corner of the building. It had been a while since I'd eaten ribs, so naturally, I ordered them.  Just a half rack, but they were pretty finger lickin' good.  I liked the rolls of paper towels for napkins.  That's about all you need at a BBQ joint. Of course beer was there.  Beer is my friend and where there is beer there is a smiley Lahnna.  No Sierra, but Arrogant Bastard took care of me as an adequate carnivorous complement.   Tons of fries.  But the real surprise were the flippin' beans!  So so good!  Like, wow! So, yeah, here is my wrap up.  Phil's BBQ is awesome.  Meat eaters, enjoy!

I used their catering service for a work event at Mission Bay.  This was by far the easiest event thanks to Phil's BBQ!  I called up Sara and let her know when/where and how many and she helped me decide what we would need. All I had to do was show up!  They arrived an hour before our event and set up tables and all the trays.  The food arrived 15 minutes before the event was scheduled to start.  So by the time the first of 120 people showed up - all the food was ready to go and I was working on my tan (okay sunburn).   Once everyone was eating the servers walked around cleaning up debris and even wrapped up leftovers for people. Only drawbacks were that the salad and potato salad ran out too fast and they weren't the cheapest option...but they were certainly the easiest and the food was excellent as usual.

Not only the best BBQ in San Diego, probably one of the best restaurants I have been to anywhere. A very casual environment and the staff is very efficient at getting your orders and making your food. My favorites here would have to be the Broham (pulled pork sandwich) and the Onion Rings. It can get pretty messy to eat, but what's BBQ without getting your hands dirty? Also very cheap for what you get. Everyone who is in/visit San Diego needs to stop by here.

I was meeting a few friends for dinner and when I arrived I was stunned to see the line out the door.  Luckily, they arrived early so we only waited about 15 minutes for a table. The waitstaff were friendly and extraordinarily efficient.  Although, if you're a slow eater like myself that efficiency could make you feel rushed. DISCLAIMER: I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce (my friends think I'm crazy & I very well could be) however, I don't let that get in the way of trying something new. I ordered the 1/4 chicken dinner with french fries ($6.75).  Small price for tons of food. Despite of the BBQ sauce, I thought the chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious as it was tender and juicy. Most of my french fries were covered with BBQ sauce and being as how I'm not a fan, I only ate a few of those fries.  The ones that weren't covered I thought to be bland.

By far the best BBQ meal you can get in San Diego The mouth watering ribs are bomb. My girlfriend loves the chicken tickler with the baked beans and fries. The prices aren't that bad either $18 for a full rack of baby back ribs and $7 for there famous el torro. If you get here before 3 you shouldn't be waiting no longer than 40-50 mins. If you get here pass 3:30 you better not come hungry your going to be waiting a while. If your a BBQ lover then this is the place for you.

Really, the only reason to give Phil's any less than 5 stars is if you're the type to prefer turkey hot dogs over delicious, delicious ribs.  I'm sure there are delicious ribs elsewhere, no doubt, but at the same price and consistent quality, well that's just ludicrous. If Phil were real, I would probably marry him, figure out his secrets to his ridiculously amazing ribs, then divorce him to take half his rib assets.  And maybe some of the pork and bean assets.  Okay, and the rib-kids we would undoubtedly have. RIBS!

Oh Phils, how i miss thee.... One of the things i miss most from when i left P.B.... I can still taste their zesty bbq sauce on my mouth... Way back,me and my foxy lady used to go here a lot.  I know this is gonna sound really bad, but i am a san diego native and had no clue this place even existed until she kept goin on about "Phils BBQ".  So one day we went, and i fell in-love.   Now, 2 years after i learned about the best bbq by far in sd, i still go to Phils whenever im near by.  I still order pretty much the same thing, El Toro, Ribs & Chicken, Side of Coleslaw, Beans and Onion Rings, 3 ranches and a bev.  They have great beverages.   Phils is awesome, i wouldn't recommend taking a 1st date here, but its a cool place to get some grub and even catch a game.   I've ordered almost everything on the menu, i do not like the chick-less (Boneless chicken) its like way super dry, the burger?  Its an average burger, not worth getting when your at the best bbq joint in town. All in all, come to Phils, ask Antonio Cromartie, he ate here like 80 days in a row at one time, this is the spot, like down south bbq.

I went there again recently and had a great experience. It was at meal time but it was not on a weekend so it wasn't totally crazy like the time before, where ordering and getting your food was like having to wait to ride on Space Mountain. This time I got the "fast pass" (Another Disneyland reference for those who didn't catch that). We know the system pretty well now so we just call ahead and then go to the pick-up order window and get the food to go, or you can take it to the bar and eat it there. I got the pulled pork sandwich this time and it was pretty mouth watering. I would have bumped them up to yet even another star if the meat could be mouth melting as opposed to just watering. What? You say. What's the difference? The difference is that there is mouth watering good and then there's amazing- want- to-eat-this-meat- for-the-rest-of-my-life-because-it-just-melts-in-­my-mouth good. When the meat is so tender you can have no teeth but still eat it. What the heck am I even talking about? The meat is probably as tender as you will ever find.  I'm giving them 5 stars. Their food is friggin awesome. I just don't like the lines, but I have figured my super special secret way around that, (which I just shared with the world wide web on Yelp damn it). Anyways, after not having logistical problems getting my food anymore, and after trying a couple more great entrees and sides, I now conclude that this place pretty much rocks! I love BBQ food and this is the best place I have found in San Diego so far.

OMG! I've never had BBQ like this at a restaurant. After a family trip to Seaworld, we were all starving. My boyfriend, and cousin watched the show Man vs. Food & was raving about how great the food was at Phil's BBQ. My cousin warned us about the wait. He told us it can be up to a 2 hour wait. Thank goodness for our iphones! As we parked, I noticed the line was incredibly long covering 2 sides of the building. As I got in back of the line, I was about to ask my family if they really wanted to wait in this line, but the wonderful aroma from inside filled the air as a very pleased group exited the side door.  I could hear them all exclaiming how great their meal was. The aroma & everyone's content countenance gave me the patience to wait. There's a camera when you get to the halfway point in line & you can watch yourself live on their website if you have internet access. As you get closer, they have the huge menu posted up high because you have to be ready to order when you get to the front of the line because of the high volume. After they take your order in the front of the line, they seat you & you pick up your order when they call you. You basically order & serve yourself. Get your own drinks & everything. All the people you encounter seemed really friendly.  It seems pretty kickback. As I was picking up the food, I noticed a bar, so I grabbed a corona. Nice and cold. I went w/ a big family so we decided to order everything & share so we could all try everything. As I took the first bite of the ribs, I thought it was gonna melt in my mouth! Wow!! The flavor was absolutely wonderful! The pork & beef ribs were so tender! Oh my! The BBQ chicken was amazing! Everything was amazing!! All the sides! The corn, the coleslaw, the potatoes! Everything!! Good Lord! I think I died & went to heaven. I just wanted to relish that moment! When I go back to San Diego, I'm def going there again. The food was definitely worth the 2hour wait. Love it!

Even though I find this place way over-hyped with the lines going out the door (which i'm assuming is because of the publicity it received after man vs food), I can't say it's bad, or even just OK because it's not. It's really fucking good. I hate to give into the hype, but I can't resist some good ol' bbq. The prices are decent pero the food took a while to come out. That and they ran out of fat tire, when i was there at 3pm. Um, why? Nevertheless, I'm a fan.

I love Phil's BBQ. I loved it in Mission Hills. I love it in Sports Arena more. More space, quicker service, and I love me some amazing staff. I used to stick my nose out the window of the UCSD bus on the way home from work to get a wonderful whiff of joy as we passed by Goldfinch street. Now when my girl is at bellydance class at Cafe India, I'm dreaming of Phil's. The beef ribs make me drool and the side o beans can't be beat. I want to take a bath in a vat of Phil's special BBQ sauce. Thank you Phil's!

If you like BBQ you would like this place. This place has the traditional BBQ pork ribs and but... more importantly it has BBQ beef ribs. So there was 4 of us total in the party. We ordered two dishes. One being the Full baby back ribs and the other being full beef ribs. We selected 4 small sides that came with the ribs. The four being mac salad, coleslaw, fries, and well... I forget the 4th one. But... I have to say... They are all phenomonal.    I would have to prefer the baby back over the beef ribs more because of how tender pork was. The beef rib was good that it was big, juicy and quite meaty.  The fries... ohh the fries were excellent. They were like how "mama make it"   Well... I don't really know what else to say other than the service is pretty timely and the food is excellent. :) If you crave BBQ in San Diego... come check it out. :)

I will probably gain back all the weight i lost now that i have discovered this place.  My only quibble is the lack of greens on the side menu. Crap day at work? Phil's on Speed Dial get past that crazy line.  Settle into my 8 foot bean bag and inhale sweet smokey meats.

Let's just say that I don't normally like ribs or barbecue sauce.  I initially came in here with family (all of whom love ribs and had heard about Phil's legendary meals) and ordered corn on the cob and fries.  At the prodding of my 15-year-old cousin, I tried a bite of her riblets.  They were AMAZING!!!!  Soft meat, the sauce so good, I immediately began sneaking bites off of her plate!  We had to place another full order with the server!! Also, arrive early.  We got there around noon and waited 15 minutes.  By the time we were done around 1:30, the line was wrapped around the building.

Totally worth the wait in line. This would be my second visit to Phil's since I moved to San Diego. My first time writing because the last time I came here was before I joined Yelp. I came for the LA/SD Yelp meet-n-greet and had a good time with my fellow Yelpers hailing from up north. The management was well accommodating to us as they're obviously well aware about what Yelp is. Phil's BBQ always seems well prepared for the onslaught of hungry patrons. Their system works well. Service: 6 stars. As for the food. Well, DELICIOUSLY. EPIC. I want some more right now... even though I was in a serious food coma for all of yesterday afternoon. Words can't correctly describe the taste bud orgasm you receive. And the portions are epic as well, hence the food coma. So, well worth the long wait. Well worth the long nap afterward. Well worth coming back for more. I think that we've also decided that Phil's is a tourist attraction.  If you're visiting San Diego on vacation or whatever, COME HERE.

You can NEVER go wrong with Phil's BBQ! The best ribs I have ever had, thus far. The wait could be bad, but that's why you go at off times! You have to seat yourself, which could be a problem if its really busy, but I never had to wait too long to find a seat. I usually sat outside, though. I recommend the beef ribs and the baby back ribs. The portions are huge so sharing is a good idea! I don't like onion rings particularly, but the onion rings here are SOOOO good. It's so crispy and just plain awesome. The macaroni salad is really good too so I always get that as my side. Personally, I don't like the fries because every time I got it, it didn't taste fresh. It was very soft and mushy. I took my parents after my graduation and they fell in love. It's really hard to please the taste buds of Korean parents, but they approved. They are willing to make the 2 hour drive just to eat Phil's again! My dad's always asking me when we're going to go! If you are in the SD area and craving some bomb ribs (even if you aren't craving ribs), you should CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!!

Why do people wait here? Why did we wait here? WHY WHY WHY? Do you not realize that the to-go order counter and the eat-in counter is the SAME DAMN COUNTER? Do you not realize that the huge long depressing line you see circling the strip mall plaza floors is the line to eat-in, ONLY? Do you not realize that they give you the same food in both to-go and eat-in, only in different receptacles? Sure I'm not a big fan of Styrofoam as much as the next pseudo environmentally inclined Californian.... but seriously the wait is atrocious. I came here thinking that YAY I'm going to wait in line to eat amazing BBQ. Okay, fine I kind of threw a fit in the middle of waiting (I'm SO HUNGREEEEEE AGGGHH). Yeah, I kind of complained, a lot. But you know what! It was raining! And cold! And stuff. So when we finally got inside and to the counter, I was like holy shit all that could have been avoided. My companion and I spend the entire dinner marveling at the waste of our 1.5 hour wait. Do yourself a favor, order to go. Seriously. Unless you like waiting in lines or something, then go to Disneyland where you can't take the experience back in a paper sack (unless your companion vomits on Space Mountain, another review). The BBQ? Pretty good. Onion rings could use some work.

I'll wait! Even if it means waiting through the rain! It's worth it! I had the baby back rib tickler, which came with 3 ribs, a side of cole slaw, fries, and two onion rings. Ohmygoodness! Fall-off-the-bone heaven! I love the smokey-ness of the meat and how they don't drench the rib with the sauce. You can still taste the flavor of the meat. It was amazing. The cole slaw, fries and onion rings were delish! Everything was amazing! I came in a group of 6, so they actually set up a table for us and our waiter kept coming back to refill ice waters, hand out bibs, give us extra ranch/bbq/etc. sauces. Overall, super friendly service and amazing food!

Yummy! I would make this a regular stop any time I'm in the area and so should you. I tried the baby back ribs with fries and macaroni salad.  Everyone is right, the meat falls right off the bone and sauce has a nice spicy kick to it.  The fries and macaroni salad were good, but everything it overshadowed by the tasty ribs. We ordered to go, because the line was sooooo long.  Our to go order took about 10 minutes to get so definitely a good option if you don't want to wait. Last words...if you're in the area then you must go here :).

The easiest way to get Phil's incredible BBQ without the huge, long wait in line is to get them to cater your next event. They brought the magically delicious BBQ ribs and chicken, yummy, spicy baked beans and ho-hum coleslaw to our school fundraiser and man! was it ever good.

All I can base my five star rating on is from my experience of BBQ restaurants I have been to, and growing up in Southern California for the last 28 years.  I have never been to Texas, or experienced any of the BBQ you see on the Food Network where they go to these little Redneck towns to secret BBQ locations.  So maybe somewhere out there in Texas, there is better barbecue than Phil's.  This is the best BBQ you are going to experience anywhere around here. Yes, the lines are long.  No, it doesn't get knocked down for that.  Just place a phone order before you leave.  It is soooooo easy!!! I enjoy the beef ribs, and the broham.  All of the sides are amazing, especially the onion rings, and the macaroni salad.  Just go, you won't be disappointed.

After all the years of hype and excitement about Phil's BBQ, I finally had the chance to visit the renowned restaurant. And did it live up to the hype? The food was good and flavorful, yes. But maybe since all of my friends had made it seem like THE PLACE for ribs and all things BBQ I was imagining: grade A+++ sauce, tender, moist, fall-off-the-bone meat, and delish side dishes. Soo I must say I was a tad disappointed. I was not extremely impressed by the sauce. It was tangy and sweet, but perhaps a little too tangy for me, or perhaps there was too much sauce on the ribs. The sauce hid the slight dryness of the baby back ribs, and the meat was not as tender as I had imagined. I ordered the fries and baked beans as side dishes, and both were good. Add a few dashes of the Tony's Creole seasoning (found on the tables) onto the fries and you're good to go! The fries were very crispy and I liked how they kept the skin on, which added more depth to the flavor. I tried my friend's macaroni salad, which was nothing to rave about. Plain, creamy, and that's about it. There's always a line (so I hear) but the line moves quickly, so don't be deterred! You might have to walk around the restaurant a few times to find a place to sit during busy hours, but the wait staff are quick and friendly. I'll go back and try the ribs one more time and hopefully it'll be a bit more tender *crosses fingers*. But if you have not yet tried Phil's, it's definitely worth a try and you will probably like it!

I've been to Phils' bbq too many times and I ALWAYS leave this place with a happy belly and a big smile!   I'm currently in love with their beef ribs.  Mac and beans go hand in hand and great when mixed together.  Onion rings have the perfect crunch and scrumptious when dipped in ranch.   The line can be long and intimidating, but it's worth the wait!!

Anyhoo its ALwAAYs busy so dont be in a hurry, (if you are get it to go),but theres a reason why it's busy: good bbq!

Big round of applause for Phil!! He was there saying hi to every customer, came to our table and noticed that one piece my BBQ Chicken looked very burnt. He immediately offered to get me a new piece, and told me to take it home if I can't eat all of it. How cool was that? The BBQ here is superb. Definitely the best I've had in Socal. Their fries and macaroni salad are both very good...and thumbs up for moving into this new location at Sports Arena. We hardly had to wait very long for our order to be ready. Love this place.

My first time ever and I have lived in San Diego my entire life!!! I think the reason I stayed away were the rumors I heard about the long lines...but foolish me, a line a mile long would have made it worth the wait. As it was, although the line was long, the wait was short. The restaurant is very organized and as soon as a register is open you are directed to it by a very friendly, very chatty beautiful black lady who is part hostess, part show director and part Phil's diplomat. She was handing out magnets which are very handy for putting on your fridge both at work and home. So unlike most rib lovers, I do not care for pork ribs, I am a beef rib lady all the way to the grave, so I ordered a beef rib plate which came with one fat ass rib, 2 KILLER batter dipped and fried onion rights and some righteous but not sweet cole slaw. Oh yeah, a TON of homemade french fries which were very good but truly dude, there was like half a pound!! The rib was perfectly sauced, as I took my first bite I closed my eyes and thought  to myself " So this is what some folks mean when they say  ~heaven on earth~." OMG...tender, somewhat sweet....I wish I could have had ten more but I was at lunch with friends and didn't want to freak them out. The service was excellent, the cashier was very helpful and after you place your order you are given a buzzer which lets you know when your food is ready. Honestly that place was as busy as a bee hive but everything happened in a timely fashion,  no undue waiting, kudos to the great mind who thought the process through, from standing in line, to waiting for the food at the first open table (and there were plenty.) Dirty dishes are picked up on a regular basis, drinks come from an all you-can-drink fountain including get this...Kool Aid...and there are rolls of papertowels on the table. Outside the bathrooms is a big, long, wide sink with several faucets and lots of soap dispensers and paper towel holders...GENIUS!. The only teeny, tiny little suggestion I would have would be to possibly add another restroom...only two toilets for such a big restaurant? Well, I had to go and I have very little pride so I made like the Europeans and used the boys room. A very handsome young man came over to ask us how our food was and was startled when we told him it was our first time even though we are all natives..(.I was going to insert a joke here about beef ribs but thought against it) Anyway Phil, if you ever read these reviews, please know that you have another customer for life. You guys rock!

First off, this is NOT BBQ.  As a few people say below, BBQ is simply disastrous in San Diego.  If you're from Texas, and your friends are saying "Lets go to Phil's, its the best BBQ you'll ever have!" you'll probably be disappointed.  It isn't BBQ like you know it.   That said, if you think of Phil's as a rib joint, it really is quite excellent.  Both their pork baby back ribs and beef ribs are fantastic.  They are very tender and juicy - perfectly cooked in my opinion.  Their sauce is kind of the vinegary, sweet style, probably more Mississippi style than TX, or SE.  Its an amazing combo with their fries and beans.  The atmosphere is great too - bluesy music in the background, cool bar area with good beers on task.   So why only 4 stars?  Well.... its honestly a pain to eat here.  The line on most nights is at least 15-20 minutes long, closer to 30-45 on weekends.  You see a lot of people saving spots in line for big groups too - one time we were behind a couple of people who became an entire football team.  There is something about the system that isn't quite right, and it can be frustrating when you're hungry smelling those heavenly ribs. Take out, which is what their old location mostly was (tiny area inside), doesn't work too well either - its just not as good once you get home.

You know how your driving to Disneyland, and you already know before walking through the gates that you MUST ride Splash Mountain, and then you finally make your way to the line, and it's 10 miles long, but you don't care, because you MUST ride this ride before exiting the park, so you stand in line, with a few (or a lot) of good friends) choppin' it up about random things, playing various hand clapping games like slide and patty cake, tweeting or texting, anything to make the time to go buy, because finally when you get on the ride, and it lasts only 3 minutes after standing in line for and hour and 45 minutes, but it was all worth it because I mean... it's Splash Mountain at Disenyland?! :D Yeah, that's kind what Phil's is in a nutshell. My first time here, the line was RIIIII-DIC!... ridiculously long. I about turned around and went back to my car to head to Red Lobster for some cheesy bread right across the way, but everyone suggested I stayed that it was worth the seemingly endless line that wraps around the building. I'm not going to lie, the food is super delicious, ANND the portions are huge, which work REALLY well with my Samoan nature of eating well over capacity. The ribs fall off the bone, the fries are crisp, ranch is creamy goodness in a little plastic capsule, and the onion rings are one of their signatures, just immaculate conception between batter an onion. I tried the chicken WITH the ribs, and the ribs won in a landslide of BBQ sauce, no joke. If you do the ribs after the chicken, you'll never go back to chicken again. There's no point in keeping your tastebuds unsatisfied. Anyhow, I love this place. The customer service is awesome, there's a tall dude there that always has a smile on his face and is pretty much the face of Phil's when I get there. I'm always hoping to sit in his section, usually if I can't find anything, he assists in finding one for me :D Such a sweetheart. The people are great, it's busy, ALL. THE. TIME. The line sometimes seems intimidating, but once you get a hold of those ribs, it's all glorious wonderment from then on. :)

I would give this place 5 stars, but because there is always a long line is why I'd give 4. Phil's is for football nights in my household. I remember going to Phil's back in the day when you ordered through their shack and the line used to go around the corner, located in Mission Hills. To this day, they've lived up to their expectation and shows for it for being featured in Man vs. Food. If you haven't tried this place, you clearly must be a vegetarian!

After my review, Fred, the owner of Phils, replies with this offensive remark to me and to our Military family.   "If you got in the military for free food, you are in it for the wrong reasons." All I did was to suggest to Phil's to show some sort of Military appreciation, and he replys with such an offensive remark!  I've read through Phil's 1~2 star remarks, and he seems to take it very personally, since he has replied quite vilently and offensively to most of them.   All Military members, stay away from Phils!!!!!

Okay, I'd been looking forward to finally eating  whatever seemingly super-awesome BBQ caused people to form a line that nearly wraps around the restaurant, and now that I have fulfilled that fat-kid goal, I must ask: WHAT THE #$%^ is wrong with your taste buds, San Diego!? It's safe to assume that the people handing out five-star ratings have never had real BBQ, or for that matter, good BBQ as compared to mainstream BBQ chains that ain't half bad for what they're worth. I ordered the Beefy Rib & Chick-less Dinner, and the meal was average at best. I suppose the prices are fair given the possible portion sizes, but when I sit down to eat a meal I'm paying for, it'd damn well better be HOT, not sorta warm, but HOT if nothing else. Aside from the food, the employees I encountered were all a joy to be around for the seconds we spent together, and the sinks that saved me from having to enter the restroom to wash my hands are this freak's dream come true. So in closing,  I love meat, and I love BBQ, but the only way I'd consider getting my chubby jollies off at Phil's again is if it were free, because if there is anything I love more than meat, BBQ, and puppies, it's free.

Phil's BBQ may seem like a long wait but they do move kind of fast. You are actually waiting in line to order your food then get seated. Food was ready in less than 6 mins thereafter! The baby back and beef ribs were so delicious. All meat came right off the bone so this BBQ is done right! Only thing is....the bbq sauce is not the best that I have tried. It's got too much vinegar and salt in it for my taste. I do enjoy the itty bitty kick it has to it though.

Come on San Diego...is this really what you call BBQ?  First off the OB BBQ house kills this place.  Secondly, this place is just crying out to be a chain and that's just lame. The sauce is sweet, which I'm not a fan of but can normally tolerate...definitely can't tolerate it here.  The pulled pork had barely any flavor and the fries tasted as if they just came out of the freezer. Save yourself the trouble...sure it's cheap and it has great reviews (I have no idea why, really), but I'd rather eat a McRib than pretend to call this good BBQ.

The line here is SUPER LONG sometimes... because yeah, it's THAT DELICIOUS! The line moves pretty quickly, so just hold on and wait! The ribs here are juicy and succulent! They slip right off the bones! How perfect is that? I love their sides as well. This place is great for families and large groups. Sharing a bunch of BBQ is fun at Phil's! Highly recommend this place. I think it is better than Lucille's!

This place MUST be good since I trekked all the way from Irvine for BBQ! We arrived at about 6, which is pretty early for dinner, but there was already a line out the door. You order at the cashier first and then grab a seat and wait for your order to be called. I think this is a pretty good set up, because when I'm craving some good BBQ, I don't really care about table service and such, just give me the meat! Since this is far for me, we ordered a lot so we can try everything. Between 4 of us (3 being girls), we got a whole rack plus half rack of the pork ribs, and another whole rack plus half of the beef ribs. For sides we got fries, the baked beans, cole slaw and corn on the cobb. First the meat. The beef ribs were soooo meaty! I ate one and I was already feeling pretty satisfied. I was afraid the sauce was going to be too sweet for my liking, but I didn't mind it, could've been more tangy or spicy, but that's just my preference. The pork ribs were very tender and  had a good amount of meat per bone also and it was also very moist. The one gripe about the beef ribs was that while most of the ribs we got were super meaty and moist, there were a couple end pieces where it was more chewy and jerky like, but still, soooo good. Sides were not very good. That's why I couldn't give them 5 stars. The beans tasted like they went a little over board with the "smokey" flavor, maybe too much liquid smoke? The coleslaw was nothing to rave about, the cabbage tasted a little too raw, partly because the cabbage was cut pretty coarse, and the fries were just OK as well, I'd rather have Mcdonalds ones. So come here for the meat, or take out and bring it home and eat it with your own sides. One thing to  note, they have a hand washing station near the bathroom area. I like that touch because BBQ definitely can get messy. (We saw a guy in a WHITE SUIT eating there..weird!) BUT, the soap is SUPER strong. I washed my hand before eating, and every time my hand got too close to my face while I was trying to clean my rib bones, I could smell the soap. It's like industrial strength or something. So be wary of that if you don't want to smell soap the whole time you eat, unless you want to be fancy and knife and fork it.

OH MY Fxxxinglicious Good! Never come at dinner hour or lunch hour, you'll be standing in line for ordering and then for finding the table for AWHILE, always come slightly an hour before dinner, just when the crowds aren't hungry and cranky yet.

What the hell did I know? Prior to this past Saturday - I HATED BARBECUE.  I'm from NJ, and BBQ means slapping some burgers and dogs on the grill.  Maybe some chicken.  Maybe a steak.  Not this weird "pulled pork" (REALLY with that name?) or ribs slathered in sauce that tastes like tangy grossness, smoke and dirt.  Not my idea of a good time. However, my BF's friend birthday lunch celebration was being held at Phil's, and I figured I would suck it up, give it a try and be a good sport. Apparently I had gone to sub-par BBQ joints in the past, because Phil's was delicious.  I was not grossed out by the sauce, or the texture or anything that I encountered.  I got the BBQ Broham pulled pork sandwich, as did my boyfriend. We both highly recommend it.  The sandwich is busting out the bun!  The last time I had a pulled pork sandwich it was so dry.  Not the case at Phil's.  The meat is tender and slathered in a delicious sauce.  Also, the cole slaw is very tasty.  Surprising, since I'm not usually a fan of slaw.   I wish I could have finished mine sandwich, but I only got about halfway through and my stomach was about to burst. The BF also ordered the 1 beef rib sampler.  I scoffed, thinking "Why the hell is he paying $3.95 for 1 freakin' rib?"  Little did I know that the rib is the size of one of those ginormous turkey legs you can get at the Ren Faire!  I have never seen a rib so huge in my life.  I tried a bite, and it was also delicious.  The meat is very tender. We also ordered a side of fries (the small, which takes up an entire huge plate!) and a side of onion rings.    The fries are nothing exciting, but the onion rings are insane!  Huge, sweet and crispy.   As per usual, the BF and I ordered way too much food, didn't even come close to finishing it, and spent the next 3 hours sleeping off the food coma. We arrived at a little after 12 noon, and the line was already out the door, but not terrible. Service at both the counter and from the bussers was great.  Very friendly.   Barbecue would still not be my first choice when dining out; however, it's good to know that I do not have to avoid this place like the plague.

Get ready to stuff your face and get a little messy while doing so. Phil's BBQ is a San Diego staple... not a classy establishment by any means but a real crowd pleaser with delicious BBQ meals. Once you get to the front of the line order your meal and then find a table to sit at. Wait for food to arrive and then get ready to eat! Might as well get a doggy bag since the portions are big. The beef ribs and pulled pork sandwich are favorites with a side of fries with ranch and bbq sauce to dip.

I either saw this place on yelp or on TV, I'm leaning towards yelp. Instead of waiting forever for a table, we ordered to go. The line to order out was much shorter. The line to eat at a table wrapped around the corner, I didn't even want to see how far it went. We got the half order beefy ribs (3 ribs) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… & half order baby back ribs (6 ribs?) http://www.yelp.com/biz_…. Each comes with 2 small sides or 1 large side. We opted for potato salad (potatoes with skin), macaroni salad, fries, & sweet beans. Out of the sides, I liked the sweet beans the most. Everything else seemed like I could get them anywhere else. The ribs were too saucy, spicy, & tangy for my taste. For 2 people, that was so much food (I think I can eat a lot), even though the items we ordered were each half orders. It's worth it to try this place once, just to see what the hype is all about.

I don't understand the appeal of this place. The line is ginormous, you order at this mcdonalds looking register, you wait for your food while staring at all the people who are feasting on their selections, you finally find a seat after lingering around a table of customers, and.... Then the food arrives. We dig in, expecting an out of this world experience. I'm not denying that the ribs and meat aren't good, because it is! But I can make all of this at my BBQ parties, and for much cheaper and less stress. It's not worth all that!

Phil, it has been about 2 years and I still pine for you.  Yes, there is The Joint in Bywater, and he does a 5 star job of satisfying my Q cravings, BUT, it is you PHIL who kept me full of sweet, delicious Q. The baby back ribs are my favorite, close second pulled pork (am I correct?) yeah, those 10 napkin meals and the beer I had to go get separately from the separate bar area.  I didn't mind, really I didn't.

I could not wait to go home for Thanksgiving for a few reasons. 1. See the family 2. Visit my buddies 3. Finally go to Phil's new Sports Arena location Compared to their original Golden Hill "camper shell" location, the Sports Arena location is like a double-wide trailer.  Ok, bad analogy, the food is far from trailer-trash.  I got ribs, chicken, fries, and onion rings.  The donut-sized onion rings were great, I couldn't stop munching on them.  As expected, the ribs were excellent, smoky sweet with just enough spice to keep me licking my fingers.  The chicken sort of surprised me, as I haven't had it before, and it was well cooked, and hell, coat a newspaper in that sauce, I'll eat it.  The fries were blanketed in ribs and sauce, if only In-n-out's animal-style fries were this good...  This place reiterates the fact that Phil's has the best BBQ I've ever eaten.  Seriously. The bar is a quintessential addition, beer and meat, you can't go wrong.  It's your own fault if you're a vegetarian prude.  You gotta love the huge open sink for washing hands, though I wouldn't mind wearing that smell for the afternoon.  The decor of the place is just right, thanks Phil's for not going into the Chili's/Friday's zone of hanging stupid tacky sh*t everywhere.  Keep hanging those bbq and rib contest trophies, I'm sure there'll be more to come.

I'm actually not a huge BBQ fan, but this place is finger-lickin' good!!! My bf took me here, surprised that I had never been to Phil's BBQ during the 4 years I had lived in SD. I shrugged it off, wondering how great can the ribs be? Boy - was I wrong. Between the two of us, we shared the Half Rib Dinner, which included 6 bones of baby back ribs and 2 small sides (or 1 large side). We got 2 small sides of coleslaw and fries which wonderfully complemented our meal. The Baby Back Ribs were probably one of the best I have ever had. The Mesquite grilled ribs were rich in flavor and the meat was cooked just right. Other places tend to slightly overcook the ribs, which was probably why I never really liked ribs, but this place is simply amazing! Phil's BBQ is probably not the place you'd take your first date because it gets REALLY messy. (Some people were wearing bibs). Don't wear nice clothes and get ready to get down and messy. If you want some really good ribs, this is definitely the place to check out if you already haven't.

I really wish they had kept open both locations - who cares if the air in Mission Hills smells like BBQ?! I'm not a huge BBQ fan or a huge meat fan but I like Phil's - I usually get the veggie burger. It's just upsetting because the line is always around the corner and in the parking lot. Its a crazy (but organized) free for all.

Overrated! Seriously, considering the amount of praise Phil's gets from Yelpers, I expected food Mecca but left rather let down. I ordered the beefy ribs and chicken combo with fries and red beans. The chicken was terrible! Super dry and not an ounce of liquid to be found in any of the handful of bites I ventured to try! The ribs were okay. They were smothered with sauce but the meat itself didn't have much flavor - the taste of fat made it hard to taste what flavor the meat possibly had. The fries were pretty good when covered with a more than liberal dash of the cajun seasoning... they do a great job of filling you up just in case the meat doesn't. Red beans were weak! Way too watery! Overall, I don't know if Phil's is worth the drive or the wait and still leaves me without a good barbecue watering hole in San Diego...

dude you NEED to get the food to go, the line is much much shorter! And eat in the parking lot or something- I don't think this place is worth an hour+ wait. The people who work here are really nice though- passed around fries to those of us waiting in line and there's cucumber water so you don't die of hunger. Had the baby back ribs + fries + macaroni salad. I surprisingly liked the bbq- I'm not typically a fan of sweet sauces and thankfully this was more savory/vinegary than sweet.

Saturday Evening (around 5ish) * Dine in: 50+ min wait---the line was wrapped around the corner of the restaurant! yikes! * Phone in Order: they said 15-20 min, but we actually got our order in about 10 min! whoo hooo! With the "bleh" rate we were going w/  the mediocre tasting food joints we had visited earlier in the day, we did not want to take our chances of fighting the looooooooong line--only to be disappointed. Hence, we got out of line and  made a phone order and picked up our food within 10 minutes. FOOD: * pulled pork sandwich: LOADED with smokey flavored super DRY shredded pork. friend #1: "tastes like dried squid" friend #2: "yeah, I agree" me: "me three!" * Half rib dinner: - semi "fall off the bone", BUT the sauce was too tangy for me and they over cooked the edges---had to toss out a big portion of the ribs because it was over charred. * Colossal onion rings - good thing we got the small order, it was huge in size(see picture). * baked beans: pretty good * coleslaw: not bad SERVICE: 2 thumbs up Bottom line: another 'must try'.....only ONCE.

BBQ Mecca! After hearing my friends rave about Phil's BBQ, I had to give it a try. Came with a bunch of friends around 6pm. We got seated at 8pm. Yup, the line was that long. Be ready to wait! The wait is worse than it seems because you can smell the barbecue. Also, you can see the people through the windows chow down their food while you just try not to stare at them and drool. While waiting in line, I had a hard time deciding what to get. I definitely wanted baby back ribs, but I also wanted to try the beefy ribs and the chicken. Also, I wanted to try ALL of their sides!! I decided to go with the Quarter Baby Back Ribs Dinner with Sweet Baked Beans and Coleslaw....AND Beef Rib Dinner with Macaroni Salad and Potato Salad. Yes, I was starving. I was so excited for this meal I was about the cry when I picked up my food. First bite into my baby back ribs....OMG.... I cannot believe how good it was. The meat fell off the bone. The bone came out so clean. Meat was juicy and tender. It was perfectly paired with the sweet, tangy, and spicy barbecue sauce. The beef ribs where the same. Super super tender and really soft. Fall of the bone as well. I'm DROOLING as I'm typing right now. Sides: The best was the Sweet Baked Beans. Sweet, but not overly sweet. Really good. The coleslaw was really good and refreshing. The mac salad and potato salad were good as well. I cannot wait to come back. Phil's BBQ, you have raised the bar. I will NEVER order ribs anywhere else.

Phil's BBQ sauce seems to make people crazy. I called in an order this evening and when I went to pick it up there was a line of hungry barbecue lovers going out the door. Bear in mind this was at quarter of nine on very freakin cold Tuesday night. I could not believe my eyes. I thought they were selling Playstation Threes here or something. But no, it was just that sauce. I'm telling you -- it makes them crazy! I have never been here at peak hours (like dinner on the Weekends) but I imagine it probably looks like that cafeteria scene in Animal House. I mean, they have a handwashing station for customers right in the middle of the restaurant. And rolls of paper towels on every table. And a bib dispencer! One cannot help but wonder if Phil has dealt with a dry cleaning bill or two in his day. I could totally see some lady complaining because she got barbecue sauce on her blouse while commando rolling her way to a second serving of ribs. This place has that effect on people. AV

I made a large order here and never received such great service! When I came to pick up my food, they even let me use their Styrofoam carrying cases and said "just bring them back whenever you have a chance." Since I wasn't from the area, I found this a bit interesting that they would trust a complete stranger to return their probably expensive carrying cases. Anyway, we ended up returning the goods before we left San Diego, but only after we enjoyed racks and racks of ribs, chicken, wonderful beans, onion rings, fries, and corn on the cob! THE ONLY SUGGESTION I WOULD HAVE is this: Have a side of macaroni and cheese available (not the mac salad), because everyone in my party wanted that so we had to go to Bristol Farms and buy a $30 platter of macaroni and cheese that wasn't that good compared to the mouth-watering menu at Phil's. Good thing I also pre-ordered because the line was about 20 yards outside the front entrance. -Matt

There's a party in my tummy everytime I eat at Phil's.  And you know that's because I don't overeat (anymore).  I started going to Phil's when I lived in Mission Hills, and Phil's was on Goldfinch.  I had a special love for that location, but BYGONES!  Now Phil has moved up and out--why wait for 7 hours to get a rack of ribs when you can wait 1 hour, a know?!  But you know what?  It's so worth it!  My faves are the pork ribs, fries and beans.  And you need to have the onion rings with the buttermilk dressing--OMG, to die for!!  And with a pint of brew!  It doesn't get much better when you're finger-lickin' bbq sauce, my friend! Other things I go for are the Chickless Dinner and the Brougham Sandwich.

I've been going to Phils for 6+ years now, back when they were just a little shack in Mission Hills.   When they moved down to Point Loma, I expected that it woudln't be nearly as good, but they are still 100% on top of things at this joint.   If you don't like waiting, which most people don't when they're hungry, call ahead, and take your food to go.  Find a nearby park or picnic area and chow away.   If you don't mind waiting, this place is worth the wait and you will constantly crave Phils and want to come back for more.  I won't even go anywhere else, and I've traveled all over the world, and when someone mentions BBQ, I just laugh and say "I'll wait until I get back to San Diego"... ;) Which leads me to my question... Do they put crack in the ribs?!

What can I say that hasn't been talked about in almost 2,000 reviews before me?  Phil's is a good BBQ spot, indicative by the round-the-corner line that is always formed at the front door. Any place that serves mass quantities of slow-cooked meats can't be a bad thing.  They have great variety on their menu (as long as you want beef, pork or chicken).  They'll smoke it, grill it, pull it, chop it, or sauce it with each individual order. My first man-meal years ago at their Hillcrest location was their standard (pork) ribs and chickless meal with beans and mac, to which I added two beef bones and onion rings to share.  More food than one person needs, but when has that ever stopped me before?  Been going back ever since, usually with a smaller order but I still try to get the best of everything, usually by sharing with someone else. I would like to see a thing or two added to their sides, namely mac 'n cheese and collard greens... but I am always happy with the beans, mac salad, fries, cole slaw... you really can't go wrong with any of them.

I gotta say, the management definitely won me over! After my mediocre review of Phil's, the big bosses there stepped it up :) I am surprised by how willing they are to accommodate & make up for a poor experience there. We went with a group of 4, got complimentary meals, and had quick service. AND THE FOOD..well, that's spoken for already from other Yelpers. Just to reiterate the goodness of the food: both the pork & beefy rib meat just melts in your mouth & the corn on the cob is  so sweet and juicy (my fave side dish). Secretly, I love the big roll of towels because I can get as messssy as I like. Messy eaters unite!

BBQ or Steamed? I'm not sure how this place is ranked this high, but have any of y'all tasted real BBQ?  When you pulled into the parking lot, did you see any grills/smokers in the back?  Or did you smell the wood burning to flavor the meat with smoke flavor?  I saw or smelt none of these things...  So would you consider this true BBQ? I'm pretty big when it comes to BBQ.  When I came down, my friends said we are taking you to a BBQ joint.  I was excited to see what the hype was about.  But disappointed when pulling up and not seeing smokers or grills in the back for authentic BBQ. The taste...  It was okay, I've been to many BBQ places that definitely tastes better than Phil's.  I really don't have nothing else to say besides this is not authentic BBQ. Process of cooking is definitely in the over and then tossing it on the grill to get a last minute char for the BBQ effect.  Ribs were probably dried rubbed or brined tossed into the over with a thin layer of water and cover with foil to steam it so it stays tender...  Then when needed, tossed on the grill to heat it up and char it a little.  Then toss on the BBQ sauce. Where is my BBQ with either wood or charcoal? =/

Honestly..do I need to say more??? PHILS IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, SAVORY, AND YOU CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH OF IT!!! Honestly, i came into UCSD hearing about Phils and I didn't expect much especially because I felt like it was SO overhyped....damnn I was SO wrong. The very first time I went to Phils, the line wasn't too long! So I was a happy camper. As soon as you walk in the entrance you know the ambiance is great. Besides, the lady at the front of the line who tells you to go sit at a specific table is amazing! She makes my night everytime I go! I usually order half rack (I'm pretty fat) baby back ribs with a side of macaroni salad and beans. MMMMMM-MM-Mm One thing I LOVE about phils is that their food comes out so quick! You never have to wait more than 5 minutes for your food. Another additional yum-factor food they have are their ONION RINGS. Let me tell you this...THEY'RE COOKED TO PERFECTION. You've got to try it with the ranch sauce or usually I ask for an extra case of BBQ sauce so I just dip it and grub away! Your fingers get a little messy but..it's all worth it. The first bite you take into your ribs..i dont think you'll ever ever forget it. it tastes...pretty freaking amazing. It's so tender that when you run your fork through it, the pork just kind of melts off the bone...MMMMMM!!!!!!!!! I usually get a side of lemon and I sprinkle it on top just to give it extra flavor. Once, I was sooooo obsessed with Phils I think I had it 3 times in a week. You've got to try itttttt

Visited SD this weekend and FINALLLY got to go to Phil's! My friends talk nonstop about it and oftentimes drive 2 hours just for some of this BBQ. We got there around 7pm, and the line looked so long - luckily for people in line, i saw servers passing around trays of french fries to keep hungry tummies happy!! We anticipated the long line, so called in our order and only had to wait in a 10 minute To-Go line. Baby Back Ribs: YUM! Beef Ribs: LARGE and YUM! Beer Battered Onion Rings: SO MANY in one serving and also YUM! Come hungry! Servings are pretty big - for 2 guys and 2 girls, we ordered 2 full racks of baby back ribs, 3 beef ribs, onion rings and fries, and we ended up SO FULL and also probably only killed 2/3 of it.

The line is usually around the building but it's definitely worth the wait! I'm not even a huge ribs fan but I'll eat ribs here, so that says a lot. Love their bbq sauce and everything we ordered was delicious. Everyone working there was more than nice and very polite whenever we needed extra settings, napkins, etc.

Best barbecue I have had, ever, in my entire life. I am so lucky to be a San Diego-ite. If you live in San Diego and haven't heard of Phil's BBQ, you are either a vegetarian, or living in a cave at Cowles Mountain. This place is meat-centric, so don't take your vegan, vegetarian, raw food diet, or neo-hippie health nut friends here. This place is one of those places where you go to eat MEAT, like a neanderthal, off the bone, dripping with sauce messy, and filled with char-grilled satisfaction. If you are on a date with someone who is fancy and/or shmancy, dressed up, wearing nice clothing, going to a club afterward, or aren't going to be near some exfoliating hand soap later, you might want to check something else out for the evening. You are going to get messy, and your companion should be on board with that. Also, just my own advice: if they aren't, then you should find a new companion anyway. So, from my own experience... the beef ribs are a must. They are fall-off-the-bone tender and taste so delicious they would make a modern-day Siddhartha give up his quest just to mack down on some ribs. Eating these ribs has given me my own definition of nirvana... a full rack makes an excellent meal in itself. The pulled pork sandwich is awesome, the brisket sandwich is awesome... The Pork ribs are fall off the bone and delicious, and the chicken is... well, the chicken is the only thing that isn't really EXCELLENT, but it is really good. Dip it in some extra BBQ sauce on the side followed by some ranch and you will have an excellent time. Basically, the entrees themselves are amazing, and you can't go wrong... but I would say avoid the chicken by itself if you want to have a well-rounded meal. If you want chicken, get the half and half (half chicken half pork rack or half chicken and 2 beef bones) so that you can get the best of both worlds. So, there's always a caveat even with a 5 star rating... and in this case it is the sides, which aren't all that awesome. However, the sides are basically just empty vessels in which to transport more barbecue sauce or their awesome ranch dressing into your mouth. I usually avoid them, because the protein here is what's really on display... If you want a nice side with a little carbs, add an order of onion rings and ranch and you will be happier than wasting your time with their corn or fries. Or just fill up on meat! You wont be disappointed. And then there's the location, which is by far fine... there is plenty of room inside, they have an event center for large parties... but the only glaring issue I have with Phil's is the line. Call me a hipster, but I used to like Phil's before it was everyone's go-to spot and the line was only ever 30 minutes long at the most. Now, everyone and their mother loves Phil's, so getting in can take up to a 2 hour wait in a line that wraps around the building during peak hours... which isn't very conducive to hunger abatement. In fact, standing in line for 2 hours while waiting to eat, smelling the freshly fired meat wafting around, could be enough to go on a hunger-induced rampage. However, there are several ways to avoid this line. I will let you in on a few age-old secrets that work for me every time. Firstly, why eat there? go get it to go, and take it home. You avoid the seating line and go straight to the front, they fire the food as soon as you get there so it is still piping hot, throw it under a blanket or in a heat bag you stole from your last shift at Domino's Pizza and you have the same experience at home where you can eat like a fatass and then take a nice long guilty shower afterward to reminisce upon your poor eating decisions and exfoliate the barbecue sauce that somehow seeped into your pores. Secondly if you must eat there, just come during non-peak hours (make your dinner plans for 5pm or 8pm, and your line will be significantly shorter.) Last, but not least... and this is key... find a friend with a birthday and have them sign up for the Phil's newsletter to get a front of the line pass for the week of their birthday! If you have multiple friends who like Phil's and a birthday to celebrate in every month, you can skip the line once a month! I cannot tell you how satisfying it is to walk past hundreds of hungry people in line waving your front of the line pass and whispering under your breath "look at these suckers waiting in line, muahahaha." Yes, this could be the reason to stay in touch with that awkward kid from high school with the only birthday you know of in September ;) Anyway, lines aside, the food is worth the wait, and while the prices are a bit high, but the food quality makes it more than worth the price as well. The sides are overpriced, but just skip them... There's always room for more meat!

Finally got to the new Phil's and ordered for pick-up. It was a bland Tuesday night everywhere else except this place - it was hoppin!  Although there were designated lines for phone orders & walk-in orders posted OUTSIDE, there was only 2 other people in front of me. in the phone-in order line.  Too bad for the walk-in orders though - it must have been 30 people deep.  After paying, I only had to wait 5 minutes for my order.  During that time, I looked around a bit and saw that about every table was full, but this is no surprise because they have the BEST DAMN RIBS ever!   After I picked up my grub, I hightailed it outta there and drove back home to downtown.  Unfortunately I got stuck in Padres traffic.  Fortunately I ordered the onion rings - which I've been told were excellent.  Being the first time for me to get them, I just HAD to try a bite before they got cold.  Needless to say, the rest never made it back home.  I ate ALL the onion rings on the way home!   If you haven't tried this place, go for the pork ribs & onion rings with ranch.  You'll dream about them afterwards!

Sweet Jesus! My cousin wasn't lying when they handed me a pterodactyl size ribs. I wasn't sure if the large portions was for my rookie ass but eating that bad boy is like eating a young baby. I was pretty surprised that I was able finish my Beef Ribs & Chicken, the tasty sides of fresh coleslaw and potato salad, and the numerous gallons of beer for my small skinny ass. So beware, you need a couple notches to loosen that belt of yours. It's that good. All I could say it was the best weight gain I endured during my visit to the San Diego. Ugh! I only wish if the Bay Area could have such a BBQ joint for it's quality, quantity, and pricing.

Okay...I got flack for giving Phil's only 3 stars -- I'm sorry!  I must have been having a bad, "ugh I ate too much" day :). I went back to Phil's and I enjoyed...no make that...LOVED every itty bitty morsel.  I wasn't even full after all that food because I wanted more!  I've heard that Phil's BBQ style is sweet and not spicy like Texas BBQ but that ribs I had were spiced perfectly.  The coleslaw -- yum.  The fries -- yum.  The onion rings -- yum. **** The one and only time (so far) that I've been to Phil's was pretty good.  The wait wasn't too bad (I hear lines get out of control) and the service was okay, too.  You don't really have a waiter so I can't judge much on that note.  The food was really delicious (ribs were tender and fell right off the bone) but I felt like I was going to have a heart attack afterwards its "A-OK" for me!

I've been to Phil's several times and it's about damn time I got around to writing a review. Easily the best BBQ I've ever had. I have to keep going back..this place is ADDICTING. (I may need an intervention...just so long as it's held at Phil's) I've eaten in the dining room and done the take-out thing. First...the food. I always get the baby back ribs and sometimes get them with the chicken. The menu states that you get 4 bones...but they always give me more than that. (NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING!!!) the meat ALWAYS falls off the bone and the ckicken is always tender. The BBQ sauce is just incredible and has the perfect amount of heat. I usually switch up the sides and each and every one fo them are tasty tasty tasty. Next...the service. ALWAYS just as good as the food. From the greeter at the door..or the person taking your order, the person filling your order or the person on the other end of the phone, you can always count on quick, happy and most of all accurate service. (most kids of that age group could care less about their job..but Phil's does a great job of hiring the right kind of people. I could go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on about how good Phils is, but I wont. Only to add one more thing though...whenever a guest comes in from out of town I always make it a point to try to get them over to Phil's and they always say it's the best they've ever had.

I love Phil's!   In a calorie-free world, I'd order a large batch of onion rings with their buttermilk dressing and that's it... heavenly lightly battered rings of onion goodness!  I have yet to find onion rings that I enjoy more than Phil's.  Instead I opt to satisfy my onion ring cravings with about 2 onion rings and some form of their rockin' BBQ.  Baby Back ribs, chicken, or the Broham. Now, here's the SECRET:  phone ahead to place your order for pick up to avoid waiting in that inevitable, pesky line that streams out around the front (and often side) of their building.   Oh, and the double secret is to go through the side entrance of the bar so you don't have to say "excuse me" a million times to reach the phone line on the left.  I really hate the feel of angry eyes who wonder why you're trying to cut in line.  It's like you need a t-shirt that says, "Please move aside folks-I placed a phone order and I'm sorry that you didn't and you've been standing in line for an hour."  :)

I stopped by Phil's BBQ on my Memorial Day with a group of friends.  I was told by many friends, that this is the place for best BBQ you will ever find in So Cal.   They spoke about how the meat falls off right the bones as you sink your teeth into them.  I am not a big fan of BBQ, but I have to admit the pork/beef ribs were as good as they said they were. We got to order a bunch of different sides such as the baked potato, fries, onion rings, cole slaw, macaroni salad.   The macaroni salad was the favorite side   Overall, it was a great experience and the next time that I'm in the SD area, I am heading over Phil's BBQ again.

Wow.  4.5 stars from 900 reviewers?  I mean, it was alright, but that's a bit ridiculous. The ribs (baby back) were quite tasty and the bbq sauce had a good amount of bite to it, while still sweet. The sides left a lot to be desired.  At $4 for a small caesar, it was quite a letdown.  The baked beans were par to sub-par.  And how is this a bbq place that doesn't offer bread of SOME sort? I'm really glad I didn't spring for any more sides... stick with the meat. And at $20 for all of that plus a drink, I can't possibly give this place more than 3 stars.  At $10-$12, it *might* deserve 3.5 or 4.

Beefy or Baby-back.  That is the question. While waiting in line I asked two of the employees what they suggested.  One guy told me that baby-back ribs were like a touch of heaven, while another told me that beefy was the way to go.  I ended up going with baby-back and I did not regret it.  I ordered the full rib (baby-back) dinner with sides of macaroni salad and fries.  My mouth pretty much dropped when my dinner arrived and I dived right in.  The meat fell off the ribs with just a slight gnaw at the bone, and each rib was slathered with mouth-watering BBQ sauce.  The fries were quite crispy, above average at least, and the macaroni salad was pretty standard fare.  Well worth the price of $18.95 before tax and tip.  From trying my friend's beefy ribs, you cannot go wrong whichever type of rib you choose. The staff was extremely friendly and looked like they were having a great time while working.  While seated at our table, service was fine and I have no complaints.  The whole atmosphere was very festive; we sat in the enclosed outside area past the bar and the heat lamps were a nice touch.  I only wished I lived in San Diego

ok so i decided to take a little vacay out to SD and a lot of my friends have told me about this BBQ joint. So after all this hype Ive been reading about on Yelp and hearing from friends, it was a must go to spot before coming back to LA. As i pulled up the parking lot i was wowed to see the long the line and how full the lot was. i got out and did my thing and stood in line. As i was standing in line i couldn't help but think, " damn this place has to be good" " and look the line only gets longer, i cant wait". as i approached the front corner of the building i saw a sign on the corner it states " approx 21 minutes from sitting"  at this point i was like "damn this place better be good and worth my time". As i stood in line and i finally entered the building i saw all the stickers on the window for "nominated restaurant  for the years 2004-2010" and i was like damn this is starting to build a lot more hype. The hostess was being funny and entertained the hungry mob for a few minutes. The hostess asked if i ever been to Phils i said no and she explains the whole spiel. so i get to the cashier and they asked what did i want to order so i ordered the baby back ribs and the chicken, with the 2 small order of the baked beans and potato salad. i knew that i would be sharing my meal with another person so i ordered a small side of the onion rings. the cost of the meal wasn't bad considering it was filling for 2 people. Any who, we are here on yelp to rate the facility for the tasting of the food and not the cost . so here it goes. i personally think the BBQ was not as good as what i have had before. the baby back ribs taste like its been steamed cooked or boiled before it was dipped in sauce then bbq-ed, meaning it was double cooked. the chicken was the toughest and driest chicken i have ever eaten. having done bbq's at my own house and for an amusement park, i personally believe that i have cooked better bbq. for a toe to toe comparison of bbq, the bbq at Lucille's bbq is 10 times better. your every day bbq sauce bull's eye or kc masterpiece tastes way better. through and through of my experience, i believe this place is way over rated and not worth the wait line. plus its like a chow line type of deal. anyone that rates this place as being a 3 to 5 stars needs to go over their reviews again and try a different bbq joint because honestly i don't think they have tried any other bbq joints.

I have been to Phil's twice now, because of friends who say "OMG OMG OMG PHIL'S IS AMAZING YOU HAVE TO GO". Let's just say, I expected a lot out of Phil's. Unlike others, the times I went didn't have too much of a line. But I was disappointed to find my food completely drenched in sauce. I could not TASTE the meat... all I got was sauce, and unfortunately, the sauce was way too sweet for my tastes. My boyfriend felt the same. Imagine the looks on our friend's faces when we told them we didn't care for Phil's. Everyone freaked out. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing or came on an off day? I prefer Bulls BBQ to Phils, and really don't get what all of the fuss is about. WITH THAT SAID, now knowing that you can get "sauce on the side", I might give that a try and see if that does the trick. If I do, I will update for sure.

Are you kidding me???  This has to be one of the best rib places I've ever been too.  I went there because I saw an episode of Man vs. Food when they came to San Diego, I read several reviews on Yelp, and I had one of my friends confirm how good this place was.  My wife and I split the El Toro, which is a tri-tip sandwich, a full rack of baby back ribs, and an order of their onion rings.  The meat was very tender and juicy...it just fell off the bone!  The best part is the mesquite flavor that's cooked into the meat, it's kind of spicy, smoky, and definitely has a kick to it.  The onion rings were huge, and the onions were pretty thick and juicy.  The batter was pretty light, but they were onion rings...they're supposed to be pretty oily right?  We also got a few sides like corn and coleslaw which were pretty good too. Try not to be too afraid of the amusement park ride-like lines that you see from the outside.  Although there were probably around 60-80 people in line, it only took around 30 minutes to get seated.  I didn't expect this, but the line leads to a cash register where you put down your order.  Then they get your food to you within about 10 minutes or so if not faster.  Everything is a lot quicker than you'd think. If you're visiting San Diego, do not miss this place!!

I originally was going to give the place just four stars but upon other consideration, I guess I will have to be one of the 1000 reviewers to give the place 5 stars. I know that most people will talk about the baby back ribs but I am actually a big fan of Beef Ribs since I am not much of a pork eater.  Yep, I know they can be very messy to eat but I don't care. 5 stars and more should be given based on their  ribs and sauce alone.  However, there are other factors that you really have to consider.  So, here are the factors that you have to consider before going to Phils. PATIENCE IS VIRTUE - Just like Brandy C., my family and I were one of the ones that braved the cold slightly foggy long a$$ line at Phil's last night.  The wait was long but not boring since all of the people kept reassuring us that the ribs were worth waiting for so we decided to stick around.  However, in the back of my head, I kept on thinking these RIBS better be the sh!T$$. One suggestion, they shuld have someone serving coffee or tea outside specially on a cold night like last night. SHARING IS CARING - We knew that doing full orders for everyone would be crazy so we decided to share.  A full order of anything will probably feed a whole village somewhere else so share your food with the peeps you're with.  I shared my meal (A full order of the Beefy Ribs with two sides) with an extra corn on the cob. THE MEAT, THE MEAT,THE MEAT - Like I said, I loves me some beef ribs. Let me tell you, the reward of even just using a fork to just separate the meat from the bone of those ribs got me all excited already.  If you've had beef ribs before, it's usually not like baby back ribs where it just comes off the bone most of the time.  However, Phil's BBQ hit the jackpot on how they cook the meat.  As soon as I picked one up, the meat started falling off the bone already. THE SAUCE -  As soon as you bite into the meat, you can taste the meaty flavor, but the sauce totally compliments the meat.  It's a little sweet, a hint of vineger, lots of smoky flavor and definitely not overpowering. SERVICE - Phi's staff are awesome.  Knowing that the line is long, they have someone come up to you and give you the menu an hour in advance.  NOT sure if this is a good thing because it only got me hungrier.  They also have a sign that was slightly inaccurate when you reach a certain point letting you know that you are close to getting seated. SIDES - They have all kinds of sides but I opted for the potato salad and steamed vegetables with an extra corn on the cob.  One thing I have to suggest is they are missing some bisquits or bread to go with the meat.  I also am looking for some GARLIC ROASTED MASHED POTATOES.  Another suggestion that I think should go really well with the sides you already have. THE RINGS - We decided to just get one COLOSSAL order of the onion ring.  EAT IT RIGHT AWAY because it was really good when it was fresh but it tasted a little doughy towards the end. Oh, another suggestion just popped!  NO DESSERTS.  This place could use some but I do understand that most people might not have room for it.  THAT IS WHY YOU GIVE THEM DOGGY BAGS.   Oh, one last thing, we did not realize that there are full size adult bibs available by the sink right by the soda fountain right next to the washing area so I will give Phil's one last suggestion (yeap, I know its kind of a run-on but that's how long it too for us to realize that the bigs were available.)  Put the bibs right up front so that the rest of us messy eaters can put the bib on before the meat from the bone falls right into my shirt! Alright, I've said more than my fair share of comment so I will just let you review th rest of the more than 1000 reviews about this place.

Finally got my chance to check out the incredibly popular Phil's BBQ.  Strategically planned on coming early and on a weekday to avoid the equally famous "epic-long line."  Plan worked; only took 10 mins in line and we were eating within minutes.  I liked that we didn't have a waiter; you order/pay at the front, the cashier hands you a pager, then you find a table.   The food: pretty damn awesome. So why only 4 stars? (I'd give it 4.5 if I could. ahem...yelp?!) I found that while the meat itself was cooked to perfection, the sauce overwhelmed the flavor of the meat, imho.  It is indeed tangy and sweet -- perhaps a little too sweet.  I was definitely in a food coma afterwards.  While I started with a soda with my meal, I was screaming for some water halfway through (-0.5 star for that).  But I know, to each their own... so if you dig a lot of sweet/tangy sauce on your baby backs and beefers, this place is for you.  Dress appropriately! Also, you get A LOT of food for your money.  The ribs are very meaty and the sides are abundant up the yin yang!  Fries are reminicient of In-n-Out's and their potato salad was pretty good.  I spied some other dishes and the portions were equally as huge.  The BBQ sammich looked great, but looked to be swimming in sauce, so I'm a lil' cautious now about getting it.  The onion rings looked like they were made from huge mutant onions!  I will definitely have to try those on my next outing. The place: works for what it is.  Tables in the main dining area will seat 4 and they have larger tables reserved for 6 or more people.  Loved the paper towel rolls on the table; you'll definitely be using A LOT of napkins. (Not eco-friendly, but hey, you're eating bbq!  You're in the wrong place if you're thinking about the environment.)  Acoustically, it does get loud in there.  And there's something about bbq & blues/southern rock that really makes babies and kids scream extra loud! oof. Service was good. The girl before the cashier was helpful and sweet, however our cashier wasn't the friendliest of people (and here's the other -0.5 star).  But everyone else was great and made us feel welcome. Overall, I'll be back to try some of the other goodies on the menu.  Phil's definitely lives up to its reputation and should not be missed by anyone. (Actually, go ahead and miss it...that way the line won't be as long!! Just kidding! Wuv u, Phil's!)

Pretty disappointing. I expected that with long lines and people writing such good reviews about this place, that it would be really wonderful. I suppose, that in San Diego, since there is hardly any competition, that this bbq place would be the only one to go to. It's like if you go to a northern state, Taco Bell will be Mexican food. But if you've experienced real bbq from cattle country, this really falls short. SERVICE: Pretty quick; once you get to the front of the line and order, you get a beeper and are paged to go pick up your food. ATMOSPHERE: Packed, loud, can hardly hear anything from the person across the table from you. FOOD: Mediocre. Too much bbq sauce that is rather plain. Nothing special. The pork shoulder was dry. The french fries were hard. The sweet beans and macaroni salad were solid though, and so were the onion rings. OVERALL: Not worth going back. No bbq is better than bad bbq.

When it comes to BBQ Phil's knows what it's about. Now let me explain the four instead of five stars: For a place with a massive line, I wish the food would be piping hot when I received it. Also, I am more of a savory BBQ person, Phil's sauce is more tangy (felt like there was some cinnamon in there). I got the pulled pork sandwich that was delicious just not hot enough. The ribs my friends got instead was more food for your money. If you like tangy, sweet, BBQ Phil's will be your heaven, just make sure to head over when you're not even hungry otherwise by the time you order you will be famished.

I'm going to say it, I don't like ribs. Actually, if you really knew me, you'd know I like ribs, I just don't like to eat anything that has a bone in it when served. (I know your mind is going there, so just come back to me when you've let the thought finish...) Done? Okay. Dragged here against my will, my jaw dropped when I saw the line to get in to this place. I also don't like lines either. It's a good thing I went with some pros who showed me the secret way of getting a table and eating in less than an hour. Sorry, I've been sworn to secrecy not to tell. The four of us troublemakers ordered up a pitcher of beer. Finished it before the food came. So HAD to order another pitcher. I got the Chick Tickler, why? Because I thought the name was cute, and again, I don't eat things off bones. Plus, who can say no to ONION RINGS?! I'm on a new journey on looking for the best onion rings, suggestions welcome. Back to the food, right. Chick Tickler? Everything I wanted it to be. Not on a bone, onion ring heaven, and "cold slaw" in honor of my friend Evelyn who didn't know until last weekend that it's "cole slaw". Then to top it off, our neighbors offered us the rest of their pitcher of beer! (We all think it's because the guy was on a date with a girl out of his league - why would he bring a girl to Phil's on what looked like a first date? Plus, he was shorter than her. It was never going to happen). Which brings me to the boys in there... Um... Really good odds. Yeah, it's dude central.

My favorite west coast BBQ joint.  Its the kind of bbq you imagine eating on a red checkered tablecloth in one of the southern states.  The ribs and chicken are really tender, the bbq sauce is tangy, sweet, and spicy all at the same time.  The onion rings are also very good here.   The only disappointment were the sides which were just ok.  Got the baked beans and coleslaw.

This is definitely the best BBQ I've ever had!! And that's not just in San Diego! I got the quarter rack baby back rib dinner and it was DELICIOUS! It was SO good that I ordered a half rack and the beef rib sampler to go for the next day, but ended up pretty much eating the rest right when I got home with my sister! Both beef and pork were awesomely delicioso, but the beef ribs had so much more meaty deliciousness...made my carnivorous side soooo happy. The sides varied in deliciousness...I would say that the corn on the cob was the best, especially with the seasoning at the table sprinkled on it! Oh! And did I mention it's delicious?! Although the food is THE BOMB (Yes, I said it!), it's not the best thing about Phil's. The BEST thing about this place are the PEOPLE that work there! Everyone is extremely fun and friendly! Which makes the experience there THAT much better! Made me go the extra mile to write my first review on Yelp. You will NOT be disappointed!

Phil's BBQ, while good, is not five-star amazing.  I really think it depends on how you like your BBQ sauce.  Phil's sauce is tangy and since I like my sauces sweeter, I don't think it exceeded the hype.  However, everytime I've gone the employees have been more than friendly, even on days where it's a 45 minute wait in line before you can get your food and the restaurant is packed.  They are very accomodating and helpful, never fake. The pork ribs are very tender and fall off the bone.  I also love the macaroni salad, as it is a bit sweet and there is a nice texture to it (some crunch!), and the onion rings, which are always perfectly fried.  However, the potato salad is sub-par and the fries are sometimes soggy.

Yes the almighty 5 stars! IF you get 1400 reviews with 4 and 1/2 stars then your doing something MORE than right. This is a must visit in San Diego. I can't believe I've never been here before. The food here is the best. They have mastered the technique on making ribs. The wait is like a rollercoaster ride that just came out. But once you get on the ride it's like mind blowing. The experience was well worth it. I ordered the baby back ribs, macaroni salad, potato salad, fries, and colossal onion rings. The onion rings were huge and were some of the best I have ever eaten. The potato salad was just whatever I could a skipped on that. The fries were good after I added the seasoning onto it. They also brought it out with homemade ranch that they make every morning. Delicious! The macaroni salad was so good and I wish we had it like that back home. The highlight of course was the ribs. They just fall off the bone! The flavor that comes from the meat is unmatched. Phils where have you been all my life!? This is top notch bbq at it's finest. The wait might scare you but you will leave happy. This set the bar on what my ribs should taste like. Recommendation: baby back ribs, macaroni salad, and colossal onion rings.

I'm not really a fan of BBQ in general (especially when it comes to waiting 1-2 hours for it), so I was hesitant to try this place, even though everyone seems to love it. Split a small order of onion rings and an order of beefy ribs only with my sister, thinking that was a reasonable amount of food. I was wrong. There was so much deliciously marinated, tender meat on each bone that we were already really full after getting through 2 bones each. I like my onion rings a little more fried/cooked on the inside, hence the 4 stars. Our server was extremely friendly :) They also provide disposable bibs, wet wipes, and a hand-washing station to clean up after all that yummy bbq. If I ever come back again, I'd like to try the baby back ribs.

When my boyfriend suggested we have lunch at Phil's, I had no idea what I was in for.  I moved to San Diego from Seattle about three months ago and until that day, I hadn't heard of Phil's.  But I'm happy to report that I'm glad to have discovered it! We arrived a little before noon on a Saturday and beat the lunch rush by about 15 minutes.  On our drive to the restaurant, my boyfriend said that we might have to postpone our meal at Phil's if the line was too long. I didn't understand how that could be an issue at a restaurant but by the time we left an hour later, the line was out the door and heading down the side of the building!  But the people all seemed content to wait, which must be a sign that it's amazing. I ordered the white meat half bbq chicken platter with fries while my boyfriend got the beef ribs with onion rings.  I couldn't believe the size of the portion!  Huge plate filled with two chicken breasts and wings and more fries than I could eat in a week!  I managed to work my way through one of the breast pieces and boxed up the rest to go. I'll add this to my list of places to take my Seattle friends when they come to visit in San Diego!

I haven't found any good southern BBQ places in CA. I finally found one here. There was a line wrapping around the building, but it was definitely worth it. There's a reason why Adam Richmond visited here on Man vs. Food. Food: 1) Baby back ribs - the meat just falls off the bone. The bbq sauce really helps out with the taste. 2) Sides - Macaroni salad, fries, and bbq baked beans are really good. They go well with the ribs. 3) BBQ Chicken - the chicken is soft and tender. Nothing special, just chicken and bbq sauce. 4) Tri-Tip - Very soft and breaks apart easily. DELICIOUS Be prepared to get dirty. I always use a lot of towels

Phil's BBQ is one of those places every San Diegan should experience. I'm sure this has been said many times, but don't let the long line intimidate you! The amazing, mouthwatering food that's waiting for you inside is worth all that queuing up. All three of us who went are small eaters - so we got two "Best of Both Worlds" combos - the beefy rib/chicken bbq plate and the baby back ribs/chickless (aka chicken breast bbq) plate. Coupled those with some of the best-tasting macaroni and potato salad I've ever had - we're not talking Costco/Sysco here! Plus a large side of mixed veggies. Mmmm! That's the shizzle right thurr. And the portions are just right - we even brought some of the food home. You order at the counter, so there are no servers to deal with. But there was this busser, a charismatic feller named Marco, who just seemed to be the most genuinely caring, sweetest busser in the entire world. He often stopped by our table to check up on the food, or if we needed anything else. He even brought us water. Now that's awesome customer service, folks. And I just have to mention the music. I'm not sure what genre it is, but all I know is it's ~southern~ music - bluesy rock 'n roll, southernized mainstream rock covers, big band, whatever you call it - the music kept me bobbing in my seat throughout our meal. It's not the stuff that typically floats my boat, but there's something about this kind of music and mackin' on bbq that goes together so well. It's osm. It amazes me how a place that's so hyped up can actually live up to it.

first time we went to there. BBQ is Sooooo Goood. (baby back rib, cole slow, macaroni salad) why i place only 4 stars. because we waited 1 hour..... even sign said 14min. (outside corner) but when we went to inside, we could find few tables were available. i want them to up-date service. i didn't say i don't want to wait. need quickness. Again,their BBQ is good. if you have a chance, you should go. but you need some extra time, though.

Coming from a white boy growing up in Compton... I know barbeque! Phil's BBQ is hands down the single best bbq I have ever had. I think I even broke my Dad's heart when I told him that Phil does a better job than he does. FOOD: You cannot go wrong with the food here. Huge portions at a great price. The secret behind all the food is the awesome sauce they use. This sweet and tangy sauce could be spread on liver and onions and I would eat all that yucky stuff up. My favorite items: El Toro (tri-tip) sandwich, baby back ribs, onion rings, and macaroni salad. Great food, service, and prices - Phil's BBQ is a San Diego MUST!!!

I love this place! The beef ribs and pork ribs are both amazing. I love how they lather on the bbq sauce (it is not overbearing at all). The bbq chicken is great also since the chicken is so tender and melts right off the bone. The portions are generous and the sides are great also. I like the fries there and the onion rings are enormous in size. A good idea is to call in ahead of time and phone in your order since the lines at Phil's tend to be crazy. It can also be a competition to find a table (there is some outside seating and I would check out there if there are no tables inside.. they have heat sources so it isn't cold outside).

My coworkers love this place.  I think I love it too.  I got the BBQ chicken with macaroni salad, and we sat in the back by the bar.  The chicken was juicy, and the BBQ sauce is delicious!  What else do you want??  It's a good place to hang out after a morning of work, and the food is awesome!  The service was friendly, and the food came out quickly even though it seems they get pretty busy.  I see why people are always trying to leave early to go here! Edit:  I went back several times, and it has been better each time.  There is a sliced beef sandwhich (blanking on the name) that is delicious!  By far, my favorite thing at Phil's.  Now that I've found that, I added a fifth star.  ;-)

WOW. my sister brought me here when I went to visit her in SD, and that is all I can say. WOW. There was a line to get in, but it moves quickly. The ribs are so good, and they give you so much! I think my plate was bigger than my head. I really enjoy the messy, finger licking, lips smacking, eating with your hands ordeal, so naturally, I enjoyed this place quite a bit.

I started going to Phil's when they were that little hole in the wall in Mission Hills.  The thing I hated about that joint was that it was like the size of a shoebox. NOW! Now things are different.... Phil's has the room to accommodate the masses! Not that i'm for being a sheep among the masses.  Not at all.  But every American is entitled to good BBQ. Their ribs (both pork and beef) are devine.  Their sides? Amazing.  Their rings? HUGE and yum. Bottomless fountain drinks to wash down that amazing sauce.  They've got a bar too just in case you need some beer. Overall, if you see a long line outside of it, take the opportunity to exercise patience and stand in the line.  It goes pretty fast and you can multi-task at the same time.  What I do is peruse the menu and see exactly what, of all the delicious fare, I will choose.  It's seriously hard to pick my sides because all of them are great.  Slaw, fries, beans, rings, all delicious. Oh and don't forget the wet naps by the soda fountain.  You'll need them!

First of all, I am really not at all a BBQ fan.  I don't like eating meat off the bone and it's just so messy.  But somehow I ended up standing in line for over an hour Sunday night to try this place out... aannd I would totally do it again and again. There really isn't much to say that hasn't already been said.  Get the pulled pork sandwich.  And the onion rings.  And the ribs... duh.

3.5 stars One serious BBQ joint!  I've never seen anything like this!  I got here on a Sunday afternoon and the line was out the door and around the corner of the building.  Hubby and I scratched our heads while contemplating whether or not we should wait.  The person in line in front of us informed us it would be about 30 minutes.  I was seriously doubting him, but we stayed anyway.  There was at least 40 people in line ahead of us.  Sure enough, the wait was a little less than 30 minutes!  Incredible!   So, let me break it down for any 1st timers.  You wait in line.  You order & pay.  You are given a pager for when your food is ready.  You find a table.  You grab your drinks.  The pager goes off and you & your whole party go to grab your food!  Seriously, you'll need a few hands cause their servings are huge!  Eat, enjoy & relax while you catch a game on their many tv's!  Finally, pack up your leftovers & you have a whole other meal! So, here's the damage: $52 before tip included: -1 full baby back dinner w/a corn-on-the cob -1 full beef ribs dinner w/a baked potato -1 small side of sweet baked beans -1 small side of potato salad -1 small order of onion rings The baby back ribs were definitely better than the beef ribs and I generally prefer beef ribs.  Both were meaty and fell off the bone.   The bbq sauce was tangy and finger licking good!  The potato salad and beans were just ok!  The onion rings are a must order!

Thank you Marcus and family for introducing me to this place! I started going to this place at their old location; fell in love right away. I don't know of many places where you will wait in line for 30+ minutes to order and then wait even longer for your food...AND THE LINE KEEPS GOING! that just tells you how amazing this place is. they have sped up quite a bit at the sports arena location; bigger spot, more efficient logistics (couldn't think of a better word, lol!) I always order the Beef Rib dinner (3 ribs not the 6 or 7), two orders of fries, and usually share onion rings with someone. Its just ridiculous. I don't know what they do back there, but its magic. Also, considering how large the place is, the staff are SO friendly. They come by and check on you, and really invest in showing the customer that they care. Please try this place. You will fall in love. Thanks PHIL! Marwan doesn't lie.

Let me start this review with a disclaimer:  No, I have not been to Pappy's, and I'm not a regular customer of Oklahoma Joe's in Kansas City, and yes...I did just google "best bbq".  I have, however, been to Lucille's, and have had the McRib, and that qualifies me as a Barbecue Expert. With this bit of information in mind, I decided to take my expertise down south.  My significant other and I went to visit some family members for a day, and they took us to the cool spots in the area.  After a day romp at the San Diego Zoo, they decided to take us to the #1 choice spot to get some BBQ in the area.  It seems that this #1 choice spot is also the #1 choice spot for all of Southern California.  I guess my BBQ knowledge is not as great as I thought. First thing you will notice when visiting this local dining destination is the line.  The line the line the line.  Did I say it enough times for you?  As you pull up, it's very possible that you will feel a shade of discouragement which can prompt you to pack up your ideas and take them on down to the next eatery on the street.  Fight this overwhelming desire to move along, and suck it up! Step into the line, and you'll soon find that time actually passes a lot faster than one would think.  What's nice is you will be able to wave at the camera, which broadcasts over the internet.  After braving the line, you will be rewarded with some of the BEST BBQ you can find in California.  It's obvious they take pride in their work, as they obviously stick to the fundamentals of slow and low (that is the tempo).  The slow and low approach guarantees that the BBQ will fall off the bone, and (essentially) melt in your mouth.  The sauce, on the other hand has a character all on its own.  It's the combination of sweet, and spicy, with enough bite to have your senses craving the combination long after visiting Phil's.  Here are some of the items you will find here: Baby back ribs - These are a crowd pleaser. Order these, and you're guaranteed to be back for more.  As stated before, the meat is very tender, and will fall off of the bone, and the sauce, and BBQ process lends an excellent flavor to the mild flavor of the meat. Chicken - It really wasn't my favorite, and I could do without it.  It was kind of dry.  I would've been happier just skipping this order and going to Costco and picking up some rotisserie chicken.  It's much more tender. Beef ribs - Not everyone's favorite, but I loved them.  The beef has a stronger flavor than the pork, so it stands out more, but it was incredible how tender the meat was.  The sauce wasn't as overpowering on the beef ribs, as it was on the baby back ribs.  It was more complimentary. Onion rings - There's a reason why they're known for their onion rings.  They're really good. Fries - whatever.  They weren't as crispy as I like. Macaroni salad - flippin' excellent.  I don't know what it is about this stuff, but I'd buy a jug of this, and have it for lunch every day, if I could. Cole slaw - okay.  don't have much to say about it, so that speaks for itself...and yes, I usually love cole slaw. One more thing about this restaurant: They provide their customers with hand wipes, and  a hand washing trough, so be sure to eat as messily as possible when you're here....you're covered.

Not a BBQ fan, but I am a Phil's BBQ fan.  The BBQ sauce is to die for.  On anything in there, it tastes good.  The chicken rib lets, the ribs, the burger, the veggie burger, the pulled pork- anything and everything here is amazing with that sauce.   Good thing about Phil is that he didn't try to make it a smorgasbord of stuff, he wanted to offer BBQ foods and he did it and mastered it.  Pretty basic menu of BBQ foods and some accompanying sides like corn on the cob, baked potatoes, french fries, onion rings and so forth all of which are great tasting. Be prepared though, for at least an hour wait each time you go there.  Anytime of day, there is a wait.  I never have not had to wait here.  But I also have never regretted waiting here.

Even though I do not like the new location, the food more than makes up for it. I miss the Mission Hills Location because it had 20 times more character and it was closer. I wish that they could have both open. I always order the rib tickler. It is the perfect amount of meat, onion rings, slaw and fries. They have a creamy thin ranch dip that you should ask for at the counter when you pick up your plate. It is delicious on the onion rings and fries. The onion rings are thick with a serious crunch (mmmm...deep fried batter).And if you are addicted to the sauce like me, ask for some extra sauce to drench your meat and dip your fries in.   I should say that although I am not a fan of the new space, the employees are plentiful and helpful. There are tons more parking spaces and tables to accommodate everyone enjoying their meat (that's what she said). **** for the vegetarians, they have a bbq veggie burger that i've heard is to die for.

I went here for the first time today. I know, I know: how could I have called myself a native San Diegan for all these years without ever having been to the famous Phil's BBQ? Well, don't worry, I have now seen the light. Seriously though, if you haven't been here before and you like BBQ you really have to check it out. +1 star for very, very friendly staff +1 star for ample portions and great prices +1 star for tender ribs (the meat almost falls of the bone) and zesty BBQ sauce   +1 star for a great section of tasty sides, I especially liked the potato salad +1 star for papers towels at your table and big sinks to wash your hands Only downsides: crowded (for a darn good reason) and not really vegetarian friendly (duh).

Update August 4, 2008 Crap and a half.  This place has grown on me.  And I actually like the sauce!  Just not too much of it, but I think that has more to do with me liking dry rubs versus ribs dripping in sauce (again, I am a picky bastard).  Since I come here so often with my husband the staff recognizes us, so that in turn makes the service great, because who doesn't love it when you come into a restaurant and the staff remembers you?  I always order the same stuff: Beef Ribs, beans, potato salad, and onion rings.   But damn it to hell, every time now when I ask my husband if we can go eat at Phil's he gets this "I told you so" look on his face. ERGH! --------------------------------------------------­--------------------------------------------------­------------------------   My fiance loves this place, but I'm not that into it.  I think it depends on your taste and what kind of sauce you're into.  Phil's sauce is tangy, and I don't like tangy sauce.  I always order my ribs dry, with the sauce on the side.  One thing I love are the onion rings, they have the best onion rings.   And the wait here is ridiculous sometimes, but it's nice how this place is bigger than the previous one.  I don't mind eating here, it's just not my favorite (my fiance is going to kill me for saying this about Phil's).

If you're in San Diego and haven't been to Phil's you are missing out! I had been to the Mission Hills location, but this past weekend when we were in SD, our friends took us to the new Pt Loma location. Umm...yah. Phil's obviously has made bank by the looks of the new digs. The food is so good, I'm wondering why I don't visit SD more often. ;o) Tip: get there early. I mean senior-early-bird early or you will be waiting in line. Kid tip: Great place for kids, but my toddler found the BBQ sauce a bit spicy for her palate, but she enjoyed being able to help finish off a few ribs and fries.

There's something in the sauce, I'm guessing it's crack. The meat falls off the bone, they've got a bar with a good amount of taps, the food comes out pretty quick and the prices are totally reasonable. Overall - Awesome. Everything on the menu is good, so choose whatever and you'll be happy. No matter what, order the onion rings.

The line was soooo long to get into Phil's, but thankfully, it moved pretty fast. We were not disappointed by the food! It was great! Baby back ribs tickler Barbecue broham Barbecue chicken and beef ribs combo For the baby back ribs, the meat was just falling off the bones and was so tender. I loved the sauce, which had just the right amount of spiciness to it. And, the coleslaw was really good. I would definitely come back here the next time I'm in San Diego!!!

Most people might think i'm crazy for giving Phils only four stars. However, i do have my argument here. Phil BBQ is a great place to try and almost a must try if you don't live in san diego. their tenderness of the beef and the meat falling right off the bone as you bite it is something very difficult to do. There's usually long lines but they move very quickly. Their side dishes are very traditionally american food and they also prepare it well. Alternatives such as chicken and beef ribs are also fantastic choices if you prefer somethign aside from pork however, i cannot come here more than once a month. The heaviness of the sauce doesn't make me crave phils for a long while and i think that may be the biggest upset of a great restaurant. I understand that the BBQ sauce from Phils is what makes Phils, but for someone that loves food as much as i do, i cannot give 5 star rating to a place that i don't crave enough. but i mean, if you're totally craving for ribs, this place is totally bomb ;)

The food here is soooo good.  The ribs fall off the bones, the beer battered onion rings are delicious and the portions are huge.  My favorite (right now) is the El Toro sandwich because it's a great deal at $6 and some change and it comes with enough meat for two sandwiches. I can't give Phil's a 5th star though.  The first time I visited the one on Sports Arena, some friends and I were finishing our meal while chatting and they basically kicked us out because there were other people waiting for a table.  I completely understand... had we been done eating!  We went there for a nice, relaxing, casual meal -- and we were pushed out the door!  And on another visit today, the cooks didn't get our order in the kitchen and we had to wait close to an hour for our meal. This place is busy (because the food is so good), but the service needs a second-looking.

This is a place that's so good, you get random but constant cravings for it whenever. I grew up here in San Diego, and when my old high school friends come back to town, they always want to go to a) a Lolitas-esque Mexican restaurant or b) Phil's BBQ. I always get the half rack of baby back ribs with the large order of fries, though I have tried their chicken (which is pretty damn amazing, but not as fun to eat ;) ). They have the tastiest BBQ sauce I've ever had, and while it does get messy, it doesn't get as messy as ribs can usually get because the meat just falls right off the bone. No annoying gnawing is needed to get those last bits of meat off the ribs. The fries are way bomb as well and are especially tasty with the BBQ sauce. I devour that whole meal like there was no tomorrow. The line is always long, but it goes by quickly. The only real challenge is finding a place to sit, especially if you're going during lunch or dinner hours, but I've never had to wait more than 5 or so minutes to find a seat. The staff is pretty friendly.They're quick about getting your empty plates from you, and they check on you to see if you're doing all right - even if there is no waiting service.

Review #550!  Yowza! SO...I told my friend I was going to check out Phil's BBQ and he said I HAD to get the chicken.  Chicken?!  I'm going to a BBQ place and he tells me about chicken?  To me, chicken is just that...chicken.  Now, I am a RIBS girl all the way so I stuck up my nose, thanked him for the advice and ordered TWO plates of ribs...on the bone and boneless.  My mom ended up ordering the chicken, and that is how my life was changed...ha! Now, the boneless ribs were a bit dry so I don't think I'll get them again, but ribs were good!  The bbq sauce is on the tangy side and I like mine a little sweeter, but the meat fell off the bone and it was delicious. After about 2 ribs, I reached over and took a piece of my mom's chicken.  I had to at least try it so that I could tell my friend they were "okay"... so I took a bite and went back to my plate, but then I stopped.  I chewed the chicken and it was super moist and tender!  I snuck another piece and holy bbq it was mouthwateringly delicious!  I was shocked!  The chicken was BETTER than the ribs?!  How is this possible?  I looked at my mom and gave her the "daughter" look and asked if we could switch plates, and being the sweetheart that she is, she did!  I finished off the chicken and licked the bones clean!  Never in my life have I passed up a plate of ribs for a measly plate of poultry, but there's a first time for everything I suppose.  (Sorry I doubted you friend!)  Oh!  The onion rings are great, too.       This isn't a full service place, so be ready to do a little exercise (which isn't a bad thing considering you'll be shoveling mounds of mouthwatering bbq into your face).  You order at the counter, find a table and when your buzzer rings, pick up your order.  There's a bar in the next room so you can walk over there and grab a beer while you wait for your food.  The service is great!  There's a friendly hostess at the front of the line to chit-chat with, and she'll guide you through the process.  The cashier's don't seem as nice, but that's because they need to speed you through in order to get to everyone in line.  While you eat there are some servers who'll check on you and get you water and condiments.

Dare I say....overrated???? We went here because friends raved about it.  Hmm... Lucilles is WAY BETTER!! We ordered their ribs/chicken dinner with 2 sides.  I'll admit, the ribs and chicken were tender and good.  I thought the bbq sauce was a little bit too sweet/tangy.  Powerful.  Fries were good and so were the baked beans. The pulled pork sandwich was horrible. =(  The bread was too hard and the pork was TOUGH!  I almost choked on it.  The coleslaw was decent.  I do admit that they don't skimp on the pork. The pork was piled on!  But it was so big and messy that there was no way you could eat it as a "burger".   I'm glad we tried it but I don't think it was great enough for us to go back.  Sorry SD, you need a Lucilles!!

Very hyped up joint. As someone visiting up from LA, I was very excited to get my chops on this. We came here around 1pm on a Saturday. As such, I was expecting a crowd or something. To my surprise, there wasn't a soul in line. So we literally parked, walked all the way in, and had a register available for all four of us. I got a plate of ribs and boneless chicken, w/ sides of cole slaw and fries. Which were pretty generous portions (along w/ the meat) for the $13 or so I paid. The ribs, as everyone else has stated a million times over, were freaking amazinggggg. I wasn't wowed by the chicken. And the cole slaw and fries were great sides. The only problem I could see with this place is, that when it gets back, I assume it'd be hard to find seats, seeing as you seat yourself to whatever booth/table's open. And like I said, there was no line, but as we were sitting and enjoying our moment of gluttony, the line started to form and rear its ugly face. Thankfully, we were already inside, bahahhaha.

Well well. What can I say? The famous Phil's BBQ holds true to its title. I came here expecting to have some good BBQ, but little did I know that I'd be running away with the best in the business. The only tincy wincy little problem I have is that I could use more sauce on my food, but the quality of everything here is amazing. The ribs are INTENSE. If you want to be full for three days straight, I'd recommend the "beefy ribs." Otherwise, for the same great flavor, the baby back ribs will suffice. I, personally, am a chicken-fan, so I roll with the chick tickler almost every time. It comes with fries, onion rings, coleslaw (ughhh...), and of course the boneless chicken pieces. Again, more sauce = happier pawl but it's still super bomb. I'd say swoop on a nice whoopie pie for dessert to top off your stomach but most times its hard to finish. TL;DR: Super good but super filling, so get the "ticklers." - pawl e.

San Diego is known for it Fish Taco's, not it's BBQ. However, Phil's is off the hook. I use to frequent this place when I lived in Sun Diego, every chance that I got, I was at Phil's. The ribs were nice and meaty and the portions are worth the sauce on the front of your shirt. I ate there so much, that I \would eat myself sick. YEAH...I lost my dinner in the parking lot once because I ate so much. And that was worth it as well... Five Trans-Fats out of Five.

I love barbeque.  And when I finally went to Phil's to see what the hype was about, I'm sad to say it didn't live up to it.   Parking isn't the best, especially because it gets super crowded.  The line has almost always been out the door of the few times I've been there, so it really didn't help the experience.  The food was average and the ribs weren't as tender as I'd personally like them to be.   I wouldn't go out of my way to go there and I especially wouldn't wait in line to eat there because there are so many other good places to eat in Point Loma.

I went to Phils for the last night of Restaurant Week (last night).  Our family of three went and enjoyed sitting in the bar area.  Having Stone IPA on tap was a real plus for me. Two of us ordered the pulled pork/chicken.  I got the slaw and fries.  My partner got the slaw and Caesar salad.  My nephew got the ribs, slaw and fries.  All three of us had whoppie pies for dessert. The pulled chicken was good, the pulled pork was not.  Nuggets of strange meat for sure.  My nephew loved the ribs.  The bbq sauce was noting to write home about.  Sweet baby Rays, the sauce I measure all others against, held fast to its reigning champs position. The slaw was creamy but not too wet.  The fries were very good.  The Caesar salad was week and used iceberg lettuce, very strange. The whoppie pies were a big miss.  The cake/cookies were stale and hard--not like what Mom would have made. The real hardship came when we headed to bed.  Phils used so much MSG (partner and I both allergic) that I was crazy awake all night long.  It was one of the worst reactions to MSG in a really long time. While the food was okay going down, it was terrible throughout the night.  I won't go back any time soon.

Never come here on the weekends. or even anytime at night. YOU WILL be waiting for an hour or more. This place has a line that's probably a yard long. I went to San Diego for vacation and my lovely lovely cousin surprised my hungry hungry stomach with a line that took us an hour and a half to finish. Mind you, this was a Saturday night. We ordered the baby bbq ribs meal, the pulled pork sandwich, and onion rings. OH LA LA ~ lemme tell. it was like the MOST AMAZING THING i ever placed in my mouth. given that i was on the verge of doubling over in hunger...the overwhelming flavorful BBQ sauce just knocked me over. sweet, tangy. smoky BBQ flavor. yes i steal adjectives. plus, i do not eat onion rings. now Phil's onion rings are the size of a bracelet. they were crunchy and perfect. mmmmmmmm...... i crave for them now~~ X__X anyways, my overall impression was that the BBQ sauce tasted the same as any other BBQ sauce drenched ribs i've tasted elsewhere. the meat fell off the bone in the most tenderous way~~~  i wish it had a little bit of a crunch on the outside while also falling off the bone. i would go here again if the line did not go so far out into the street, but i could basically get the same great flavor at other BBQ places. just not as cheap as Phil's. There price range is decent. this is a must go to place at least once in your life if you're ever in the city.

I dare you to try and tackle the full beef rack without getting messy! No visit to SD is ever complete until you go to Phil's BBQ. If you are a rib lover, this is the place to go! Seriously delicious fall-off-the-bone ribs. I prefer the Beef ribs, however, some people love the baby back pork ribs. This place is award winning for a reason, and you will not be disappointed with the portions for sure. Grab some Onion rings, salad, or other appetizers if you really want; but, I will tell you... it's not necessary - go straight for the beef ribs and you are good to go! This place is like a cafeteria where you place your order, and find your own seats. This place is great for large parties because you can order and pay seperately, so no headaches over splitting the bill! The place is worth the wait, and has a great service where you can purchase some alcoholic drinks while you wait. Anticipate anywhere between 20 - 1 hour wait. So plan ahead!

SERVICE: BEST. i love the workers there FOOD: It's cheap and pretty good. But it's too much for me. The flavors and what not are too strong. After a couple bites I can't eat much more.

Best BBQ in town, hands down.  There's always a line and they take the month of January off, but hey, you'll always come back for more.  The staff is friendly and fun and the food is exceptional.  Prices are decent, great for what you get. Tip: If you don't like waiting, order on the phone 'to go' and when you pick it up it'll be ready.  Find yourself a seat if you can and you're ready to rock and roll.  If the place is just too darn full, take it home or to a park!

I didn't really get this place. You pay an arm and a leg for the privilege of ordering at a counter and getting served on plastic plates. The ribs were good but not any better than a Joey's BBQ or numerous other places that don't have the reputation Phil's does. The ambience is good and it is a fun place (if you don't mind yelling to have a conversation.)

Being a vegetarian, Phil's isn't my first choice when selecting a place to eat out.  The menu is (obviously) heavy on the meat, with only sides and a veggie burger to pick from.  That and the line is always ridiculously long to order your food. I ordered the veggie burger, baked potato, steamed veggies and onion rings.   The onion rings were huge, and had a great crispy batter.  Definitely top five onion rings I've tried. I ordered the potato with cheese and dumped my veggies on top of that.  Delcious. The veggie burger was perfectly cooked, not too dry as most places tend to over-cook the patty and I end up with a hockey puck on a bun.   Phil's is definitely worth the long lines, even if you're not a fan of the meat.

I really don't see what all the hype is about. It's your typical bbq, potato salad, french fries, picnic food. I think the hype comes from Phil's being only one location, and of course it's going to be packed full of people. At this point, I'm pretty sure Chili's has the same if not better choices for bbq ribs, and you actually get a server. I wouldn't wait in any line longer than five minutes for this place.

I feel like this place is what doozer buildings are to the Fraggles.  It is addictive BBQ.  The line is long, the prices are reasonable and the food is amazing.  I usually order the ribs with the chicken.  It is so much food but not too much that I have to wear sweatpants to eat there.  I am overall not a huge BBQ fan but this place is heaven on a bone.  Just know you will have to wait, but it will be worth every minute unlike the circus circus buffet (or hometown buffet...or any buffet)

Phil's is my favorite BBQ joint in Socal!  I discovered it a couple years ago in San Diego and had it again a couple months ago in their new San Marcos location, which is a 60 mile drive instead of 85.  I drove there just to eat at Phil's, so yea it's pretty good! Normally I like St. Louis ribs better, but Phil's babyback ribs are excellent... that and they don't have St. Louis ribs.  Although I don't think they're actually smoked, they're extremely tender and rich in flavor.  The texture of the meat is good.  It falls off the bone, but only if you pull.  Some places have ribs that I actually think is too tender, where the meat can literally fall off from the force of gravity and is too soft.  They throw a ton of BBQ sauce on which can be a bit overwhelming, but you can ask to get it on the side.  My only complaint is that the sauce is a bit too vinegary for me, but most people really like it.  The beef ribs are not bad, the not as good as the pork. A full rack of ribs combo dinner is $18.95, which is really not bad for the amount of food you get.  I really like their fries also -- natural cut, crispy on the outside and soft inside.  Don't get a large order of fries.  The small order is HUGE and can easily feed 2 people.  I hope they open another location in OC!

Perhaps I'm a bit of a bbq snob being from Texas.  Bbq = brisket...the kind of brisket that has been smoking for two weeks.   Phils likes pork, and lots of it.  They have a few beef rib dinners as well as a beef sandwich but still there isn't a brisket plate! Come on Phils!  So, although I really like the chickless dinner and the beefy ribs (they do fall off the bone), I just can't give this place more than 3 stars.  I do love their macaroni salad.  It's delicious.  I also like that there is a bar area because how can you not have a beer when eating bbq.   Just a little note: You used to be able to call in your order and then eat there.  Supposedly, if the line is long (around the building long) you have to take your food to go because you've technically cut in line.  I almost got in trouble for it last night.

A 3.5-3.75, I went with the under because there was more "meh" than "wow." The big 2-0-0, woo hoo, I wanted to make this one special, so what did I decide to do?  Probably one of the most reviewed restaurants on yelp San Diego- Phil's  BBQ.  I've been hearing about this place since I came here, and I figured it was time to bite the bullet. The wife and I came out here on Father's Day, figuring more of the fancy places would be busier- WRONG.  As we drove up there was definitely a line winding around the building.  Well, they must be doing something right.  After waiting in line for about 10 minutes, we elected to just order take out- after all it was a beautiful San Diego afternoon, why not?  I was told take out would be about 35-40 minutes, oh well, we weren't going any where that day anyways (though in hindsight, it looks like we could've gotten a table if we had waited another 20 minutes or so). Menu is pretty basic, but they cover all their bases.  They have both pork ribs and beef ribs, along with chicken, pulled pork and your typical sides.  My wife and I love pulled pork so we decided to order to broham sandwiches and a half baby back rib dinner with fries and potato salad.  40 minutes later our order was ready and we drove over to Mission Beach to grub. The good- baby back ribs were on point no doubt!  Ribs fell off the bone, and were excellent.  The 1/2 dinner was pretty huge too.  At first we had pondered whether or not we should get a full rib dinner, we're glad we didn't because that would have been entirely too much food.  And speaking of too much food, their pulled pork sandwiches were HUGE.  I'm talking 1/2 lb-3/4 lb of pulled pork.  Absolutely ridiculous.  The fresh cut fries went very well with the ribs as well. The bad- Ok, I won't say bad, but the pulled pork wasn't anything mind blowing.  Yeah it was good, and had a nice smoked flavor, but it wasn't mindblowing.  Plus (and I know it's bbq), but the sandwiches were really messy.  Every time I took a bite, 1/8 of the sandwich would fall out.  Maybe I'm just being a bbq diva.  The potato salad could've been from Von's. Overall- Not in my top ten of places to try in San Diego, but If you've never been to one of the bbq capitals in the nation (Memphis, Texas, etc...) certainly worth checking out.  Be prepared to wait, especially in the summer on the weekends.

Please don't go here and compare this to any other bbq place you've ever been to. It's not like, southern, Texas or anything you've had "back east". But it does taste like what you'd have if you were grillin' some bone-in chicken or ribs out back with some bbq sauce without the cleanup. Phil's is delicious for what it is. Be prepared to stand in line and no holding tables.

After my more-than-forgettable experience at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach, I was in dire need of some good (or at least decent) barbecue.  And since Phil's had been on my list for years, I decided to take a day off work (don't rat me out now!) and headed over.   The wait wasn't as long as it could have been since it was a Thursday night.  Upon entering, you are directed to the counter to place your order.  Then you take your pager contraption and find yourself a table.  In my case, the pager buzzed the second I placed it on the table.  Impressive. Onto the food... First, the baby back ribs.  As overused as this term is, there's nothing else I can say to describe it: the meat just falls off the bone.  The sauce is sweet and it surprisingly had a little kick to it.  Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the second half of the rack as much as the first because I started finding the sauce to be too sweet.  Actually, I thought there was just too much sauce on the ribs to begin with; it took too much away from the flavor of the meat.  They don't make this mistake in Texas.  I even switched my drink from the orange soda to lemonade just to minimize the sweet flavors in my mouth.   The beef rib tasted like the baby backs initially because of the sauce, but once I got past the sauce, I realized the beef doesn't taste as good as the pork.  It just wasn't fun to eat. The cole slaw was probably one of the better slaws I've had but I was a bit disappointed with the macaroni salad.  It was pretty bland. Last but not least, the onion rings were quite the hit.  I had eyed someone's order of rings while waiting in line and I knew right off the bat that they would be good (which was why I ordered it).  I can tell by looking at onion rings whether I'll like it by the way it's battered.  It had the perfect amount of crispiness to it and it was the perfect side for the ribs. In most BBQ restaurants, a full rack of ribs will cost $24-26.  At Phil's, it's $18 (or was it $19).  Really not a bad deal.

My friend and I joked that next time we come here, we'll bring lawn chairs for the huge and ridiculous lineup.  I took a picture when we first got there and it was still bright and sunny.  By the time we went inside the sun had set well over an hour before. Was it worth it?  Yes.  So much meaty goodness.   But the sauce has to be WITH the meat.  By itself it's very tangy and almost has a vinegary overtone to it, but with the meat it's PERFECT.  Smoky and delicious. Thx to Jenny N. for the recommendation!  Next time I'm in San Diego I'll definitely be back...maybe for takeout the next time around so I don't have to drive my stomach crazy with all the yummy smells wafting through the 2 hours line up.

I was in SD this past weekend for a concert and had been hearing about Phil's for quite some time so decided to pop by. We timed it so we'd get there on the early side (4pmish) and had to wait about 55 minutes before we got to order. I have to admit -- this place runs like a well oiled machine! We were a little worried we wouldn't have a place to sit but they really monitor how they let you order. They also have this place really well staffed so that the tables are cleaned the minute people leave. I was impressed! My bf ordered the baby back ribs and I ordered the beef ribs. I thought my beef ribs were actually some of the best I've ever had...so incredibly juicy and tender. My bf liked his but didn't think they were the best he's ever had (not quite 5 star worthy - hence the 4 stars) but he agreed that my beef ribs were da bomb! I really wish I could give 4.5 stars cuz that's honestly what they deserve. We also shared some fries (super fresh and delish!) and also split one of their whoopie pies for dessert - YUM! All in all I'd go back to Phil's in a heartbeat... defintitely worth the wait! Also, we noticed you can phone-in your order and get it to-go which had a SIGNIFICANTLY smaller line so if you're a local and can take home I'd highly suggest you do that! ;-) Oh.. and don't forget to sign up for the mailing list cuz then they send you a birthday 'skip-the-line' email -- looking forward to that one! :-)

After reading the glowing reviews for this place, it almost made me believe that Jesus himself came down from heaven to man their BBQ. Was the food good?  Yes it was.  Was the food amazing?  Nope.   If you have never had real BBQ that has been smoked for hours to absolute perfection, then you might think this is amazing.  If you have never lived in the country and stopped off at at roadside stand to have meat grilled over an oak pit, then you might think this is amazing. If you can go on over when the wait is 15 minutes or less, then go for it.  The food is tasty, the service is friendly, and the food is solid.  It just isn't worth waiting 45 minutes for, and it isn't worth bragging about (unless the status of the restaurant is how you choose what is for dinner).

The moment you step out of the car and take a look at the line forming outside the door at Phil's BBQ, you start to think 'Oh hellz no!"  But then you stop and smell that aroma of saucy meat going into your head and you know you gotta jump on it.   Dubbed the Best BBQ in San Diego, the critics weren't kidding.  It's always crowded pack here and there's a reason why. By far, this is the best place I've been to for good ribs.  Straight up it's damn good.  Why do you think there's a line forming every night it's open?   And if you can muster the excruciating 1 hour+ wait for your food (to order; find a table; and wait) to arrive, trust me, your taste buds will thank you for it.   The restaurant may appear tiny from the outside but go inside and you'll notice a rather large dining area with wooden furnishing and that warm cabin-in-the-woods feel.  Unfortunately, it's just not big enough to house the hungry folks that pile in.  Phil's BBQ makes you wait in line first and order your food before sitting down.  After you order, then it's off to finding an available table inside which may seem hard at first with, but the wait time for orders will give you plenty of time to find a seat and chillax.  Don't make the mistake I did the 2nd time I came here and having my buddies' hold the fort while designating one of them to order for you...that's a no-no.   So while you wait for your food, you can play the available board games they have provided or watch the game playing on the TVs.  Very considerate of them. Okay onto the food.  Their specialty is obviously the ribs.  You have your choice of pork or beef ribs smothered with the most excellent BBQ sauce you'll taste.  Both choices are excellent and very meaty but I prefer the beef ribs more.  Phil's also offers chicken too and there are even half-chicken/half-bbq combo platters which is a good starter choice if you want to get a taste of what they do best.  Whatever you order, you can be sure they'll be mouth-watering and juicy.  Everything is slow roasted and has that smokey flavor the way real BBQ should be.  And you have your choice of 2 small sides or a large side to go along with your meal.  All this for about $9 and you got yourself a closer of a deal. And everything is so good, you got to eat it messy.  Screw table manners, just dig in.  There's a washing counter that lets you wash down your dirty hands (and face) at ease.   Very convenient and ingenious.  If I were to factor in the long wait times, I would actually give Phil's a 4.5 out of a 5 .  Yes, good food takes time but dammit.. Phil's is a tease to your tastebuds and your hungry stomach the moment you step in.  Making you wait for such goodness?  That's torture!

So I went to San Diego this past week to take my little boy to Sea World and as you can imagine all they have is overpriced food there so we decided to go eat dinner after we left the park. I yelped bbq food and this was the first restaurant that appeared. I read the reviews and they were all pretty good. I agree with all the positive feedback. I called in an order to pick up and take back to the hotel and I walked right in even though there was a long dine-in line there is a separate line for take out. The food is reasonably priced and delicious. I ordered the half stalk of short ribs with baked beans and macaroni salad and it was so good that I would recommend this place to anyone going to SD.

Our first attempt to go to Phil's BBQ for dinner was an epic fail -- one car went to the wrong Phil's BBQ, and the other went to the right one and left because the line was wrapped around the building. (If you didn't catch that, TIP: the Phil's BBQ on Goldfinch Street does not exist.  That's what we get for being too hasty with a Blackberry and Google Maps.) We tried again the next day for lunch, and we got a table (on Superbowl Sunday, no less)!  The place was surprisingly clean for food so messy, and I always love being surrounded by widescreen TVs. Ribs: 4 stars My friend and I shared one full rack of baby back ribs, and we couldn't finish them even though we wanted to.  The meat was tender, and their sauce is really good. Sides: 3 stars Okay, I was pretty disappointed with the sides.  We got a whole assortment of sides, and they were all just mediocre.  Bleh coleslaw, beans whatever, standard fries.  BUT their onion rings are their saving grace.  Seriously, those are what all onion rings should aspire to be: thick, crispy, and delicious! Overall, 3.5 stars but I'll round up -- it's a good place to go to break the monotony of eating Mexican food in SD.  But personally, I like BBQ joints for their sides as much as their ribs, and Everett and Jones in Oakland has Phil's beat on both fronts.

Breaking news: BBQ fans, you don't need to go to the south to get your fill of good BBQ! It's right here in San Diego. Even better news: They're opening up another Phil's BBQ in San Marcos! Now, all they need to do is open one up in my kitchen... For light weight eaters like me though, the portions are pretty big, so it's good to share with another person. The baby back ribs and chickless combo meal is perfect for those who want ribs and chicken. I hear the pulled pork, Broham sandwich is pretty dang tasty as well! Here's a tip: If you're going for lunch, go EARLY. Like line up by 11:00 early. Otherwise, bring a snack to keep you from going over the edge and trying to gnaw your neighbor's arm off. For dinner, same thing. GO EARLY! Line up by 5:00! Otherwise, you're screwed... Guaranteed the line will be out the door and looped all the way around the side of the building by 6:00.

OK For a BBQ aficionado, this place is pretty good. Not fantastic but pretty good. Sauce is tangy and tasteful, Ribs were tender and juicy, chicken was a little on the dry side, but the Tri-Tip sandwich was VERY good! I was surprised at the line at this place. In my opinion, it would be better if they offered table side service; vice the order at the counter, come get your order when your pager goes off. But that would slow down the service significantly! A sign outside says "21 Min and 14 Seconds from here" it took 45 Minutes, I understand it is a joking estimate and I have no problems just relaying how it was for us. The great thing is the complimentary water and the beer garden available while you wait in the line. nice touch. 4 vice 5 stars due to some of the food being a bit dry and not having table service. Sláinte!

Am i the only one that misses Phil's Mission Hills location?  a) it rhymed b) the food in mission hills was cooked with love, the food in sports arena is cooked with heat c) the atmosphere made me feel fuzzy.  There's a reason you used to have to wait an hour to get food there and now there is not even a 20 minute wait, not that i like waiting but it just goes to show.  The new Phil's looks like a chain restaurant and feels like one to people who knew and loved the old Phil's.  Phil, we will miss you, even though i will still go there whenever i want ribs.  I think i would give a higher rating if I hadn't been so in love with the old Phil's. Good day

For years now, I have been a regular and finally got around to writing a review.  This BBQ joint is special!  Their baby back ribs are delicious!  Soft, tender, smoky, and tangy bbq are just falling off the bone delicious!  My favorite sides are their BBQ baked beans, huge crunchy but oily onion rings! Their fries are so delicious!  Their potato salad is also very tasty.  When I'm trying to go on the healthier side, I order their large mixed veggies.  Their veggies has broccoli, zucchini *green and yellow, cauliflower, and I believe carrots too! Steamed to perfection!  It's now raw but it's soft but still has the vibrant colors and slight crunch to them.  I have also tried their tri tip sandwich.  It's delicious but I always go back to my favorite baby back ribs.  Their chicken is always dry and almost dry.  Somehow, I'm not a big fan of their chicken.  I've had better.   The Staff are amazing!  They are fun and on point.  Perfect spot to have a small or large group.  Just the downside is the long line.  But definitely worth waiting for.   Their BBQ is available for purchase by bottles but somehow, it doesn't have the smokiness flavor when we actually order inside.  Just let them do the grilling!   What tops the icing on the cake, this place has a bar and have lots of tv's if you are interesting in satisfying your craving or hunger, you can also watch sports!  FUN and very inviting place.

Oh Phil's...I so badly wanted to fall IN LOVE with you. Would you settle for IN LIKE with you. Came here for the Hubby's burpday lunch. Neither of us had ever been and Phil's was on our hit list for some time. So off we go... I had a half rack of ribs. Hubby had their Broham sandwich. No sides came with either so we decided to order a side of macaroni salad, potato salad and baked beans. The ribs were definitely tasty. Were they $11 and some change tasty? I don't know...maybe I'd feel better if they actually included the sides. I am sure that I wouldn't complain about the price then. But I just didn't think the quantity matched the price. Believe me, I am so willing to throw down the bills for exceptional food but one of two things has to happen...quality or quantity. Now the Hubby's Broham was ginormous! Again no sides were included but then again it was only $7 (rounding up). I thought that was way worth it. (Scratching my head...) I don't get it. I have to say it was just as delicious as my half rack of ribs and probably had as much meat as I had on my plate! The sides were all meh. To be fair, it could be my palate. I'm used to the island style mac salad and potato salad. And me being the opposite of an onion-lover, I didn't appreciate the bits of raw onions that would surprise me when I'd take a bite. The baked beans...I was hopeful. It was too peppery for my liking...but again, could just be my palate. Phil's seemed to have a pretty organized ordering system. Menus are posted everywhere so you can contemplate and have a decision made when it was your turn. There's a sink to rinse your messy hands. Tons of parking. Outdoor seating to be taken advantage of especially with beautiful SD weather. Overall, it was just A-OK to me. I'm willing to give it another shot, but this time I think I'd order something different. Clearly, Phil's is doing something right and there are tons who are IN LOVE with Phil's just based on the packed restaurant. Maybe one day, he'll sweep me off my feet . For now, I'll play hard to get. ;)

I LOVE THIS PLACE! Whenever I'm in or around SD I'm here, I'm not a huge BBQ fan but Phil's made me a believer! The wait to get a seat in the restaurant is almost always long but worth every minute. What other restaurant do you know of that can take a 2 week holiday vacation and close completely other then Phil's!? They must be doing something right in order to be loose 2 weeks worth of business annually. Try it for yourself and make yourself a believer too!

nothing that hasn't been said already! When visiting San Diego, we've only driven by this place, looked at the insane line outside and driven off. But on our last trip to SD, we arrived mid-afternoon on a Friday. guess what? NO LINE. we walked right up to the counter, ordered our food and less than 5min later we were enjoying one of the best meals we've had in recent months. I'm by no means a BBQ expert, hell! I hardly ever eat the stuff, but wow! meat so tender, it literally falls off the bone & BBQ sauce with just the right about of vinegar-y kick!  excellent sides ( I ordered the beans & macaroni salad) All around great meal! and believe me that roll of paper towels on each table surely comes in handy! Food-coma-worthy meal for 2 for less than $40! hell yes!

I knew it would be like this...but who's to complain anyway!???  This restaurant is a GREAT PLACE. HAS GREAT FOOD. GREAT BEEFY RIBS! and a GREAT ENVIROMENT FOR A BIG PARTY TO HAVE DINNER! **As for birthday specials? Uhmm, they don't even have a dessert menu, so getting a "free cake" or sumin' is not going to happen. But they did help us sing happy birthday, which was a nice kodak moment!

I understand why people wait. The food is delicious! The ribs are savory, the corn is sweet, and the potato salad is hearty. We stood in line for almost two hours, but servers came out with onion rings and fries to keep waiting patrons happy. The staff was helpful, and the food came out promptly after we ordered. I ordered a chocolate whoopie for dessert, but had to bring it home, because I was too full after dinner.

Phil's BBQ is one of those places you have to try before you die if you're in the Southern California area. I've been to Phil's BBQ a couple of times and it was amazing, just like what many of the reviews have said before me. Today I want to emphasize the amazing service. It's 9pm and my friends and I are in Long Beach. We're bored, a couple of my buddies just finished their finals and want to do something out of the ordinary, and so we decide to bust the a mission to Phils. Normally, a trip to Phils is 2 hours. We leave at 9:30 and Phils closes at 11 on a Saturday. Against the rain and all other odds, we make it RIGHT at 11. The place is practically getting ready to close and we're like, "Damnit, we're too late." We decide to test if it was really closed for sure, so we sat at the bar and the first guy that comes up goes, "Sorry, our kitchen closes at 11." Right as we're about to leave, the majority of the employees were like "Oh, no, we'll still cook something up." We got our food in 10 minutes. They brought out the plates to us. It was amazing. Of course my friends and I did an inspection for hairs, spit, dirt, toothpicks, tic-tacs, doritos and so on. Nope. This was my friend's first Phils experience and I don't need to tell you how much they enjoyed it. So thank you, Phil's BBQ, for being so hospitable even though you guys definitely wanted to close up. I know other restaurants would be pretty angry for people coming in RIGHT before closing. The people had Phils knew we were hungry, they knew we busted a late night mission from Long Beach, and still wanted to show that Phil's hospitality. Here's to hoping that Phil's BBQ lasts forever.

I've been in San Diego for a year and a half and have never ever had the desire to try Phil's, despite the hype surrounding it. But we finally got to go there for a friend's birthday. I didn't finish ANYTHING. There were enough leftovers for an entire dinner the next day, and I got the half-rack. Because this is one of those meals where there comes a point where you feel sick because all the food is heavy, greasy, creamy, and drenched in trans fat sauces. Not their fault though... I just don't have an appetite for that stuff. I got the "fall-off-the-bone ribs", macaroni salad, and the fries. The ribs were as good as everyone says they are, but my mouth never waters when I think about them and I think I'll stick with a sandwich next time I go. The fries were okay... but the macaroni salad. Ohhhhh baby.............. maybe next time, if ever, I will stick to purely sides. They definitely give you enough to fill you up. I also sampled some of my friend's coleslaw and I hate coleslaw... but I ordered one of my own after trying hers out. I was about to give this place 4 stars, but I WILL give them an extra because: +: service. Their service was AWESOME. Although I felt really bad because the man helping us out was old and cute and grandpa-like, and I just feel plain uncomfortable when people give off that way-too-nice-shouldn't-be-working-as-a-waiter-at-­Phil's-because-they-deserve-better vibe. Yeah... it was one of those. +: Their system of payment. Clever... they must know that a lot of college students sans enough money to treat their entire party to dinner come here, and being as busy as they are, they don't have time to split the bill and deal with the graciousness required to wait on tables. I know that comment sounds like it's a bad thing, but it's not. It's win-win. They don't need to shell out great service because I'm not tipping for it (although the people bringing you stuff are quite gracious as it is). And I save money on tip! Yippeeeeeeee

This restaurant is extremely popular. My sister gave them a call at 11, the time that they opened, to place an order. The receptionist gave us a little bit of an attitude but we got our orders in. When I drove out there to pick up our order, there was already a long line outside the door and looked like it was getting ready to wrap around the entire restaurant. We found the "phone orders" line which was pretty quick. The place was engulfed in the smell of bbq sauce. My sister and I watched as a waiter carried a tray of bbq beef sandwiches. They were loaded with meat, drizzled with sauce and had a huge pile of onion rings accompanying it. If we hadn't already ordered and there was a line, we would have chosen to stay in the restaurant to eat. It had such a homey feel to it. We ordered the full rack baby back ribs with fries and macaroni salads. I was not a huge fan of the fries but the macaroni salad was good. I usually prefer light sauce on my food but the the baby back ribs were extremely good with the extra sauce that dripped off of it as I ate. It tasted even better the next day (we ordered a little too much) :)  The meat itself fell off the bones, was very tender and practically melted in your mouth. I would definitely come here ( whether it is to-go or eat-in) and would recommend it to anyone who loves bbq. I haven't had enough bbq to compare and say this is the best bbq but it is definitely good.

No words are enough to describe how delicious the ribs are!!! You get a good feeling about the place not only when you see the huge space mountain-like line outside, but when you sit down and see a ROLL of paper towels on the table. I knew this was going to be a good experience, but I definitely fell short... I can't wait for the day when BF and I go back and get our BBQ faces again :) I also was very impressed about the onion rings (I am the kind of girl that asks for her food sans the onions, but I couldn't resist these humongous onion rings, and I am grateful I didn't skip them!!). Pretty tasty, THE BEST RIBS I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!

Phil's BBQ is one of my favorites and if you haven't tried it before you have to try it, their baby back ribs are simply the best in my opinion.  Although Phil's has changed since it was at a small location on Goldfinch St in Mission Hills which had a homey feel with it's board games to pass the time while you waited to the current location with a lot more seating area and very nice bar area with televisions.  Some things haven't changed, you will probably have to wait in line but it's all worth it because the staff is great and you will get great quality food. The baby back ribs are so good it is very hard from me to pick something else to try but I did recently try the Broham Pulled Pork Sandwich, although very good baby back ribs are still my poison. The sides are all very good, although recently I have only been getting their rib tickler which doesn't allow for substitutions but bbq sauce covered fries and coleslaw are great and at a great price.  A tip for not waiting in line is to call in your order and you can skip the line and enjoy Phil's to go!

First time finally trying the world famous Phil's BBQ.  As always this place had a line going out the door towards the parking lot.  When there's that many people there you have to consider Phil's must be doing something right.  Luckily for me I came late and the party I met already was inside and had ordered me a plate.  As I got in the place was packed.  I had a dish of what appeared to be 3 short ribs and a side of fries with coleslaw.  The ribs themselves were tasty...not overly burnt but cooked right with some tangy bbq sauce.  The fries had a smoky flavor to them too.  The coleslaw is what you'd expect it to be.  The service seemed friendly.  As far as forks and spoons you are to help yourself to them off on the side along with your drink.  I want to try the may other bbq options here next trip.

I went there not knowing anything about the place. I saw the raging line and decided this place must be good if the line is out the door and around the building. So glad I went. The line moves really fast and there is bar with open seating. I didn't know that until I got to the front of the line but next time I will definitely check that area first. Food was amazing.

There's always that one place in a city that's over the top for BIG FOOD. The place for the biggest, sloppiest cuisine in San Diego has to go to Phil's. Once you walk in you wonder if this is a Disney ride or a restaurant with two lines one for the week kneed take out (phone orders) and the one for the gastronomically adventurous table hunters. The darkened decor of Phil's is emblazoned by the fire pits behind the wall long pass-through as ribs and briskets fly into styrene boxes faster than iPods at a Mac Convention. The smell is enough to make your eyes water as well as your mouth as you feel the tiny morsels of hickory flavored ash forever embeding themselves in your clothes. You can tell right away that the meat is well coated with a wonderful BBQ sauce.  The place is packed by 5 P.M. so maybe the phone call is a better idea. The beef rib is a steak on a skeletal broom handle.  The full order is three meals if you don't belong to a frat house and two if you do. A light sandwich in here is well over a pound of meat so don't go too crazy on your first order.  God knows what the veggie burger looks like. Yes they do have one! The pork ribs are tender and the meat falls off the bone but I like them a little more crispy, thank you. The sides are descent and attribute to lack of a 5th star.  Although the beans are surprisingly tangy without massive amounts of sugar.  The corn tastes boiled when it should be broiled. Fries are fare but the rings are better.  A little more vinegar in the potato salad would be perfect. Expect leftovers for  a week.  You may also never need nor want an air freshener in your car again.

Hands down, the BEST BBQ joint in San Diego! The food is outstanding, everything from their pork ribs to their BBQ sandwich. The french fries are freshly made and the onion rings are huge. Even their sweetened black tea is good!! You can't loose with Phil's BBQ!! BTW, the best time to go is early evening around 3:30-4:30 because the lines are not as long. Any other time, the line can get extremely long so be prepared to wait.

Finally tried the famed Phil's BBQ (featured on Man vs. Food)! I came here on a Sunday afternoon, and not gonna lie, after reading review after review on how the line seems long but the wait goes by pretty fast, I did not expect to wait for almost an hour. Nevertheless, with thousands of reviews and an average of 4.5 stars, I knew I had to stick it out and give Phil's a try. And everyone was right - the wait was DEFINITELY worth it. I knew that the portions would be ridiculous, so I chose the Chick Tickler - BBQ chicken with slaw, 2 giant onion rings and a ton of French Fries for $6.45. I wasn't a huge fan of the onion rings because I like them small and not so dough-y, but everything else was so so satisfying and delicious. The BBQ sauce was flavorful with a tangy kick, and the chicken was tender. I also tried a bit of the baby back rib, macaroni salad (my personal favorite side) and potato salad, all of which tasted incredible. So if you're hungry and craving for some BBQ, definitely make a trip to Phil's - you won't be disappointed.

I don't think I'm alone when I say that I have heard A LOT about Phil's.  Phil's is certainly the talk of the town when it comes to BBQ and it's famous food ranks in the most talked about for any type of food here in SD.   There is no question that Phil's is very good.  I went here last night with a group of 10 people and there was plenty of room and no wait.  I ordered "El Toro" with a price tag of around $7.  Also got a large order of the macaroni salad ($2.25).  El Toro was very good.  Shaved, tender tri-tip slathered in BBQ sauce on a hamburger bun.  The only thing that brings this from a 5 star experience to a 4 star experience is the amount of sauce as well as the flavor of the sauce. The sauce is pretty good.  It has A LOT of flavor.  In fact, the abundant amount of contrasting flavors and spices was slightly overwhelming for me.  The amount of sauce seemed to mask the quality of the meat to an extent.  There was A LOT of sauce. I'm afraid that the accolades that Phil's has received is a bit overboard when considering the the amount of sauce on EL Toro along with it's slightly overwhelming flavor.  That, being said, I would still highly recommend Phil's for a good plate of BBQ.

I agree with what everyone else said. On that note been going here for the 8 or so years I was living in San Diego. Coming from LA and now SF, I still havent been to a place that can even come close to the ribs here. The lines can get long but worth the wait cause it always goes by fast as they are more then prepared for the crowds. Worth every penny.

Jonathan C. suggested going to Phil's since a group of us were in the San Diego area.  When we arrived, the line was around the side of the building, so I had pretty high hopes that this would be a mind-blowing BBQ experience.  I think we waited for about 30-40 minutes before we were finally able to order.  I got a Chick Tickler and husband got a 1/2 rack of ribs.  Now, I don't know if anyone of the people who gave this place 4-5 stars had ever been to Lucille's in the LA area, but husband and I both agreed that this place had nothing on Lucille's; not that the food was bad, we've just had better.  I think the long line and Yelp/Twitter signs got my hopes up. =/  The one thing that I thought was reeeeaaaly good here were the onion rings.  Other than that, just don't come here with super high expectations and you'll probably be satisfied. In regards to service, all of the staff we encountered were super happy and friendly.  I guess they really like their job. Bottom Line:  If there were no line, I'd come back.

If there's anything I miss about living in what I used to call the godforsaken black hole (aka San Diego), it would have to be Phil's.  I didn't quite understand BBQ until I met Phil, and he then proceeded to show me the world.  The menu is fairly straightforward: pork and beef ribs, and chicken.  There are also a handful of sides to choose from, including potato salad, coleslaw, french fries, and beans.  All of the meat is incredibly tender and juicy, and never fails to be so each and every time.  Rib meat falls too easily off the bone, much like a silk charmeuse slip off of a French whore in a Godard film. I started going to Phil's at its original location off of Washington, in the Hillcrest neighborhood.  Although it was a small joint, that was also its appeal.  Amazingly the wait would never be too long, and I loved their wash-up stations where you could periodically get up to clean your dirty paws from the extra saucy ribs.  From my understanding, this location is undergoing renovation, but it seems to be taking them a long ass time to get it together.   Now that Phil has decided to expand with that behemoth on Sports Arena Blvd., the restaurant's popularity has soared, like, a million-fold.  The last time I went, the line was practically wrapping around the restaurant.  This bothers me, because anyone who knows understands my disdain for hype.  But for Phil, I GUESS I'll have to make an exception.

What can I say... I went in starving I came out ready to explode all with spending around 10 dollars *2 thumbs up* Drove by here a couple of times the long lines scared me away but I'm told by my friends that the lines mover very quick even though they look intimidating. Today I went around 9:30 so there was no line, food came quick and boy was it GOOOOOOOOOOOOD. I wish had a picture of me gnawing on the bone like a dog, it was crazy, my face was covered with BBQ sauce and hands covered with it as well. Got the full rack of beefy ribs and split it with my gf, filled both of us up (both of us are fatasses, so this says a lot) overall -happy with the food -happy with the prices -happy with the quick clean up they did of our stuff after we were done -happy with the hand washing sinks in 2 locations -happy with the quickness the food was ready -happy happy happy with that said I felt the potato salad could have had more flavor and the ribs could have  A LOT less fat, I felt like i was eating jelly or something cause it was all fat, but I was so hungry that I didn't care. overall a great place and would come back again for sure, but does have some minor areas they could improve upon.

I've been to Phil's BBQ a few times. If I could, i would go there every week. But unfortunately Phil's BBQ is too far from LA; why can't they open one in LA?! As you walk toward the restaurant, you can smell the aroma of BBQ..mmmmm..yuummmyyy.. meeaaatttt *drools* The ribs here are so flavorful..so saucy...sooo delicious. The meat just falls out of the bone. Every bite i take is just pure goodness! I normally order their full rack of baby back ribs..and i will devoured all of it in one sitting. The fries here are good too. but mainly i'm here for the ribs, dont care about the side dishes. Man, just typing up this review is making me salivate. I'm not going to say it's the best ribs in the whole world cuz i havent tried that many bbq places, but in my opinion, i think it's better than Lucille's. So if you havent try Phil's BBQ, make a stop there today. I think the only problem i have w/ Phil's BBQ is their seating arrangement. You don't always get a table right away, you have to wait and wait for people to leave. It's annoying especially when u have your plate of food in hands but you're just waiting for a table to sit.

BBQ is delicious.  I always get the broham sandwich with the coleslaw on the side.  They give you more meat and more coleslaw this way!  Ribs are awesome, Chicken is good, but sometimes dry, El toro sandwich is ok but dry, Onion Rings are yummy.  All the other side dishes are good, but not great. PROS: Quick Service, Take Phone Orders, Has a bar CONS: Gets super busy

Five minus two stars this time around? Why you ask? Well, this past Saturday evening, an employee forgot to give us a receipt for our order, but still gave us a pager so we can be called.  It didn't occur to us at first that we didn't receive a receipt and after 25 mins of chit-chatter, we realized that our stomachs were still empty, and our pager has still not vibrated.  So two people from our party go up to inquire and low and behold, they ask us for our receipt.  We tell them that we actually never received one so they check with the cashier who handled our order and come back to us saying that the order was in fact NEVER PLACED and that they were going to make our two family rib dinners right away.  They quickly brought our food out (said it would take a minute) but we didn't really receive any apologies in return for their mistake.   Mind you, we waited outside in the rain for 45 minutes to place this "lost order" that we paid $50 for.  Although the food was still good, my entire party and myself were very disappointed that we weren't approached by the manager or any of the staff to express their apologies.  If we didn't say anything about our order taking too long, it wouldve gone unnoticed.  Our waiter didn't even notice how long we were waiting.  Also, all the people who were waiting the same time as us, were already done eating by the time we got our food.

I love this place. Everything about this place I love... well scratch that, the wait I hate... especially that damn sign that says "21 minutes and 14 seconds". I can't pick anything else buy the baby back ribs. Damn those are so dang good. I mean FINGERLICKIN good. The sauce is sweet with the right punches. It changes flavor in my mouth everytime I eat it. I even love eating with my hands. Perhaps its the primal nature about eating bbq? I don't care. It's so good. And while I'm not familiar with the average pricing, the fact that my friend and I could share the full rack of baby back ribs and sides and still have food left for $19 bucks plus tax. Its good. The staff has always been helpful whenever we came there. Here's a tip, you can skip the wait if you are willing to sit in the bar area and you can order at the bar! Next time, I'll order the El Toro... I was meaning to order it but after watching Adam Richman from Man Versus Food eat it, yum. So yes, visit this San Diego staple. Although, I can't wait for it to open in San Marcos!!!!

PHIL'S... DELICIOUS, SCRUMPTIOUS, MOUTH-WATERING. I'm sure by now all the yelp readers know what Phil's bbq offers. I almost always get the half rack with baby back ribs. It comes with about 10-12 ribs which is more than enough for me. It also comes with 2 sides and I always get the macaroni salad and fries. The ribs are just out of this world. The meat just falls off the bone and it is perfectly marinated in their bbq sauce. The sides are also very delicious. After I eat Phil's bbq, I am ALWAYS satisfied and full... and all this for $12! Yay!

Yummy, yummy, yummy, I got love in my tummy!  This place simply has the best BBQ I have ever had!  Every time I step into Phil's, I feel like I've just entered an eating marathon in which I'm not allowed to utter a word until my stomach is hanging over the top of my pants. I normally order the half rack baby back ribs with fries and macaroni salad.  I have also tried the beefy ribs and the El Toro sandwich. The baby back ribs are money!  So fine, fresh, and FIERCE!  The meat is so juicy and tender that it just falls off the bones.  The ribs have a nice not-too-heavy coat of sauce on them--I don't like it when restaurants spill excessive amounts of sauce onto their foods and then serve them to customers.  Finger-licking good!  I can hear angels singing every time I take my first few bites into this heavenly goodness. The beefy ribs are MASSIVE with huge chunks of meat clinging onto thick bones!  They're literally like the size of my forearm!  These have to be eaten using two hands because if you try to lift them up with one hand, you might break your arm.  I found these a little dry and tougher to eat, so I do not enjoy them as much as I enjoy the baby back ribs.  Also, have some paper towels nearby; they become handy after your BBQ sauce facial. The El Toro tri-tip sandwich was disappointing for me.  My cousin ordered this, and I tried a little of the meat.  In addition to being cruelly drenched in BBQ sauce, it was overwhelmingly smoky to the point where it tasted a little bitter.  It's like I volunteered to be trapped in a burning room to taste-test some smoke. Now, please excuse me as I wipe drool off my face and go heat up some leftover ribs to eat.  Nom.

It was a Sunday afternoon and my wife and I were staying in Old Town, San Diego. We decided to walk a couple miles to the BBQ place we have heard a lot about. Phil's. The line was pretty short and the greeter asked us if it was our first time there. We said,"Yes" and he explained how everything worked. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my wife ordered the boneless chicken tenders platter with steamed veggies. The order taker was awesome and the lady that gave us our food was fantastic too. Everyone had a smile on their face. Even the bus boy was in a good mood. Now onto the food. The pork sandwich was teeming with meat and spilling over the sides. It was juicy and perfect. The sauce could have been hotter, but I like spicy stuff. It was good though, kind of tangy. I would have liked multiple options like Famous Dave's back in Minneapolis, but that is just being picky. My wife's platter was full of white meat pieces of chicken breast. They were awesome, but I would have liked more sauce on them if I had my choice. Her veggies were fresh and crispy and with the service and pop refills, Phil's lived up to expectations! A must visit in San Diego. The line looks big, but it went by quickly and it is worth the wait.

I bookmarked this place for a while now and I finally had some! THE WAIT IS AROUND 50 MINUTES!!!!!!!!!! we arrived at 1230. got in at 145. ordered. sat down. this tall black guy name KENNY was really wonderful. we weren't even waiting for that long (prob 10-15 mins.) he looked over the counter at us and came over asked what did we ordered, came out a bit later with our food! we didn't even have to wait for the buzzer to go off and go get our food. He was really friendly =) I just wanted to include him because he was not a server or anything. He didn't have to serve us our food, but he did anyway! What we ordered! - Beefy Ribs (5 pieces) with 2 sides ( Macaroni Salad & Fries ) + a side of fresh corn on a cob. $19.95 - Baby Back ribs (3 pieces) + 2 sides of cole slaw & fresh cut fries. $6.45 I prefer the beefy ribs over the baby back ribs! Just sayin'. I enjoyed this place and it was worth the wait! Will come back.

We got to Phil's BBQ around 5:30 or 6pm so the line was already pretty long, but my housemates and I knew we'd be waiting for at least an hour anyways. It was torture seeing all the other people eating. The wait was still pretty long so we decided to grab some beer to kill time. They have this little concession stand for drinks. The guy working it, named Douglas I believe, was a good sport. The beer was made locally and it was good! I ended up ordering beef bbq ribs, 3 bones with small side orders of macaroni salad and potato salad. I was worried it wasn't enough food, but when my order came up and I saw the amount of meat on those 3 ribs, I stopped worrying. The sauce is so delicious. Very tangy and vinegar-y. I asked for extra sauce and dipped the meat in it even though it was covered in BBQ sauce already. The meat itself is so tender and just... ahh man, I want some more. I was so focused on the beef ribs that I nearly ignored the sides. My friend let me try some of his baked beans -- I'm not a big fan of beans but WOW those were yummy. I ended up not finishing my food so I got it to go. I brought back a little of San Diego with me to Norcal. I can't wait to go back, whenever I end up in the area again! Not only is their food amazing, but their customer service is the best as well. I love Phil's BBQ! When we left, the line was 2x as long. No lie. Get there early, know what you want when you get to the cashier, and keep an eye out for an empty table. This place is packed and for a good reason!

Phil's BBQ was featured on Man vs. Food. Phil's BBQ is the real deal and is a pleasant surprise to find bbq this good outside of the prototypical bbq regions. I saw the El Toro sandwich on Man vs. Food and had to try it for myself. This turned out to not only be one of the best bbq sandwiches I've ever had, but one of the best sandwiches, period. The sauce was unlike any that I've ever had. The taste was a perfect combination of tangy, sweet, and spicy. It tasted like we were mixing the signature characteristics of Kansas City and Carolina bbq into one awesome sauce. I also ordered the onion rings and would rate them as average, nothing too special. Although Phil's is a good sized restaurant, it get's packed. We tried to go for dinner on a Saturday night and were greeted by line that was long enough to discourage us from staying. I went back the next day for lunch and ran into a long line of hungry people waiting for Phil's to open for the day. Phil's serves up some of the best bbq in the country, and therefore earns a five star rating.

I love this place. I came here with Wilmar D., Sarah M., and two other friends who aren't on Yelp (what losers). I was apprehensive at first. I'm not a huge fan of eating ginormous portions of meat, and the side dishes that came with were all fried potato and coleslaw. For the record, I have never liked coleslaw. I've always hated it. This place changed my mind. I'm not going to be craving it anytime, but it can be pretty good with good BBQ. Which is what this place serves. Really good BBQ. I ordered the quarter pound ribs. The meat came right off the bone, it was sooo tender. Excuse me while I wipe my drool off my chin. It's a little noisy inside, but it doesn't really matter if you call in your order and just pick it up to eat somewhere else. It's just as tasty. Best BBQ of life.

I can't speak as to whether this is genuine BBQ or not, but I can comfortably say this is the best BBQ I've had in San Diego outside of my own grill. This place gets PACKED.  Expect a line that runs out the door and possibly down the sidewalk, but it moved pretty quickly.  The service was prompt as well (they had my food ready within 5 minutes). I went with the ribless / chickless platter, which is basically rib meat and chicken without the bones.  Both items were tender, moist enough and tasty.  I got their potato salad and baked beans on the side and they were both good as well.  It was an ample sized meal and definitely filled me up.  Everything was covered in BBQ sauce which is typical, and I'd qualify it as sweet. I'm subtracting 1 star because of the lady that polices the front of the line though.  Never, never, NEVER give a customer (especially me), under any circumstances, the "evil eye," which she gave to me when I was waved up to the counter by the cashier to place my order.  You stepped away for a minute ... what am I supposed to do, wait until you get back even though the cashier is waving me forward?  I think not ...

Had a solid man date with my buddy Jon here during spring break.  Yes, bromance was in the air as we sat down with my combo beef rib and chicken dinner and his full rack of baby back ribs.  I got cole slaw and fries for my side dishes and he opted for a whole ear of grilled corn.  And of course no man date is complete without a pitcher of Arrogant Bastard Ale and two frosted pint glasses.  This was going to be epic.   The beef ribs were pretty standard, a little more char than I usually like on my grilled meat, but the sauce was incredible and made up for some of the ashy morsels.  My chicken, however, was awesome.  So juicy and the skin was nice and crispy.  Beautiful.  Jon's baby back ribs were delicious, of course, definitely better than the beef ribs, but you know I always gotta try them.  Oh we also got an order of onion rings and extra bbq sauce that they give to you warm.  Incredible.  I should also say that the service here is great, with friendly cashiers and bus staff.  The only thing that would have this place better was if they had Stone IPA on draft.  Man that should be a law for any food establishment in San Diego.   We ended the magical evening by watching I Love You, Man.  All in all I'd say it was a pretty successful man date.  I hope he calls me back.

5 stars without a doubt! The BBQ ribs here are by far the best ribs i've ever tasted in my life! The sauce, the texture, everything is just so good i don't even know how to describe it! I would just say... the meat melts in your mouth!!!!!!!! i'm not kidding.. I also love their onion rings (they're about the size of your face! HAHA) one bad thing about this place is that everything is self-serve. You have to find your own table, you pick up your own food, you do everything. It's not really a bad thing actually, but i guess it could be a bit inconvenient for some people. the place is usually PACKED and the lines can get really long, so if you know what you want, order ahead of time over the phone! that'll definitely help you save some time! :)

In San Diego for the weekend and Angie W places Phil's at the top of  the list when I suggest that the theme of the weekend is food.  She warned me, "There's usually a line."  We grab a couple more friends and head out. Upon pulling into the driveway, I can't help but notice one glaring factoid, Angie wasn't kidding - there was indeed a LINE!  In what resembled more of a scene from Disneyland than the entrance to a culinary establishment,  I couldn't help but think to myself, "Really?...  We're gonna wait in this?"  (When hungry, Angie really isn't the "waiting" type)  I take a look at her, see her excitement, and realize that the answer to my question is, "Yes, we're waiting."  We hunker down and settle in - this is gonna take a while. We're not in line for two minutes when we're approached by Tammie, a Phil's staff member.  She comes out to greet us at the back of the line and just starts... well... socializing.  We ask her why she's outside, and very sure of herself, she replies, "I'm working the line".  Nice!... They realize that the line is long, so they send people out to ease the experience.  That's what I call customer service, and technically, I haven't bought anything, so I'm not even a customer yet. We explain to Tammie that half of our quartet are Phil's rookies and that this is our maiden voyage.  She tells us, "Wait here, I'll be right back."  A couple minutes pass and she returns from the kitchen with a basket of fries and BBQ sauce.  Again, attention to the details of your experience that you just can't ignore. The 1 hour and 15 minutes in line (OUCH!!!) go by as quickly as an hour and 15 minutes can, and we eventually get inside to order.  Personally, I went with the full rack of Baby Back Ribs with the sweet beans and macaroni salad on the sides. The ribs were nothing short of awesome!  Tender doesn't even begin to scratch the surface here.  The tangy sauce was a perfect marriage with the smokiness of the meat, and to say that the portion was MAMMOTH would be a severe understatement.  The sweetness of the beans provided a welcomed contrast to the meal, and the macaroni salad summed everything up with hints of garlic.  The entire meal was an experience in itself, but the food coupled with the friendly and engaging staff made our visit memorable.   Unfortunately, my visits to San Diego are becoming less and less frequent, but when I do return, I have a tendency to hit up some of my old spots.  It looks like I've got a new one now.

This place is famous... so don't let my rating throw you.... I'm basically writing this review as a letter of warning: ORDER IT TO GO!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm serious... I can't believe the lines this place has... It is outrageous. Now, I must give you a reason for my 3 stars: I'm not a big meat eater... The ribs are FANTASTIC... the chicken was a little dry in the center... but I came for the SIDES, and I wasn't too impressed... Their beans were very peppery... and their macaroni salad was good, but not the best thing I've ever had. Their fries, amazing.... Other than that, BBQ is BBQ to me... so consider other reviews =)

The ribs and chicken were grilled to perfection--the meat practically melted as I bit into it. VERY DELICIOUS!

So I have to write a review for this place because they truly deserve it :) First of the ribs are delicious, i had the baby back ribs and they are bbqed to perfection.  The meat is so juicy and tender, exactly how ribs should be.  The collosal onion rings are also to die for, it is a large order and you'll probably be overstuffed if you're not sharing it with a few other ppl.  I've had the macaroni salald which i loveee and the potato salad is just alright. Tip! ORDER TOGO!  So the line at Phil's get's ridiculously long, my friend and I decided to go to the togo line..which had only a handful of ppl versus 30+ ppl.  We ordered togo and my friends Veggie Burger takes longer to make (~ 20 mins), my ribs came out within 5-10 mins.  While we were waiting in line the store manager noticed that only i had my food and my friend was still waiting.  He graciously, told me that he would take the ribs i had and remake me new ones so that my food won't be cold by the time we got the burger.  Probably the best customer service i have received in a restaurant.  He even threw in a few extra ribs for me and upgraded the sides to a large order.   Soo all in all, on top of the great food the customer service is also excellent :)  So be sure to make a trip to Phil's you won't regret it ;) and if u don't want to wait, order togo instead and drive out to mission bay park (2.5 miles away) and have a little bbq picnic by the bay on a sunny san diego day :)

When we arrived we saw a long line and weren't sure if I wanted to wait for bbq ribs.  But if you had any doubt just park the car and roll down your windows, the smell of smoke meat greets you and suddenly waiting in line for a rack of bbq ribs don't seem too bad. A long line wrapped around the block and people still smiling at every inch they are closer to that front door. Here's what you need to know: -Casual Dining -You order at a cashier/counter and they give you a buzzer.  Once your buzzer goes off you are to go to the front counter and pick up your meal. -It is dine in with no reservations, this is not a typical restaurant.   -Wear a dark shirt -you must try their chocolate whoopie pie (not on the menu but is for sale at the front counter) Their ribs falls right off the bone and their beef ribs have a ton of meat, unlike some ribs you get at other bbq restaurants.   Service:  O. M. G.  that's all I have to say... They were all friendly and so nice.  Always wanting to help and they smile all the time.  It's amazing to have a great meal and there's no lack in service.  From the counter to the bus boys to the bbq crew (they dont' call themselves waiters) it was a great experience and a must stop in whenever you're in San Diego.  Try them out, you won't be disappointed.

The pork ribs and the onion rings were perfect for me.  The only bad thing was that I had to share my dinner rack, and I realized that I am a selfish person when it comes to good food. This is the place where you can lick all 10 fingers clean without noticing anyone else; it's that good.

Everyone and their momma since moving San Diego and learning that I love BBQ, has told me that I have to go check out Phil's BBQ.  It is supposed to be the best BBQ in San Diego and perhaps the whole world.  While I do not argue that Phil's BBQ is very good, I cannot join everyone else in their hyperbole regarding Phil's Q.  It does not make me jizz my pants - the litmus test for the ultimate BBQ. When my girlfriend and I try new places we order a variety of things so we can get a lay of the land.  We tried Phil's out Saturday and on advice of several people called in our order.  At a good 'Q joint, I think one MUST have some: pork ribs, pulled pork, chicken and sausage (aka hot links).  Those 4 things are the four corner stones of any good BBQ joint in my opinion.  After that it boils down to preparation: sauce vs dry rub or combo, the kind of bbq sauce, smoke, etc. Phil's gets points for good technique on smoking their meats.  The chicken and baby back ribs were smoked well.  The meat portions were huge and they didn't skimp.  There wasn't the prominent tell tale smoke ring usually evident in good Q, but the meat was good.  The meat was lightly seasoned and then bathed in a sweet and tangy BBQ.  The sauce balance in the sauce was off however.  It was more tang than anything else in the sauce.  Whoever made that sauce was a little heavy handed with the vinegar.  Next time we'll be ordering the sauce on the side. Here are the things I was not crazy about: 1) You know you're popular, so get a bigger place.  The line around the corner seems incredibly unnecessary and just for ego boosting. 2) I didn't see an option on the menu to order pulled pork seperately or with a combo with something else.  It was only available in a sandwich. 3) The prices seemed high 4) The baked beans were not anything to write home about - skip them 5) The potato salad while well seasoned, the red potatoes were woefully undercooked 6) The portions were small for the take-out sides All and all, when I don't want to spend the time making my own BBQ it's good to know there is a viable alternative nearby.  And oh yea, where are the rolls or bread to sop up the BBQ sauce??  There were none with our order.  Or how about some greens??  May be I'm just thinking more southern BBQ.

We came here for the first time about a year ago and we liked the food. We were not so thrilled with the 45 min wait for our lunch. I was so excited to find out that we were going to Phil's for dinner last night with our friends. When we arrived, the line was out the door, around the building and I quickly developed a bad headache and almost turned into a whiney baby. Finally, after half an hour patiently waiting in line, reading every word on the big menu hung on the wall, we got to the counter and were greeted by a smiling young man who seem genuinely excited to take our order. I was so excited to order the baby backs, beef ribs, corn, fries, baked potato. I remembered that the ribs were really good, but, for some reason, this time, I really didn't enjoy the sauce. I didn't remember it to be so tangy and sour. I didn't like it at all. The sauce on the heavier beef ribs were alright but on the baby back, it was overwhelming and overpowering the tender pork. It's really too bad cuz I was really hoping to enjoy the ribs here. I grabbed my soda cup while sweetie paid for dinner, and I think I perked up with a sip of rootbeer. We found a table and eagerly waited for the vibrating pager to inform us our dinner is ready for pick-up. We ordered beef ribs, baby back ribs and corn on the cob, macaroni salad, and french fries. I started munching on with a few pieces of french fries then went straight into the my big hearty beef rib. I absolutely love it. There was a perfect bite to each bite and the flavor was perfectly savory.

My love letter to Phil's: Dear Phil's, I hate BBQ sauce and American BBQ; hate is a strong word and the American BBQ and the sauce it's usually served with deserve it. But not your BBQ and your orgasmic sauce...they're both one of a kind and I... love them. Why must you be so, so, so delicious? No other American BBQ and BBQ sauce can compare. No wonder why you're the #1 restaurant in San Diego. I regret not discovering you until my senior year of college - I wasted 3 years of my life. I miss you. When will you come to the Bay Area? Yours truly, Grace.

OV-ER-RA-TED!!! I was completely overwhelmed with the ridiculous waits the last couple times we tried to go grab some famous Phil's BBQ. And I thought with all the hype it's GOT to be good. Well, I was wrong. They sure made me look like a fool. 1.) Menu set up is a bit cluttered and confusing. 2.) The following items that make a barbeque weren't on the menu! Such as:  -Macaroni and Cheese  -Tri-tip  -Brisket 3.) There's one choice of BBQ sauce. (And it was a bit too tangy for my taste.) 4.) A bit dry/over cooked. The pieces of chicken and ribs we got were burnt. (Not too happy about that.) And it seemed they didnt put enough sauce on our meals. I'll say, the place most definitely will get you in and I guess you can't knock it 'til you try it. But I personally wasn't too impressed. On a good note, the prices aren't too bad and service is friendly.

I have been hesitant to review this place because I thought it was so cliche.  So I am going to keep it short and funky! Succulent pork drenched in barbecue sauce is an amazing combination. If you want to get the most meat for your money, "that's what she said," order the Rib-less Dinner!  It only costs 10.95 and includes two sides.  You will get twice as much meat as ordering the full slab of baby back ribs. Short and funky!

If you ever visit San Diego, everyone who is in the "IN" wil tell you to come here! Its maybe not the best bbq you every tasted, but its probably the you'll ever taste in SD! its definitely GOOD and worth your buck.   The meat just falls right off the bone and the sauce... well... its really hard to describe. I would say kinda vingary with bbq zing! Lick your fingers and see what you think.  The line is long, wraps around the whole place sometimes. just bring it home and watch a game! there's never a line for take-out! I usually get the tickler, its got the best of everything. your bbq ribs, coleslaw, fries, and two huge onion rings! yammy in my tammy! You best believe i eat the whole thing!  Its a huge portion and everything is hella good! i mean 2 of the things are fried, one is drenched in sauce and extremely tender, and coleslaw is your "salad," is good for you right?! Keeps me full, keeps me happy. :)

I utilize my 5-star ratings sparingly and Phil's BBQ deserves the top starage. From what I hear there usually is a long line, but it goes very fast and the staff is friendly and helpful which helps the wait become more bearable. I had the Beef ribs and chicken combo. It was great. The BBQ sauce has a bit of sweetness, a little tang, and a small kick. Again, it was great! The best thing about the chicken was the tenderness. It was perfectly cooked and juicy. The portion of the dinner was large. Big enough to share, but I suggest to get your own and take home the leftovers! My friend ordered the onion rings and I tried one. They were good and crunchy. I also had a Caesar salad on the side and wasn't too hot about it. I'm not a big Caesar fan, but have had some good Caesar dressing, this wasn't one of them. It's not bad, just not great. If you're in San Diego do  not miss Phil's BBQ...it is the best I have ever had and I have had BBQ in Kansas City!

There is a wait but I think it's worth it. I have been here multiple times and never disappointed. The atmosphere is very woodsy. They cater too!

I'm gonna give this place five stars because between you and me, this is the greatest place to get some barbeque anywhere. Being probably the least biggest fan of barbeque in the past, this restaurant was able to change my mind around in a big way. It's the kind of place you'd want to take your friends who are in town for a couple of days and just want some good quality comfort food. Another important note--at first sight, Phil's may look like the longest wait for food ever, especially during any of the peak hours, but they serve their food in a very efficient way which moves the line rather quickly-- so don't be daunted by the Disneyland ride lines wrapping around the restaurant, trust. It'll take you no longer than 15-20 minutes for some of the best bbq you've ever had, so just bear with it (you'll have time to digest whatever salad or mcgarbage you had before, jk...kinda :) ). Anyway, I always get the best of both (which is both bbq chicken and bbq pork ribs or whatever other combinations they have on the menu), because seriously, when do you ever get a chance to get the best of both in anything? Right? Right. Offered at a very reasonable $13-14 dollars, this meal includes two small sides as well. When considering sides I have to recommend the beans, coleslaw, or macaroni salad...but then again, if you're down to spend a couple more dollars, do yourself a favor and indulge yourself in some home-made onion rings made from their OWN batter. I've probably praised this place more than I should, but when I think about how satisfied I am everytime I leave this place, it's more than deserving. Hope this helps any doubters!

Just like the 49ers of the 80's NFL and the Florida State Seminoles of the 90's NCAA football, Phil's dominates the rib joint scene.  It's not even close.  I'm 29 years old (as of this weekend) and the days of waiting over an hour in line for a meal are few and far between.  If i'm gonna wait that long, it damn well better have happy ending.  Well luckily you get a happy ending at Phils.  And not the illegal kind (I assume, I didn't ask).   It took about an hour and 15 minutes to get in on a Thursday, however, the food ordering and serving was relatively fast once your in the door.  The service was OK at best, but to be honest the food was so good they could have punched me in the face at the register and I would still give 5 stars.  Service is irrelevant. I got the baby back ribs with sides of baked beans and potato salad.  They were extremely tender, drenched in BBQ sauce, and finished off on a grill just enough that the edges are just slightly charred.  This is exactly the way I like my BBQ so for me it was as good as it gets and then some.  The sides were also top notch.   The meal was so good in fact that I now have an almost adverse reaction to BBQ joints in SF.  Places that I used to consider decent I can no longer tolerate.  I will be petitioning to have these local mom and pop businesses closed in hopes that Phil's BBQ will consider opening a branch in the Bay Area and eventually become a global conglomerate.   Phil's shall become the first food purveyor REQUIRED to be a monopoly by the US government.  Muahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!  Also people who dress up their dogs or jump in pictures would be shot. Nate's BBQ take your crap ribs and get the hell outta the Bay Area!!

Waiting in line for Phil's is the greatest pay off you will ever receive for waiting in a line. It is an evidence based fact that the length of time you wait in the Phil's line is directly correlated with the increase in amount of food you will order than when you first get in line. (i.e. 0 mins= "I'm gonna get the ribs"; 45 mins = "I'm gonna get the ribs AND the pork sandwich"; 1.5 hours = "I'M GETTING 1,000 RIBS.") The line length is also the determining factor for the speed of meat to face, allowing for optimal face stuffage, as needed. (i.e. 1 hour of line waiting = approx. 1,000 rpm [ribs per min]) Thus, the line wait is also equivalent to "WORTH IT." I've heard someone say that Phil's is just "ok", but I've decided that that person does not have taste buds. The pork ribs make everything in your life better, including the fact that you've just waited that long to get in. The coleslaw, Broham sandwich and onion rings are also rockin. And the staff still treats you nicely even though you turn into a carnivorous beast with sauce all over your face. What's not to love? 1,000 high fives for Phil's!

Probably can't say anything that hasn't been said about Phil's before but I would just like to spazz about how great this place is! I come all the way out from LA just because I'm craving Phil's BBQ...and I bring all my friends! They're always skeptical because of the long wait that can take anywhere up to an hour or two during dinner hours. It's crazy but so worth it. The meat is so tender and falls right off the bones. You can't go wrong ordering anything here. My favorite sides are the coleslaw and the bake beans! yum yum yum. It's worth every penny. This should be a tourist destination! They even have the Phil's cam live online which is pretty cool. I also enjoy the people there. Last time I went I was talking to the lady who was controlling the line. She was talking about the QVC channel and still made it funny somehow. The atmosphere is always busy and you can see how much everyone is enjoying their food because everyone leaves their inhibitions at home and pigs out eating with their hands...well at least I do any ways. I feel so at home at Phil's!

After going back a second time I've decided to bump it up another star. I think that their BBQ chicken should pretty much just be ignored because I didn't like it too much the first time I went there and the 2nd time I went there the other people who ordered the chicken didn't really like it either. Just order the BEEFY ribs, all day everyday. It's like the hugest piece of meat ever, and with the barbecue sauce it's basically a giant meat lollipop. Delicious.

If you're in San Diego, you MUST come here. The baby back ribs are TO DIE FOR. Sometimes the wait is long, but I've never been disappointed, even after waiting a long time. The service here is top notch as well. I'm not a big fan of the beef ribs, but many of my friends are, so give that a try if you're game. The best things on the menu (in my humble opinion, of course) are: baby back ribs chicken(both the ribs and chicken meat fall right off the bone and basically melt in your mouth) onion rings (huge battered onion rings) fries (standard, but always good) coleslaw macaroni salad I always get a half baby back rib rack dinner with coleslaw and mac salad. Bathrooms are clean, service is excellent, food is DELICIOUS, what's not to like??

Delicious BBQ!!! Eat here, you won't regret it. Whenever people visit me in San Diego, I ask where they want to go and we always end up at Phils. I've tried almost everything, but my favorites are the baby back ribs and the onion rings. Mmmm good. Be prepared for a line, but frankly, Phil's is always worth the wait...no matter how long the line is.

We ordered 3 beef ribs, 1 baby back rib dinner with a side of fries and potato sald and another small side of onion rings. I loved everything I had here.. I just wish I had another stomach.. yummyyy Thanks to my tour guide... a friend who suggested we must go here, I loved it... With the meal above and 3 ppl to share.. It was more than enough. All of the above was suggested by the worker there and we took her advice. Glad we did. Liked it so much I bought the sauce to go. I just wished I knew if the ribs were smoked or what?? lol =/ but I doubt it.. Soo, overall had a good time here.

Finger-Lickin' Good Typically I usually prefer the veggies over any type of meat (especially nowadays since I have been trying to watch my figure.) However, on this particular Sunday evening, I found that all of my concerns had magically disappeared the moment I stepped out of the car and into the restaurant's parking lot. Instantly, I was surrounded by the aromas of long smoked barbequed meat, mixed together with the sweet and tangy smells of their specialty barbeque sauce. As my friends and I stood in line, (which only took about 15-20 minutes) we were soon to learn that the tantalizing aromas were not the only teaser that Phil's had in store for us. With each moving step towards the door, our eyes were locked on the plates of ribs, fries, and shredded meat that was easily visible through the large glass windows of the restaurant. It was definitely a predator and prey moment, bringing out our deeply buried animal instincts. This restaurant is well aware of its effects, luring in outsiders like us who drove about an hour to satisfy our barbeque cravings. Every second leading up to the moment we placed our orders, contributed to our selfish desires to want to consume more than we could handle. Surprisingly, with the help of two guys and three girls weighing in at about 100 pounds each, we were able to finish our meal of pork baby back ribs, fries, coleslaw, baked beans, corn on the cob, and the Flintstone-sized beef ribs. However, the last bite shared between Diana and I definitely pushed us over the top. The drive home was an agonizing one, each stomach filled to its capacity with pig and cow. (Sigh) What a wonderful experience....

Okay, let's be honest. If you live in SD (or visit) and you like BBQ you are doing yourself a major disservice by not eating at Phil's. SHAME ON YOU! If BBQ makes you and your tummy happy consider this the Disney World of BBQ (in San Diego) so strap in, equip yourself with a bib, and wear that BBQ sauce proudly.

the old place in Hillcrest was more conducive to a pre-meal curbside hotboxing session.  The hugeness and franchise-sports bar look of the new location speaks volumes on how popular Phil's has gotten.  You can go there for lunch on any given day and find a line out the door (if you're ordering for pick-up it's best to call them to place an order, for easy pickup.) If you're a seasoned bbq connoisseur then Phil's won't get you especially worked up, but as far as bbq in san diego go...it's an accessible spot (read: you don't have to drive to the hood to eat) with all the modern conveniences (espn-hd, local microbrews,) and although it's been given the wal-mart treatment and a dude taking a rip off the bubbler in the parking lot has become an activity less unlikely to be seen, the food is still pretty good. except the onion rings. it's like eating an onion covered in mummy.  i don't like when my side dishes taste like king tut. i saw an old friend, big mig aka the chupacabra there eating the beefy ribs with a side of onion rings.  He validated my claim by saying, "don't order the onion rings. they is nasty." there you go.

I went here with four of my buddies and we spent the whole meal in silence I think because we were savoring how good it was! There can be a really long wait outside but it goes by really fast, and once you get inside, you realize it was all worth it.  The prices are the most reasonable I have seen for barbeque and its just delicious.  You just have to try it to be in the same boat as me I guess. Everything seems fresh as well.  When you usually order coleslaw or potato salad with barbeque, it seems like you already know what it will taste like, but I think they make it all fresh here, in house, which is a really nice treat.   I loved it and and I can't wait to go back. Awesome. WOO HOO! Nice.

The food is great, the price is fair, and the environment is satisfying. If the food provided me with the daily nutrition I required, I'd probably eat ribs and fries everyday all day. RECOMMENDATIONS: If you've got a large appetite like myself, get the beef rib dinner with fries and coleslaw or the mac salad. I'm definitely a fan of the beef ribs over the the baby back ribs. Fries are a must, especially because they're an entirely different style and caliber from that of standard fast food joint fries. I prefer the coleslaw for the mac purely because I feel like the mac salad is probably worse (health-wise) than the slaw. If you have a smaller appetite, you can't really go wrong with any of their other menu items except the chickless chicken. I advise against the chickless chicken because it's rather dry and unappetizing. ATMOSPHERE: The staff here is very helpful and friendly. There is no outdoor seating, but pretty ample seating inside. The line to get in can get upwards of an hour wait, but I would suggest to call for take-out if you can't stand the wait. The side portion sizes are smaller if you get your meal to-go, but the time you save is worth it. WHY FOUR? Honestly, with the exception of the fries, I really wish that Phils BBQ provided larger sides. The amount that the sides cost for the amount you get is cutting fairness pretty close, but at least the entrée makes up for it. The wait can be a turn-off and has caused me to look elsewhere for casual dining, but it's all good if you have a place you can take your food to go. Also, vegetarian options are limited to purely sides, but it's a barbecue joint that focuses on ribs, so I'd say try  somewhere else if you can't eat the meat. CONCLUSION: If money and health weren't an issue, I'd probably try to eat at Phils BBQ at least every other day; but this is coming from a rib lover. -TanK

With so may reviews no one will read this...I really don't care. I need to add my 2 cents. This place has simple fare. It is just simply good. Phil knows how to slow smoke Beef, Pork, and Chicken. His sides taste excellent and accompany the meals perfectly. The blues playing over the speakers just make the experience even better. I've tried almost everything on the menu. Hell even the veggie burger...which is great by the way. I'm a big guy and typically have a big appetite to match it. However, I always end up with leftovers due to the portion sizes. Phil's is just great the next day for lunch. I can't tell you if there is anything that is bad at this place. Pros: Best Bar-B-Q in San Diego, You can not miss this place if you have visitors from out of town. Order the best of both worlds (Beef ribs and chicken or Pork ribs and chicken) Mac salad + Cole slaw That is a solid 1st timers choice Cons: This place gets packed everyday. The wait on the weekend can be as long as 2 hours. Get there before or after the lunch rush and you should be okay. There are no food choices that suck here. Hope this helps the yelpers out there. Enjoy your culinary adventures, Francis

Only the best BBQ place on the West Coast!  Please don't fret if you get there and the line is wrapped around the corner - it's way worth the wait and at least you don't have to wait days before getting food like many 3rd world countries.   If you don't want to wait in line you can try to sneak in and go sit at the bar where you can order right from the bar tender.  The pork ribs are my favorite, the meat just slips off them bones faster then your prom dates dress!  Props to the Onion Rings too, some of the best!  If you have out of town visitors treat them to some BBQ they'll never forget!

Phil's BBQ, do you really need ANOTHER 5-star Yelp review? Well, okay. Here it is. *FIVE* stars. Their baby back ribs are some of the tastiest I've had. And the sides? All very good too! The wait is insanely long 98% of the time but like I tell everyone...it's going to be so worth it, just wait and see! Your legs will be mad but your belly will be happy. It all works out in the end. And once you do finally get your order in, you get your food in no time -- maybe 5 minutes max.

Phil's BBQ is by far the best Barbeque available in San Diego. The lines waiting outside can wrap around almost half the building, but it goes by pretty quickly. Their macaroni salad is very delightful, and of course the ribs were a hit. Very filling, and tasty. Always down to get some Phillys

OVERRATED - ribs are only ok CONS: - Impossible wait times (20mins+ just to PAY for take-out, 1.5hr for table) - Impossible lines - Ribs are VERY SOUR (the sauce) - NO PARKING EVER (cars circle and circle) - Bad elements and cops hover Try Mo's BBQ Ribs from San Luis Obispo and Pismo Beach. Or order the sauce from their website yourself. It KILLS Phil's. If Mo's was in San Diego, Phil's would be out of business. Mo's is softer, moister, sweeter and yummier (with 4 DIFFERENT rib sauces to choose from).

How did I live in San Diego for 2 years and not discover Phils?  I dont know, but I wish I knew about this place while I lived in SD because I'd probably be here twice a month.  This place is awesome.  Best BBQ I've had hands down.  I had the full rack of baby back ribs with fries and baked beans.  The ribs and beans were amazing.  Fries were ok...but I wasnt here for the fries.  oh yeah...fountain drinks are refillable for free.

3 words. Finger Licking Good. 3 more words. Wear a bib. 3 more words. Cheap. Fun. Fabulous. Waiting in line can be taxing on the tummy, especially when you re starving, but its definitely worth the wait.  There is nothing artificial in the taste...no liquid smoke flavoring here... Price is reasonable and the door woman is hilarious, she is like the black momma Ive always wanted.

Visited this place for the first time over the weekend during dinner time.  Definitely a bad idea because there was a huge line out the door for the establishment.  However a long line usually means the place is good, right? We ordered the full rack of baby back ribs, the broham sandwich, large onion rings, small mac salad, small bbq beans. The onion rings were HUGE.  They were quite tasty, and very crunchy.  Mac salad and the bbq beans tasted average.  The baby back ribs tasted good, I think it tasted better than lucille's.  The broham sandwich tasted very smokey and the pulled pork was juicy, however the juicyness tasted more like it held too much water than pork juices, so wasn't as good as I hoped. Overall a good experience.

Saw the HIGH ratings on Yelp PLUS the hotel clerk said to try this place out I phoned in an order and picked it up to eat in my hotel. When yelpers say this place is BUSY ... ok THIS place is BuSY!!!! If I waited to dine in, it would have been a 2 hour wait.  All I did was PICK UP the food and that took 40 minutes.  NOT BECAUSE the food wasn't ready.  The food WAS READY!  It was sitting on the counter all bagged up waiting for me.  Just the LINE TO PAY and PICK UP the food was 40 minutes long.  But hey, this is one way to socialize and talk with people. So be prepared to wait if you want to eat/order here. And I went at 6PM on a Sunday night. Why the 4 stars? The pepper.  EVERYTHING had pepper in it.  My 2 year old toddler couldn't eat anything because it was so peppery.   * Baby Back Ribs - EXTREMELY tender and scrumptious.  Just too much pepper.   * Sweet Beans - Very sweet and delicious ... too much pepper. * Cole Slaw - Tasted fresh ... but too much pepper. * Ceasar Salad - Super fresh ... but too much pepper. * Onion Rings - SUPER HUGE ... didn't think onions could be so big.  LOVED IT.  No pepper!  YAY! If you are a PEPPER lover, this place is for you! Unfortunately I'm not a fan of all that pepper so as much as I LOVED the baby back ribs I'll have to pass on this restaurant.

This has to be one of the best bbq places I have ever been to. Their ribs are amazing! They fall right off the bone and aren't fatty at all. The bbq sauce is also amazing. Lastly, I enjoy the onion rings! They are great dipped in ranch and bbq sauce. There is usually a big wait here so come early or come late to miss the lines!

Came at 6pm on a Saturday on a friend's recommendation and didn't know what to expect. Holy cow! The line was out the door, around the corner, and down the length of the restaurant. I've never in my life seen such a line for a BBQ place. We didn't get to sit down and eat until right after 7:30pm. I guess it was worth the wait to get ribs that just melt in your mouth, but only once in a blue moon can I stand that line. Coming from Texas, I love my BBQ, so I'm glad Phil's stuck with ribs and didn't try to make brisket and sausage. I've been disappointed in every BBQ joint in California in the past 7 years. Phil's is best BBQ in California that I've found so far!

Yummy in my tummy! Got here a little before noon and the line was out the door as usual.  But it was flowing nicely so that was good, I really liked how they put up all the menu's so you can figure out what to order while you're waiting.... instead of having to squint at the board when you get close to the front of the line.   for 3 people, we ordered: -Full rib dinner w/ side of Macaroni salad (the meat was very tender and falls off the bones) -Broham Sandwich (this is my favorite-toasted bread covered with a HUGE serving of cole slaw and pulled pork shoulder drenched with sauce) -side of sweet baked beans (this is probably one of my favorite sides here, even though the full portion doesn't seem like a "full size" because they didn't fill it up this time ... that was kinda shady.   I think this is the best bbq join in SD so far... I would have -1 star because they forgot our order this time... and we had to wait for over 25 minutes but when I went to check on the order, the manager gave it to me immediately.  So this was the first time something went screwy.   I think it was because they were overwhelmed with the celebration of their 10 years anniversary,   because the food is so consistently delicious, Phil's bqq deserves 5 stars... my mouth is watering just thinking about it... YUMS! I still "heart" you Phil's bbq

Portions were smaller than i had thought it would be.  The Baby back ribs did not taste like baby back ribs.  In fact, it tasted like ordinary ribs.   Note, This place may be haunted.  Standing in line while ordering, the server had placed a cup directly in front of my girlfriend and I.  Suddenly, without any warning or provocation, the cup went flying at the sever and bounced off the cabinet behind her.  Surprised (both the server and I) we looked at each other and confirmed with each other what we just saw.  Wow is all i got to say.  Pretty freaky....... In all, i give it a 3 star.  Some wait time and small portion just did not cut it for me.  Be scared by angry ghosts did not do well either.

I am not a big BBQ fan.  But after watching Paula Dean quest to find the best BBQ, it made my hubby and I crave BBQ.   It was our first time there but for sure it won't be the last.  The line wraps around the building. That is the sign of GOOD bbq restaurant.  We met a nice family in front of us (Thanks John and your cool mom).  They gave us all the dirt on what to order.  We had the full baby back ribs and a side of fries...  hands down this is the best BBQ i had ever had.  I am officially a BBQ fan thanks to my man Phil.  The baby back ribs are so good...it gave my hubby a RIB-gasm. Trust me...this is the place to go.  Phil's BBQ not only has great food, but also outstanding service.

Do not go here if you have plans in the next couple hours. You will be bombed out after eating Phil's! We always comment that we need to go lie on a hot rock, like lizards, after filling our bellies with ribs, chicken, more ribs, beer, and ribs! Long lines, but they do move quickly. Although it's not a full sit-down full service restaurant, servers do come around to see if you need anything. They are always so kind. The ribs here are ridiculously good; I love the baked potato side, as well as the fries. I only made the mistake of getting the chicken one time. Not that it's not good, but why waste time with chicken when you can have more ribs? mmm...ribs...

The BBQ Broham pulled pork sandwich is unlike any other I have ever had. The coleslaw at Phil's is perfectly sweet and crunchy. I can't help but devour every morsel of food on my plate, and that is a LOT of food. The fries aren't my favorite, but the beans, corn, veggies, etc etc are WONDERFUL. And the pulled pork... mmmhmmmm. Get a side of sauce. Maybe two.

I first tried Phil's BBQ back in January and have been in love ever since!  I visit San Diego so that I can pay a visit to Phil's.  (Don't tell my SD friends that!)  Sure, the line is always too long, but it's a part of the experience of eating at Phil's!  I should actually thank Phil's for forcing my friends and I to play ridiculous games like "Never Have I Ever" where we've learn way too much about each other.   The food never disappoints.  I usually get the beefy ribs tickler which is a steal for how much food you get!  I've also tried the chicken and the pork ribs but I love cow.  The meat is always tender and moist and is slathered in their bbq sauce.  Even their sides are good!  The potato salad is my favorite.  Yesterday when I went, we even got Cesear salad.  It was actually refreshing to see some green on my plate!  I also can't get enough of their onion rings!!!  The food at Phil's is so awesome, they give you bibs and wet wipes.  Let's just say that when we left yesterday, my friend still had some bib on her.  *sigh* Until next time...

Believe the hype. This is surely the best BBQ in town, arguable best BBQ this side of I-35. Yes, if you come here during popular eating times, you will wait. A while. But you will be rewarded my friend with all the barbecuey goodness your little mind can handle. Strap in taste buds, things are about to real. I am a fan of the quarter chicken and quarter rib combo with the steamed veggies, its the only way to get a good helping of meat and not walk away feeling like you just swallowed a volkswagen. Eat at Phil's.

I'm not a big meat eater.. so it took me a few years after living in San Diego to try Phil's BBQ. Stood in line for over an hour and ran around the restaurant for a place to sit for another 15 min. Yes the ribs are really good. The bbq sauce is delicious and thier onion rings are extra crunchy. this restaurant is obviously popular for a reason and definately one of the must go places in san diego.. but for the 1.5 hour wait and price? minus 1 star for me!

This place is amazing! The BBQ is one of the best I've ever had and the sides (coleslaw, potato salad) are the perfect compliments; light, crispy, and super, super yummy. The onion rings are amazing! They are so sweet and come in huge portions. My only regret was that I was not hungry enough to finish it all, and so I bought it home only to find it devoured before I could get my leftovers. Doesn't matter; I will be back next time I'm in San Diego! Yes, the line can look long, but it flows by relatively fast. They are extremely efficient as it is. Service is outstanding too!

Phil's BBQ = awesome. As most in San Diego know, Phil's is pretty much the standard for top notch BBQ, and when I went yesterday, I was not disappointed. I got a rack of baby back ribs, and two sides. The ribs were fantastic, fall off the bone, slathered in sauce. Mmm.... Their BBQ baked beans are a little different tasting than normal baked beans.. maybe some sort of BBQ secret? good stuff. Cole slaw was pretty standard. I had a bite of a beef rib as well, and it was tasty... but i'll stick to the baby back ribs. Their awesome sauce will have you licking your fingers. Glad to have them in the Sports Arena location as the Goldfinch spot was too small, and the wait for food seemed too long.

Sure, you can be a dainty little lady and pick at the meat with your fork. Or you can be a PHIL and eat with your hands, ultimately getting a drop or nine of the delicious sauce on your clothes. Me? I'm a Phil kinda girl. I'm also the smarty that accidently wipes her hands on her pants. Hate waiting in lines? INSIDER TIP: If the line is too long for you to stand and you'd rather go home, go grab a menu and phone in your order. You can then skip the line that goes around the building, walk in to the left of it, and pick up your order. The food is the same caliber by the time you get home anyways - just be sure to vent the fries during the ride! Baby back or beef - it doesn't matter. They're both fall-off-the-bone bits of heaven. Grab a side of potato salad to alleviate the flavor in your mouth. I wont go on about the food - it's clearly evidenced in the surrounding Phil's BBQ reviews. Dig in and eat!

Wow, seems like everyone knows about Phil's, especially if you live in San Diego.  Took some family members to eat here and they raved about Phil's.  The line was short on a Friday evening at 7:30PM it was only 20 minutes.  There was live music to keep you company while you wait in line.  While we were in line the Phil's staff came up to us giving us fries to sample...and boy were they tasty.  Nice way to lure people in :) So you wait in line to order, then you get your own seat and then you go pick up your food...kind of like a cafeteria style.  They had plenty of t.v's around with games on, we were watching the Lakers in teh playoffs :).   Anyhow we all ordered the pork baby back ribs, having fries, corn and coleslaw.  Their ribs were juicy, tender and tasty, the fries are amazing and the prices were so great for what you get. Getting the bang for your buck!  If you like bbq you would love Phil's.  I can see why there's a long wait.

Phil's BBQ - the day there isn't a line is the day when it probably closed down for whatever reason. At around 11am, we drove past this restaurant and there was a line, when we actually came back on Sunday at 5pm, there was a line which lasted an hour, when we finished eating and walked out, there was a line which was a bit longer than the 5pm line, and even at 8:30pm on a Sunday night, there was still a semi-line out the door. All I can say is, good job Phil's! My family and my brother's friends came here to celebrate the end of his bodybuilding competition, and we sure celebrated in style. A whole cow and half a pig as well as a few chicken were probably killed that day in honor of us. We needed a table of ten and the workers there were very nice and accommodating. Since it was my first time there, I wasn't sure if they were always like this, or if they were afraid to mess with all these big looking bald dudes. Regardless, the service was great. We tried a bit of everything - beef ribs, baby back ribs, chicken, onion rings, cole slaw, fries (which are surprisingly good for just regular fries) and potato salad. I don't think I have an absolute favorite since everything is pretty dang good, and the price was dang good as well. Even though there was still a line out the door after we were done eating and just sitting due to food coma, the workers did not ask us to leave... again, I wasn't sure if they're just like that to big groups or because there were some intimidating looking guys there. We got a bottle of "Phil's BBQ Sauce" because we answered a question correctly, the worker said it was because we ordered lots of party platters and they just wanted to throw in a little freebie for answering the questions "What city did we originate from?" (answer: Cleveland) correctly. Although the wait was horrendously long, it's well worth it. While waiting in line, they have those signs like Disneyland, "You are 21 minutes away from the front of the line".... awesome! Oh, and it was also featured on the travel channel.

There are 3 things in the world that I have been known to drop anything for: 1) A friend in need. 2) A last minute trip to Vegas. 3) Phil's mother effin' BBQ. I remember walking by this place when it was a small 1 door place in hillcrest. I smelled something good and wasn't terribly hungry... but I decided to grab some food anyways. As they say, "The rest is history." To me, Phils BBQ can't even be compared to other rib or bbq places because it's not even fair. Tony Roma's is good, Outback is nice, Brett's BBQ is decent... but Phil's? It is in it's own category. My usual is a full rack of ribs (pork of course) with coleslaw and fries or a corn on the cob. Their potato salad is also amazing... Actually, you know what, I've never had anything bad here, ever. I am not going to attempt to describe what it tastes like. Nothing I can type, nothing you can read, will do justice to how this food tastes. There is almost always a deceptively huge line out front, but it moves fast. The wait staff keeps busy so everyone gets a seat in a short amount of time, and they have buzzers if you are dining in. Writing this review makes me want to go back and take every other 5 star review I've ever written and make it a 4 star review because Phil deserves 6 stars... Added bonus: He actively endorses local non-profits. I am a Big Brother with the Big Brothers Big Sisters of San Diego County and Phil Pace (owner of Phil's BBQ) put on a huge BBQ/Padres game event for all the Bigs and their Little's!

One of the better bbq places I have been to. They serve chicken, beef ribs, baby back ribs, and pulled beef sandwiches that are smothered in their signature bbq sauce that can be purchased at san diego costcos. Anyways I got the baby back ribs full rack dinner for $21. The ribs were fall off the bone texture and the bbq sauce was very rich in flavor. (the strongest bbq flavor i have ever tasted). Although I got the full rack, it seemed it was still not enough. The dinner also came with 2 sides. I got the baked beans and potato salad. They were both adequate carb fillers to make me almost full. My friends also got onion rings and french fries which I might add were both very good and crunchy and worth trying. They also have separate hand wash stations not in the bathroom for customer convenience. This place can also get very busy and they do not open on mondays. Bottom line: Worth trying and one of the better bbqs that ive been to.

HANDS DOWN THE BEST BBQ EVER...!!! I'm never speechless, and that's all I can say.  Insane texture, smoke ring, tenderness & of course taste.  I hate overly sweet tasting bbq sauce too, that's NOT what you get at Phils!  I just have to say try it...and pick your favorite side...I've tried them all with our large group and I didn't dislike anything.  The onion rings too are a must! TRY IT ALL!!!  THANK PHIL'S, I'll BE BACK.  MAYBE TONIGHT!!!

Definitely go here before the mad rush times.  I cant believe people are willing to wait in line for even 2 hrs just to eat. However,  I can understand why they would. The food is decently priced for the portioning. The meat is pretty fresh and large portions.  My favorite sides were the beans and the onion rings!  They were Delish! My mom said it was reminiscent of her times she went to restaurants in Texas.   This place is definitely the place to be for meet lovers, especially the Ribs.

I have one less reason to go to Texas now.... why?! Because I've found a place where their is no other close competitor that comes close to this joint's smokin', gimme gimme more flavored kind of BBQ around this hood. After reading a multitude of reviews of this restaurant and ravings from my fellow foodie friends, I finally decided to make a trip down to SD just to see what the hype was all about. So why am I writing a review even though there's already 1,000 + reviews from die-hard Phil's BBQ fans?! So that I can further contribute to Phil's rating and vouch for this place, hands up. It's crazy crazy good! I'll cut to the chase. Here are my picks: 1) Big Bone Beef Ribs- a MUSTTTTT. I personally preferred these over the classic baby back ribs since the former was way more fork-tender, fall of the bone kind of ribs compared to the latter. I also preferred the sweet, fresh BBQ sauce on this rib compared to the somewhat tangier and sour-er sauce on the baby backs. Did I mention that there's also TONSSSS of meat so that's always a plus!!! Who doesn't like MORE of awesomeness?! 2) ONION RINGS- i was nomming happily and eying the last onion ring the whole meal. That's how much of a fatso and how delicious these things were! Addicting crunch and flavorful, going well sans or w/ ranch dressing. Perfecto!!!! 3) BBQ Chicken-Bok bok! This Chicken was deeelicious! Tender, juicy (even the white mean was delightful) and full of mmm mmmm BBQ sauce glazed over the skin! Next time though, I'll pass on the corn on the cob as it was nothing special. In addition to the good spankin' food, despite the bustling sea of human ants, the service was wonderful! On my visit, the cashier forgot to charge me for an order of fresh cut fries. Since I realized this after I got seated, I went up to the front to notify someone of my sad receipt that was lacking of "fries" and to my surprise, instead of standing in the super long line to re-order and pay for my fries, they kindly apologized and gave me a large side on the house! Free food= happy customers! They know how to make us happy indeed. Lucille's will never taste the same again, friends.

I liked my experience here and the food part did live up to the hype. However, I'm not sure I would wait for over an hour to get food here. I think waiting that long anywhere for food is crazy. I had a total of 3 people in my party and we ordered one dinner portion of the Ribless Meat with a large side of french fries as well as a small portion of their spring mix salad with chicken. Ribless Meat: FREAKIN' DELICIOUS! So good. The sauce was just enough and tasted wonderful. Fries: yummy! Goes great with the cajun seasoning and bbq sauce. They taste natural and fresh. Salad: boring. The chicken breast that came with it was a little dry and I didn't enjoy that too much. All that was enough to feed 3 girls. We weren't super hungry, but that left us stuffed. I'd have to say that the portions are HUGE, so dinners can probably be shared between 2. My biggest gripe about this place is the ordering/food pick up/table situation. Otherwise it would've been 5 stars. I can't imagine coming here with a big party and looking for a table to sit us all. I guess this system makes turnaround time quick and would be suitable for parties of 6 or less. I'd definitely stop by again at a non peak hour just to have more of their delicious and tender bbq meats!! Yum!

I didn't have to wait in a long line! What's my secret? Going for an early lunch Sunday around 11am. Ordered the Full Baby Back Rib Dinner (comes with 2 sides) with fries and baked beans. Perfect for sharing between 2 people (especially for lunch!) The BBQ sauce is so good! Just a little sweet and a bit tangy. Perfect! The ribs were very good, except the last few that had bits of dryness. The fries tasted like they were cut from fresh potatoes and taste great smothered in Phil's BBQ sauce. Baked beans were equally good and completed my "dinner" for lunch.

Definitely a must try when you're in the SD area. Ordered el toro's tri-tipped beef, beefy ribs, best of both (chicken and baby back ribs), side of fries and macaroni salad. we ordered way too much, and lets just say one plate is good for two people. I'm not much of a barbecue sauce fan, but everything was soo good.  There was plenty of bbq sauce.   HELLA long ass wait though.. (we were really hungry). Self service type of restaurant too, order, get your stuff & eat. 4-stars (sorry, took one off for the long wait...)

I put the 'ass' in embarrassment.  I started dancing in front of the PhilCam while on the phone with my hubby: "Do you see me now?"  NOW, do you see me?" I kept asking as I did crazy dance moves that look like dry heaves set to music*.  After awhile, the guy herding the very long line started to join me.  We looked like we were engaged.  I was only picking up food to go because the line snaked out the door and went on longer than I cared to wait for.   The bbq ribs were tender and juicy, the chicken was only eh--a little on the dry side--loved the potato salad.  They sell the sauce and dry rub so I had to have me some of that too..  Cheap eats, great ambience and solid service from friendly staff.  There's no good time to come here for short lines except if you're wanting to eat dinner at 4:30 so just come with a good attitude, hang out, do your little happy dance in front of the PhilCam.   *tm, George Costanza.

There's great debate whether Phil's is REAL BBQ. I don't know if it is, but I do know it's delicious. And the super long lines on the weekend prove that others think so to. I usually get a full baby back rib dinner with fries and whatever other side I feel like. You GOTTA get the fries. They're great under the ribs soaking up the sauce. Pro-tip: If you don't want to wait in line, go for an early lunch or call it in for to go and eat in the parking lot. That line is crazy, they even have a webcam for it.

I'm gonna make this short and simple: best bbq joint in the planet! Expect a long line! because this place is just that great, and get here early, or get lucky maybe the line will move faster who knows. The ribs: amazing! made tender, well marinaded, add creole seasoning and vinegar for added flavor, bomb! The sides: colossal onion rings with batter dip let it ooze those rings! Are you full? then great! you just had the best bbq in the land i don't need to say more.

Came back here for a second time to try out the same sandwich I got last time and it tasted a lot BETTER! The manager came over to our table to see how our food was tasting and explain to us why my other sandwich tasted so bad. But I'm glad I got to try it again. This time it was good. I also tried some of the ribs and they were amazing. I recommend getting the ribs over the Broham Sandwich. Thanks Fred!

Phil's BBQ is awesome! I'm not the type of person who craves BBQ but when I do, the only place to go in San Diego for delicious BBQ is Phil's. Lines.. there is always a line but what 's great about Phil's is that they have a webcam online so you can see how busy it is. Plus.. even if there is a line, the line goes quick because they are crankin' the BBQ one order after another. Seating is a pain sometime, but it'swell  worth it. I love the "el toro" and the "broham". F'in amazing, can't go wrong with the two. ALSO! The price is not bad at all! especially for quality BBQ! DELICIOUS!!

Need I say more. This by far is the best BBQ in San Diego! Whatever you order here is on point and If you're looking to grub come with an empty stomach! I love their El Toro sandwich which is boneless pulled pork with their amazing BBQ sauce. I add tobasco sauce to it to spice it up! Can't really taste their bread but its perfect because the BBQ drowns it out. They have a bar you can sit at or you can fall in the long lines for a good 45-1hr and sit down.  They also have pick up which is great. Their ribs are to die for, their macaroni salad is the best in SD and I love their greasy fries and onion rings.  Their Veggies on the side are also great and I love going there and chowing down with a beer! Very busy staff but very courteous. Can't wait til it reopens, went there when they were renovating and they were closed, so dissapointed that me and my family drove ALL the way to San Marcos and ate at the new one. It'll get 5 stars eventually. Them being closed and not knowing about it just hurt my feelings there for a bit. LOL

This place is bomb diggity!!! I ordered the beef ribs and man they were really big (that's what she said). I got three ribs with coleslaw and mac salad as my side. I had also ordered for my friends and I a side of Onion rings I believe that they are beer batter onion rings. To sum everything up since everyone had said what I was going to say. This place is a must.

Eat this kind of food for a couple of years and you are guaranteed to get a heart attack or some other disease. What is so special about this place??? It has huge lines and cheap American BBQ. If not for my group of friends, I would never step inside this place! I have to admit that it tastes good, but come on! The food is not only about taste. Besides, standing in line for over 30 minutes to this place is just ridiculous.

There's not much left to say after 2278 reviews...but here i go anyways :P Shared the full dinner, perfect amount of food for 2 ppl! I gotta admit the meat is really delicious here, so tender and falls off the bones like it should. The BBQ sauce on the other hand is just ok, I've had better...Now oddly here is what I love the most: the mac salad. SOO GOOD! I even got a large to go because I loved it so much. A large side is only $2.25! The onion rings are good too. Get them if you have some people to share it with. The staff here is nice and they get an extra point for giving us free onion rings. They initially took them back but gave them to us anyways thanks to vinh h :) I'd love to come here again but I don't think I will put up with a 1hr wait...or maybe i'll just buy the macaroni salad to go :P

if heaven has a BBQ cafeteria...let it be phills bbq please! I've been told by couple of people that i need to stop by here while in SD...and the first time i stopped by, the line was long out the wazoo!  I didnt wanna wait and my stomach was already beating me for starving it.  Went back for lunch and it was still long but not as bad....and i was told NOT TO FEAR THE LINE...and correct they stand because the line went by pretty fast....not 20 minutes but good enough. So newsflash!  Phils BBQ isnt like a wait on service where someone takes your order, you order at a counter and you find a table yourself...you get your plates and drinks yourself but they do come around every so to ask how you're doing...just FYI So they have two type of ribs....beef and baby back (pork) and for those who love chicken like i do, they also have chicken too...but im here for ribs! BRING IT ON!  We got the full rack baby back ribs, with fries and macroni salad and two beef ribs samplers.....and trust me...its enough!!  Did i mention sodas are unlimited...heaven!  By recommendation from a friend, go with the small sides because they give you a lot!!!  so much fries!! Get ready to get dirty!! I tried the beef first...and when they said sampler...they should really say a half rack,....it was big!  it's so moist and juicy but the top is also very charred.  It does have a lot of fat but it def helps with the moistness and juices!  I went on to the baby backs and i fell in love.  The pork is smoked in its own meaty flavor and slaughter with the infamous bbq sauce....did i mentioned that we got extra on the side cause i sure love the bbq sauce and im so AHHHH happy that it was free on the side =D.  You can taste the porkiness but its doesnt overwhelm when added with the bbq.  I even mixed the macroni salad with it and its heaven.! Please move to SF, phils bbq....PLEASE...i miss your baby backs!

Firstly: Phil's is good. Secondly: You will have to wait in line. Now that those are out of the way, allow me to elaborate:  Phil's business model basically has you wait in a God-awfully long line for up to a couple hours, order at a counter, and then fight for a seat so you can eat when your food is ready.  It's worth it, but only just...and I'd never go there when the wait is over, say, half an hour.  When they're busy, this model lets you basically wait, order, and eat, and someone else to do the same right after you.  The timing works, but at the same time it's not the most pleasant experience... Everyone raves about Phil's food.  It's good, and I'm defintiely a fan.  Still, they can be a little skimpy on the BBQ sauce, and the fries aren't great.  I'm also not ga-ga over their sauce, like some peolpe are...and they can be a little skimpy with it anyways (but, if you go ask for more, you can get it.  I think they're supposed to charge you, but they didn't for me on Sunday, so whatever...I'll take it...) The ribs are good, as is the pulled pork sandwhich.  Both are really tender and super filling.  The steak sandwich, chicken, and baked beans are all okay--the chicken especially depends on how much sauce you put on it.  As I said above, the fries suck...so maybe get a small one until you're sure of it. Parking can be a hassle, but the staff is always really friendly.  I'd say, if you can manage it, you're better off calling in your order, picking it up, and taking it elsewhere to eat (the beach is only a few minutes away!).  Phoning in means you get to skip the queue...so consider it the next time you're at Phil's.

OMG!  Phil's BBQ has the best baby back ribs.  Their BBQ sauce was sweet, not tart at all.  It's just the way I like my BBQ sauces.  The meat was tender and slid right off the bones.  It was just perfect.  I had a chicken and baby back rib plate to share with my daughter.  We could chose two sides so we chose fries and mac salad.  My daughter loves mac salad, but she didn't prefer it.  But Phil's is not known for their mac salads, it's known for their BBQ and the ribs, she loved it.  An added bonus was the cajun spice seasoning for the fries.  It was a right addition.  If you are ever in San Diego, stop by Phil's BBQ.  Trust me, you'll have a great meal.  Finger-licking good meal.

Go for the baby back or beefy ribs. I personally prefer the baby back but really, both are great! You will be blown away by the smoky flavor and the tender, juicy meat. I like getting the tickler size because it is just the right portion for me. I also love that Phil's makes it so easier to clean up the mess (big sinks, paper towels, wipes, etc) so there is no inconvenience in picking up the ribs with your hands. Expect a long wait (45 minutes to an hour)  especially on Saturday evenings. If you want to skip the wait, do a phone order and take the ribs home.

Phil's BBQ is to authentic BBQ as Taco Bell is to authentic Mexican food. Phil's needs to lay off the fake smoke flavoring and try actually smoking their ribs with a decent dry rub and not swamp their ribs with sauce to make up for the lack of flavor. I am from the south where BBQ is a staple, and this is a pathetic excuse for BBQ. If Phil's were to ever enter their BBQ at Memphis in May, they would be laughed out of town. If you want real BBQ, try Felix's BBQ with Soul.

I went here last week with my friends and I have been wanting to try this place for forever now. I was so excited to eat here that i starved myself before this so i can pig out here. My friends and I got here at about 4 o clock, which was the perfect time because we did not have to wait at all. I got the 1/2 baby back ribs with fries and macaroni salad. The food came out super fast and the macaroni salad was really good, but the fries were whatever. I also sampled my friend's food and the beef ribs were really good too. It was more than enough food for me. I will definitely come back here again. This is one of  the best bbq that I've ever  had and its pretty cheap compared to other BBQ places. Just make sure you come early so you don't have to wait forever in line. It gets super busy here.

I've been a fan for years, but hadn't been to the Sports Arena location since they opened (though I've been the beneficiary of several take out orders). Picking up some paint across the street at Home Depot tonight, I realized that it was my big chance to visit the new establishment. Phoned in an order while my paint was mixing, and proceeded to cruise by about 100 (no exaggerating) people that were waiting in line to dine in. Straight to the counter and picked up dinner for the family, and right back past the saps waiting in line. I don't know why it tickles me so, but I love to do this at Fillipi's in Little Italy as well. Long story short (if that's still a possibility), this place is the best San Diego's got, and they've certainly built this iteration to scale. It's huge, and from what I witnessed tonight, amazingly well thought out. There must have been 12 expediters working the counter, and the food was flying out. Quality operation through and through (as evidenced by the fact that they didn't include my onion ring order in the hot window, but rather fired them up when I arrived... nice touch!) Long live Phil's!

I'm feeling a little guilty about some of the negativity in my recent reviews, so I thought I'd re-visit Phil's BBQ for an easy five stars. I have lots of memories of Phil's BBQ, good memories that have been replaced with even better ones. I used to have a regular BBQ partner, and then I didn't, and now I do again! Sweet! Somebody who can put away a massive rack of delicious ribs, somebody to share my love for a side of bomb baked beans and fries slathered in magical BBQ sauce, somebody to entertain me while waiting in the line that sometimes not only stretches out the door, but down the street. I don't know how they do it, but the line really does move quickly, I assure you. There are some places filled with memories that you just can't go anymore, but Phil's is not one of them, for my love for Phil's Ribs and Chickless still burns strong.

Long ass line around the building but smells really good! Long wait for some meaty food. I have to say this was a meat overload dinner. I'm not sure if I quite liked all the food that i had but it was good overall. The beef ribs were huge and tasty. They were filled with fatty, juicy meat that I could eat right now! I don't think the pork ribs were worth it at all. They were too small and too dry for my taste. The onion rings were yummy. The people were nice and attentive. If you don't mind waiting a long time for dinner, then by all means, come here.

The first experience I had with Phil's BBQ, we decided to cut the line and order out instead of waiting. Then we proceeded to drive to the nearest McDonalds to eat our BBQ because we could not wait any longer after smelling the BBQ goodness for a couple minutes. I am pretty sure the families around us were super jealous that we were having an orgasmic eating experience with our baby back ribs while they were eating their fake versions with McRibs. I never change my order. Always baby back ribs!!!! I love eating the fries with the bbq sauce and ranch. OHMYGOSSSSSSH!! The one thing that never changes with Phil's is the quality of the baby back ribs. Tear off the bone, soft, tender goodness. I am always happy afterwards. The only negatives is the other sides are mediocre. I've tried the potato salad, macaroni salad, coleslaw and fries. The only ones worth getting are the fries and coleslaw. The coleslaw is nothing special but it tastes pretty refreshing alongside your fries. The potato and macaroni salad are probably as standard as your regular grocery store brand. I have yet to try the chicken but if you want a good first experience, I do not recommend getting it. If you want a lot of meat, get the beef bones because the amount of meat on the bone is ridiculous. Phil's usually does not skimp on the meat either way. So if you are not a big eater, get half a rack or tickler. I do not think it is worth an hour wait but it is mighty tasty to make me forget I waited an hour.

It has all been said, but I will just add one more compliment from a true southern girl: the barbecue at Phil's is second best only to Bodacious Barbecue in east Texas. If you are in California, Phil's is the best damn barbecue you can find. And the friendly, professional, efficient service just makes it even better. If I could give 10 stars, I would. God bless you, Phil's. I'll be back again and again.

I LOVED THE LONG LINE.  I def. saw like 50 people waiting outside....you know why I loved waiting?  It's usually a good sign that the restaurant is worth waiting for.  I waited like a fatso.  I was drooling...thinking about how good it would be...the wait made me just more excited and hungry for Phil's BBQ. Two thing happen as you get closer to the front of the line.  The killer smell and low prices=WIN WIN WIN. I tried both baby back ribs and beef ribs.  After the first bite of baby back ribs, I heard a small voice from the baby back ribs..."i am the best rib ever...right?  i know you can't ever go back to other ribs."  You think I'm crazy and maybe so...but i'm serious....it's so tender and the smokiness of the rib just knocks you out.  As for the beef ribs, I tend to like my beef ribs a bit fatty so it's less chewy but it was super meaty (i'm not complaining by any means...hehe) Onion rings?  Order it.  Why?  because i said so.  You listen to the fatty and you can't go wrong.  It's huge.  It's juicy.  It's heart attack.   As for the sides, i mean...i tried fries, cole slaw, beans...every single side wowed me.   and my final tip...get more than what you think you can eat....because i promise you that you will kill your dish and would want more.

My first rib experience and a very, very pleasant one. While Phil's is apparently notorious for its line, we were serenaded by a karaoke singer extolling the details of the reasonably-priced Phil's menu as we waited. Inside, the vibe was warm and chummy, with fast and friendly service. Order ribs. Seriously. The chicken is flavorful but the ribs are where it's at. (If you get a full rack, be sure to ask for the sauce on the side unless you want a BBQ sauce overload.) Oh, and definitely wear the plastic bib, complete with catcher. It's part of the experience. (Okay, okay, so the only people in the restaurant wearing bibs were me and my friend. No shame.)

I had heard a lot about this place from my friends every time I would visit San Diego. But for one reason or another I never made time to visit until last Sunday. I got to say it lived up to the hype! The meat on my baby back ribs were tender and fell right off the bone no problem. The BBQ sauce had just enough sweetness to it along with a good Bold kick to it but not to thick or to watery... just right. The cistomer service was friendly and on top of it. I recommend this place to anyone!

Awesome place to come get bbq in SD I can only review the Baby Back Ribs as thats all I ever order,they are SO DELICIOUS that I cant bring my self to order anything else when I go Tender meat, smoked barky crust, Super Tangy BBQ the Fries are always crispy and real, reminiscent of In n Out Fries the Baked beans are a great side too, rich and flavorful ,not cheap and full of bbq like other places. Lines are huge, but believe me its always worth the wait, and while the price is defenitely up there, you gotta pay to play! Not to mention the service is BEYOND impeccable, the servers are incredibly dilligent and polite and help you have a great night. do yourself a favor if you havent already, go to Phils, you wont be dissapointed.

How good is Phil's? I drive all the way down from Laguna Beach to indulge myself in this best execution of Bar-B-Q in Southern California. Having spent considerable time in the South (particularly in Tennessee and the Carolinas) I can quote you BBQ chapter and verse about "red" vs. "yellow" and the histories thereto. I can also wax poetic about the legendary Rogers BBQ in Florence, SC, Calhoun's in Knoxville, TN, and Jerry Poindexter's monumental BBQ of July, 2001 in Franklin, TN--point being, this particular rave review of Phil's comes from authentic BBQ experiences and references. There's few choices for good BBQ in SoCal, so be thankful that there's Phil's, and quit complaining about the line and wait.  Your alternative for BBQ this good is a long plane flight (or an even longer drive) eastward to destinations where you see American cars, sans futile "Kerry/Edwards" bumper stickers still on 'em.

Obesity at it's best. Wash it down with a cold beer and you're good to go. Not for the dainty calorie counter folks for sure.  If you feel like hogging out and gnawing off meat from the bone, then this is heaven. Maybe next time I'll just try the burger. Just be prepared to eat tons and use lots of paper towels. It's next to a swap meet.

A few months ago, I discovered Phil's BBQ on MvF. I tried the 1/2 baby back rib dinner (3 stars), BBQ broham a.k.a pulled pork shoulder sandwich (3.5 stars) and a small order of colossal onion rings (3 stars). The food was good, but my ribs weren't as tender as I'd like them to be. Pork sandwich was half moist and half dry, but the sauce helped. Overall, the service was good, peeps were friendly and things moved along fairly quickly. HELPFUL TIPS - Note for everyone, the portions were ginormous. Bring your appetite. - One dish is sharable for two. - Arrive early to avoid the long waits. - Phil's has a "BBQueue Cam" that provides estimated wait times - Have one person save a table while the other person orders at the counter.

I know the food is great that is why I took senior blind mom there for lunch today.  Our bank is across the street at Point Loma CU. As we entered the door the people in front of  us said please go in front of them to the front of the line.  I was wanting to take a look at the menu behind the counter when  the hostess said have either of you ever been here before and I replayed I have about a year ago have the rules changed?  She said that I was over the line at the door and should be behind it. I said don't make us go to Wendy's and she said if you go over the line again you will go to Wendy's . So we  smiled, left and went to Wendy's . Who needs it I'll go to Brazen closer to home, with less crowd friendlier greetings.

This place will a ruin a healthy diet but it's sooo worth every bite! The Broham and Onion Rings are the way to go for sure. The ribs are great and all, but the Broham has all that BBQ goodness and no bones. I'll admit it, I didnt even LIKE coleslaw before I ate at Phils- but I am humbled by the wonderous sandwich they call The Broham. BBQ shredded beef, peppery colesalw and lotso' sauce on a kaiser roll. Perfection!

This is an incredibly popular (lines of people consistently standing outside) barbecue restaurant that is just west of the Sports Arena on Sports Arena Blvd. They have indoor and outdoor seating but instead of waiter service, you stand in line and place your order then find a place to sit. As is the case for several barbecue restaurants, they have a variety of sides available. For about $2, you can get an ear of fresh roasted corn on the cob that is still in it's husk. While not seasoned, the corn was very good. They offered a couple of salads, a Ceasar and a mixed greens salad. Both were unimaginative and disappointing but reasonably generously portioned. The dressing for the Ceasar was strongly fishy, ruining an already mushy, not particularly appetizing salad. They offered fresh cut french fries that were available in very generous portions. The fries had skin on them but no salt or seasoning and were undercooked and stuck together (incompletely cut). While the fries could have easily been improved just by cooking them longer or using a little bit of seasoning, they were still very good and vastly better than the frozen fries used at most restaurants.

I don't know how to put this but Phil's BBQ is kind of a big deal. Knights Of Columbus!!! The El Toro sliced tri-tip beef sandwich is Phenoficent! (That's  phenomenal and magnificent combined). The real star of the show is the sauce though. it has a sweet, tangy, spice to it that is truly amazing. Ive been to Memphis, Texas and Kansas so Ive had some pretty awesome bbq and this one is up there with the very best. I'm definitely taking a trip to pleasure town again.

Phil's BBQ - A San Diego institution of succulent sauce, tender meat, top-notch service and long lines is one of best-run mass meat markets in the city.  Let's break it down: Food.  Vegetarians need no apply.  Come for the beef and/or pork.  It's good.  It's darn good BBQ. Service.  The management here is excellent.  One one occasion while dining with a co-worker his order mysteriously disappeared and mine was served.  When it was observed that I wasn't eating, an employee first asked if everything was fine; it was, I was just waiting for him.  The employee then noticed the missing order, reviewed the receipt and returned with the food immediately.  And this was on his own volition; we didn't NEED to ask.  That defines excellent service. Wait.  You'll wait in line at Phil's, but it moves fast and is worth the time. Decor.  The large stainless steel tables are move efficient than pleasant.  Same thing with the paper towel rolls -- you'll be glad they are there to use more so than you will enjoy looking at them. Personal recommendation; get the tickler's.  They'll completely fill you up and are some of the cheapest items on the menu.

Finally was able to try this place out! The line was a bit intimidating...we ended up having to wait about an hour...but the BBQREW was more than at friendly and informative we ordered the full rack of baby back ribs that came with either 2 small sides or 1 large side (about $20) and a large order of onion rings (about $5) everything tasted WONDERFUL!!! The ribs were smokey and sauce was great!!!!! BEST ONION RINGS I'VE EVER TASTED! I'm craving for it right now!!! Drinks were $2 free refill everything was kind of self service which I kind of liked...you can refill your drink without waiting for the waiters!

I come here at least once every 2 weeks. I remember one time coming and it was during the dinner rush hours and me and my friends had to wait 2 hours in the cold, but it was SO WORTH IT. It's a definitely must go place since their baby back ribs are renowned. I usually order the half-rack since it's a reasonable $14 and comes with two sides. I always get the macaroni salad, it's like the best thing there IMO =) Not only is the food delicious in every aspect, but the workers there are super friendly. Most of the time they are packed but they cycle through tables really fast and the workers are most willing to help you find a suitable table. Another thing I love about this place is their restroom. Since eating at Phil's is such a messy deed, we all have to go wash our hands. The cool part is, they have the Dyson hand dryers that basically dry your hands in 10 seconds with those powerful bladeless dryers! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Basically, if you're new to the SD area and you're craving something good and top of the line, then Phil's BBQ is the MUST-GO place! I promise you will not regret Phil's BBQ.

Absolutely delicious, though not entirely worth the often too long wait. My favorites are the beef rib dinner, baby back ribs, cole slaw, and macaroni salad. The onion rings are on point but an order, even a small, is often too much due to the amount of accompanying grease. A 3-rib dinner is often enough to guarantee leftovers for breakfast and lunch the next day. In my experience, the chicken was often dry and unmemorable compared to the beef and pork entrees. The prices are extremely reasonable for what you get and the service is always very attentive. Great spot to take guests and wow them.

Not sure it is it worth a LONG wait. I say if the wait is 15-30 minutes its ok. Anything over 30 is not worth it. Tip, go to the bar area to eat and NO WAIT if you can find a table or seats! Servers in this area. Onion rings YUMMY! BBQ was tender.

Tip: pork ribs and pulled pork Everytime I'm in SD, this place must be visited. The wait can be ridiculous but they now serve beer while waiting in line. If you want to avoid the wait, just call in and order for pick up, head to the counter and only wait about 10 minutes for your food. This is what we did. The pork ribs are amazing. The sauce is solid, the sides are good. There's not really much else to say other than. WOW. I did not do the pulled pork this time and went for the beef ribs instead. Extremely tender and almost falls off the bone. This is one of my favorite bbq spots and must be checked out for anyone visiting the SD area.

after a morning/afternoon at seaworld, the boyfriend and i worked up a real appetite and decided to try the much talked about phils bbq. got there around 3:30 and there was no line. well, that's a lie. there was a group of five infront of us but compared to all the other reviews i've read, i can't complain. i got the half rack ribs with coleslaw and baked beans. i rarely ever eat beans a) because they fill you up b) they make you tut, unless that's just a rumor c) just don't like them. but wow, phils made me not want to share them. coleslaw was equally as good. the bbq ribs...fall of the bone deliciousness. the boyfriend got the bbq chicken all white because he's a health freak and didn't forgo our diet like i did on our vacation. but that was also delicious. i thought it'd be dry but not at all. we ended up having half the chicken left over for dinner that night plus a little but bit of our our sides. overall, i think if i had to wait for 3 hours, i would just order from the to-go line and eat on the steps.

i cant see myself waiting 2 hrs for this.. im glad we waited about 45m? the service was in control even though it was pretty hectic all around.. maybe im spoiled with the bbq fat fest at the nugget that rolls into sparks, nv every year? maybe i cant get over everett & jones in oakland, ca? at phils, the sauce is too tangy. im glad i got mine on the side.. the sides were good tho, but for the pork ribs? ehh..  beef ribs are hard to mess up.. i dont kno.. id go again only if theres a spot at the bar i could sneak into. other than that, not worth the wait.. ive had better..

Tough place to review as it is one of the only BBQ places in San Diego, so not much to compare to (at least from what I know - if you know opther good BBQ places, please le tme know!). There is ALWAYS a long line to get in here.  The new location is much better than the old - more seating and easier to move around in.  The Beef Ribs are delish, but a little fatty.  I think they should order better raw meat.  The pulled pork is fabulous and Iwould go back for that alone.  All of the sides are great, albeit a bit limited.  I guess I hoped for more southern style sides to go along with BBQ - Cornbread, greens, hushpuppies maybe?   Good for San Diego but I have definitely had 9and can make ) better.

Arrived at 11:00 am after we picked up the rental, and already a line out the door!  This is the 406th review for Phil's BBQ so I know this won't make a difference but just so I don't forget to make a stop here next time I'm in town, I'm reviewing it for my own records. The BBQ baby back ribs are HELLA good. Meat, tender. BBQ sauce, tasty. -1 star for the chicken that was a bit dry and needed more flavor, but at least next time, I know to skip out on the bird and go with the pig, fries, and cole slaw. Thanks to SD Yelpers for showing the way. Will definitely return.

Writing a review while hungry at work is a terrible idea...I'll have to keep it short so I don't start digesting my own stomach. After hearing all the hype for years, I finally went to Phil's BBQ (Point Loma location) last week. The line seemed long, but it moved pretty quickly.  I didn't realize it was an order-at-the-counter and seat-yourself kind of place, but now that I know, I'll probably order take-out to bypass the line.  Take-out is so versatile: pair delicious BBQ with your favorite beer in front of your favorite TV show, or surprise your sweetie with a BBQ picnic and lots-o-wetnaps. I ordered the Broham (pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw inside) and snagged some fries from my friend. Delicious. Great BBQ sauce. Great meat. Great bun. That's what she said. The only thing lacking was the coleslaw. The Broham is brilliant in design, but they need to flava up the coleslaw a bit. All in all, I'd definitely eat there again. Like maybe tonight.

Went to Phil's last night and took my wife and friend Daniel.  They were very intimidated by the line that wrapped around the building.  I told them it was worth it.  20 mins later we were eating.   The pork broham is great, the bread was soft and the contrast of the bbq sauce, cole slaw and pork excited my taste buds into a party!  The onion rings were ok, but once dipped in the buttermilk ranch turned them into rings from heaven. I suggest to avoid the line sit at the bar, next time this will be my move.

I've been waiting for a long time to finally try this place out. The first time I went Phil's was closed, but I was able to try out Chickfil'a for the first time, so still a pretty awesome experience. As for Phil's it's a very cozy place. My friend ordered for the 3 of us. Two full orders of ribs with fries, coleslaw, baked beans, and macaroni salad. The ribs were pretty good, the only thing that I kinda didn't like was the excessive amount of sauce on my ribs. So much of the taste was from the sauce which is kinda difficult. Other than that they were pretty good. The ribs fell off the bone easily and were tasty. As for the sides... Fries were fried a little bit more crunchier than expected. Cole slaw was pretty good, very standard nothing special. Baked beans we ok, but i wouldn't recommend getting them again. The Macaroni salad was exceptional. We should have ordered more cause it was the best one out of all the sides we ordered. Overall it was a good first time experience. I love bbq and so if i'm ever down in SD again, I'm gonna give Phil's another visit

I can not put into words how good the food at Phil's BBQ is.  I've had my fair share of BBQ and consider myself a huge fan of food but I have never had a bbq meal of such epic greatness!  As we pulled into the parking lot, I could smell the amazing aroma that flowed from the restaurant.  I was initially thrown off by the ordering system but after a moment it seemed pretty self explanatory.  There was a line that extended past the door but it went fairly quickly.  I ordered the baby back rib and chickless combo while the GF ordered a turkey burger.  We were both starving so the wait for the food seemed never ending but alas our beeper finally started ringing!   Simply put, the food was amazing.  Hands down it was the best order of bbq ribs I've ever had.  The meat was tender, smokey and the sauce had a little zing to it.  The GF's sandwich was really tasty and quite a unique twist on a turkey sandwich.  If I lived or worked near Phil's I would not hesitate to go back a few times a week! I'm counting down the days until my next visit to Phil's....

Me: " No babe I'm getting full, please no more ribs" (5 mins later me looking longingly at the ribs, salivating) Me:"maybe one more...." (3 mins after that, Face hands and shirt covered in the best BBQ sauce EVER) Me: "ummmm can we split that  last one" Him: "I'll fight you for it" He wasn't kidding and he's usually so calm but there's just something in those ribs..... AND the baked beans--O M G (we had spoon wars over those too) Only 2 things are missing -cornbread and mac & cheese, you'll notice this while waiting in that long ass line deciding on your order but as soon as you gnaw into a rib .... Cornbread who?? Mac and what??

I was totally underwhelmed when they were at their old location, but their service seems to have picked up since they moved to their new location.   Food is ok.  It's probably one of the better places in town for BBQ, but that's not saying much.  I like their rib tickler dinner, or whatever it is you get with the two ribs, onion rings, slaw and french fries.  It's just the right size.  The chicken always seems dry, but the ribs are good.  The pulled pork sandwich is pretty good too.   I was totally impressed with the efficiency of their to-go system.  Calling ahead is the best way to go, but if you walk in, you don't have that long of a wait.  I had been braced for a super long wait the one time we walked in without calling ahead, but it only took about 20mins to get our order ready.  They are super organized and totally have it together in that respect.

MY FAVE! Perks: DELICIOUS BBQ that falls off the bone accompanied by a tangy bbq sauce , friendly staff, friendly owner that walks around to ask you how youre doing, unlimited beverages, sinks and hand wipes for the "aftermath" lol. Downers: Loooong line if you get there too late (aka after 5 or 6), a little crowded and noisy, you gotta wait until a table opens up and you cant send a family member over to "reserve" a table while you wait in line either =/ All-in-all in my opinion its totally worth it to put up with all the downers just to enjoy some of their bbq.

Be prepared to wait at least an hour in line just to order. The line wrapped all the way along the building, being a non-local I was not prepared for such a large crowd! But thankfully most of the wait is in the shade and they try to be as quick as they can by serving everyone with menus. I thought it was a nice touch that one employee came around with a huge plate of fries for people in line to eat. Got the pork baby back rib half rack with baked potato, and my friend got the huge onions instead. The ribs melted off the bone and was very meaty. The baked potato was so-so, a little irked they had silly little charges for butter and cheese, but who really comes for the sides. My friend and I loved the fries too. Worth the wait.

This place is dangerously delicious.... I'd come here anytime I'm near San Diego. The line is long, but it actually moves faster than you'd think if you were here for the first time. Since it was our first time here, we thought it would be convenient to just get the food to go, since our other group got there 30 minutes before us. So we ordered it to go, which took like 5 minutes, and went outside ... and noticed there were some seats. Just a cautionary note, you aren't allowed to get food to go, and eat it there, even if you take it "to go outside." Rhonda (lady controlling the line) did not look happy at first when she saw us eating.... but said its okay since it was our first time there. I just said I was from China....

The food here is great, and of course the BBQ ribs were the highlight of my dinner. The one quality that meat has to have, in my opinion, is juiciness because if the meat is dry, the flavor isn't as great. And Phil's BBQ ribs are juicy. And flavorful. So juicy that the meat just fell off the bones. I ordered a half rack with a corn on the cob on the side and I really liked the corn too, so bonus points for that!! I love my corn fresh and crisp, so it was perfect. I ididn't have any experience with bad customer service, so my experience here was ace. This place gets CRAZY lines though! Crazy as in it wraps around the outside of the restaurant! I find it funny that there is actually a sign over a certain point in the line indicating that the wait from that point is about 20 minutes. The line does not take ridiculously long to get moving since most people go there in large groups, but it still takes a while, so plan ahead so you don't end up waiting forever!

I'd definitely come again. Funnily, the girls and I were chatting about how many stars we'd give it as we were eating the food. Our ratings varied... but i give it a solid 4. The chicken was dry (although my friend's portion was incredibly moist) and I'd give it a 3, while the baby back ribs were excellent and worthy of a 5 star rating. I'd recommend a rack of ribs with a side of cole slaw and fries if you're wondering what to order. The waiters were great, good service all around.

I should probably disclose that I am a New Yorker and I am better qualified at reviewing pizza than BBQ.  However, I do know good food.   I know there is always someone better, but until then, I am getting my BBQ from Phil's.   The meat is tender, the sauce is right on.  Phil's BBQ is delicious. The price is fair when compared to other BBQ places in town,  but when you consider the quality, then that makes Phil's the definite leader.   The one downside to the place is the wait.  There is always a line out the door.  If time is not a concern, then you can enjoy your ribs while watching the game and sit down.  Or, you could also do what I do.  Call ahead and enjoy the porky goodness where ever you like, without the wait.

I finally popped my Phil's BBQ cherry!!!! I grew up in San Diego but I've never been to Phil's BBQ until 3 days ago. Me and my parents went there at an odd time (between lunch and dinner) so our wait was only about 15-20 minutes. However my mom says that usually the line is wrapping around the whole restaurant. Anyway the way it works is: while you wait in line you figure out what you want to order (there's menus posted up on the walls), order at the cashier like at a fast food restaurant, they give you a buzzer so you know when your order is ready, and then you seat yourself at whatever table is available. Also there's an area where you could grab your own plates, utensils, bibs (if you need it haha), etc. Me and my parents shared a whole rack + a quarter rack of the baby ribs. Hahahaha my mouth just started salivating as I was typing that. The ribs were soooo good! The ribs were slathered with their own BBQ sauce and the meat fell right off the bone, which is a sign of a good rib. The ribs were combined with a few sides: fries, beans, steamed veggies, and we ordered the onion rings on the side. The sides by itself were okay, but they complemented the ribs well. This was total satisfaction! I can't wait to go back when I visit SD again.

Best BBQ I've had this side of Texas.  I had the Baby Back Ribs, BBQ Chicken, baked beans, and french fries. The ribs were nice and juicy with a wonderful smoke flavor.  The chicken was excellent too.  There was a delicious BBQ sauce poured over all of it.  I detected a hint of spice in the sauce but nothing a person who doesn't like spice could handle. The baked beans were nice and sweet and the fries were excellent.  You could tell the fries were natural and fresh cut....much like In-and-Out fries but with much less salt. TIP: I ordered over the phone thinking I would save time but they said that they will not put in your order until you show up and pay....they said they want it to be as fresh as possible.  So, if you don't want to wait in the long line to sit and eat, then just show up and order to go.  Phoning it in will not save any time.  Either way, I only waited 10 minutes after ordering for my food. They definitely do BBQ right!

All the hype? It's all true! Seriously love this place. Definitely get the beef ribs, it's life changing. Not in a born again kinda way, but pretty close. :D Baby back is good too, but I definitely prefer the beef. Staff is also super friendly and helpful. One anecdote: Was here on a random night and I guess there was problem with a customer in the bar section who was asked to leave because he was saying some inappropriate stuff. In a fit, he walks over to the main dining area throws a wad of cash into the air and yells, "Here's your f*!@% money!" and walks out. The food is so good here and the staff so nice and professional everyone in the restaurant gave him a dirty look and went back to the same happy vibe as before. Yuuuuummmyy!

I looove this place. I usually go with their sandwich choices and it fills me up plenty.  Splurge a bit with fries once in a while, but I gotta share that. Rather than mimic the other reviews on Phil's Epicness, here are some tips for avoiding the line: Call in your order Take Out or if you don't have that many with you, head for the bar area =) (I've been able to bypass the line twice already )

Love this place...would love it more if the line wasn't always out the door. Since there is always a line out the door when I want to go, which is why I deducted 1/2 a star, I typically order over the phone so I can by-pass the line and get my food to go. I do have to say that for the size of the line it does move pretty quickly. The baby back ribs are by far the BEST. The meat just falls off the bone and their BBQ sauce is a nice blend of sweet to spicy. I usually pair those with the chicken breast which is sometimes dry, this is where the other 1/2 of a star is deducted. Their french fries are really good too, I like when they put the ribs on top of the fries and the BBQ sauce soaks into them. I usually also get a side of the baked beans which are sweet, just the way I like them. Overall quality food with reasonable prices make this place a regular on my list. Writing this review reminded me that I need to get back there ASAP.

Perfect For: Birthday or Large Group dinner Ambience: 4 Taste: 5 Bang for Buck: 4 Service: 5 Wow Factor: 5 Fatty Meter: 4 Very lively atmosphere and it's almost always packed so try to avoid the peak dinner hours and try to get there early, especially if you have a large party. The BABY BACK RIBS... BBQ CHICKEN... PULLED PORK... ONION RINGS! End of story! Ribs are expensive everywhere, but you more than get your moneys worth if you order the full rack dinner.

Oh Phil's.. I think I've become a fan of BBQ foods after coming here. Food: Baby back ribs - delicious! It comes with the right about of BBQ sauce (which is tangy and a bit spicy) and if that's not enough, just ask for more! The meat was super tender and melted in my mouth. Fries - yumyumyum! I LOVE FRENCH FRIES. and I would definitely come back here just for the fries. I split a large portion with someone else and still wanted more. Yes, I'm a fatass. :( Macaroni salad - Not your typical elbow macaroni (+points there). It doesn't have as much mayo as your normal macaroni salad.. but it's GOOD. Garlic-y. Need I say more? Chickless - Meh. I'd prefer the baby back ribs over the chicken.. Service: Attentive. Someone came by and asked if he could get us more bbq sauce/ranch before we even had a chance to take a bite of our food! Parking: Can be a pain in the butt when it's busy. Wait: Came on July 4th and had to wait about half an hour. Not bad. There were lots of tables open too, so I guess it's just the ordering that took awhile? Cleanliness: I like the huge sink in the back to wash your hands. And the moist wipes too. Mm.. I want their fries again :)

Wow.. this place is good!   We went on a Friday night, driving from Carlsbad, and the line was wrapped around the building with a wait of 1 hr.  (what can I say.. we're newbies!) Since we were starving and the kids were with us, we decided to leave and come back another time.  The smell of the BBQ sauce was so yummy my 5 year old had a fit, and I promised her we would return tomorrow.... making the 25 mile journey once again.  I was pretty upset too that was had to leave and was fixated on the smell all night, into the morning. So we came back the next day and were NOT disappointed.  IT WAS SOOO GOOD!  The sauce was too spicy for my 3 yr old boy, but he did well with the chicken after the skin was peeled off.  My daughter ate about 7 baby-back ribs, and had sauce all over her face.  It was sort of cute actually.  She was really into them. My husband is normally afraid of beef ribs as they just suck at other places.  Not so here.  Yum yum yum!!! The only downside is that seating is a fiasco.  (Hence 4 stars instead of the deserved 5, for the food)  We ended up sitting in the bar. As it was our 1st time, we weren't sure if you had to get back in line to order more food, so we decided to place a phone order, which worked well.  However, when we got our phone order in the to-go boxes, we were told that if you get takeout you can't sit at a table.  We told the guy that this was seconds, and he said no need to wait in line again if you have already done your time. In short.. I'd go back in a heartbeat and will be asking my husband to "swing by" on the way home so we can reheat and enjoy.

The first time I went was when the only location was on Goldfinch. It took about 1 hour to get our order, but since then, I've been craving it at least once a month. Unfortunately, I moved to San Francisco and I really miss San Diego food (phils bbq, hodads, carne asada fries, salt and pepper chicken wings) which San Francisco doesn't really have. Back to Phil's BBQ: The new location at Sports Arena, is BIG and there's still a good line (which moves fairly fast) at the door, but to me it's well worth the wait. If you really don't like waiting in the lines, you can call in your order before you get there. The meat just falls off the bone and goes straight into my mouth, those ribs are cooked to perfection. haha. The 1/2 rib dinner with sweet baked beans and fries hits the spot. The chicken they have is okay, I havent ordered the chicken since my first visit, because all I want are the ribs. hahaha. I can't wait to visit San Diego just to eat. I would also recommend the BBQ Broham sandwich.

I got the beef ribs.  I'm sure someone already mentioned this before, but these bones are HUGE.  I was thinking of pork ribs or baby back ribs I guess, so I wasn't sure they'd be big enough.  But I could only finish one! (I also had the chicken). The onion rings are THE best onions rings I've ever had.  Don't forget the sauce. Though the beef ribs were good, surprisingly I enjoyed the chicken better.  Super tender.  Made me repeatedly crave chicken for the next week or two.

There are just not enough words to describe Phil's.  A few of the words that come to mind are: mmmm meaty, messy, delicious and amazing.  The food is really great, and everyone that works there is obviously taking happy pills.  I don't remember the last place I went to where everyone is so helpful and friendly!  If you haven't been here yet, you are soo missing out! Side note: We just went for the bf's birthday with a group of 16.  We thought there was no way that we could all sit together, at least in the next hour or so.  The restaurant was per usual - packed, but after we waited in the standard line, we waited in the bar for five or so minutes, and they had cleared us a table.  Amazing.

Okay, look.   I don't even *like* ribs, they don't sit well with me.  I don't enjoy coleslaw either, and generally when people get all excited about "OMGWTFBBQ", well, I just sort of sit there. This was before today. Whatever these people do, they're doing it RIGHT.  They don't win those awards for nothin'!   Had a piece of chicken (!!!!!!!!!), a rack of ribs (!!!!!!!) , the slaw (!!!!!!!!!!!!) and the onion rings.  Whatever they batter the onion rings with is tasty also, a bit greasy but tasty, but it's the sauce that really tops it all off.  It's got this honey-tangy-molasses-y goodness that you just want to pretty much rub your face in.  There's a nice kick that starts up around your last couple bites, and lasts until you wash it down with soda or beer or something that's not water. The meat was done pretty well, it had a nice burnt crispiness to the edges that is just what you'd want when  you think about that particular kind of food.  It wasn't heavy.  It was all very filling, of course, but it wasn't that cloying sticky 'ugh' that makes you sort of over BBQ for awhile.  Quite the contrary, my friends.  I'd eat somebody's arm if it was covered in that sauce. It made me wonder what bacon would be like if they BBQ'd it. *nom nom nom nom nom* All said, definite kudos to the Phil's crew!  You'll be seeing me again.  :)

I moved here from Tennessee and few years ago, where in any direction I drove, I could find good Bbq. Here, however, people mix ketchup and vinegar, then call it barbeque sauce. I've actually gotten violently sick from eating at some of these places... like the cow was trying to punch it's way back out of my stomach! :( I'd given up my search until my husband dragged me to Phil's! I should have known it would be good by the long line out the door. It turned out to be GREAT, from the huge portions, tasty sauce and all-around wonderful service! :) My only complaint is that there isn't another closer by with no wait time :(

BBQ Beef Ribs?  You serious?  I'm not even from around San Diego, but this beats the hell out of what I've been eating everywhere else in the California coast, and I'm a huge BBQ fan.  However, it doesn't beat the "baking-your-own-ribs-for-6-hours-constantly-­basting-it-with-your-personal-deliciousnessible-­sauce-every-hour-when-it's-in-the-oven-after-­marinading-it-overnight-and-then-slapping-it-on-­the-grill-because-you-can-for-the-final-searing-15­-mins-to-extract-additional-smoky-mesquite-flavor-­so-you-can-get-the-meat-falling-off-the-bone-­sensation-deeming-you-a-certified-beef-rib-­glutton-whilst-leaving-everyone-super-jealous-­when-you-hold-the-ribs-in-your-hand-with-the-­juicy-sauce-dripping-down-your-fingers-knowing-­damn-well-that-it-was-worth-it" method...but anyway, who's got that time to start cooking for dinner when it's only 10 in the morning??  (---I do)....but NOT this time!

Overrated. When I say this place is overrated, I mean way too many people rated this place already. So why should I even bother? Even my mom likes it there. No really. The night we ate there it was my brother's b-day so we had a big group. The line was pretty efficient and since we had a big group we already had a table waiting for us. There are menus posted everywhere so it's easy to make a decision by the time you get to the cashier. Customer service was pretty decent considering the cashier seemed hopped up on Starbucks or on crack. Our waitress was fast and very helpful, but it's not like we needed one since we had to get our own damn food and our own drinks. They pretty much clear the tables and get people their doggy bags. The food is nothing amazing but it didn't suck. The sauce is good, but I feel like I could have concocted the same stuff at home. The food came out in like 5 minutes. If you're an average person ordering ribs, I've been told the 3-piece beef rib dinner is sufficient enough to satisfy the average person. But since I'm a beast and I was hungry, I ordered the 5-piece. Good stuff. The atmosphere had that sleazy biker bar feel without the stripper poles and that feeling that I was going to get my @ss kicked.There were numerous flat-screen TV's showing whatever game was on for all you sports fans and a bar to solve life's problems...The prices were fair enough. It's a great place to have a bromantic evening or time with family.

I worked in the sports arena area for a long time. Being that we worked long nights and had little time to eat, we usually ate in our offices. Once in a while we'd do a Phil's run. This place has great food. By SD standards, Phil's has pretty good BBQ. I've had North Carolina BBQ so I don't think anything out here in San Diego will ever get more than a 4 star rating from me. I'm a sauce addict and their sauce is great. Only down side is that extra sauce will cost you extra money and it isn't cheap. We'd call in our orders and they'd have it hot and waiting when we came in to pick it up. You saved a lot of hungry IT agents from late night famine.  I served our military men and women all over the world and your food helped fuel me. I tip my hat to you Phil :) ... if I were wearing one :D

Who's a carnivore?  I am, I am!  (But don't tell my vegetarian guy that!)  :D The best BBQ I have ever had!  The line will wrap around the store on weekend nights, but it's so worth the wait!  The baby back ribs are mouth-wateringly tender.  The beef ribs are huge-mongous!  The baked beans are seasoned to perfection and the coleslaw balances out the tang of the BBQ sauce with a little mellow sweetness.  Man, do I love this place!   I remember when it was the little place in Mission Hills that only the neighborhood knew about.  I miss those days!  Now I have to wait about an hour each time I head down there.  :/  Grumble, grumble.  BUT I suppose it's what happens when the world is let in on the secret that is Phil's BBQ.   Service is great.  Prices are reasonable.  What more could anyone ask for?  :)

Wow do I hate to rate this place low but I have to speak my peace. I'm native to San Diego and have tried some fair to good BBQ here. I like to think I give all places a fair shake when I try them. And when it came to Phils... maybe I just expected TOO much. I had never tried them while in Mission Hills and when I went looking for them some time ago to find they were gone I thought I had missed my chance to try the best BBQ meats in SD. Sometime ago I heard they were in Pt Loma and I have been looking forward to finally trying them. A recent Man vs Food episode visited Phils and I just had to go. After walking Kobeys most the day the smell of Phils made us somewhat hypnotized and we had to try it. Let me say that with the business this guy is doing he is obviously doing something right. Personally I think it is the sauce not the meats themselves. You WILL be waiting to enter Phils. But the nature of the people seemed cheerful in anticipation of the wonderful smell surrounding the area. No doubt they use wood fuel. Not wanting to wait we decided to order via phone and grabbed a menu from the bar that serves free lemon water and limited beverages including some alcohol to those waiting to enter the place. You can by pass the line if you order it to go. I do think that the atmosphere of Phils is worth the wait though. Its was truly upbeat. We ordered 2 sandwiches, the pulled pork shoulder and the tri tip as well as a large order of the fries and baked beans. The fries were good. nothing spectacular but good and there was SO many. A large is good for 4. I wasn't thrilled about the beans but my companion enjoyed them. Ok Now I love BBQ but if it the meat is dry... it's not good. and the pork sandwich was very dry. Oh there was lots of good sauce on it but the meat itself was very dry. My companion who is not as critical as I can be agreed that is was really dry and declined more than a bite. The Tri Tip was not as dry but dry none the less. Both meats had good flavor but honestly, if its dry it's ruined. I WILL try Phils again They can't be doing this good of business and getting such great reviews for nothing. Maybe we just got the end of a pan? I don't know but I was dissatisfied with the meal. Had I eaten there, I would have asked for replacements. Barnes BBQ, (real smoked meats,) in Lemon Grove and Ramon's, (moist meat with great sauce,) in Alpine are much better choices for BBQ in my opinion.

The food was outstanding, not just terrific value for dining but seriously tasty and well cooked. We had a couple of 'best of both' dinners with a Beef rib/chicken and also the other Baby back rib/chicken - in two words, friggin awesome. Add some coleslaw as well as the finest beans I've ever tasted. All in all so great I even bought the t-shirt. No actually I bought 2 Phil's BBQ t-shirt just before I left! One for my fat brother lol.

The 2 times I've been here so far have been with the same cousin (and we ordered the same thing both times lol). We ordered the baby back rib & chick-less dinner with cole slaw and potato salad. Even after sharing that meal, we were both full. I'm sorry to admit that I don't have a really great palate that is super critical, so I can't meticulously rate how the bbq is compared to places I've eaten in the South (e.g. places like The Shed).  What I can say is that it is GOOD! (my mouth knows when someone is tasty =P) There's obviously a reason why people wait hours in line just to eat here. The last time we came here it was incredibly busy and when my cousin went to get our food (they gave us chicken vs. chick-less ..so he had to wait for them to correct it), they gave us an order of [huge!] onion rings for having waited so long. My cousin's trick to this place.. eat at the bar side if you can. It moves A LOT faster than the other side (which I've actually never been in lol). Also, gotta love the hooks under the table for purses. =P

Can't complain about Phil's. I always over eat when I come here because every plate has large proportions, can't complain though. Good thing about this place is that you can eat healthy too. Try the Chicken breast with a side of steamed veggies. Service is also great. If you are planning in  making a trip here, make sure you are patient to wait in line. Definitely give yourself about 1hr if you are going there for your lunch break, as most of the time there's a long line. Well worth the trip.

Ok, everyone in town is nuts for this place.. but, you better LOVE ribs if you come here.  I don't, and the non-rib stuff on the menu here has left me scratching my head, WTF.

Plus, it apparently closes for a month every year.  We went there once for a going away party and they were closed.  Back in 3 weeks or something.  Bad business.

Although the wait can be long, it is worth it!  I had the half rib dinner with the cole slaw and fries on the side, and was not disappointed.  My fiance had the beefy rib dinner with cole slaw and baked beans and we also shared a side of the onion rings.  YUM!!!  Some of our friends got the BBQ chicken and that was good too!   I highly recommend this place for anyone craving BBQ in the San Diego area!

Savory delicious slap of ribs, satisfaction at its best! Anyways the fries, beans and everything was all up to par.

My first time at Phil's was at their old location and my friend's and I waited 2 hours for carry out! I was so hungry and mad at the wait that I just inhaled my food. I didn't really savored it and thought it was okay BBQ. But there are moments when I just crave BBQ. Whenever I'm in Texas, all I ask for is to eat BBQ. And I get my yummy BBQ. But I'm in San Diego, not Texas, so I decided to try Phil's again. This time I was smart and called in my order at their new location. It was crazy when I arrived! The line just to sit down on a Sunday 2pm was already at a 45 minutes wait but I was able to bypass it since I called in. I waited until I was allowed to pay and watched as they packed my food on the spot. Great and friendly service. It took at most 10 minutes. I ordered the ribs and chicken. The ribs were slow cooked, tender, falling off the bone delicious. The chicken was good but I loved the ribs more. The BBQ sauce is on the sweet side but it was tangy and finger licking delicious. The beans were good too - it was a little sweet but peppery. This is solid BBQ.

Phil's is my favorite BBQ place on the west coast.  It's a must have if you've never had decent BBQ.  Just be warned though,  I don't think they smoke the ribs, so they come off the bones really easily.  One of my friends said that good ribs shouldn't do this.  But who cares, it tastes amazing.  AMAZING. Also, i'm not really a fan of beef ribs, but I don't mind eating them here.   If you're not interested in waiting in line for an hour, call ahead and order pickup.  Drive to your nearest friends house and enjoy ASAP!

Barbeque is probably my biggest culinary soft spot.  So when I saw this place featured on "Man v. Food," I knew I had to go!  As an Angelino, I make weekend trips down to beautiful San Diego as often as I can... and Phil's has become my #1 place to stop for lunch just as soon as I drive into town, every time! The tri-tip sandwich, known on the menu as the El Toro, is my hands-down favorite item to eat here. The smoky-tasting meat, char-grilled to perfection and soaked in Phil's own brand of tangy BBQ sauce, nearly reduced me to tears the first time I tried it.  And the BBQ Broham sandwich is a pulled pork masterpiece that will floor you as well.  Both sandwiches are piled so high with meat that you literally will not be able to see the lower bun!  And don't miss the baby back ribs... the tender meat just falls off the bone, and you won't be able to get enough.  On every trip, now, I buy more food than I can possibly eat... some for now, and some for later! Between the amazing food and the incredibly friendly staff who work here, you'll find it's no surprise why there is a large line out the front door all day and night!  But never make the mistake of allowing the size of that line to intimidate you into finding another place to eat... the professional staff at Phil's keep that line moving quickly (and never lose their friendly smiles while doing so), and while you may dismay the first time you take your place in line here, you'll be dining on some of the finest (and most reasonably priced!) BBQ you've ever had in your life before you know it, and you'll be heading back for more without a second thought!

I know I'll get flamed for this. I went with a open mind since I'm not a fan of BBQ style nor ribs. Nothing spectacular, probably all hype. I'll give it another try next time since it's what all the San Diego people are talking about it. THE LINE WAS CRACKIN' THOUGHHH (waited about a hour in line for nothing memorable). The war of fighting for seats was pretty fun.

WORTH THE WAIT! I drove down to San Diego for over an hour and waited in line for another hour just to eat at this place. The line was literally out the door and around the corner. Parking was difficult to find and the place was packed. But this place does not disappoint. Thankfully the line does move quite fast because stand in line to order their food and then wait to pick it up. It may be one of the best BBQ place I have been to so far and I am very satisfied overall. The portions are just right and very delicious. I ordered the Beef ribs and chicken platter and it was bomb. I also sampled the baby back ribs and they are awesome. I would definitely suggest getting some baby back ribs  But honestly I dont think you can go wrong with ordering anything off the menu at this place. Everything is just so tasty and juicy. This place is literally finger licking good. Asides from the wait I would see myself coming back to this place over and over again if it was closer to my location. If your in San Diego please do your stomach a huge favor and check this place out & dont let the line scare you. There is always a line, in fact there is a dedicated camera for it on its main website so you can monitor it. It moves fast and is worth it. AWESOME BBQ!!

I think I came at the right time...3:45ish on a Sunday. The wait was about 5 minutes to order. The staff is pretty great too! I ordered a baby back rib tickler, thinking that would be too little. When it said that it came with 3 ribs, cole slaw, fries and onion rings, I thought there would be a little side of fries. To my surprise, half of the plate was filled with fries. My friend ordered the full slab of baby back ribs. He was pretty full at the end of the meal and for the rest of the day. Both of us didn't finish eating the fries. The bbq sauce is tangy and   Overall I will definitely come back for more BBQ when I visit San Diego.

I went to Phil's w/ my friend JJ. When we went there it was around 1:15 and we didn't have to wait long to order our food.We ordered the pulled pork sandwich w/ onion rings which were really tasty.The coleslaw was really good b/c I find that most coleslaw is really gross.   I refuse to get on the band wagon and say that this is the greatest BBQ I've ever tasted in my entire life.With that being said I wouldn't turn down the chance to eat here again either. Truth to be told this establishment could NEVER compete w/ places in Tennessee.Kentucky,and places in the south who'd smile &say  "May the lord bless your delusional soul!". I didn't type that to be mean,but the truth is California really isn't known for having great BBQ,because that crown is often given to establishments in the deep south.

There are two types of restaurants in the world - restaurants who fail to live up to the hype, and ones that do so. Phils was definitely the latter. People don't realize that barbeque is expensive. It's a lot of protein, and protein is expensive!!! With that said, I think Phils is considered to be really cheap for barbeque. I've been to other places, and all charge more than Phils. Now that value is out of the way, the other 4 stars goes towards the taste. I've never had "legit" all american barbeques before, but I think Phils is already pretty darn tasty. The ribs fall off the bone and you can taste all the smokiness it gets from the smoker. But I think the X factor behind all this deliciousness is the sauce. When you get your ribs, always make sure you ask for extra sauce. With every bite of ribs, make sure you soak your ribs in that delicious sauce!!! I come here almost every time when I visit my friends at SD. Believe the hype.

If you ever wondered what champion BBQ would taste like go no further than Phil's. Every Person in San Diego will tell you it is the best and by george, they are right. When I get the chance to go to SD I plan my day around when I can get to Phil's..No Joke this place is that good...I am already trying to plan our next visit if I could give this place extra stars I would, every one should have the pleasure of visiting this place once in their life time, just don't go Monday's because they are closed, that must be the the day they have to count all their money because they are to busy during the rest of the week to have time for that!

well worth the wait. drove quite a way from the sd safari park just to eat here. luckily we were anticipating the line so came while we werent as hungry so by the time we got our food, we were ready to eat! the portions are ginormous which is great for sharing. shared a half rack of baby back ribs and 2 sides with a friend. also an order of large onion rings for the table. at the end, we were alll stuffed with leftovers! - baby back ribs - falling off the bone good and that bbq sauce they use is awesome. - french fries - easy side right? but something about the freshness of the potato just made it that much better... fries + meat = delish - mac salad - very light and a nice addition to a fried meal - onion rings - ginormous rings of oil goodness. while it wasn't totally oily, it did sit heavy after 3 rings or so - sangria - a bit too sweet for my taste esp with the flavorful and oily food.. should've opted for a soda or lemonade. i'd come again but the wait is a deterrent. perhaps i'll just go to the bar and order there.

I've been here twice in my life, once 6 years ago in high school and that was the best barbeque experience i've ever had in my life.  Good service, best barbeque i've tried at the time, i couldn't ask for more. Now 6 years older, i went back with the hopes and expectations of the memory i had of this place.  The cashier service has become atrocious, and the food quality had greatly declined.  I expect so much more from a place i've held to such high prestige.   Maybe I had gone on an off day and by chance got the cashier with the worst attitude, and received a plate that wasn't fresh, I DONT KNOW. i wouldn't be opposed to changing my review if by chance i did go on an off day, but this second experience keeps me feeling reluctant of returning here

BEEF RIBS..... If you have a cravin' for beef ribs, this is the joint you need to check out. Im impartial to labeling places as the "best of the best", but i do have to say that Phil's BBQ has some of the best beef ribs that i have ever grubbed on. Ive tried Beef Ribs in Texas, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Georgia, and out of all those places Phil's takes the rib filled cake. A description of their beef ribs is needed. The beef ribs are huge in size and meaty. The meat is tender not rough and falls off the bone with ease. The sauce that is evenly placed on the ribs is just the right amount and is not too spicy or sweet, just right. The beef ribs plates are plenty enough. Rule when eating ribs: Wait until your done to wipe your hands and mouth, go for broke... The 4 stars im giving is a result of their BEEF RIBS. Ive tried other things there which were also grub, however, their BEEF RIBS is what this place is all about for me. Get ready to eat GOD's beef ribs. Its prime..

Was in town to go to Sea World and stopped here to meet up with a friend.  I am definitely coming back.  We had the beef ribs, bbq chicken, onion rings and tri-tip burger (I forgot the name), but all of them were excellent! Our wait in line wasn't long, less than 5 minutes and the service was excellent, our order was correct and the workers always made sure we were okay with sauces and boxes and we got what we needed.. We all walked out stuffed!!

Good BBQ!!!!  I usually order beefy ribs dinner (3 bones and fries).  Don't be fooled by the long line.  They have a good system that makes the wait shorter but if you think you're impatient, you can always order for pick up. Beware that It's nearby San Diego Sports Arena so if there's an event, you will definitely hit traffic.

#1580, right here! Phil's is the best place to get your barbeque fixin'.  The ribs are tender and fall right off the bone.  I always get the baby back rib tickler which comes a HUGE side of fries, coleslaw, and 3 baby back ribs - all for $6.45!   The restaurant gets pretty busy during dinnertime so I'd recommend planning accordingly.   OH, and if you sign up for an e-newsletter on their site, you get a coupon for a free hug from Rhonda on your bday =P

So I heard about this place from my friend. He asked me, "Charlene, you're going to San Diego right? Two words: Phil's BBQ." I told my dad about it and all so we ended up going to try it. Oh. My. God. It was SO good! There was only 3 of us: me, my dad, and my mother. We ordered a full baby back rib dinner with a large side and a pulled pork shoulder sandwich. The total came out to be less than $30, and there was so much food! The meat was so tender and juicy...thinking about it makes me crave some right about now! :D Do try it! Worth your money and time!

If you only had one meal to eat in San Diego, you definitely have to go to Phil's BBQ. Why?? Because the Baby Back Ribs are simply OUTSTANDING. C'mon, the meat just cleanly falls off the bone. Sooo good!! But besides its tenderness, the secret to its success lies in the flavor of the meat. Specifically, the flavor comes from the dry rub on the meat before grilling, and also the sweet, spicy, and tangy barbeque sauce that is added at the end of grilling resulting in PURE AWESOMENESS. For those of you who don't feel like eating baby back ribs, another favorite of mine is the pulled pork sandwich. The sides are good too but they're just there to help you fill up. Without a doubt, it's all about the Baby Back Ribs at Phil's BBQ! The line can get ridiculous but it's totally worth the wait. Phone orders for take out are also a great option. Plan your visit wisely.

Phils... it's spectacular. Only downside is that there's always a line for this place.  We waited over an hour to get our food last time.  But the ribs really are fall off the bone tender.  You can use fork and knife to eat them, you don't even need to use your hands. I'd recommend against the boneless ribs though, as they aren't as tender as the baby back ribs.

I'm new to SD and one thing my friends told me I have to do is go eat at Phil's. My expectations were pretty high and when I saw the ginormous line circling the perimeter I knew it had to be good. I came with a group of 14 people, and I was the only newbie here. No worries! The host was super nice to be and gave me tips like getting ranch with the onion rings. I got a full rack of Baby Back Ribs with macaroni salad and cole slaw along with a large onion ring stack to share with my friend. The cole slaw sound have been better, but the ribs were DELISH! They fell off the bones and full of flavor. One of the best that I've had. My other friends had the Beef Ribs, which were 10xs bigger than the Baby Backs. The beans were so good too. I stole some of my friends (: Anywoo, it was an amazing experience and would go back (but maybe a little later, since it was so heavy).

Came by a few months ago.  I'm not a huge fan of baby back ribs, but this place is worth the hype.  I'm not so sure it's worth the 2-hour wait in line on busy days, though.  Fortunately an employee does come by to offer complimentary fries for the hungry guests in line. The meat on the baby back ribs literally fall off the bones when I begin to consume it.  The Onion Rings were also very delicious.

I'm not really into the BBQ scene but this place is pretty good. Have i had better? YES! I've only been here a couple times and it's not because i hate it, its because i dont really eat BBQ. But the times i do come here i usually just get "Best of Both" Rib-lets and the Chick-less with either 2 small sides or 1 big side. With the sides i never go wrong on choosing the fries and usually for the other side its a toss up between sweet baked beans or the macaroni salad which both are delicious. Overall food quality meats juicy and hardly dry if that makes sense. Never any complaints on dry meat. Prices for this place is kinda high, if you're not looking forward to paying $15.00 or higher i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. This place every time is ALWAYS packed. Service is always great and it doesn't really take to long to get my food.

SOOOOOOOOO,  I'm reading the reviews and read where some people think the food is crappy and others think its nothing short of manna from jesus christ himself. i even read where some so-called "southern knowing/living" people swear that since they are from the "south" somehow this makes them experts they then give the place a#1 rating and rave over its authenticity!! MY QUESTION TO THEM AND ANYBODY ELSE IS THIS--HOW CAN YOU CALL THIS TRUE BBQ WHEN IT HAS NEVER BEEN SMOKED.  TRUE BBQ IS SLOW COOKED USING SMOKE---PERIOD. CALL IT SANTA MARIA STYLE BBQ OR CALL IT THE BEST GRILLED RIBS OVER MESQUITE--BUT PLEASE DON'T CALL IT BBQ JUST CAUSE IT HAS SAUCE ALL OVER IT.  ALSO, BBQ DOES NOT MEAN SIDES--SIDES MEAN SIDES.   i have gone to Phil's twice as my nephew-A MARINE and his wife love the place.  it has great grilled meats and good sides and a very vibrant and noisy  atmosphere.  its fun and high octane--be prepared.  some might complain about the prices-- i think if you want to go out and enjoy a good family meal and enjoy it--YOU SHOULD BE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT.  otherwise go to micky d's and get the MAC-RIB SANDWICH AND CALL IT A DAY.  if you can't afford to go out, don't- and act like you did.!! I HAVE ENJOYED MY TWO OUTINGS TO PHIL'S-- I JUST DO NOT GO THERE FOR TRUE BBQ.  FOR THAT, I STICK TO LOS ANGELES.

Finally tried this place for the first time. I was never willing to wait in a long line  before but bored and not really hungry, I was willing to wait in line on a late Sunday night. This place is good, but I can't really justify the long wait to go again, maybe for to go. This place is worth trying once but there are many other good BBQ places in San Diego also where the wait isn't ridiculous. Great for the owner though!

Phil's BBQ is awesome. I do not mind the long lines and wait-times, as long as I get my Phil's (: Every time I eat here, I always order the "best of both" with baby back wings and chickless, with the macaroni salad and fries as sides. The baby back ribs are amazing and basically falls right off the bone easily. But I'm pretty sure their other dishes are pretty good as well. If you do not want to wait in those long lines during lunch and dinner, there's always the option of ordering your food take-out and coming to pick it up once it's ready. I've done this a few times and he food is still good. You can ask them for take-out little cups of the sauces and condiments they put out on the tables. That is a must!

I will continue to find an excuse to go to Phil's. They are one of my favorite BBQ places to go to. Serving portion is more than enough. I ate the pulled pork sandwich and it was delicious.

I'm not big bbq fan but after my experience with Phil's BBQ. I'm totally in love with bbq !! Went to Phil's bbq after a day trip to the SD zoo. After we got to the restaurant the line was super long maybe like a 2 and 1/2 hour to 3 hours wait time. So instead of wait for a table, my bf and I ordered take out, which it still took 50 min to get our food. We ordered a 3 pieces  beefy rib dinner, half rack of baby back ribs and a El toro sandwich. The meats were so good. They were tender, juicy and the meats just fell off from the bone.  After eating at Phil's BBQ, i think I just became a meat eater. I love this restaurant.the best bbq. It is OUTSTANDING DELICIOUS!! This will be must visit place next time when I go to San Diego for weekend getaway!!

Phil's is a treat for all meat lovers everywhere.  I have never once been disappointed here.. in fact, I don't think I could if I tried.  I won't give my local secret for getting around the line, but tourists can't have all the fun!! My go to: A full rack baby back ribs, and a full corn on the cob, and side of beans.  Seriously, to die for.. seeing how the number of reviews and quality speaks for itself.. I'll leave it at that.

The meals are very fulfilling. If you're not full after one, then I you must be a beast!! For the price the food's pretty good, but don't expect anything gourmet. It's just very hearty BBQ. i love the onion rings though! If the rib meals are too much, try the sandwiches. And be sure you have A LOT of napkins at your table. You're going to need it.

This place seriously doesn't need anymore reviews so I will make this quick. Outstanding service and great food. Workers all seem happy to serve you. I hate the line for this place but the wait is what makes your meal that much better. My personal favorite is the BBQ Broham sandwich aka pulled pork sandwich. They give you so much meat on the sandwich that I have to take half off just to close the sandwich to fit it in my mouth.

Lunch: Broham sandwich cole slaw on the side + ranch. Dinner: Baby baby baby back full rack with cole slaw and fries + ranch and BBQ sauce! Okay, my very first time at Phil's, I was really disappointed. I waited forever to eat baby back ribs overly drenched in BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce was way too much for me. Couldn't handle it. Eventually I returned and ordered the same thing but this time, it was all different. I was man enough to eat without a bib. I really think that's what changed the taste. Trust me, eat without a bib and it'll taste 10x better. Since everyone already wrote about how great the food is here, I don't really have anything else to say about it. I'll just say I agree with everyone. Quick tip: If you don't like waiting (I don't like waiting), and you don't mind taking it home to eat, call in and make a phone order and go straight to the front of the line (left line). When I go here, if the line is around the first corner, I immediately call in and order while I find parking. This way, the wait is no more than 5-10 mins!

I had the ribs tonight, they were actually very tasty. Just the right amount of sweetness, little bits of crunchiness - it was great. The only complaint was that a full slab of ribs was 20 bucks. I have a good appetite and could eat about 9 ribs or so, plan accordingly! (Slab is 10-12)

I'm usually not a fan of anything with BBQ sauce, anything that's overly sweet or tangy just isn't my cup of tea.  I've tried baby back ribs at several restaurants and was never impressed...that was until I tried Phil's while I was down in SD this past weekend.  Their baby back ribs are so tender that if you just slighty push the meat it will fall off from the bone.  I was able to clean out my 4 baby back ribs with just a fork and didn't have to get my hands dirty...so that's definitely a plus in my book cuz girls like me only get dirtaaay on the dancefloor.  HA!   They also have the best onion rings I've ever had.  They were still nice and crispy when they turned cold.  I also give their cole slaw and macaroni salad two thumbs up.  This place isn't  a sit down restaurant, it's more like a fast food joint so they don't take reservations.  There was a long line when we got there, however it did move pretty quickly.  Definitely stop by Phil's BBQ if you're ever in San Diego, it's worth the wait.

Pretty damn good BBQ ribs. I have had better (Montgomery Ribs in Ohio!), but these were still pretty close to perfect (the meat was a lil dry). And they're a lot more local than the Midwest. There are all sorts of sides you can order up with them, the corn was yummy! My only real peeve about this place is the wait to get in, I think we stood in line for nearly an hour to try this place. It was worth it to go once, but honestly I'm not sure I'll do it again unless I know there isn't going to be a line for some reason (when are their off-peak days?!). Because of the crowd it can be almost impossible to find somewhere to sit as well (or at least that was an issue the night I was here). Also, is there service beyond the ordering of food? If there is, it sucks. I was confused about that, we ordered and I think other people were getting drinks from a waiter, but no one ever checked on our table. Otherwise, this place is good stuff. Casual atmosphere, almost picnic like. Huge sinks available for hand washing. This weirded me out, it feels odd to wash your hands in a restaurant in front of all the other patrons. Still, definitely a practical idea. Go get you some BBQ!

Wow, This must be the longest line I have ever seem at at BBQ Joint.  You feel like you are camping out for Black Friday Sales. Referred to this place by a friend of mine.  This place is no frills, All-American style BBQ.  Their Baby back rib (Pork) or Beefy Ribs (Beef) and BBQ Chicken are all very hearty in size.  Taste is pretty good at a reasonable price.  This place beats Lucilies hands down. I had a full rack of Babyback rib with the corn on the cob! Yum...Very delicious!! People here are all very friendly and eager to help.  I agree with others said, order by phone ahead of the time if you can't wait. This place is very close to Seaworld so you can make a trip after a day at the park.   Tip:: Find a seat at bar section to skip the line! I skipped my 40+ mins wait :D

We pull up in the parking lot and the first thing I notice is the line. HOLY SH!T. It's literally wrapping around the restaurant on three sides. Wow. I'm like waiting for a new ride at the amusement park especially with all those random signs like "Smile, you're live on the BBQ cam." The wait turned out to be an hour. The second thing you will notice when you enter Phil's parking lot is the smell of bbq in the air. You can't miss it unless you have a cold and your nostrils are filled with boogers. We get up to the counter and order our food. Wait, is this a fast food joint? It sure seems like it. Anyway, they give us a pager and shortly it starts buzzing. The staff was very friendly and always checked up on us. Fountain drinks are awesome. Drink whatever you want, however much as you want. They even had a Crystal Light drink. Too bad they don't have sweet ice tea like they do in the Southern states. The food here was really tasty. I had the ribless plate with the macaroni and beans. The beans were awesome! Definitely a score. The mac was okay. As for the ribs, very juicy and tender. However, I should've just went with the ribs on the bone. I was just lazy at that moment but I think I would have enjoyed it the original way, like an animal picking off the meat and spitting out the bones. We also had the onion rings. These are excellent. Crispy, crunchy batter and soft onions on the inside perfect with the dipping sauce. Few things I noticed they didn't have. Corn bread and/or biscuits! Maybe even mac and cheese but I'm not a big fan of that (I'm sure a lot of people are though). C'mon now! I think my friends and I had a good time here. I'd probably come back when I'm in this area but only if i have the patience to wait for it. Don't be too cool, bust out the bib they give you. Who gives a flying f*ck what other people think. Enjoy it and have a good time.

This is not a waiter service restaurant (you order and pick up at the counter). The portions size here is quite large in which my SO and I each ordered the full size rack of ribs for the pork baby back ribs, and the other 5 beefy ribs. We only able to finish off half of it! The onion rings, even their small size contains 10-12 large onion rings which were quite crispy with a smooth ranch dressing. One small order could be shared a plenty among 4 people, but too much for 2 people. As for the ribs, I noticed that their style of tangy BBQ sauce is vinegar based which I thought complemented the beef ribs, but overpowered the pork ribs. Again this depends on your taste palate, the ribs were tender, but my last memorable experience of great ribs was back in Texas. As for the sides, they were good. Service was friendly, and peppy. For a couple, you can easily just share an order of one full size rib dinner that comes with the 2 small sides, small order of onion rings, 2 soft drinks and be satisfied.

What can I say that hasn't been said.  Probably the best restaurant in San Diego pound for pound.  Don't waste your money on the ribs.  Order the BBQ Broham Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of macaroni salad and coleslaw and you will be hooked for life.   Here's a little secret a lot of people don't know about:  you can actually order onion rings Chris Rock style.  You can order just ONE RING!  It's like 75 cents, but you really only need like 2 instead of getting the huge order that you won't finish.

Beef Ribs and Pork Ribs= Why you waif for more than an hour for this place.  You will salivate was you are in line watching everyone lick their fingers.  This is a must eat when in San Diego. They also get the staff to sing a group Happy Birthday to your group.

"In search for the perfect ribs" and Phil's BBQ (Phil's) came on top. I love ribs and I love Phil's. I always make it my business to visit Phil's every time I go down to San Diego. It's really hard to find a good bbq place in OC since there are a lot of independent bbq joint and bbq chains (Lucille's, beach pit, etc.). I am still in search for the perfect ribs in OC, but for now, I've found my Phil's ^_^ Anytime I come to Phil's, there's typically a line form outside of the restaurant. I really like the policy of no food no seat. The waiters will direct you to order the food and then you can find your seat. Eventhough it's always crowded and long line on the outside of the restaurant, I never find any problem finding seats for 4, 6, 8, or even 10 people. So their policy no food no seat (simplified terms ^_^) works for me. I always get the full rack bbq ribs while my wife would get the chicken. The meat is very tender and just fall out of the bone. The sauce is very thick and I can taste the BBQ spices. Some people think it's a bit to strong for their taste. But I think it's the perfect compliment to their sweet and tender meat. So far, I'm still searching for the best ribs in OC. For now, Phil's still the best place to go.

I just went to Phil's for the first time today. After hearing and reading all the hype, I don't think Phil's is worth standing in line (in the rain) for 45 minutes. You are herded like cattle to order at a register and then wait for your food for another 30 minutes. The barbecue is good but the pushy wait staff is does not help. I ordered food to-go while my sister ate in the restaurant. I had 2 different people come up to me and ask why I was eating to go in the restaurant and "Didn't you see the big sign our front?" They've definitely let the hype go to their head. I also heard several people comment, while in line, that they were going to leave and go to Red Lobster instead, obviously, Phil's was not worth the wait. Just a note as I eat their Baby Back Ribs--they are WAY over done. I don't know if this had something to do with the amount of people waiting, or if that's just how they are. Stick with the chicken, not too many people can mess that up. Their french fries tasted like In and Out's, so go there, its cheaper.

I totally forgot to update my review!  Well, one of the managers sent me a message and suggested I try ordering sauce on the side.  Well I went back, hella forgot to order sauce on the side, and liked my order.  Weird.  I probably went on an off day?  Anyways, phils is sooooo good.  There's a reason why the wait is ridiculous!!  I always get a Phil's tickler, which comes with 3 baby back ribs, onion rings, fries, and coleslaw (but since I don't like coleslaw, they just sub it with onion rings).  Order that with some Coke, and you're set.  It's SO GOOD.  How good is it? When my cousin came down to visit me, I took her here.  Now every time someone mentions SD, she exclaims "must get phils bbq!!"  (She even asked my mom if we could have my graduation dinner at Phils, lol.)  I wish I was joking, but I wasn't.  It's that good!

A Broham and a side will still keep you under $10. Sometimes it's good to start with the basics: Bro: a modifier to imply that something is bigger, more tattooed, and all around bro-ier. Ham: a meat coming from the animal known for being the most Powerful culinary force In the Goddamn universe (PIG). Naturally, a sandwich named "Broham" is better than sex.  Twice. I got addicted to this place in college, and it's since shortened my life in the most wonderful way possible: BBQ pork.  It's tough to get better pulled pork without doing it myself, and their equally awesome BBQ sauce makes it well worth it to pay them to put up my arterial roadblocks for me.  They do a standard BBQ style type of pulled pork (no pressure cooker, so far as I can tell), which is a little bit crispy.  The Broham takes an obscene pile of this and puts it on a toasted bun covered in a spicier than sweet sauce and calls itself a sandwich.  However, I have to fork through the pork for a good five minutes before I can get it into a working sandwich format. I also recommend getting a side.  They're all good, just pick one. The service is really good.  Everyone there is on top of their stuff and having lots of fun.  They manage the crowd well while simultaneously being very personable and helpful.  I can't think of a time I've gone there and haven't had a two minute talk with an employee while waiting in line, or had someone go out of the way to hold a door open for me as I waddled through it with armfuls of food. Do you want to live forever?!

So hearing my raving friends and reading the great reviews, I just had to get a taste myself. My boyfriend is in town and he loves BBQ, so hey, why not go to Phil's ... even if it is a 2 hour drive. One thing I did miss was that there is a long line. Well, this is expected considering how good it was said to be. So we got in line, it moved fairly fast considering how long it was! We decided to share and get both of the ribs - baby back ribs and beefy ribs. I have always been a baby back ribs fan and love it drenched in BBQ sauce. But my friend insisted on beefy ribs, so we had to get both. The baby back ribs were so incredibly tender. I picked up one rib and the meat just fell off. And the beefy ribs were of a smoky flavor. I loved it because Phil's had their own taste ... there are a lot of places with ribs and bbq sauce, but this is extra special. Seriously, BEST RIBS EVER. If you go with a friend, I suggest getting both and sharing. Their sides are also very good. I got fries and the macaroni salad. My boyfriend got cole slaw and baked beans. Everything was so delicious. The beans weren't too sweet but still really really good. Phil's BBQ sauce is just... good, amazing, delicious, everything a BBQ sauce should be. The employees are great too. There was a guy walking around, entertaining the line. It was my first time there and the lady at the front of the line was really sweet and told us how everything worked. Even the cashier was delightful to talk to. Good service, no complaints. Definitely worth the drive and the wait.

Not much to really say about this place that hasn't already been said.  Been here three times, it's the best BBQ joint in San Diego. The baby back ribs are loaded with flavor and come off the bone real easily.  The chicken is sufficiently tangy and more than filling.  And the small sides aren't really all that small.  Safe to say that you get your money's worth and then some. Sometimes the line is long, especially around dinner time.  But with a place this popular, can you really blame em?   And get the BBQ sauce at Costco!  It's really good! (I swear I'm not getting paid by anyone to say this.)

Oh man, loved it! It's gotta be one of my fave BBQ spots of all time now. I love that their menu is simple and they just let the food speak for itself. My BF and I shared the baby back rib dinner with fries and cole slaw and our table shared an order of the onion rings. The ribs were perfect--meat so tender and falling off the bone. Sauce everywhere which is just the way I like it. Get ready to dig in and get messy. My next favorite were the onion rings. The fried batter is just different and definitely worth a try. I think their order and find a seat method is rather efficient instead of being a full on sit down restaurant. Waiters still come around and take plates and offer to get you things like BBQ sauce and wetnaps. Overall, I had a great experience here and would love to go back the next time I'm in SD!

I've reviewed this place already but had to do an update.  I tried the EL TORO sandwich consisting of deli sliced tri-tip drenched in Phil's signature BBQ sauce.  WOW.  SO AMAZING.  The bread had a nice chew to it and complimented the piles and piles of tri-tip.  The tanginess of the BBQ sauce complimented the mild saltiness of the meat.  Very tasty.   I've been going to Phil's for years now and this was the first time that I had the El Toro.  If you're not in the mood for a sandwich go for the beef rib tickler.  My girlfriend absolutely LOVES it.  It comes with one generously portioned beef rib with a side of coleslaw and french fries.  The plate is HUGE and is VERY well reasonably priced. I can't wait for Phil's San Marcos to open.  It's a lot closer to my location and I'll be down all the time!

Yelp needs half stars. Let's be honest, this place is over-hyped. It is definitely not delicious enough for the 2 hr wait, thank god I have friends waiting ahead of time for me in the cold. JK that only happen once. A lot of people that go here are students its in the middle of like 3 universities and people love to go out and socialize. We're broke and hoping to spend less then 20 bucks on a decent meal; Phil's BBq answers that call. But there are plenty of other place. I feel like students who go here never tried BBQ anywhere else. I know the south hands down probably has the best BBQ but they don't even smoke the meat here. The BBQ sauce is average, you can taste their attempt to season it because there's a hint of cinnamon in the BBQ sauce. Thats right, the meat isn't smoked and it comes out to quick to believe that it is smoked. But I guess you can't blame them with the amount of traffic that goes through here. They have a deal called best of both. You either get 4 pieces of pork or 2 of Beef ribs and half a chicken. Ask for thigh and leg because the chicken breast is absolutely dry. For 11 bucks you get your fill. Or you can go get a full rack of beef or pork ribs for around 19 bucks. So not exactly cheap if you want your BBQ fill. While the sides here are good, they are not to die for. P.S. what type of place has ribs, but not spare ribs and a tri tip sandwich, but no TRI-TIP? I need to ask them that when I go there. The break down? 3 stars on food 3.5 stars on pricing 4 stars on Service Deduct a point for the 2 hr wait time So bottom line? Go here if you want to fill up your stomach with "the best of both" for 12 bucks. If you want BBQ? Go Vegas, the south, or better yet my personal favorite Lucille's BBQ

Finally, I get to review Phil's!  I had been here a couple of times several years back, but this is the first time I've attended ever since joining Yelp. So, I took my friend Wendy M. G. here for a belated birthday lunch over the weekend.  I had warned her about the wait, but even when we arrived at about 1:30 pm, the line was daunting to look at.  For a while, we even considered leaving, but as we were already there and Wendy was really looking forward to going here, we stuck around - and we were glad we did. After waiting in line for an hour, within five minutes of placing our order, we got our food.  We both ordered the 1/2 chicken, 1/2 baby back rib plate with potato salad and cole slaw.  Additionally, we split an order of onion rings.  As always, the ribs were amazing, and the chicken (while a little hard to cut through) was delectable.  The cole slaw wasn't that crisp, but one can tell that it was made fresh in house.  The potato salad, though... mmm, good!  And the onion rings are simply to die for! The beverage bar is well stocked with various sodas and teas.  Also, Crystal Light is on tap - a fact that surprised and delighted this diabetic who's a bit tired of quaffing his thirst with diet soda. The restaurant itself is clean and tidy, no matter how bustling it is.  The restrooms even have those awesome Dyson hand dryers I went crazy for at Westfield North County Fair.  And, the staff are helpful and friendly; keep an eye out for the 6'2" staffer who filled the ice in the soda fountain WITHOUT using a stepstool! Great food, great service, and great times here... over a thousand 5-star reviews on Yelp (as the outdoor menu hanging over the entrance states), and now they can add one more to the tally!  No bones about it, Phil's truly is the best barbecue in San Diego!

What the others said about the BBQ smell when you pull right into the parking lot is the TRUTH! WOW! We had our sunroof cracked and the smell came into the car like it was nerve gas! I was literally knocked out! The line did wrap out the door and down the front on my trip. BUT there is a secret to the line...but i won't disclose that to you all. The waiter in out section was amazing...talk about 110% customer service Disneyland style! A+! The BBQ here is the sweet and tangy flavor.....personally I like the just sweet bbq sauce. The baby back's were off the hook! Soft and tender. The Mac Salad was kind of like the Hawaiian mac salads (yummy), and almost In n Out style fries. All in all a good experience!!

Everything I wanted to say, everyone's already been there, done that! Sharing a dinner with someone isn't a bad idea, the portions are sizable. My brother and I always share the beefy rib and white meat chicken dinner, with an add-on of a large side to accommodate our appetites. Works out just perfect! The onion rings are HUGE, nice and crispy. The steamed veggies are really fresh, and the ribs are, as said by everyone, fall-off-the-bone. It seems like the large beefy ribs have a lot more fat on them, but I could be wrong. The sauce is just excellent--I can't even put into words. It's definitely a tangier version, less sweet. The vinegary taste is very present. But wow, I dip everything in that stuff. TIPS: Parking is not the best. You just have to get lucky. Lines are usually 1 1/2 hrs at peak times, or more, so either call in or have someone wait for you. Also, it's a really great place to bring out-of-towners. I brought my little cousin, a high school senior, who said it was the best place he'd eaten at on his road trip up and down California =) Hi Mono!! *waves* This place was already bangin' even BEFORE Man v. Food, so don't give them all the credit =) Succulence. Period. One of those places that makes you thank God you're a fat kid =) Also, the service was really awesome. Our busboy was super attentive, helpful, and very polite. Got us napkins when he saw we were running out--I like service that anticipates. It rids us of having to bother him for it later. He was tipped nicely =)

Portions are CRAZY huge. For individual portions, I would highly recommend getting the "ticklers." Getting one of the combination plates will make you really full. I like their beef ribs and chicken; this place prizes itself over its special BBQ sauce, which has a sweet, molasses consistency. Sorry I can't give this place a 5/5. All my SD friends raved about Phil's, but hands down there are other BBQ joints that beats this place. There are long wait times esp. during the weekend lunch craze. They have amazing coleslaw, fries and baked beans. It's good for large crowds. Did I forget to mention their staff is super friendly?

This place is amazing. This was a must-go-to place on our San Diego trip. The wait was long and the line stretched around the building; but it was worth it. I got the (regular) Beef Rib Dinner with 2 sides (fries and macaroni salad) Good thing I got the regular (3 bones) because I could only finish 2. They're so tender they literally fall off the bone when you pick them up. The fries are filling so go easy on them, but the macaroni salad is amazing; I should've gotten 1 large side of macaroni salad instead of 2 small sides. Next time...next time.

For a place known for ribs and bbq? Not bad. For me, it's a good place to eat but nothing extraordinary or special. I've gone to Phil's since the Goldfinch location and it has always been good, but nothing for me to die for. I think it's great that they came up with the 'system' to seat the people in your group together, but still quite a wait on any night. Personally I think the chicken is a bit dry (used to get ribs and chickless) so I never get the chicken there anymore. Nowadays, baby back rib tickler is perfect for me, although I wish that I could switch out the fries for macaroni or potato salad. The bar could have been built a lot bigger and better, but I don't think even Mr. Phil Pace could have foreseen every section of the restaurant to be so packed every night. Overall, it's a good place to eat if you are willing to wait in line for a bit. If you don't care about eating in the restaurant environment that Phil's provides, call in your order, park on the curb side, pay and take your food. Simple and fast.

Defreakinlicious. Seriously, good bbq. My weapon of choice is usually the beef ribs. I love me good beef ribs and these be some good beef ribs. The meat is just  so tender and the sauce so...tangy and sweet at the same time. I LOVE that they have Cajun seasoning at the table. Those things are made for fries. I'd knock points off for the wait, but I have a hard time blaming a place for making me wait because their food is so good that 100 (or so...literally) people are willing to wait in line for god knows how long for a taste of their food (true story ladies and gents...happened this weekend).

We decided to come here after a Padres game, figuring a plate of Phil's BBQ would sweeten up the taste of a loss to those #(*&#$ Giants!  But since the game did take over 3 hours and it took me a while to get out of downtown, I didn't have any big hopes they'd still be open when we arrived at a quarter to 11pm.  But open they were (until 11pm on Friday & Saturday I think) and with no waiting line, we zoomed right in, made our order, and sat easily amongst a still 2/3rds full restaurant. Wait time was the normal several minutes (why rush good food?) and to my surprise, the food was just as hot, fresh, and tasty as it is any other time of the day!  What's more, the staff was understanding about the time we got in and told us not to worry about rushing to eat before the place closed. As usual, the BBQ cheeseburger rocked with a nice fat onion ring on top, and my wife's beef ribs in the rib dinner just fell off the bone once she dug in.  So once again my view of Phil's is that its simply greatness and my anticipation for the opening San Marcos location is even higher!  Mmmmmmmmm...Phil's in North County.  I'm there!

I hadn't been to Phil's since it moved to the Sports Arena so I arranged to meet a friend there to talk personal business.  Great call!!! Everything was excellent!  The sauces were great, the chicken, beef and pork were tender and it was good and messy.  The new digs are spacious but, as with any good place, there was a decent size line.  There isn't much to say about Phil's except "GO THERE and ENJOY!" The only thing that prevents it from being one of the very few 5-star places in San Diego is the fact that there is absolutely no service.  Let me be clear, it's not that they have bad service, they actually have none.  Think of it like a fast food joint when it comes to service.  You order and pay at the counter, they throw you a pager, you scrounge around trying to find a table, and they page you when it's ready.  You walk back up to the counter to pick it up and grab some silverware and wet-naps at the condiment bar.  If they actually served it, I would throw it the final star.  Alas, they do not.  However, I should say that we didn't wait more than 10 minutes for the food and it was some good old fashioned chow.   Phil's is definitely worth the wait and the money.  Because it's loud and the food is messy, it may not be the best place for a first date or a business meeting.  Except for those two caveats, run on down and "Git you a plate!"

I went here for the first time a couple of days ago and MAN, was it good! It gets really busy at night, so we decided to go at around 3:00pm on a weekday and it was just perfect... NO LINE! We both ordered the 2 beefy ribs with the bbq chicken. Mmmmm!!! Plus, it came with 2 small sides or 1 large side, so we decided to go with the baked potato (large side)! Just the way I like it! Split down the middle and stuffed with melted cheese! Plus a side of sour cream and butter! I felt my arteries hardening! The meal cost $11.95. Not bad! The service was SUPER fast! We had just sat down, when our food was brought to us! It's a fun place to eat if you don't mind getting your hands dirty. You just can't eat ribs gracefully! Tip: Bring some dental floss. You're going to need it!

Phil's is pretty good.  I've lived in San Diego for 3 years and this past weekend was my first visit to Phil's.  I love bbq, but for some reason I never got around to eating at Phil's even though EVERYONE says how awesome it is.  I have my favorite bbq place in Miami and I was hoping that this would compare, but it didn't.  It's a good alternative though.  Their chicken was moist and tender, but the skin on it was slimy.  I like my chicken charred and the skin crispy.  That's my main beef with them.   I got the chicken and baby back rib combo with fries and cole slaw.  The fries are pretty good especially once they soak in the bbq sauce.  I'd like to try their onion rings, they're massive and look delicious. We called in the order at 11:05 for pick up, walked past all the people waiting for sit down service, paid, sat at the bar for a beer and a minute later our buzzer went off indicating our food was ready.  We took it to my mom's house to eat there, but we could've easily sat at the bar and chowed down on our take out while watching football. We at first thought that we'd get there right at 11 on Sunday (when they open) and be the first in line to dine in.  I think that's a bad assumption on our part.  When we got there at 11:15, it was packed!  Just a heads up!

Mind blowing. Yes, the ribs, they are that good. Fierce competition to my mom's ribs. I think Phil's will be one of my new regular spots to visit when I'm in San Diego. I rarely give out five stars but I like how this place works, you order your food at the counter and then seat yourself. The place has enough tables and has a good flow of customers going in and out. My boyfriend and I were there on a Saturday night, it was busy but we didn't have to wait very long for a table and food. My favorite part is the separate sink where you can wash up. A star for that!  Wet naps do nothing for me because I get grimey when I eat ribs. (Cue Dave Attell: Where'd you hide the body?) We ordered a full rack and split that. I could easily dominate a full rack on my own, they're that good. Even the macaroni salad was good! Not too much mayo. I'm sad because I didn't get to try the onion rings. The cutest little girl had a huge plate of them in front of her. I never wanted to steal from a kid so bad in my life. I can't wait to come back!

Phil's BBQ is an absolute must eat when in sunny SD.  Mouth watering, succulent, juicy, tender, fall off the bone barbecue holy goodness is served at this joint.   It is the absolute pinnacle of what food should be.    Food made with soul.  Food made with thought.  Food made with love.   I will crave Phil's BBQ ribs and its fix-ins for the rest of my life for sure.   ohm nom nom nom nom!!!!

GREAT selection of BBQ, GREAT service.  VERY clean for a BBQ restaurant - ever since they moved over here from Hillcrest I was afraid the menu was going to change but it didn't.   EasiER parking that before, but still not the great parking.  Weekends can be busy.

I went to school for 4 years down here and haven't tried it until just recently.  The ribs are so good that you even enjoy the taste of carcinogens covered in their bbq sauce.  That said, get the ribs and stay away from the chicken, it pales in comparison.

We waited 90 minutes on a Friday night for dinner... The Phil's Cam that we checked out online beforehand wasn't much help, and the wait time indicated by the sign around the corner was not accurate... Don't get me wrong - I don't dislike Phil's BBQ - BUT the hype does not meet the wait. The meal prices were reasonable, and I liked the sides more than the meal itself, i.e. cole slaw and macaroni salad.

This is another good place to eat in San Diego if you like bbq.  When they were in Hillcrest the wait was ridiculous.  However, since they opened up the location on Sports Arena it is possible to get your food in a reasonable amount of time.   However the place is loud. My suggestion would be to order food to go.  The beef ribs are fantastic, especially with the sauce on the side. My Favs Beef ribs Onion Rings Potato Salad Coleslaw Moonpie Wish they could resolve the long line issue. I dont know how many times we had to opt not to go because we could not wait so long.

YUMMM!!! when i pulled up to this place and saw the line go out the door and around the corner, i thought to myself...."this better be that DAMN freaking good" fortunately enough i had a group of friends that arrived earlier than i did and suffered a 20 minute wait while i only had to put up with about 10 minutes of it. this place is great because it accomodated seating for 10 of us and the food wasn't half bad either...okay, okay, don't pull my arm, the food was delicious.  the service however costed them the 1 star, it would've only been half a star if yelp allowed for it, but no....with that set aside, this is a definite place to try out for some good ol' BBQ.

I'm a pretty big BBQ guy and this place has some GREAT BBQ! I had the pork ribs and the meat just fell off the bone as soon as my teeth dragged on it.. YUM! The sauce was so great. Not too sweet, not too bland... just right! The order came out extremely quick for something that tastes this good. I'll be taking my friends here next time I'm around.

Phil's has GREAT BBQ!  I've only ever had takeout that the hubby picked up, so I can't comment on the restaurant atmosphere, but the food is so good. The ribs are very meaty, and the meat falls right off the bone (I can't stand messy ribs, so this is a huge plus for me!).  The smokiness is strong, but it doesn't take away from the flavors in the sauce, although the BBQ sauce isn't my favorite.  It is different from any BBQ sauce that I've ever had... extra tangy maybe?  The baked beans are also uniquely flavored with LOTS of pepper and spices.  The fries are so-so; I think next time I might try onion rings instead. The only drawback for me is that there are no desserts on the menu at Phil's.  I'm used to Brett's BBQ, so I've come to associate good ribs with bread pudding for dessert!

Juicy BBQ and fries The wait for this place was definitely worth the wait!! Best BBQ ribs and fries ever!!! I got the hype for this place, it was definitely a great experience. Got the pork and beef BBQ and chicken plus fries. The fries were hands down awesome!! I thought the pork BBQ was definitely juicy and melted in my mouth. The beef bbq felt a bit dry in my opinion and the chicken was not bad but some parts felt a bit dry. I thought the place was really cool and great to visit once a year. After awhile the place starts feeling overcrowded and loud. After dinner I felt like I had way too much bbq sauce and can't eat it for a long time. But at the time of eating it, it was like heaven on earth. I recommend everyone to come visit this place and see what the hype is all about. Great juicy experience and BBq

Hate to say it because so many people love this place but I wasn't impressed.   First there was a wait midweek, OK..it's popular what can you do.  But then when it was time to order I found the menu confusing (2 sides, 3 sides, large sides, small sides) and the TWO guys helping me at the register only made it more confusing and made me feel rushed.   So I had the boneless ribs (with some name that doesn't distinguish them as boneless ribs but I was expected by the cashier to understand) and while the meat quality was good, all I could taste was liquid smoke and it was pretty gross.  I didn't even finish them. I'll give it another try if the group wants to go there again, but I won't go there on my own or suggest it.   Overall, pretty disappointing.

This place has been reviewed a lot, so I'll keep it short.  It's pretty much been said already.  Very good BBQ place.  Probably the best in SD.  If your a BBQ aficionado you'll realize this isn't the best BBQ ever, but it is very good.  Portions are large for the price, and the sides are very good as well. I thought the beef ribs were better than the baby back.  The beef rib sauce was more my flavor.  A 3 beef rib dinner with two sides and two sodas is perfect for my wife and I to share, so the price is very good. It's crowded but it goes quicker than you'd expect.  If you decide to try this place out, you'll probably like it and may love it.

This is the BEST BBQ Place EVER!! Let's start with the Price. 2 people can eat there for under $20 and it is ALOT of food. I love their El Toro sandwich. I  always order it with a large side of fries. My husband Loves the ribs. The bbq is the best. The french fries are delicious. We come here ALOT and it is always packed.  It is a really good place to bring family and friends that are visiting san diego. Their beer selection is really good and I LOVE THEM for having Fat Tire which goes amazingly well with the bbq because it off sets the sweetness a little. No other place compares to Phil's when it comes to bbq. The service is really good and everyone who works there is really friendly. This is the only thing I'll miss when I leave san diego. =(

I first tried this place out when it was at it's old location on Washinton Street, which was small, and cramped, but the food was really great. The new location on Sports Arena is bigger and better, yet somehow it seems that it is as busy or even more so.  Don't be afraid of the line--it movies faster than you think, and there is a reason there is a line--the place is bombkies. The chicken is good, the ribs are good (I prefer the fall-off-the-bone tender beef ribs, but the pig-variety are good too), everything is good.   You should definitely get an order of onion rings to split, they are the best I've had.  They're not breaded, they are coated in a nice batter, sort of like tempura. As far as sides go, I usually opt for the macaroni salad and the fries.  The cajun seasoning on every table goes well on the fries, and instead of ketchup, I dip them in the delicious barbeque sauce that has generously welled up on the bottom of the basket.  The baked beans are good too. The bar has a good selection of beer and the price is decent.  If I could change one thing, it would be to replace the macaroni salad with macaroni and cheese.  If they're dishing out good soul food, it should come with a good mac & cheese.  It's a minor flaw, and not worthy enough to take off a star. Bottom line--this place rules, and you need to eat there if you haven't already.  What the hell are you waiting for?

First time I came here, I met Phil -- yes, that one. He saw me standing around and asked how long I'd been waiting (10 minutes), got me my food, found us a table, and came back later to make sure everything was alright. I made the unfortunate mistake of ordering chicken that night. Not that their chicken is bad by any measure, but after coming back again and ordering the beefy ribs, I'm not sure what the hell I was thinking. If got tortured via forcefeeding (a la Se7en), I could only hope that it would be here.

As someone who lived in San Diego during my college years, I think that I have a little bit to say about what San Diego has to offer.  And if someone asks me what they have to see, Phil's is definitely on the list. I remember people telling me that they would make special trips down from Los Angeles just to have the BBQ food at Phil's.  I thought that was crazy, but that made it at least worth the effort to try.  On my first attempt, they were unfortunately renovating their previous location.  That was a pretty big disappointment, but some of my friends brought me here for my birthday since they knew that I wanted to try it.  While I had initially been disappointed because I didn't get to try it on the previous trip, I can definitely say that I was NOT disappointed once I put some of that food into my mouth!   At the previous location the seating was pretty bad because the restaurant was so small.  However the current location on Sports Arena Blvd has plenty more seating.  The old location had, in my opinion, more flavor and character.  But the past is gone, and Phil's is still good. The beef ribs are huge and a much better deal for a single rib (3.95) over a single baby back rib (3.75).  Personally I'm a fan of the baby back ribs, but I can definitely enjoy the beef ribs as well.  Opt for the fries (on the firm and crunchy side) along with the cole slaw (fresh and mild compared to most slaw).  Put on a plastic bib if you're messy and get ready to dig in.  The sauce is finger-lickin' good. You should definitely put this place onto your list of things to do if you're in San Diego.  You can expect nothing, and you'll receive an awesome meal.  But even if you do come in with some expectations I think that you will leave satisfied.  Just don't come at peak hours lest the swarms of people ruin the meal.

Wow, about sums up this place for me! Came here with our niece who lives in San Diego.  She warned us about the long lines, but said it was well worth the wait.   We waited about 30 minutes before getting to the counter to place our order.  The baby back ribs are what to order on the menu, but the chicken and pulled pork sandwich were also great!  The fries and potato salad are also recommended. We sat at an outside table and the servers kept coming to check on us to see if we needed more water or anything.  Not only was the food wonderful, the best bbq I have ever had; but the service was great also! Definitely a place we will come to again when we visit San Diego!

Regardless of the time you go, you will have to wait in line.  The line moves relatively quickly, but you can expect to wait 45 minutes for dinner.  Once in, you place your order, get a beeper, and seat yourself.  It's self serve, but servers will come around to assist w anything or remove all the napkins from your table. The food is delicious!! I got the baby back ribs tickler (3 baby back ribs, 2 onion rings, fries and cole slaw) for lunch on Saturday. It was ~$6.50 and more than enough food. I'd get the half/full rack for dinner ($11+). I also had a taste of the pulled pork sandwich and the garden burger.  Surprisingly, the garden burger was good. Both were less than $7. I also ordered a bottle of bbq sauce to go.  I was expecting a pre-filled commercialized jar, but instead I got fresh bbq sauce in a jar.  They even bagged it for me! Also, there's a sink to clean your hands, and the automatic water is warm (vs cold). That tickled my fancy.

I felt i had to write a review on this place, because almost anybody that's a foodie or used to live around the sd area has told me that if i ever go to San Diego, gotta go get Phil's BBQ cause it was probably the best BBQ they ever ate. They spoke about how it's all ribs on the bone, and when i told them that i'm not really a fan of ribs (fyi, i don't hate ribs, but just never found a place that made it good enough) but WOW, once i started eating the ribs, i was hooked, if i didn't like ribs before, Phil's BBQ made me like ribs again. The atmosphere is very loud, but in a good way where people can sit and eat family style. The place is pretty pet-friendly as well, because 2 of my friends that went with me had their dogs w/ them, and Phil's BBQ has outdoor patio seating, where they  have these shades that zip up at night to make the patio area seem like another room in the restaurant. So because we had dogs, we told them if we could take an outside seat, and they were very accommodating to our requests. The place comes with pork ribs, beef ribs, chicken, and a number of different sides that consist of baked potato, friends, onion rings, beans, cole slaw, potato salad and macaroni salad. Personally, i liked the pork ribs better than the beef ribs, but don't get me wrong, the beef ribs was good as well. Overall, it was a good experience and next time i'm in san diego again, must stop by here again, but don't let my review try to convince you, i'm sure once you go here and try their food, you'll be hooked  yourself.

There's a reason the line is so long. I've eat'n bbq throughout the midwest, Kansas City, Memphis, ect. and Phil's is one of the best! One of the few places where you can eat the meat without the sauce! Prices are fair considering the portion size. The staff is fantastic!

For someone who doesn't enjoy bbq 90% of the time, ESPECIALLY bbq sauce, the fact that I'm saying that the food and bbq sauce here are AMAZING and that I would wait in line again for those sauce-covered ribs MEANS IT IS EXTRA, EXTRA AMAZING. Their onion rings are also incredible and definitely bigger&better than your average onion rings. I know everyone says this but it really must be said: be prepared for an incredibly long line. I waited for 1.5hrs, but as long as you're with the right company and have the right attitude, who the heck cares, right? Just treat it like an extremely long line for a Disneyland ride.. except BETTER (was that sacrilegious?)!!!!!! So if you're a huge BBQ fan, GO. If you're not the biggest BBQ fan, STILL GO.

There's a reason why pretty much EVERYONE in the San Diego area talks about this place, it is truly delicious BBQ. The Chick-less dinner with Macaroni and Potato salad is my favorite meal but everything on the menu is good. I usually come to Phil's on a completely empty stomach to make sure I have room for their huge portions but it can make the super long wait almost unbearable sometimes. With BBQ you couldn't get anywhere else and super friendly staff, Phil's is unbeatable :)

So I finally had my Phil's BBQ virginity taken after hearing people rave about it for a while. I had heard of the long two-hour waits in line for their ribs and whatever they offered there, but my friends and I got there around 9:30pm, so the line wasn't too long. After about 20 minutes in line, we finally got our food. I ended up ordering a half back dinner with fries and potato salad as sides, thinking that this was something I could finish. I ended up bringing home half of my ribs, a little potato salad, and most of my fries. It was so much!! The meat on the ribs were tender and felt right when I was eating them, I didn't have to fight with the meat at all. Fries were pedestrian. There were big chunks of potato in my potato salad, which is a big plus to me! And I felt there was a good ratio between potato and the cream stuff... Overall, I was satisfied. But I didn't realize that this place would be expensive (and before you guys put me on blast, this is my first time at such a place. I usually dine at the cheaper Asian restaurants, so I'm used to $6-$9 dishes)  Then again, I still have leftovers, so I guess it still works out!

3.5 Stars at best The food was good, but nothing was outstanding. We sampled the ribs, which were good, and the sides were fairly average. The onion rings were also good, but again nothing outstanding. Perhaps what put us off was the pricing...for two rib family specials shared among 4 people and one drink we paid $53. I feel as though Lucille's serves the same quality of food for a slightly lower price. Again, I'm glad I went but probably won't come down from OC to here anytime soon.

Their BBQ is REALLY, REALLY good. Since I've lived in San Diego it's the best BBQ I've had. As other reviewers note, the ribs fall off the bone and melt in your mouth, and the chicken is hellla tasty. I've never eaten inside, so I cannot comment on the lines because I always get my food "To Go," usually by calling in ahead of time. With this method I'm always in and out in under a couple minutes. The people that work there are definitely enthusiastic and friendly, which is rare in a restaurant these days. The onion rings are BOMB, and the only not-so-tasty item I have found on the menu is the potato salad. For the best BBQ in town, hit em up.

Too good. My first review (below) was 2 years ago and I only gave it 4 stars. However, it has become my favorite BBQ place of all time--- to date. I'm still up for suggestions but 5 stars right here for sure: I am stuffed right now from eating at this place so I thought I should review it before my brain forgets how my stomach feels. And the answer is....happy. I really enjoyed this place. I really like ribs and I ordered a half rack. I like how you order it from the counter and wait for your "buzz" to pick it up. For me...here's how I rate this place: The good: friendly staff, good atmosphere, great ribs, large servings, reasonable prices The not so good (reason I deducted one star): baked beans weren't the greatest, ribs and other plates only had one choice of sauce (compared to some places that offer a variety), hmmm....that's all I can think of. Anyhow, I did enjoy the food and the ambiance and will come back again when I'm in town and hungry, however, this isn't my favorite BBQ of all time.  I really like to have variety in my sauces (you know...spicy, mustard, etc.) But if you love BBQ, give this a try. Chances are it will win you over.

Let me join the zillions of other San Diegans who recognize that this IS the best BBQ joint in town. there are a bunch of others but to speak plainly...they SUCK. After living in Memphis and eating BBQ around the south, I can tell you this place is v good. I've gotten tired of trying to find a backup for those Mondays when i forget they're closed. I just resign myself to hanging around the place looking stupid like the other half dozen people who inevitably forget they are closed that day. If there's anyplace as good in SD, I want to hear about it. seriously.

When planning this trip, we were deciding whether we should go to SD for the beaches or Texas for the bbq. Because it was hurricane season we decided on SD. After breakfast, with no real destinations for our San Diego trip we decided to cruise and check out our surroundings. We saw Phil's and immediately we knew what we wanted for dinner. It was a sign... I was to get the best of both worlds =) While we were standing in front of the menu, checking out their offerings. A guy came up tp us and recommened a little bit of everything so why not? There was no line and the girl taking our orders was extremely patient with us as we debated on what sides to order. We got the baby back ribs (THE BEST!!!) with potato salad, beef ribs (very tender and falls rght off the bone) with french fries, bbq chicken (breast portion is a lil dry), and pulled pork sammie (we were told it was a must have, but it wasn't all that)... The portions are huge and it only costed $42. I was in heaven, good food and really affordable too. They really need to open one here in the Bay!

This place is one of my absolute faves in SD. Of the almost ten years of living in San Diego, I can say with 100% certainty that this is my most frequented dining establishment.   I usually alternate between the 1/4 chicken and baby back ribs combo dinner or the rib tickler (3 baby backs, fries cole slaw and 2 onion rings, but this option requires the addition of a side of the mac salad). The mac salad is so amazing, it has ruined most hawaiian bbq's for me because I can only think about how the mac salad does not compare with phil's. I have also had the BBQ cheeseburger (delicious), the Broham sando (not as delicious as i had hoped , but I'm blaming that on the hangover and will give it another chance), the beef ribs (HUGE and delicious, but i think i prefer the pork). The sides are yum yum also, the aforementioned mac salad, baked beans, cole slaw, corn and potato salad are my choices.  I usually have to get 3 sides, not because of the portions (which are plentiful), but because I am afraid I will be sad if I leave something out.  Even the fountain soda makes me excited (really good ice and selection). I think I may be the only person in the free world to not like the El Toro (BBQ beef sando), so dont trust my opinion there. and don't forget to order the onion rings with ranch.

Phil's bbq has it's pros and cons. Let's start with the goods. I absolutely love their bbq chicken. It's so soft and the meat just peels clean off the bones. It has to be one of the top 3 bbq foods I have eaten. The fries were actually really good too when I added seasoning salt to it. Lastly, the bbq sauce had to be one of my most favorite of all time. The service had it's goods and bads at times. Onto the cons.... The line is extremely long. I understand they have many customers and not enough seating, but I honestly wouldn't wait more than 40 minutes for phils' bbq. The macaroni salad seemed plain and was tasteless to me. The coke there was extremely watered down and tastes gross. I don't know what's all the hype about on the ribs, but it sure wasn't to the point where i wanted to wait 40 minutes for.

When I used to live in San Diego, Phil's used to be located on Goldfinch and Washington.  The wait time at that place was a minimum of 40 min, a two hour wait was not unusual but well worth it.  The BBQ was consistently good, the sauce wasn't spicy hot but it had just enough jalapeno to make the outer lip tingle.  Really Great stuff! When they moved I was afraid the BBQ wouldn't be as good as I remembered.  I was recently there and was not disappointed, it was just as good but without the notoriously long waits.   I am always on the hunt for good BBQ and Phil's is one of the tops in my book.   The only BBQ that's possibly better is Ernest Phillips BBQ located at the Sunday WLA Farmers Market.  The only problem with Ernie's BBQ is the quality of meat.  Sometimes he uses cheaper cuts of meat which is disappointing.  It's hit or miss with this guy but there is no doubt the man can cook.  Even when he uses the cheaper cuts, it's always fall off the bone tender.  Well back to Phill's, when ever I am in Diego area I always try to make it to Phill's and pick up a full order of pork ribs. Note:  Make sure the ribs are hot and not warm when you eat them or else the tingle from the pepper will be hidden. Also, they have outstanding onion rings.  Get the large order.

The food is great!!! Especially their baby back ribs... They melt in your mouth. I just don't like the wait that's why it gets a four. I personally think the hype is a bit too much for the food but they do have a very good sauce which-is what make the food taste good. I just dislike the wait. I would only give secretes to my friends no how NOT to wait in that long line as it was given to me by a the waiter, "Rafa". He told me what to do and No it's not call in your order and eat there. I was impressed and might go back during busy hours since I know what to do now. I saw it done by two boys and it worked so I'll pull it when I go there and probably give it a better rating. It would have received a five but because of the crowd and because they don't let you take a table before your food is there and because there is no waiter it only gets a five from me. But they are better from the first time I was there.

I love this place. The Best BBQ Ribs in California. Alot of times the line is out the door to get, but when you sink your mouth into those delicious baby back ribs, you will simply forget about the wait. Customer service is really good here. I'm always greeted with a warm welcome when coming here. The meat literally falls off the bone, when you eat them. The price is very reasonable. If I'm willing to drive 1 hour 15 minutes to get to Phil's I think that says alot. Can't wait to go back. Try the Half rib special. Wish there was more location especially in LA.

We just had a fantastic meal (stuffed to a point of wanting to vomit) and decided to drive aimless up north to get pinkberry.  The guy working at pinkberry finds out that we are from out of town and recommends Phil's.  It was our last night and we knew we had to try this local favourite.  It didn't disappoint.  We got the tickler (pork ribs with slaw, two rings and fries) and one beef rib to share; all for $11!!!  It's a ton of food that can feed a family of four.   The ribs were good; juicy and tender with a tangy bbq sauce that has a slow kick that lingers on your tongue.  The onion rings were meh - really greasy and not crisp, but the fries were crispy and hot.  Go figure.   What I really enjoyed about this place is that everyone who works there is extremely friendly and hard working.  The place is pretty much self service, but there are bus boys constantly rushing to clean tables for the next guests and they check-in to see if you need anything else while you're eating.  It's rare to see such hard working ppl these days.  We already left $3 bucks as a tip when we paid and gave our bus boy an add'l $3 just to show our appreciation.  I would definitely go back!

Best short ribs ever!  The meat is so tender, and it falls right off the bone!  They are not shy with the BBQ sauce, which makes a huge difference.  You'll definitely use a lot of the roll of paper towels they provide for each table as well as the wet-naps.   The entrees come with two sides, and I got cole slaw and a baked potato.  The cole slaw was pretty good, and it was a nice contrast to the sauce-drenched meat.  My boyfriend got his ribs served over seasoned fries, which were so good after they soaked up the BBQ sauce.  Genius! I love the set-up of the restaurant: you wait in line, order at a counter, and find a seat.  They give you a buzzer, and you pick it up once it buzzes.  It's a fun, rowdy place!  They even have a communal sink in the walkway near the exit.  You'll definitely need to use it!

This place is pretty hyped up.  Their food is delicious but fairly average in terms of taste.  Nothing special about the taste, but the ribs and meat are very tender.  Prices were fairly consistent with other rib/meaty restaurants.  The mac and cheese wasn't as good as I would have hoped, but still a nice addition to the meal.  It gets messy so first dates- NO BUENO. Expect long lines unless you're early!  You can end up waiting up to 50 minutes... I would say it's not worth it to wait that long.   There's a sign on the corner that tells you that you're 20 minutes away from being served... definitely inaccurate.  More like a 35 minute wait.

After a day of surfing, there's nothing like a little BBQ in ma' belly. My feelings of this place is mixed... On one hand the portions were outstanding though I think they could have added a little bit more BBQ sauce. But none the less great BBQ. IDK if I was so exhausted from surfing but that 30min wait time felt like forever. I can't really complain cause I was alone so I got to bypass the HUGE line and go to the bar. Which I must add that there are no signs telling you that. A staff member came outside asking how many ppl in my party. I told her one, then she told me of the bar area. That was another thing you kinda have to wait for ppl to finish their meal 'till you get to sit at the bar. The odd thing was standing there staring at ppl eating, trying to see who was gonna finish first so that you could swoop right in and occupy their seat before the person behind you see's it first. I really think they should organize this process better. It's seems we're on our own to fight for our seat at the bar. Plus, there's only one waiter helping the whole bar area; which again seems like forever until you get asked what you want to order. I must admit that the staff were really friendly despite the constant busyness of the place.

Good BBQ in San Diego?  Really?  Really!  Went with a couple of friends and was a little apprehensive because I've never heard of San Diego being known for good BBQ.  Well Phil's will change your mind. We got there and was greeted by a very long line.  Now this must be the norm, because they set you up really well for the wait.  They have TV's and menu boards so you can decide what you want before you get to the counter to order.  Once you're at the front, the service is very friendly and efficient.  The food came quickly and was hot and fresh.  I had the combo BBQ chicken and baby back ribs with potato salad and the beans, while my friends had the baby back ribs and fries......lots of fries.  The chicken was good, but not great.  Unfortunately, Some parts were a bit dry.  The ribs.....just awesome.  Great smoke flavor, super juicy, and fall off the bone tender.  Absolutely loved it.  The BBQ sauce didn't do it for me, and was a bit too tangy for my preference.  The potato salad was great.  Good flavor and perfect texture.  The beans....meh, they were good, but I've had better.  All in all it was a good meal and the service was spot on.

I probably don't need to say much about this place as the other reviews are pretty thorough, but you will leave this place stuffed and very satisfied. Phil's is one of those places you have to try when you're in San Diego. Its employees are enthusiastic and happy to work there and are more than happy to give you recommendations. The main downside of this restaurant is the wait, which can often be 40-60 minutes. They try to make the wait less painful by coming out with fresh fries for you to try, which is an awesome courtesy. Definitely not a friendly place for vegetarians.

The food was a flawless victory. It's delicious, it's messy, and the portions are generous. This place has some of the best bbq sauce I've ever had and serves up some great ribs and onion rings. The one thing that I disliked about it was the wait. You have to wait outside in line to get in and they don't take reservations. What the heck guys, you're the highest rated restaurant in SD and you don't take reservations? Am I not famous enough? It's not like I can get bottle service at a BBQ HOUSE or some shiznit to skip the line...

I live just blocks away from the Mission Hills location and it's still closed but it is worth it to go to Pt. Loma for Phil's BBQ.  In addition to great BBQ I particularly like the onion rings -- yum yum.   Calling ahead is the only way to eat at Phil's without a wait.  After you've done it a few times they get you in their database and it is quick and easy to order by phone then you can waltz in and get your food while the less informed wait for 30 minutes or more.   At the place I work we've also used Phil's catering several times and I would highly recommend it.  Great for an office party!

I could seriously eat at Phil's once a week and when I tell everyone about how delicious it is they don't take me seriously as a vegetarian recommending bbq.  But all that I can speak for is the veggie burger bbq style, a side of fries and a karl strauss red trolley ale (all for under $12),  so I might be a little biased seeing as I get the same thing every time, but non-vegetarians that I've gone with love the meaty bbq and all of the sides that go with (the fries and the corn are the best!!). I would recommend checking out the bar area for a Sunday lunch as it's not super busy early in the day, otherwise you're looking at least a 20 min line at all times.

I ordered the half rack baby back ribs dinner with steamed veggies side.  The portions were generous but I must say that the sauce they use is a little off.  I think it is either too sweet or maybe too sour, not sure, but I've had better bbq sauce.  Also, the veggies could have been seasoned better and cooked longer. *EDIT* I went back a second time and found that the sauce sort of grows on you.  What's great about phil's is the consistent quality of meat along with the low prices.  I can definitely see myself becoming a loyal customer.

We read the good reviews and gave Phil's a try last week. I'm glad we did! We got there around 1:30 PM after the lunch rush, so we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. They don't have a kids' menu, but the "Chick Tickler" (boneless pieces of BBQ chicken, 2 onion rings, and a side) was more than enough for our 8-year old. In fact, it would have been enough for an adult. Our daughter doesn't have much tolerance for spicy food, but she remarked, "When I eat the chicken it's like my mouth is on fire, but it's SOOOO good!" The pork baby back ribs were excellent. I only wish I would have remembered to order a side of onion rings (I sampled my daughter's), but I was so full I'd have had a hard time finishing them. My wife commented that she really liked the cole slaw because it was so fresh and not too sweet, and she doesn't usually like cole slaw very much. Staff members came by the table a couple times to make sure everything was to our liking. The next time we're down in San Diego we're going back.

When you see the line wrapped outside and around the corner every single day they are open, you know this place has to be good!! BEST BBQ Pork Ribs I've had my whole life!! The meat actually melts in your mouth, and never disappoints. Nothing negative about the food, only about the slightly high prices ($20 for baby back ribs and 2 sides), closed on Mondays, and line is ALWAYS out the door. After trying their BBQ, all other places don't even come close!

Ah, Phil's BBQ...   Heard much about it, but never actually been there.  I may have stated this in past reviews, but my family is not necessarily the type to go out to a sit-down place for food.  So when my friend decided to meet there for his birthday lunch get-together, I just couldn't pass it up.   Right along Sports Arena Boulevard, the aroma of the barbecue is enough to make my mouth water.  My party was already there when I arrived and one of the workers helped my out in ordering my food and bringing out to me when it was ready (major points for service there).  I had the BBQ cheeseburger and I was licking my fingers in-between bites just so I can get some of the sauce that trickled off.  I actually finished my burger and was very satisfied.  I hope that the next time I'm here, I'll order the ribs and perhaps many other things... can't wait to go back!

I ordered: The Beef Rib Dinner with sweet beans and fresh cut fries.  The meat was tender and easily fell off of the bone.  The BBQ sauce was delicious.  It wasn't too tangy and the sweetness didn't make my teeth tingle.  I got 5 ribs with my order and was forced to take 2 of them home to eat later because I didn't have any more room in my stomach.  The line was long on Saturday.  It stretched out of the door and around the side of the building but it was well worth the 20 minute wait.  The greeter lady at the front of the line was really nice.

I review this with a sense of humor because it's Phil's BBQ and not front row seating with Bobby Flay. Let's be honest here, after waiting 60 minutes in line (in front of this loud, nerdy douche bag yapping about engineering and his 2-cents about every aspect of life), I was expecting the food to be piping hot off the grill and succulent meat to fall right off the bone.  The romance died right there.  The meat was great in quantity, but lacked the quality that a 60-minute wait in front of a yapping Asian male-douche-bag would warrant.   I'm glad I got this one experience because I'm heading over to Carvers the next time I want ribs the way I like it  :)

As for the food - they have absolutely ruined it for me.  Ever since I discovered Phil's, they have set the bar and I won't eat bbq anywhere else.  The are the best.  Will always be the best.   ps - the wait in line is faster than the length it looks.

Hands down my favorite BBQ place in San Diego.  Seems like most people rave about the ribs, but for me, it is all about the Broham.  Pulled pork shoulder, resting beautifully on a bed of slaw, and served in a bun.  It is simply delicious!  The slaw adds nice flavor and texture, and the BBQ sauce is tangy and tasty.  It's like heaven on a bun. I must admit, however, that I'm not a huge fan of their ribs.  I certainly wouldn't say that they are bad, but to me, they are just adequate. The only downside of this place is that the line can get really long, so be sure to get there for an early meal, or during off hours.  The last time my family went, we arrived in the early evening, just as the line was starting to creep out the door.  By the time our food was ready, the line was already heading towards the end of the building and starting to turn the corner. I also found out during that visit that Phil's is a pretty good place to catch a game as well.  We went during the LLWS, and everyone was glued to the television.  Pretty awesome to hear the whole place erupt in cheers when the boys from Chula Vista were busy hitting bombs.

I wasn't expecting much from a BBQ joint in SD, but all of the yelp hype gave me reason to believe. There wasn't much of a line when we went on a weeknight, but most of the tables were full (with a bunch of college students). I didn't know this restaurant was an 'order at the counter' type of place, so I hastily selected their beef rib and half chicken combo, with coleslaw and potato salad sides. The portion size was good with two pieces of chicken and two hearty beef ribs. Unfortunately, the chicken was overcooked and obscenely slathered in sauce. I could tell it was chicken based on the stringy texture, but the overwhelming flavor was sweet/sour bbq sauce. By comparison, the ribs were much better. The meat was cooked (guessing baked) just right. It wasn't that manufactured super fall-off the bone tender that you find from boiled/prepackaged ribs. They were firm and had a nice smokey flavor. Although they were also sauced by Captain Generous. The coleslaw and potato salad sides were mostly forgettable. Similar to something you'd find from your local grocery-store deli. For the price, I guess I can't complain. I might come back for a quick simulated bbq fix, but I def wouldn't wait in line for more than 15 minutes.

Ok...I will admit, I like going here. But, its because I live in San Diego and the food quality is poor, unless you want t quick taco. So, for that reason I like Phils because it has decent food that is consistent. HOWEVER, I will back everyone else that this should not be called BBQ. There is no smoker and this food is not BBQ'd. It, in fact, is par-boiled earlier in the day and then quick grilled on the spot before served. That is why the ribs are so often burned or charred. Most people don't notice because of the ridiculous amount of sticky / salty sauce that they call "BBQ sauce." (its ketchup, sugar, molasses) The wait staff is oh so annoying but I'm over being annoyed by them, now I just ignore them...and I would suggest YOU DO TOO! Go to Phils to: 1. A change from the taco shop 2. Ignore the staff 3. Wait in line for a long time 4. Feel bloated after wards 5. Get annoyed by the lack of parking 6. Get annoyed by the COPS ALWAYS PARKED IN THE HANDICAPPED SPOTS 7. Get a headache from the endless tourists (who don't know anything about BBQ either for some reason) 8. Feel like getting away from the Convoy area (but cant seem to even though it is Point Loma) 9. Get annoyed by door dings from the packed parking lot 10. Get annoyed by the long line and END UP GOING TO RED LOBSTER NEXT DOOR!

The only way to do Phil's is takeout or sit in the bar.  I'm a die hard barbecue fan but the experience of eating in the restaurant in no way is worth standing in line for an hour and a half.  My friend and I split the baby back and beef ribs.  I felt the sauce was overwhelming for the baby backs but was good on the beef ribs.  I prefer my ribs dry so I was disappointed not to see that as an option. We got the potato salad and steamed vegetables for sides which were underwhelming.  Bottom line was that the food was good but not great and no way near justifies the hype. Thanks for your suggestion Fred I'll try 'em dry next time; but I'm still carrying out!

Phils BBQ draws in it's masses by piping the BBQ love out across Point Loma... Usually pretty crowded at midday, but worth the wait. My Staple is the "Broham" which is the BBQ pork and slaw sandwich. I'm not really a rib lover due to the amount of actual meat you get with any rib factor, but they are good too. Sides are very generous and tasty. Service is great, makes it a special day for me whenever I go.

The best BBQ I've EVER had in my entire life.  Juicy and moist and straight off the bone.  The best flavor.  Better than any BBQ I've had here in Dallas, TX (where they're known for their BBQ).  Don't be surprised if you see a line out the door.  It has gotten so popular that the last time I went I stood outside the restaurant for almost a half hour before I seated myself. I've heard that they've also built and opened one in San Marcos, CA.  Of course, I've been following them on Facebook (since they're one of my favorite restaurants).  I've been begging them to come to Dallas, TX but don't know if they will.  I know that they'll be successful wherever they go with that special sauce of theirs. Definitely worth the wait if you haven't been.  Just make sure not to wear anything nice or anything white.  Enjoy because you'll be back again.  I guarantee it!

In the Kingdom of San Diego a legend has spread since the beginning of time. From the lowest squire to the noblest lord, talk of a magnificent place abounds. A promised land. A Mecca of Meat. This place is Phil's BBQ. A dragon amongst sheep. Talk of such greatness brought me here. I expected a dragon but found a tiny iguana instead. Guess the dragon was nothing but a legend, hyped up through the ages. Don't get me wrong, the food was good but not worthy of the school-girl level crushes this place seems to attract amongst San Dieguns (San Diegites, San Diegonians?). The meat on the ribs was definitely tender and the bbq sauce not disgusting, I can't say that it will forever reside on my palette as a god amongst sauces. The coleslaw was interesting (in a good way) and had very prominent horseradish undertones. The sides all seem to be stuffed with celery (which I hate) so those were almost certainly ruined for me. The fries were overcooked and dry. Come early, like I did, or you'll face the dreadful lines one hears so much about, the only thing about Phil's that ISN'T over-hyped. Parking was ample.

Although, it does move relatively fast but it's annoying when you go there and you're craving and starving for BBQ and you have to wait 30mins.   The food however is probably the best BBQ I have had in San Diego so far and it's always a fun place to go with friends. Just remember, it is EXTREMELY busy most of the time so be prepared to wait in line.

The line you have to wait in to order food reminds me of the Space Mountain line at Disneyland. It is daunting. But it is well worth the wait if you're into the most tender, juicy bbq in California. Phil's is DEEEELICIOUS and, without a doubt, deserves five stars. I'll highlight some of my favorites about this bbq place: 1. They're quick. The line takes forever, but once you're in, you get your food in a heartbeat. Seating is well regulated so if you're in a small party, finding a table isn't that difficult, and if you're in a large party... they take care of the mess for you. 2. There's plenty of choices for everybody! I chose the baby back ribs. They were perfectly tangy and sweet. I chose cole slaw and corn as my sides, and they were the perfect companion to my soul food feast. 3. The service is great! (Maybe it was because I was in a big party, but I'd like to believe differently...) We got checked on loads, and they were super friendly. Everybody seemed to love their job. 4. The atmosphere is fun and light. I listed this last, because I find this to be the case at most bbq places, but still! Relaxed meals are the best. Go. You won't regret it.

What can I say, I love BBQ.  This place is hands down the best BBQ in a 1,000 mile radius, possibly second only to The Salt Lick. The other reviews sum up the ribs very well, but you need to try the Broham sandwich.  Something about the smoky pulled pork, delicious coleslaw, and roll that blends so amazingly well. This place is usually crowded during peak times, so I try to come after/before peak times.

Make that 3 and a HALF stars.  (CHECK THAT, MAKE THAT 4...I've got a gun to my head)...It's their BBQ sauce.  Not too big on it.  Call me lame, (CHECK THAT, CALL ME POOR...can't afford the good stuff) but I think Bullseye, Heinz, and other sauces seen on grocery shelves taste better (MY TASTE BUDS ARE NOT WORTHY). Good (CHECK THAT, FANTABULOUS, is that a word?) barbeque, but I think I've had better.  Don't get me wrong the portions are relatively huge and the pricing fits in, it's definitely proportional to the amount you get.   Don't get turned off by the how packed this place gets.  The service is fast and after a five minute wait your food should be ready.   Good luck trying to find a seat!!! I've had the chicken, beef rack, brisket, and pork rack...all awesome.

Hands down the best BBQ ribs I have ever had. There is not a better BBQ place on the West Coast, believe I have tried to find one and have failed every time, but that's a good thing! If you live in Southern California and more specifically San Diego and haven't tired fills yet, stop reading this right now and head over there and grab some ribs! The Baby Back Ribs are super tender and fall right off the bone. They are smoked for 8 hours and go great with any of the sides they have to offer. The BBQ sauce is just as amazing and even has a little bit of kick to it. If you are still reading my review that means you haven't gotten off your ass and gone down to Phil's or you are waiting in line and reading this on your iPhone.

Phil's is legendary, and rightfully so... it's simply the best. My favorite is the Ribs (always pork) and Chick-less combo.  It comes with two sides (I like the fries, and beans or slaw) and costs only $12 or so.  Plenty of food and DELICIOUS!

Went one night - HUGE line - can't do that with a 5 year old boy who can't sit still.  Decided to go back the next night at like 5:15 got right in no line - woohoo.  Line started forming as we were eating. Ribs were amazing - Chicken was awesome.   Fries were real good. Beans were good.  Potato salad was kinda not that good - wouldn't get that again but no biggie dug into the other food - it was a total hogfest and we oved it. Left full and happy - went to San Diego Padres game afterwards probably still with bbq sauce on our smiling faces.

My husband loves this place and so do I. The fealing changed after it moved from hillcrest. The place used to be more quaint but now its a lean mean BBQ machine. The building is next to the sports arena and its usually easy to find parking. Then this place turns into Disneyland. You may have to wait up to 40 minutes in a line outside the resturaunt before you order. Is it worth it? Absolutely! The bar has a wide range of local beers. It is a very solid place to catch a beer. The BBQ is the best in SD. The sauce is smokey and yet still has great flavor. The ribs are super moist. The sides are great. I always go for coleslaw and fries. The fries are quintecential for soaking up the extra sauce. I love the tri-tip sandwich beacuse the meat in thinly sliced and juicy. The table has all the paper towels you would ever need.

The broham sandwich is hands down the best thing on the menu next to the beef ribs. Their catering is awesome because of their cornbread. I have been here dozens of times and those are my favorite dishes along with their potato salad and onion rings.

I love meat, but am pretty picky when it comes to bbq. Phil's knows how to do it right though! Besides the massive line, my experience at Phil's was pretty enjoyable. It's not exactly a place I'd drive 2 hours for, and then wait in a line for another hour...but if I'm in that San Diego area, I'm definitely going back! The meat is succulent and flavorful, and honestly, I've never had better bbq. GO TRY IT, but remember, patience is key :D

What can I say.. When you are eating out here, you will be expecting to spend some money. Some people will think this place is overpriced and all. But to me, I think it depends what you are getting and you will also be getting your money worth. I usually get the best of half of baby back ribs and 1/4 chicken breast with fries and macaroni for my sides for 12.95. That meal alone is more then enough for me for tomorrow light breakfast. Compare to other restaurants when you order any type or ribs there, they give you such small portion. At Phil's, they give you the portion you deserve  of what you pay for. Also I think their sauce tops it off with your meat also. This place is the place I would bring my friends when they come visit me or people that have not tried it. I agree with everyone that the line is such a *BEEP*, but if it is too long, I would just order out and take it home to eat it while watching a movie to make the night perfect.

OK...if you're in San Diego and haven't been here, do yourself a favor and go.  Sure, the line may wrap around the building and you may wait for up to, and past, an hour, but suck it up, smell the BBQ smells from the building, and wait....it'll be worth it.  Aside from O'Brien's, I miss this place more than any other place in San Diego.   As you're standing on your ass with your stomach growling, you get to see fixed menus on the ceiling as you wait in line.  So by the time you reach the front of the line, you damn well better know what you want.  Here's what you'll want (I've had almost everything on their menu): Ribs/Chicken dinners: Their babyback ribs are my favorite.  They are drizzled in Phil's excellent BBQ sauce and fall off the bone by just looking at it.  Their beef ribs are a favorite of my old roommate and they are the best beef ribs I've had.  Normally, beef ribs are a little touch, but these fuckers are really tender.   Chicken:  Excellent, also in their excellent sauce, opposite of dry Sandwiches/Burgers:  Their pulled pork and tri tip are the best sandwiches they have.  Their burgers are OK, and if you order them it'll take longer to get it because let's face it: you go there to get BBQ - go get a burger at IN-N-Out or something.  The pulled pork is smokey deliciousness and comes with a surprisingly good coleslaw.  The tri tip is very tender but doesn't come with slaw. Sides: Get....their....damn...onion rings.  Best ever.  They're FAT, like a real onion ring and have a great batter:onion ratio, as in it's got a lot of onion but enough batter to give it a great crunch.  Their beans, potato salad, and macaroni salad are the best I've had - not too heavy either.  Their fries are nicely fried.  May not be the greatest, but they're definitely good. Oh and when you're done, you can wash your sauce-ridden hands in a freaking trough that is motion activated.  GENIUS.  Stop reading and just go.

If I learned that Phil's was serving "long pig" instead of pork, I would still love this place! Get the menu online and call in your order a couple of hours in advance, or you will wait and wait. Ahhhhh, you can smell this place two blocks away and that is with some 6 grand in filters on their kitchen! Yummmmmmmmmm!

Best BBQ in the county. Some amazing short ribs here, but what really blew me away were the beef ribs. I've never actually enjoyed beef ribs at any restaurant before. These are not the usual dried-out fatty bones. They also have a nice beer selection here. You can't top a rack of ribs and a pitcher of Arrogant Bastard! I'm not a huge fan of their sides but given the quality of their meat and beer everything else is a non-issue.

Eddie the older of my two had his first BBQ here.  He had just turned 1.  Repeat again for Daniel, our number 2, just turned 1 in early June. Both love the Big beef ribs... lots of meat on them bones, lots of flavor.  If you are worried about your weight or cholesterol or gout, then do like me and go once every couple of years! :-) The "ribless" was a bit dry, so stick to that as a pulled pork and go with the Baby Back ribs and Beef Ribs. The Grilled corn was good then and is still good. The Onion rings, I went with a half order.  My only negative comment here is.... I went with a half order.   Don't futs around, go for the full basket if you like crunchy, hot, sweet, thick onion rings! Last thing, go early, or be ready to wait in line.  I went on Friday evening at 5PM and got  my order in and a table in less than 15 min.  When we left at 7, the line was already out the door and around the corner... and this is very typical! Oh and really last thing this time, the service was non-stop excellent!  Anything we needed and it was brought to our table before we even could start looking for a server!

Other than the line being very long. I liked the food but what made it great was the server. He was on the move constantly. I did find out that he only received tips from the table and not from the jar at the front. The ribs were decent not to saucy which was a bummer. They did have a sink to wash up that was not in the bathroom. The onion rings were good big and crisp and did not slide out when I took a bite.

this is a place for all you meat lovers. super cheap for some really good ribs. we got the beefy ribs and baby back ribs. i personally loved the beefy ribs because the meat around the bones are a lot juicier. but either way, i think it's their bbq sauce. overall, it's prolly like 2000calorie meal but recommend coming here early and sharing

One Thursday Afternoon can change your taste buds. I was there this past week and i really enjoyed it. I ordered the half chicken half bbq beef ribs and for the price 11.95 this was well worth it. They even supply a plastic bib which worked out for me because I had bright white shirt on. The food was warm and fresh. The chicken was smothered with nice bbq sauce.

Best BBQ in San Diego!!! I only come here for the baby back rib. I tried the chicken bbq once and it was great but I'm a rib person. I love to have my ribs with yummy cole slaw, onion ring and macaroni salad. I always order a full rack and take the rest home. If I happen to crave it at their busy time, I always call in for togo but if I know in advance that I'm going. I will get there early to avoid the line :)

As soon as we parked, there was already a line wrapped around the restaurant (as expected).  I've heard of this place from friends and of course yelp.  So we decided to give it a try since we were in the area &oh my goodness they had exceeded my expectations w/ their food, portions and great service! Luckily enough, my boyfriend & I waited only about 15mins in line until one of the waiters came out looking for parties of 2 to seat at the bar :) Hope to come back soon!

I imagined how hard it would be to review this world-renowned place without being redundant and I'm already struggling. What else could I say about their succulent and tender ribs? Their quick and friendly service? How about their enormous portions for a cheap price? But most of all, I really like the atmosphere here. There's something very unique about it that taking  date, or coming with a group of friends both seem so perfect. It probably is the food. I just wished no one else shared this positive opinion I have so that I wouldn't have to wait in line for so long every time I come here. Remember that if you don't like something about their food, feel very free to ask them - they will make it again for you with a smile.

UMM.. AZING!!!! SERIOUSLY! WOW! I'm so happy to finally have visited this place after all the wide-eyed shocked stares I got from my SD friends from not having been.  Now I will do the same when I meet someone who has not yet tried this place. I wasn't even hungry when I came but I shared a Tickler with a friend. TICKLER?! I thought it'd be small.. it had 3 (actually ours had 4) BBQ ribs smothered in sauce, huge golden-fried onion rings, loads of cool cole slaw, and to top it off (or rather underneath) lots of crispy french fries (w/ potato skins)~ What a happy meal it was. Somehow we fit 12 people in a cozy table in the corner, and as I looked (longingly) at everyone's food.. I was so amazed at how much food we got, for such a decent price. I will forever feel guilty for buying anything the same price for lesser quality. But, that's hard to beat. I'll hopefully be back. Phil's fills f'reals! :]

So we waited an hour and a half to get in, but that's what I get for getting there at 6:00pm on a Saturday night.  But, as most can attest to, its worth the wait.  Plus it was an opportunity to get through some Angry Birds levels =] I don't think I need to go on.  Its all about the baby backs. And its probably been said, but if you can find a place to sit down and eat, then your best bet is to call it in and pick it up.  Happy are those who live in the neighborhood.

When I went to school in SD, Phil's was my favorite place to eat.   Everything on the menu is delicious... everything.  I would recommend the best of both for first timers, so you can have a taste of the ribs and chicken.  My personal favorite was everything on the menu. Ribs, chicken, sandwiches, burgers, onion rings, slaw, beans, potato salad, mac salad, etc. I'd also like to say I'm not a fan of onion rings, but i'll have Phil's onion rings any day of the week. Only downside to this place is the long line because everyone in SD wants to eat some dank bbq.

It was my first time at the restaurant and it will be the last. I brought my Family of 5 after ordering we walked around looking for seating which there was none for a group of 5 except the large booths. Those booths had a sign reserving for 6+ or outside in the cold. When we attempted to seat at the only table that would accommodate us, we were told we could not sit there as they had a large party waiting in line. Really a party waiting in line rated a table while my family and I were told we could sit outside or add a chair in the isle. This was explained to us by the Manager that this was their policy so if someone has a family of 5 we need to eat outside in 60 degree weather or block the isle way or we could get a refund and leave. On top of that our order was mixed up and we had to go back up to get the side my son had ordered. That will be the last $85 you company will see from us and I will be writing my review on Yelp as well. The Manager and sitting staff were rude and not accommodating to us but yet accommodate a larger group who was still in line. I wrote a comment on their website which the General Manager called me a few minutes ago trying to give us a free meal with priority seating. As if I wanted to go back and make some other family have to wait because we now have priority seating for one meal. He tried to say their policy is "First come First serve" unless your a party of 5 because they don't have seating for 5. It boils down to the larger parties will order more so they must have a seat before they even order their food. The food was OK not horrible but not fantastic either, but after being treated like that I guess I should call the local Fire Department and let them know that Phil's is blocking isle ways with customers because they only have 5 people.

My family and I were in San Diego for a conference and we were desperately looking for the best BBQ place we could find.  Based on the reviews posted on yelp for Phil's, we figured this place to be.  After waiting for an hour and a half my family and I placed our order and we looked forward to having a magical food experience. What a disappointment!!!!!! Having tasted several BBQ joints around the country, Phil's has to be the most disappointing BBQ places that I've experienced.  They even tried giving me a gift certificate for our experience and I refused it. I would stay away from this place.  Just because people wrap around the restaurant doesn't mean that it's good, just like McDonalds selling Billions of burgers doesn't make it a great burger joint! If you want some great BBQ, you might want to drive awhile and go to Red House BBQ in Tehachapi, CA.

In San Diego, this is one of the best places for BBQ. I could do without the long wait, but I guess it beats driving to Texas. I will add, however, that if you've had BBQ in Texas, you'll probably be disappointed. Go in without too high of expectations and prepared for the long lines, and you're sure to be satisfied.

Mm, Phil's. It takes about 30-40 minutes of standing in line to get your order. You can check how big it is with their all seeing eye on their website. The beef ribs are probably the best value and easy to hold with one hand and de-meat with the other making drinking with a clean hand that much easier. The potato salad is the best side followed by the fries. And after one visit, you won't even need to wear a bib.

I came here a couple of months ago with my best friends, and I must say that I was certainly impressed. Getting there was an ordeal, as Dane Cook was at the SD Sports Arena and the freeway was JAM PACKED. After 45 minutes of waiting to EXIT the 8, we finally got onto Sports Arena and spent another 15 getting to the restaurant. Once at the restaurant, we stood in line for around 30 minutes before we were finally able to order. I ordered a FULL rack of PORK ribs and some onion rings. The onion rings were to die for. Battered onion rings are the shit. Don't give me that breaded crap unless you want a swift one to the face. This place really has the art of battered vegetables DOWN. It's not an easy task to get your batter just right and cook it at the perfect temperature. This batter adheres to the onion rings wonderfully and gives them a nice crunch. I'm drooling just thinking about it. I don't know if their other sides are really that wonderful - but I do know that the ribs were fantastic. I I have a problem with the fact that they're dry cooked and then slathered with sauce before they're served to you. I mean, the taste is great, but there's something about the meat having marinated in the sauce prior to and during the cooking process that makes a huge difference. The sauce here is good, but I do wish it was a little more cured onto the meat. Let us be honest, the half-hour wait to get in aside, my meal was fantastic. Let's be even more honest, I'm going to bitch regardless. They didn't have collard greens. WTF is BBQ without greens? Are you trying to piss me off? This is why I prefer Huffman's. Their bar area was closed off and a little more private. It was filled with your typical SD crowd, and I couldn't complain. They had a  blueberry hefeweizen that was DELICIOUS. I even got the good girl to have a glass with us. The onion rings made all the difference in my evening. I don't know if I'll have the desire to come of my own volition, but if my friends invite me, I will certainly be delighted to return.

Ok some folks boasted best bbq ever.. I beg to differ if sauce is your main ingredient then this is probably the best bbq place by far, but without the sauce your biting into a tender no smoke, juicy but no flavor rib. I give em 4 if not 5 stars for customer service, food quality not so much, portions are huge which wut all carnivores look for but the quality was a bit low, ordered the combo baby back ribs and chicken with mac salad and fries. ribs ok just over sauced, chicken got dryer and dryer closer you got into the center of the meat again drowned in sauce.. went with a group a folks so we got to pick and taste a lil of everything sad to say if it were not for the sauce this place would be only 1 star, sauce should not make the meal, the meat should haha, sorey been jaded by baby blues bbq in SF a measuring stick for all bbq I eat so far only only one comes close Gorilla BBQ in Pacifica other then that so sad this spot didn't measure up with all the hype.. food *** service **** 1/2 excellent service ambiance *** eh restuarant layout, seats, chairs, sauces, wetnaps haha

My brother: "Hi, can we make a reservation?" Hostess: "No, we don't take reservations. But don't worry, its a good night because we're really SLOW tonight. Come on in." My brother: "ok, great. Thanks." So, we get there and there's a line 10 feet out the door! This is slow?! haha. I guess one time the line was so crazy that it wrapped around the block! You know you got the right place when you hear about lines like these AND you see stickers on the windows from YELP and BEST BBQ IN THE CITY. The line actually went quite quickly and we had our seat in minutes. They give you a buzzer and you go up and grab your food when it buzzzes. Your ribs, chicken and sides ooooze with BBQ sauce and come on a circular plate with sides. They give you a 'Bone Plate' where you can toss the bones you've sucked dry. And they have a whole roll of paper towels for the mess. You're gonna need them! We ordered the 'Best of Both Worlds' baby back ribs and 1/4 of a chicken plus we got corn on the cob AND a gimundo pile of fresh fresh onion rings. I cannot begin to describe how delectable those hot crunchy rings were. I usually try and NOT eat deep fried items but could not pass up on this treat! Use the malt vinegar and ketchup! The ribs and chicken come absolutely smoothered in BBQ sauce. The sauce is thick, slightly sweet but has a great TANG! to it. I probably could drink just the sauce. When you bite into the meat, it just falls off the bone. Its as if the bone was put there just for you to hold up the meat. The sauce gets ALL over your face, on your fingers, on your shirt and in your mouth! But don't use your fork or knife, hands are the only utensils. I don't think i could have this very often because I'd get super fat but will save it for a special treat for when I go down to visit my brother. Great place, with a great atmosphere, a helpful and friendly staff and best of all, speedy service.

Just a great place all-around...I've been coming here for the last few years. It's one of the few places in San Diego that take tremendous pride in their food, and the quality definitely shows. The service is good, the food is good, and the experience is complete. Even though the line might be long on weekends, you won't be disappointed with the food. Since it's BBQ, you have to order the ribs...personally I prefer the baby back ribs to the beef ribs, but that's open to decision. The BBQ chicken was good also, and it wasn't too dry like most places I've been to. My favorite at Phil's has to be the onion rings though...best onion rings I've had in a long time...so I get them every time I come here. Well-deserving of 5 stars.

It seems I am an utter Johnny-come-lately as a San Diegan who has lived here 23 years of my life and never once been to Phils.  A coworker suggested we try them for take-out for lunch yesterday, and after perusing their menu online I ended up just getting what he got. Boneless ribs and chikless chicken, aka a big order of boneless meat and chicken BBQ and covered in delectable BBQ sauce. The sauce was sweet, tangy, peppery, and a multitude of other things I wont' waste space by listing. I called in and ordered, the person who took my order was very helpful and friendly. I arrived and paid, and was pleased to see that they bag your order after you arrive to preserve freshness. My fries were delicious and piping hot, my potato salad used red potatoes YUM!! I could barely eat half of all the food they gave me, (even though I really wanted to) and I was delighted to enjoy the meal again the following day and noticed that like good spaghetti sauce, the BBQ sauce got even better after a day in the fridge. The parking was ample and off-street, the to-go process is quick, and every one of their staff was friendly and helpful and had smiles on their faces. I will be back as often as I allow myself the indulgence. I have to watch my girlish figure after all!

When you think of BBQ you don't really think of San Diego as the place where delicious BBQ exists, but when most San Diegans think BBQ, they think of Phil's! Lines are always long and the wait can be quite lengthy, but I promise it's worth it... The meats, the sauce, the side, oh my...I mean, really, OH MY! To say it's delicious is an understatement and while I'm writing this I am literally salivating on my keyboard. (Ew.) My favorite side is the mac salad...typically I'm immensely disappointed with most place's mac salad, but true to form Phil's mac salad is delish and I could eat the entire LARGE side myself...As for the meats...it's ALLLLLLLL gooooooooooooood. Do yourself a favor and do BBQ like a true San Diegan.

OMG i could've died and gone to heaven right then and there! This place is GOLDEN. I had the combo plate of pork ribs and the chicken. SOOOOO good. This place is barbeque done right and for the right price. The side dishes I got were fries and the macaroni salad - both delish. I normally don't like barbeque sauce, but Phil's sauce was a homerun out of the park. I used my fries to get every last bit of sauce left on my plate. The way this place works is that you line up, order and then find a seat inside somewhere. The restaurant has plenty of room and the wait wasn't terribly bad, especially if you're with good company. If I lived in SD, I'd be obese from eating here everyday! 5 stars...there isn't one bad thing I can say about Phil's. Keep the good food coming, guys.

This is by far the best BBQ place in my book. Every time I visit my brother in SD, I have to eat at Phil's.  I always get half a rack of ribs with a side of corn.  If there's more people, I'll get some onion rings.  I love the food. SOOOO GOOOD. The wait gets pretty crazy, so go early if you can.  However, the line moves fairly quick, but good luck finding a table! especially if you have a big group.

BBQ sauce? good Beef ribs? good Baby back ribs? good Chicken? good What's not to like?  I've only been there on weekdays around lunch and the wait is usually 15-20 minutes, but it's always worth it.  I always get the baby back ribs, then eat the rest of my party's food. I had to knock off a star because I'm not fond of the fries and onion rings.  Fries a little too plain and onion rings were a little too oily.  Also, Adam from Man vs. Food may have gotten the tri-tip sandwich, but almost everything else on the menu beats that. Come here hungry and in scrubby clothing because it can get messy!

First and foremost, hands down to the awesome service here.  We were greeted at first by someone standing at the door welcoming us, then another line director who was just as friendly, and then when I came to order, the cashier noticed I had braces on and informed me of the boneless babyback meat!  How nice is that?   Anyhow, on to the food: We ordered the babyback dinner combo with two sides (macaroni salad and coleslaw) along with BBQ Broham sandwich with pork.  I'm gonna have to say that the best part of the meal was the sides....so that means the main entrees didn't really live up to the anticipation I had of trying out this popular joint.  I have to admit, their macaroni salad was pretty darn tasty - just the right consistency, chunky and not watery gross.  The coleslaw was also really delicious - light and not as watery as many coleslaws I've tasted.  The boneless babyback was a bit on the dry side, and so was their sandwich.  I drove here from the OC just to try this place, so you can imagine how excited I was prior to eating the meal.  If I had a choice between this and Lucilles, I'd definitely pick Lucille's in a heart beat.  Not the best BBQ I've had...that's all.

The best BBQ joint I have ever had,.. besides my lil broski home bbq grilling haha I came here on a Saturday night after Sea World for dinner around 8pm. This joint had a line wrapped around the whole building. FAIL,. we ended up at sushi restaurant next door ( WHICH WAS GROSS, if you follow me,. you can read the sushi review next ) Phils BBQ didn't take reservations, so we left and decided to come back the following day for lunch.  My friends and I came back the next day when it opened and there was already a mini line x__X ! oh nooooO! Turns out the line outside is the line to order food.  You can have someone walk in and save a table while another waits to order the food.  Quick and efficient.  The line moves fast and when you finally reach the front, it's like an ordering service you would do at the mall, order food, give you a buzzard, buzz you when the food is ready, go back to the seat and GRUB!  The staff there is 100% friendly and very helpful. I ended up ordering the full rack of ribs, side of macaroni salad, french fries and onion rings. Also, the trip tip sandwich the El toro that was recommended by the workers.  Of course I shared this with another :) The ribs were so good, comes right off the bone, moist and saucy! LOVE IT! The fries were huge, note: it was a side order,. and it can feed up to 3-4 people! My other friend who ordered the rack of ribs to the face, did not even touch the fries at all. The tri tip sandwich tasted good to me,. but I was to full from the ribs to even enjoy the sandwich,.. one of my friends tried it and said its like eating a cigarette, cause it was so smoked?! I am indifferent about the trip tip sandwich. Onion rings were huge, as huge as my face,. although a lot of people recommended the onion rings,. i just thought it was BLEH,. just regular onion rings to me,. WILL NOT ORDER THIS next time,. it was straight fat filler. Next time I come to San Deigo,. I will be back =)

Lines out the door 11' o clock in the morning! That's gotta say something about this restaurant. This is actually my second time here. The first time was about a year ago. My friends brought me here and ever since then, when I think of San Diego, this place pops up in my head. What I ordered: BBQ ribs with side of cole slaw and onion rings. The meat on this rib falls off and the taste is just amazing. Every bite is an explosion of flavor. It's kind of addictive.

Yep. You def NEED a bib when eating here. The sauce was everywhere, not that I'm complaining, but, I think I wasn't in the mood to eat here. Just because the portions are ridic...again, NOT a bad thing.....but, be prepped to EAT when you go here. From what I did try from others: -Beef ribs/brisket was super soft. -Pork ribs were the length of my forearm. -Beans were super good. -Coleslaw was pretty good, and I'm not a coleslaw person. -Sweet tea, which was supposedly good on yelp, is the kind of tea you can get at any Chevron. -Onion rings, I liked..batter was kind of sweet.

YUM! This was my first meal on a recent weekend trip to SD/LA, and boy did it hit the spot! Even though it was already past 1pm, the line was still wrapped around the corner and it took a good 30 min. before we ordered. My friend and I got the baby back rib & chicken dinner to share with a side of macaroni salad and a side of fries. Both the ribs and chicken were SO delicious! Nice and juicy and full of good barbecue flavor. Though my SD friend claimed that the macaroni salad was the BEST ever, my friend and I didn't share his enthusiasm. Regardless of when you come, be prepared to wait... but it's worth it! If only there was a location in NorCal... -L.

Phil's BBQ? Yes, it is as good as you have heard. Also yes, the line is as long as you've heard. I feel like everyone's first reaction to Phil's is based on the line they see driving up. Out out the door, around the corner, and down the strip mall. Unfortunately you have to stand in the line as there is no reservation/buzzer option. What many people do is have someone wait in line while the rest of your party chills in the car or waits at home. Average wait time 6-8pm? Probably 1.5 hours. Worth it? Yes. If you go at an odd time (3pm?) the wait will likely be only 15 minutes :) A less advertised option for small parties or single riders: sitting in the bar! As long as everyone in your group is 21+, you can scavenge for a table in the bar. It's really not as bad as you'd think! There is quick turnover with bar customers and hovering over someone for 15 minutes while they finish their last rib or beer beats waiting in line for over an hour. You get the same menu and the same great food :) SO, the food? I always get the "Best of both" with chickless (balls of boneless white meat chicken...better than it sounds!) and baby back ribs. The sauce is AMAZING and now you can buy it at Costco in addition to at the restaurant! The meat on the ribs falls of the bone and the chicken is juicy and succulent. For sides, I always get the fries (thin and crispy!) and macaroni salad (not too saucy and clearly their own recipe). I've only gotten to-go once, but I would not order fries to-go again. They were plenty soggy and essentially tasteless by the time I made it home :( I take all of my out of town friends here, and even the skeptical ones are completely awed by the food. Also, the service (once you get to the front of the line...) is great! Smiles all around. They must have a huge staff because there is always someone coming to your table asking if you need anything or want a box. Bottom line: Pros: Amazing bbq, great service, lots of soda choices, decently price, you get to experience a moment of heaven Cons: No options for our herbivore comrades, excruciating wait, not a good place to take a soft-spoke date, not open Mondays!! GO. NOW. :)

The ribs here are definitely one of a kind, they must be smoked for extended periods of time because smoke is intense in every bite, in a good way. Chicken can be hard to do at times but it was decent here. All the sides were fairly mediocre... the french fries, onion rings, coleslaw, baked beans. I am a fan but I am not sure if its worth the lunch rush.. its a great place if you don't have to wait long.

Was here on vacation to take our son to Seaworld and this place had the highest rating in San Diego so of course we decided to try it. I will keep this review short: Other than the long long line you need to wait to even get in, it was hands down one of the best rib places in S. Cali.

We came about 8pm on a Friday and were shocked to see a line reminiscent of a new attraction at Disneyland. It took a good hour and a half to get to order but we came because all our Comicon friends said it was really good and was featured on the Food Network. The servers and the other employees were really nice and courteous but it's really self serve. Order at the front, find a seat, make a mess. The food is great. The ribs (both baby back and beef) and BBQ sauce are amazing. They're very tender and super meaty and deserving of the hype it gets. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review is that the chicken breast wasn't very juicy and the chicken wing was blackened to the point it was inedible. If KFC can make every chicken breast tender and juicy then for this much more money they should do the same.

Was in San Diego on business & a friend who lives locally suggested Phil's. Don't be dissuaded by the line waiting to get in, the wait is worth it. You know a BBQ place is on the right track when they have paper towels rolls on each table. I had the pulled pork sandwich, potato salad & a small order of onior rings (tip: two people can share the small order, it's huge). My only suggestion is to add corn bread to the menu.

If you are staying in one of the nearby hotels and aren't with a group, skip the line and get to-go. Only takes about 5 minutes to get the food after ordering (with an hour-long line wrapped around the building), and the inside is so neat that you will probably still be looking around when your buzzer goes off. I tried the 4 baby back ribs and 1/4 chicken combo, the girlfriend ordered the chickless combo. Everything was incredibly delicious, and it was a very different kind of barbecue than I'm used to. I really appreciated it not tasting like any major BBQ chains or smokehouses I've been to. Don't miss out on the onion rings, they are quite a treat. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the whoopie pie as well. The girlfriend spotted it and HAD to get one. It basically looks like a giant oreo, but it's more like a cake. Very tasty. I must give one final mention to the staff. They were incredibly friendly, helpful, and welcoming. I will be visiting Phil's again, sooner rather than later, I hope.

It's about time for me to write a review about Phil's. I've been coming here for about 3 years now, but I had a 6 month dry spell before I went here my most recent visit (which was last week). To begin, I'm not a huge BBQ fan, but even Phil's can satisfy my picky taste buds. I'm a huge fan of the baby back ribs, and I usually get a half-rack dinner with fries and macaroni salad. The sides are alright, they serve their purpose of taking a break of the overwhelming BBQ flavor, but they are nothing special. Having said that, the ribs here are super delicious. Really soft and super immersed with flavor, it's not a wonder why I always need to take a french fry break to calm my taste buds down. I feel like each time I come here, once the food comes out, conversation stops and everyone just digs into their fabulous ribs. I've also been getting the colossus onion rings each time I go here and they are pretty good. They are really big though, so if you're a fan of small fried onion rings that you can eat in one bite, you might not like these. Just a few other pointers: 1. The approximate wait time marker outside is a lie. Multiply it by 2 to get your real wait time. 2. Be prepared to get your fingers very very sticky. 3. The serving size is huge so try not to over-order (which I always do) 4. Stick to the ribs. I tried their tri-tip sandwich and it was a huge letdown. If you're a BBQ fan and you're in San Diego. It is a sin to not stop by Phil's BBQ.

I've only had Phil's catering, so I can't speak for the line at their restaurant, but I know the scent travels alluringly down the block in Mission Hills. The catering was well done. They have a small fleet of trucks all decked out in flames to haul bbq equipment. They brought industrial strength paper plates, and kept the line moving smoothly. The bbq chicken was good, not overcooked and not oversauced. The baked beans were really tasty, sweet and tangy. The potato salad was good, too, no weird stuff in it. I'm not into fancy or unique potato salad, give it to me straight like mom makes! If I get cranky waiting in line at the restaurant, maybe I'll come back and dock Phil's a star, but for now, the food warrants four stars.

I lived in Nashville for four years, and by no means did any of the BBQ joints hold a candle to Phil's. Phil's is the holy grail of BBQ Ribs . There are a few things I look for in a good rib: Sauce, Tenderness and Size. It's safe to say that Phil's has mastered all of my requirements. I had no idea what to expect, so I ordered 3 of the beef ribs, and a quarter rack of the pork. The ribs are absolutely colossal, I'm convinced they resurrected woolly mammoths, slathered some sweet tangy BBQ sauce on, and fired up the grill. Three of the beef ribs is more than enough to fill you up. The baby back ribs were sweeter and smaller... but both ribs were out of this world. The sides were all great but the ribs and bbq sauce were clearly this restaurants golden goose. I honestly can't imagine a better tasting rib... if your in San Diego, go, and call your gastro doc for a stomach pump following the meal. Go figure, San Diego has the best BBQ i've had... well I guess I should make a trip to Memphis before I can say it's the best in the country. I laughed at the sheer sight of the gigantic beef ribs, it's honestly comedic.

Saturday @ 5PM: Process - First: you line up. DO NOT claim a table without ordering because that's what we did...In that case, I suggested them to put the sign in the patio, not inside when we were about to order. - Second: you wait and wait and wait till you get inside to order, which took us an hr on SATURDAY. - Third: someone will seat you, pick up your food, and munch Food - For dinner combination, whether it's full or half rack, you get to pick 2 SMALL SIDES or 1 LARGE SIDE - Baby Pork Ribs: their ribs are 2 thumbs up, very tender. Love the sauce - Onion rings: it's humongous, the biggest onion rings you'll ever have in your life - Macaroni Salads: not too bad. It wasn't cheesey like most salads out there. - Fries: nothing special about their fries. Service: all the people there are really friendly. Their service is another 5 stars right there. Even the mister that  kicked us out the table (we got a table without ordering) was nice.

Been here multiple times. Sauce is great and the meat is tender. It was a little dry this time, but its generally very consistent and I always very satisfied. Good service, but huge lines.

EXCELLENT service/food/price! The wait staff always had on smiles and asked us a bunch of times if everything was good. One even came out to the lines and made some good conversation while we waited. I would say the pork ribs were on par with the ones I had in Tennessee!! That says a LOT!! I finished the baked beans and coleslaw, too. I'm not a huge fan of beef ribs but they were good as well. I would definitely come back and wait in line again if I have to. Otherwise, I'd just order takeout and get it much faster. I love the sink near the exit--such convenience! If you order out , don't forget to grab some bibs, wet naps, and plastic utensils. The only thing this place is missing is some strawberry lemonade served in jars and biscuits with apple butter. mmmm

Whoa... for two reasons 1)  With over 1100 reviews this clearly must be the place to go. 2)  I visited my sister in Nashville about 6 years ago and had BBQ.  Real BBQ.  It was amazing and I have been searching for it ever since then.  Until today. My visit to Phil's was amazing.  It started off with an awesome greeting from a gal who saw my white shirt and pointed me in the direction of the bibs. Then the price ($7) for a massive amount of amazing pulled pork seemed just right too. I then grabbed an orange beer which was ridiculously good.  The bartender grabbed my food for me when she saw my thing beeping! The food was incredible, the service fast, and now I am headed for a working nap. Big ups to Phil's for bringing true BBQ to the west!!!   My co-worker and I decided that we need to make Phil's a weekly lunch.  Amazing.

Don't let the long line that wraps around the building scare you off... this place is well worth the wait! What else is there to say about this place that hasn't been said by other Yelpers? If you're die-hard meat eater that salivates over the description of beef/pork/chicken slathered in a sweet, tangy, and smokey sauce... cooked to perfection where the meat just falls off the bone... then you absolutely must go to Phil's BBQ. This place makes the "I-hate-getting-my-hands-dirty" eater in me want to lick my fingers after every bite. They have a wide selection of dishes and offer the "best of both worlds", allowing diners to have both chicken and beef/pork dishes! Their pulled pork sandwich is AMAZING and massive. My brother's appetite is usually insatiable, but that sandwich had him beat. Haha. Their colossal onion rings do NOT disappoint. Unless you're a big onion ring eater, I think ordering just one plate of this is just enough. I came with a party of 7 and that was enough for us! They even offer vegetarian dishes, which I can appreciate, but come on... this place is all about the meat! That being said, you might as well throw out any "I'm on a diet" thoughts in your head when you come here. BBQ lovers, you really cannot miss this. :)

BEST BBQ I've ever had! Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely be returning here. There was a long line that wrapped around the place when I arrived (wait was roughly 45mins). My friend suggested getting to-go to feed our hungry appetites faster (wait was less than 5 mins). The aroma was amazing. They have delicious baked beans and ribs! The ribs were very meaty and slides right off the bones. The baked beans are a must! Very good deals, I think it's pretty cheap.

I recommended my friends to come here on Sunday, 3/18/2012, since they were visiting out of town and wanted to know a restaurant they just have to go to in San Diego. I love this place because it's a locally owned restaurant with a cozy but modern cabin feel to it, amazing service, and delicious food. It's one of my go to places in San Diego for BBQ. Notes for first timers: 1. It's better to come here before or way after normal lunch or dinner hours mainly because the line gets long. It goes pretty fast so don't get intimidated but it will wrap around and they even tell you a wait time (it's a sign at the corner of the building). If you're not sure how busy it is, take a peek at their live feed camera on their website. It's on only during business hours, but it'll give you an idea of how long it would take to be able to order. 2. Seating is generally not an issue. They will find a seat for you especially if you come in a large group. Just make sure to have someone sit there while everyone waits in line and orders so you don't lose your seat. 3. Everything is self service except for the cleanup. There is a station for plates, silverware, wet wipes, toothpicks, and bibs. A paper towel roll is located on the table and I would recommend grabbing one or two before you dig in because the ribs are going to make you want to dig in with both hands. 4. You can ask the pickup counter for extra BBQ sauce. 5. If you have a small party and the line is long, check the bar for seats. You can order food and eat there without waiting in line. First off, for the amount you get, it's a great deal. My friend and I split a full rack of baby back ribs with fries and coleslaw. This is my favorite mix mainly because the fresh cut fries are piled on high and the coleslaw adds a nice change in taste and texture in comparison to the ribs. The slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside fries are generally only good fresh, but aren't as crispy as I would like it. This time coleslaw came a bit thicker (I'm thinking a bit more mayo) this time and I wasn't a huge fan of it, but this could be an inconsistency. Although the sauce was a bit off, the coleslaw had nice crisp shreds of green and red cabbage and carrots with a nice flavor to it. The pork ribs are fall off the bone delicious and the BBQ sauce is finger licking good. Other notes about the food/sides: My friend liked the BBQ Broham (pulled pork) sandwich, but I never tried this myself. The beef ribs are tasty and big but a bit chewy. I've tried the chicken twice and both times it has come out dry. The beans come with a bit too much liquid and the flavor is just "okay". The corn is an entire corn, deliciously sweet, and piping hot. The onion rings are good, but rather oily and they tend to skimp on how many they give you (especially in comparison to the fries). I can't remember an exact description of the taste, but the potato salad and the macaroni salad are both good. I remember those two were my favorites for a while. I haven't had the sangria in a while, but I remember it was good. Overall, this is a great locally owned place to get BBQ in San Diego (I'm not going to compare it to any other county). The service is friendly and fast and the food is delicious and usually consistent. No complaints other than the overwhelming desire to bum rush to the front of the line to get to the food faster!

This place is good...the baby back ribs are good, soft, and tender. But I would probably not go back there again because the line is ridiculous and I don't think it's worth the wait.

Almost at a 5. So i had the Baby Back and Chickless Half n Half with a side order of fries. The Good Part: Ribs were pretty good, but not AMAZIING but pretty friggen up there. and the Chicless BBQ Chicken Breast Pieces were hella tasty as well. i LOVED the fries. However, there was too much of their BBQ sauce that it just got everywhere. i'm not a fan of mixing my fries with the BBQ sauce. it was far too sweet for me to handle. another thing, the fries got all soggy once it touched the BBQ sauce so that was unpleasant. but the rest was pretty good. i would give it a 4.3 but its too low to round upwards TRY THIS PLACE. either give yourself time to wait in line, OR come at some obscure time. I went on a Tuesday at 5PM

BEST BBQ, hands down. I don't even like BBQ! But annoying to have to wait 45 min every time. The Place - Always boisterous, indoor and outdoor seating as well as a bar area. Nothing remarkable.. The Service - Hit and miss. They're usually friendly, but always busy.. sometimes forgetful. Well, it's not gourmet, whaddaya want? The Food - What hasn't been said? This place is amazing! The line SUCKS, and always will, but you do what you gotta do. Recommended -  Ladies, one place you can eat BBQ with utensils: the meat DOES fall off the bone.  Baby-back is amazing! Give the beans (side) a chance, even if you don't like beans.. ooh, so good. I can't think of anything on the menu I DON'T recommend...except maybe the chicken- why get chicken at a BBQ place?? Silly. :) Also recommended - plan on spending at LEAST 30 min in line.

YOU MUST TRY THIS!!!! Since this place got over 1000 reviews, I knew I must try it during my trip to San Diego. The Baby Back Ribs were sooo good! The meat was soo soft and just ripped apart from the bones. This was seriously the best BBQ I've ever tried. My friends and I shared the full baby back ribs and we were full afterwards. But I think we could've eaten more. We got the large french fries, but couldn't finish them. The price isn't too bad either. For a full sized, it costed like $19. The wait for this place took around 40-50 minutes but it felt faster. The service was great =] I really wanted to bring some back home before I leave! I really wish we have one in San Francisco.

The ratings speak for themselves guys, and it definitely lives up to all the hype!!! Like everyone else said, you cannot go here without trying their baby back ribs! The chicken is also good but not nearly as amazing. Don't let the wait discourage you, it's worth it.

Get the beef ribs from here!!! Plenty of meat and it falls so perfectly off the bone. I'm not a big fan of bbq or lots of meat, but this place makes me crave it at times. The lines go by pretty quickly and the workers are so super friendly. It's like they love their lives so much just by working there or something!! I usually get the beef tickler. 1 rib, 2 onion rings, fries and cole slaw and I can never finish it. I just love the quality of the meat and how it's cooked to perfection. However, I'm not totally crazy over it because I find it too tangy for my taste. I wish it was a bit sweeter hence the 4 stars.

I would rate it at 3.75 :) They get soooooo busy.  We went to Phil's BBQ at 6:00pm on a Saturday night and the line was wrapped around the side of the restaurant.  I came here with a group of people and the staff is pretty good at getting big groups a table so that's definitely a plus! Food was pretty good...but not excellent.  The bf gave it a thumbs down.  His baby back ribs were a little too burned for his taste and he doesnt like how they skimped out on the sauce.  Which I think they do on purpose so you would pay for the extra sauce.   Other thoughts: Reasonably priced Friendly staff Parking can be a drag

I've been here 5 times already in 3 months and I don't even live in San Diego. I can't give this place an objective review, as I've never been to the South and had "real" BBQ, but this place is as close as it gets in my eyes. The portions are hefty, the prices are slim, and the service is both fast and excellent. Yes the wait is immense but once you order, your food comes within minutes. I'll be moving to La Jolla soon and you can count on me being a regular here! Cheers!

We went on a Sunday right around noon, and I have to admit, the line was really intimidating. To our happy surprise, it moved pretty fast. After reading some Yelp reviews, we decided on the Big Broham sandwich with the coleslaw on the side so that we could try more of their side dishes! We also got a quarter order of the baby back ribs with macaroni salad and fries as our sides. I'm not gonna lie just because this place is so highly rated -- I have had better... but that's because I drove cross-country once and had some unbelievable ribs and BBQ at some random place in rural Tennessee and this is what I compare all ribs to. Now THAT was what you call fall-off-the-bones tender, so I find that whenever someone uses this as a description for ribs, they're usually exaggerating. With those Tennessee ribs, I literally would stick the fork in and the meat would fall off. I don't remember Phil's BBQ being as tender as that, but it was definitely tender... just not "meat-falling-off-the-bones" tender like. Way better than overpriced Lucille's of course. Overall, the food, atmosphere, and especially service from a waitress/bus girl in particular, were all great and I would come back again when I'm in the area in a heartbeat. P.S. There was a HOT model looking delivery man, so single ladies -- get your food catered from here!! ;P

There are so many reviews and I don't want to repeat anything that has already been said so, We attended an event at the event center last night during Beer Week San Diego, the event was well attended, great beer was served and samplings of Phil's incredible food. With that said, Phil's needs to be added to your bucket list or to your 1000 + 1 places to eat, see and do in your lifetime. The place is always packed, and the food melt in your mouth, dance in your stomach great!!!

There is a reason why I constantly think about Phil's... Thank goodness I live in San Diego and can get my Phil's fix just about any time that I feel like it. Poor brother, who lives in LA, and constantly has to suffer, especially when I send him pictures of me devouring those baby back ribs.  I'm so mean. Hey, fast food BBQ that is actually legit, and can cost you about 7 bucks for a tickler (4 BBribs, cole slaw, fries, and two onion rings...which is more than enough for me). There are no words to explain the kind of heaven you realize that you're floating on when you're at Phil's. You just gotta try it for yourself. Yup, I'd consider it injustice if you never get around to trying this. Or maybe, it's a good thing you don't go--then I don't have to wait an hour in line to get my ribs.

I've never really been a big fan of BBQ, but Phil's could definitely convert me into a believer! The people here are super friendly and the food is just guilty pleasures galore. I've been here a few times and I usually like to order from the Best of Both part of the menu when I can't decide what I want. I'd suggest this for first-timers because you can get both ribs and chicken (with sides) for under $12.. That is seriously a steal for the amount of food you're getting! I've never been able to finish a plate here before. I usually get full after eating like 1/3 of my meal, to the point where it looks like I haven't even touched my plate. Phil's is definitely a must-try when you're in San Diego, whether or not you like BBQ!

For ribs I usually go to Famous Dave's, but I think Phil's BBQ wins on this one. The only thing about Phil's is that it has one sauce and famous Dave's has more than one sauce. But damn Phil's its goooooooddddd!

For being on the West Coast and in San Diego this is some darn good BBQ.   A few months ago I woke up craving BBQ - so I got online to see if any places even existed out here - saw Phil's online - so we checked it out, so glad we did! The line is long... But so worth it... If you sit at the bar you usually don't have to wait as long (why do I give out all of my secrets...??).  And that is where we always end up so we can have a pitcher of Heifenweizen to wash down the spicy BBQ.  The french fries are yummy too, they remind of In N Out in a way... and we always get their coleslaw for a side too... The peeps that work the bar are always entertaining and the service is great!

Went here on a friend's recommendation on places to eat in San Diego. It was also close to Sea World, which was where we were heading, so it kinda worked out. The line is super long. There's even a webcam showing the line. From what I understand, you order then just find a spot to sit. However, we had a group of 20, so they gave us patio seating outdoors. (I think you can do this if you have a group of 7 or more.) The patio had TVs mounted, showing sports. Perfect. Now to the BBQ. Let me say that I have never had good beef ribs before. They always end up overcooked and tough without any flavor. I got the beef ribs because my friend recommended them. They were the best beef ribs I ever had. I also had a chance to try the babyback pork ribs. They were also very excellent. For sides, the cole slaw was ok. I'd probably pass on the beans though. I got the onion rings, which were excellent and HUGE. I recommend giving them a shot. There's also free refills on the fountain sodas. The staff there was also pretty awesome. When they came to pick up our finished plates, they provided toothpicks and wet naps. The place also provides bibs, if you're that messy with your ribs. The lines here a long and with good reason. If you're in SD, give this place a try!

Phil's has great BBQ... You can tell because the line goes around the corner. A couple friends took me on a Saturday night and we all got the beefy ribs. I'm very grateful that each table is supplied with a full role of paper towels. I definitely needed it. I tried the coleslaw and the potato salad. The potato salad was awesome... The coleslaw not so much. Minus a star for having to wait for over an hour. Next time I'm definitely calling in for pickup. It's not worth the wait on a Saturday.

OMGOSH I'M IN HEAVEN every time i enter this place full of heavenly meat. haha. this is the only place my taste buds are willing to give 5 stars to. the atmosphere is fun and reminds of the midwest. you also get to wear bibs when you  eat here. where else can you wear bibs in your 20s and still be cool? nowhere, only here :) the food is sooo amazing i don't know how anything else can compare. wait, nothing else CAN compare. the ribs are so juciy, and just fall off the bone. it also has just the right amount of sauce. the bbq chicken is also amazing and the coleslaw is to die for.  i ordered a half and half plate with bbq chicken and ribs with 2 sides and split that with a friend and we still couldn't finish it. the prices here are very well priced for the quality and amount of food you get. they should honestly raise their prices...shhhh. surprisingly i've only been to this place once. that must change. this place is super crowded on the weekends and especially at night...duh. but still, i've heard the wait isn't really that long although i've never been able to get myself to go there when the line wraps all the way around the restaurant. this place will forever be one of the best places to in SD no matter what you're craving for. 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, hands down, the best restaurant in SD

Split the full baby back rib dinner w/ 2 small sides for $11/person (including tax and tip) and you got yourself a filling, delicious deal. Best ribs I ever had. I LOVE the fries here, and the coleslaw is especially fresh. All the workers here are friendly--even the bussers! The food usually comes really quickly (less than 10 min) but once we waited for 20 min (which would be typical for a regular restaurant) and they gave us a free batch of onion rings :D On the same visit, they were almost closing so they were handing out free coleslaw, since they throw out the leftovers every night. Lots of free stuff that evening (:

WOW, Phil's...you're SEX in my mouth. MMMMMMMM I came down to SD this past weekend to visit some friends and they suggest that we try this place out. We came here around 7:30 pm on a Saturday night and WOW the line wrapped around the whole building...always a sign that the place is poppin` right? BTW PARKING SUCKS...lots...small ass narrow (that's what she said! haha) streets with limited parking spots. I was pretty worried about the wait, but my friend said it goes by pretty fast...and boy was she wrong! haha. We waited about 15 mins and we hardly even moved. We decided to just get it to go and head back to eat/pre-party :] We walked in and DAMN the place is huge + there is a bar in the back. There are a bunch of TV's around, but alllllllll of them were playing baseball...except the 2 in the bar playing the LAKERS game...I know it's SD and you don't have a team...but damn its the PLAYOFFS! Anyways, back on topic. I ordered the baby back ribs and chicken dinner combo w/large serving of fries ($13).  My goodness was it fingerrrrrrrr licking delicious. The sauce is AMAZING, just the right amount of spice with bbq tangy-ness. Best sauce I have ever eaten! The meat on the ribs just feel right off and was so tender (& hot even after a 15 min drive home). I didn't think the chicken was going to be good, but I was impressed. The chicken was soft, moist, and juicy...just the way I like it hehe ;] The fries were good, except they were soggy by the time I got home, so it wasn't the BEST. I ate all the meat and about half the serving of fries and I was STUFFEDDDDDDDD. I absolutely love this place, the nice staff, and amazing MEAT!! I will be back forsureeeee. You just can't be the price and the quality/quantity of food you get! Food babiesssssss all day, everyday!

MmMmMmM. Phil's definitely has some good eats. I usually stick with my favorite old faithful (the el toro) but if I'm starvin' like Marvin, I'll order the ribs. The sides aren't the greatest, so I usually just pickup the main entree and grab those elsewhere. The only reason Phil's gets a 4 out of 5 stars is because I wish they still had the Mission Hills location. I remember when they first opened this place, several employees stated over and over that they were going to eventually re-open the Mission Hills place (and it was even on their phone recording). Obviously they haven't and had no plans to. I understand you gotta go where the money is but I know I am not as regular customer as I was before due to the Sports Arena spot and how far it is from my local stomping grounds.

As I'm sure many other people have posted: 'The BEST BBQ I've ever had!' Sadly, living in Southern California there aren't too many BBQ joints to begin with, much less good ones.  Phil's breaks the mediocre BBQ scene with a jackhammer! I could go into a long lengthy review but here is people: Pros: Everything.   Baby Back and Spare Ribs are awesome.  Smoked for hours and fall off the bone. 'Chickless' Breast Meat Chicken is to die for.  Never overcooked and dry.  Delicious and juicy. Delicious sides and large portions of sides. THE SAUCE: TO DIE FOR.  The best mix of sweet, spicy, and tang found anywhere. Cons: Be prepared to WAIT!  When this place is busy, it's BUSY & PACKED.  A true testament to how good this food is.  People are willing to line up around the building and wait up to an hour and a half to eat here.  If you're really antsy, phone in and pick up your food to go within minutes. We found out about this place from watching Man vs. Food and never looked back.  We live about 2 hours away and have made several trips out of our way to eat here.  We'll be coming back for years.  LOVE THIS PLACE!

What can be said about Phil's that hasn't been said before? Here is my take To say something bad about Phil's is to face the firing squad from the evangelists singing its praises. Let's start with what's right about Phil's Ribs Phil's is obviously one of San Diego's most popular restaurants in the city. The line around San Diego waiting to get in to first place your order before your wait for the food and  then search for your picnic table makes the TSA security line in most major airports and a strip search look inviting. Even in our countries worst recession in my lifetime it didn't discourage the crowds or the enthusiasm these past few years. Clearly Phil's apparently can do no wrong. Phil the owner who I have never had the pleasure of meeting is a genius he has amongst the best ribs in the world.Ok all food is subjective. As a jaded ex New Yorker tasting his ribs at a corporate party was a game changer for me years ago. When I heard ribs was being served I ate before the party.I wasnt a big ribs fan previously.The Kansas City Barbeque in Downtown San Diego secured that feeling about bad ribs.It was awful. Bad mistake Kansas City BBque is not anything like Phils! One taste of Phils and I was hooked like a drug addict. The ribs have right amount of spicy sweetness with a nice charred crust on the outside with a moist tender flavorful taste with good mouth feel. If there is anything consistent about Phil's it's always the quality of the ribs. Unfortunately I have also (though rarely) received room temperature ribs which is frustrating after spending 70 plus bucks for lunch for 3  people and the long wait for the food and the line. To be fair they typically do the ribs right if nothing else goes well. But why do I continue to love this place? Did I say the ribs are great?!!! The management at Phils is simply excellent having conversed in the past. with these folks.They understand its not about mass feeding but building good customer relationships.Many of the team members are passionate about their customers and brand. You have to admire that. The pressure they are under with the volume of folks they serve.Phils and their management team find some very caring team members to their credit. Things that annoy me about Phils.The potato salad frequently is semi hard like a rock with undercooked potatoes. I stopped buying it for parties and meals. The barbeque chicken could be a great product here with the same great sauce however it is frequently made to far in advance and served dry like leather after being thrown back on the grill And because it is reheated after being cooked to far in advance  frequently is warm in one place and room temperature in others. I have stopped ordering the chicken. The fact is when they make it to order for our corporate functions it is fantastic. My guess is they take more pride when it is a function in getting things right. Their worst crime against dining humanity is when a new customer walks through the door and orders a complete meal with French fries They pour barbeque sauce drenching the fries in sauce. Though this may bring pleasure for some when the fries are crisp and it is eaten within minutes its certain misery for others. When the fries are undercooked as they have been once in awhile and they are drenched in sauce and you do take out and bring home it can get ugly.... Upon arrival home you have wet under cooked greasy soaking wet fries dripping in sauce that cannot be reheated. Hello? what are they thinking? It's not pretty and it turned my dining guests off where we dumped fries for 8 into the garbage can one evening. They should warn folks but they assume everyone knows their quirks and assumes everyone likes this treatment or are too busy to communicate it to their guests. To their credit when I call up to place an order a red flag goes up to not drench fries in sauce.They leave it off.......Ah the perks of being a regular! I'd like to give Phil's 5 stars out of love however its ribs only for the most part for me and a few of the side items they don't mess up At the end of the day long live Phil's! Great Ribs nice folks that work there, infuriating long lines and a dose of inconsistency. But I admit to loving the place anyway. They try to the best of their ability to take care of the customer even when the cooking goes into auto pilot as it does with the chicken.All that said when the urge arises I too need my fix of  Phils Ribs.YUM! Bring a lot of patience. Other than that Kudos to Phil's it's a San Diego institution and success story which cannot be denied

More like 3.5 stars. I went on Sunday but line was crazy so returned on memorial day for lunch. Still there was wait but it wasn't bad. We waited about 30 mins. (Compared to some reviewers wait time of 3 hrs... whole lot better)  Ordered full baby back rib dinner and onion rings. Proportionally... it was 75% side 25% main (ribs) Just way too much fries!! I think it should be opposite! Rib was really saucy but meat was juicy. I just wasn't that impressed with meal thus don't get what the rave is about. It's worth a visit but not worth waiting, especially if you were to wait more than 30 mins.

Technically,  should be a 2.5. the line is ridiculous and I'm not certain why, because as you see ,i don't think its worth a1 to  2 hour wait. The meat is not tender, but rough and chewy. The sauce has a lot of vinegar, its quite tart.  Very crowded space. however their french fries are definitely worth a trip or two =0)

Food is definitely not bad... But I do really think it's way overhyped and overrated. Let's say the only reason I would be back is if 1) I'm in the area and someone suggested and 2) If there is no line.  There are a lot of better bbq places out there. So I guess I won't back anytime soon. Should you try it? Sure....maybe you will love it like the few thousand of people who does. :)

Perhaps the place was WAY too hyped up for me. A bit disappointing, although, it was some serious BBQ business. The ambiance of the restaurant was loud and fun. A lot of excitement in the customers and the employees. Especially the guy greeting the customers in line with menus and samples. We were a big party and was seated at the very end corner of the restaurant so it was kind of nice to chat amongst ourselves and not have to yell across the long table. Food was good. Worth the wait? ehh... kind of half and half. Baby back ribs, beef ribs, chicken, fries, onion rings, cole slaw, chicken salad... we had it all. The famous BBQ was a little tooooo tangy for my taste but that is just my preference I prefer the spicer BBQ sauces. So, if you like sweet tangy BBQ, this is the place for you.

After the disaster meal I had at Smokin Bulls BBQ, we needed to have our faith in BBQ renewed, so we went to Phil's. We waited outside in a line for about 10 minutes...Whhhhhaaaaaa waaaaaaaa!!! People waiting!! Hahahaha, there's a reason for that! We chatted with people in line who were also looking forward to their meal. We have been going to Phil's since they were on Goldfinch, and we waited in a line there!! Good things don't change, or, you hope they don't. Once inside, we ordered a Pork Rib Tickler and a Beef Rib meal....for a total of less than what we paid for at Smokin' Bulls. Our meal arrived in just minutes. The pork ribs were just the way I like them. Moist, flavorful and covered in Phil's tangy BBQ sauce. I ate my onion rings first, with some Ranch dressing, then the ribs, with the fries. The beef ribs were delicious and huge. In all, another fantastic meal at Phil's. Phil's still is my favorite BBQ place in San Diego.

I'm going to buck the trend here and admit that I don't find Phil's all that great.  Maybe it's because I frequently smoke a big fat pork butt or beef brisket in my own backyard pit.  Maybe it's because I've had really good Q around the country.  I don't know.   I do eat there, but mostly because friends want to go.  To me, Phil's is like the Wonderbread of BBQ. Take a recent lunch.  The ribs did fall of the bone, but then that's not really tough to accomplish.  The trick, is to keep just enough body to give them a nice snap.  The meat itself was pretty bland.  No spice, no smoke, nothing.  It's as if they parboiled them, gave them a quick grilling, and then slathered on the sauce.  And as for the sauce, it's too sweet for my taste and I'd prefer a little more back-of-the-throat heat.  Yeah, I know.  That's a personal preference.  And that's why I typically serve dry and then let my guests choose the sauce from several.  At Phil's, there's one sauce.  It's sweet.  And it's often applied excessively. Along with the ribs came two onion rings.  Bland onions and bland battering.  The cole slaw is rough cut, a bit on the dry side, but overall not bad.  The fries, however, aren't very good.  Too limp and undercooked. The portions are large here and the place is almost always packed, so it's obvious that lots of people enjoy the food.  For me?  Eh.

*Lines and wait time --- Ridiculously fast for a BBQ joint, Order first then pay, find a seat ( we sat a group of 10 easy on a saturday afternoon) and waited no more than 10 minutes for our food (that's like Chinese restaurant status folks!) *Food --- Large portions. Sauce was not too overwhelming and barbeque-y for the occasional bbq eater.  Cant go wrong with the half and half combo is my advice. * Sides --- I base the quality of the bbq joint based on sides they offer and hands down Phil's has the best MAC salad. From the mayo amount to the size of the macorni, everything was just in harmony.  Onion rings are a must get! batter tasted sweet, and the onions I swear felt like 1cm thick. *Service --- Cashier was cool, understood that i was a noob here and held up the line deciding what to get but she didnt rush me at all.  The table cleaning lady was super fast. The second a guest left, she stormed right to clean up , put our tables together for our large group and called us over.  =*) I Value great service. Bottom line:  Phils pwns Lucille's

The line was wrapped around the building.  Advice: call in and pick up your order.  That's what we did and the lady who answered the phone said 'Smart move!!'  I thought their food was a little overpriced. I didn't like a lot of their sides.  I liked the fact that they had chicken w/o bones for you.  So if you're a big white meat person, this place is perfect for you.  Their bbq sauce was good.   I don't have to come back here when I visit.

Yummy!  My very first time here....and it was quite delicious.  I had a glass of wine while waiting for the order.  BF and I phoned in an order... I was sad that to order from the bar you had to actually EAT at the bar.  Otherwise you had to wait in line with the fans. I am not sure if I will go back to dine in...but definitely will pick up to go.  I had the Chixless meal with a baked potatoe.  It was very good. Parking actually wasn't too bad.

Yelp says a 3 star rating is A-OK.  I say it's JUST OK.  2.5 stars. I didn't care for the sauce.  The baby back ribs were not fall off the bone tender.  The sweet baked beans were also decent.   Dreaming of Dream Land BBQ which my friend tells me is the stuff...well that dreams are made of.

I went there on Thursday Oct 8th just after 9pm.   Ordered a full rack of ribs (pork). I have been wanting to go here to see why there is always a line out the front door and sometimes around the side of the building.  There was no line tonight!  I didnt realize that you ordered at a register and, then they gave you a number so that you food was delivered, but that works well for me.   The ribs were fine, not fantastic.  There was black little crunchy burnt pieces on the outside of the ribs from it being bbq.  The side orders were just ok.  I think they might have been from costco.  The beans and potato salad were less than average and the garden salad seemed exactly like the mixed greens you get from costco with three slices of tomato on top. With an ice tea, my full rib dinner was about $24.   I was not crazy about the place period.  I did have high expectations based upon what I have heard on the street and those crazy long lines I see when passing by.

I've been to Phil's BBQ a handful of times now and I have never been disappointed. They're probably the best BBQ restaurant to eat in Southern California. The only problem is that there's always a long wait with the line often stretching around the corner of the building. Once you make your order though, the wait for the food is not long at all. If you can stand in line for 30 min - 1 hour, then I'd definitely recommend this place. A couple of recommendations: Beefy / Baby Back Ribs - If you're in the mood for ribs, they have a choice of beefy ribs or baby back ribs. I always prefer the beefy ribs. Don't underestimate the portions; the beefy ribs have a ton of meat on them so you'll definitely be satisfied. Something like a Half Order or a Best of Both (combination of ribs and chicken) will definitely do for an average appetite or even just a Tickler if you want to eat light. Broham - Make sure to try this huge tender pulled pork sandwich with bbq sauce. it comes with cole slaw, which I usually ask for on the side or leave it off altogether. El Toro - I wasn't really a big fan of this tri-tip sandwich. I didn't think the marinade went well with the tri-tip. I'd take the Broham over this any day.

I don't think there is enough good things I can say about this place...it's as good as it gets in terms of BBQ in SD. The Broham sandwich is my favorite, the meat is tender and smothered in sauce, while the bun is thick and absorbs all the goodness of the juicy BBQ. Every time I visit Phil's I must order the onion rings...I find myself craving these darn things all the time! You can't go wrong when you choose Phil's for lunch or dinner. The staff that works here is great and they're very helpful, you can tell that they truly love working there which says a lot about a restaurant. One word of advice, prepare to wait if you decide to go during busy hours such as 6 or 7. I always try to go at non peak times which works great because I am able to walk right in and sit down. Overall I'm obsessed with the food at Phil's. Side note: Phil's BBQ online offers a webcam that allows you to check the status of the line so that you can anticipate your wait period...pretty awesome!

There's a reason why I give this place 5 stars. It's good. Really really good. GO THERE. BE THERE. EAT THERE! Even if there's a long line, just wait. It's worth it. It doesn't even matter if I hype it up. It'll meet AND exceed your expectations. There's also a reason why people get jealous when you mention you're going to eat there. Make people jealous, and go try for yourself. Best bbq ribs ever.

I waited two months to visit this place until the BFF came for his visit to SD. All the anticipation made my hungry belly growl even louder seeing that I work less than 2 blocks away and the smell of Phil's BBQ somehow always lingers in through my doors.  When we arrived one busy Saturday afternoon, he almost turned around after seeing the enormous line. it took some pleading and some definite persuasion to get him to stand in the line. 30 minutes later we were placing our order...Had the El Toro and Beefy ribs plate and an oatmeal whoopie pie. What can you really say that hasn't been said yet? Is it good BBQ? Yep, especially the beefy ribs...OMG. Would I wait in the line that is always no less than 25 minutes? Probably not.... I've smartened up and decided anytime I need a Phil's fix, I'll call in and pick it up. Grab a whoopie pie on the way out---I suggest the oatmeal. It's legit. BFF/SD 4

I wanted to go see what all the hype about Phil's was so I went, and Im sooo glad that I ordered over the phone in advance.  The place was PACKED with a line wrapped all around the building.  Clearly many people love it and it is a local hot spot. As for the food, I loved it for what it was.  Good old fashioned BBQ.  The only thing that was missing were a little greens and some corn bread on the menu, but I didnt mind.   The ribs were great and you have so much fun just eating them with your hands.  However, since it is a bit on the heavier side I personally wouldnt go too often.  But if youre looking for some BBQ just order take out so you avoid the lines and you still get some yummy grub :)

Yes, I finally made it to Phil's new, mega pig pit on Sports Arena Blvd. Same FANTASTIC ribs and sandwiches, but I have to admit, I liked the cozy, crammed and tiny place on Goldfinch better. Just seemed like you were at a buddy's shack having a good time. The new place does have more space for the old "table turn", so I can understand the reasoning. Line can be long, but moves fairly fast. Besides, half the fun is smelling the smoke and wondering which bone to pick :) Well worth the travel time and the cost of gasoline to get to Phil's. Really is THE best Q in town. Enjoy!

I have been living in san diego my entire life...how did i not know this existed! went for the first time a couple weeks ago and it was a great experience! the line looks like it would take forever but we went with 10 people and we were able to get a table no problem. I decided to go for the 3 beef rib dinner, don't let the 3 confuse you, as good as it was i could only manage to eat one! i also got fries and cole slaw on the side.  i was very happy with the ribs but i think i will substitute one of the sides for the mac salad (tasted it from a friends plate and was sad i couldn't eat all of it!! ) my boyfriend got the baby back ribs with cole slaw and potato salad.  he was pleased with the baby back ribs but after tasting my beef ribs he decided he would go for the beef next time. he loves cole slaw and was very pleased but would not get the potato salad again. the portions are massive! next time....hopefully soon...my boyfriend and i will definately share!! BEST BBQ I HAVE EVER HAD.

This is the place to go to for BBQ in San Diego. Why? Who else would have a sign outside near the parking lot indicating how long it takes to get to the front of the line. Just like the theme parks when you wait in line for a ride. Seriously good BBQ. The COO of our company (a native Texan) loves this place so much, he had Phil's cater some of our employee events. That's how I found out about this place (when it was still in Hillcrest). The baked beans alone are good. FOOD: You can't go wrong with anything here. There's even a decent number of drinks to choose from. SERVICE: Always friendly! But the line can get long. Tip: Don't go during dinner rush. Show up a little before 8pm.

It really is everything you could want in a dining experience. No need to go into details, the hype is TRUE. I've been to Phil's several times (I have love handles to prove it) and it has always been an awesome experience. Sometimes a good product makes up for bad service. Take for example, a Mexican joint in the straight hood. You risk your life eating in the hood, the service never fails to disappoint, but the food is worth the suffering. At Phil's, not only is the food absolutely incredible, the service and atmosphere is always enjoyable. And you have one added bonus, it's not in the hood :)

LOCATION: close enough to Seaworld and easy to find for out of towners  like us. SERVICE: Spectacular! Every staff member was oober efficient. Line was out the door and AROUND the corner (literally) and every once in awhile, a Phils BBQ staff member would come out to check on us. FOOD: Probably one of the best if not THE best  BBQ I have ever had. Quality ribs...smoked just the right way. Both the beef and baby back ribs were delicious. RECOMMENDATION: Ticklers are a bargain. For about $6.95, you get a few ribs, a side of coleslaw and a beer battered onion ring to top. PRICE: Great prices for the portion and quality of food you are getting!

Hmm, what can I say? I can't give a very good review of this place because well.. I'm not a 'barbecue ribs' type of person. Anyhow, I'll do my best. I've only been here two times and both times I have ordered the baby rib dinner(?), sorry I don't remember the name. So yeah I guess it's good, but I don't like how it's spicy. They should give you a choice of mild or spicy. I ordered it with fries and macaroni salad. First off, I've had better macaroni salad and secondly... I LOVE their french/freedom/american/deep-fried potato fries! I think that's the only thing that I truly like/love from this 'establishment'. If you know me, you would know that I usually like my fries like I like my (fill in the blank), and that is thick! That's how I like 'em, but on the contrary, these fries here weren't and I still love them and think they taste amazing! And another thing... I'm not a fan of the onion rings. They're too oily and too much batter was used. As a result, they can be really hard at times. (That's what I said) So yeah, I understand that lots of people love it, but disagree with me if you'd like.

I love BBQ and this place IS BBQ! Phil's has the best beef ribs I've ever had. The ribs were big, meaty, delicious, and came right off the bone. The sauce was just fantastic, it's impossible to not have it all over your face! My dish came with five ribs and i was only able to get through 3.5 ribs (and I can eat a lot)! I ordered two side dishes, the coleslaw and macaroni salad. They were okay (I've definitely had way better side dishes), but it didn't matter because the ribs were friggin' awesome! Not only is their meat awesome, but the people who work here are all really nice too. Whenever I find myself at a restaurant which service matches its high quality of food, the restaurant definitely deserves a high mark. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in San Diego and I'll be sure to try their sandwiches! In short: Awesome BBQ. Awesome Service. Wait... not so awesome, but totally worth the wait!

I usually go with the chicken and ribs combo and the girl gets a pulled pork sandwich. It really is as good as everyone says it is. If there is a long line do not freak out, they do an excellent job of getting people in and out (and no you won't feel rushed). Another way to order is to call it in and then take a short drive to the beach and enjoy the scenery while you have a foodgasm.

I'm a big big big fan of Phil's BBQ.  This place is amazing and my family and I make sure to come here every time we vacation in San Diego. I don't think there's a single dish I've had here that didn't disappoint. Pork ribs are a must... the chicken is always juicy and flavorful... even the sides are awesome... we always enjoy the onion strings, bbq baked beans.. .heck, even the steamed veggies are great. The portions are HUGE and you can't beat the price. The only "complaint" I have .. and it's pretty darn minor... is the fact that they don't offer a type of bread.... be it corn bread, or rolls or biscuits. I know that this probably isn't that big of deal for most... .but I enjoy a little carbs with my meat. Also, be prepared to wait... the line gets crazy on the weekends. So go early.

First of all, if you like to stand in a line for up from 30 min. to an hour or several hours, then Phil's BBQ's extensive waiting line will not aggravate you. Not only that, but when I got to eat their so-called famous BBQ ribs, I found out how pathetically overrated they turned out to be. Considering how much red sauce they pour on in piles on your meat, you can't even taste the ribs, only the disgusting sauce. Sure the sauce was good, but would you guzzle down a whole bottle of BBQ sauce or ketchup? It was crowded, food was ruined with sauce trying to mask away the taste of the meat, and the service was so-so. The only thing I'd say that was good about Phil's BBQ, is that they have take-out boxes for you to grab as many as you like, which I thought was convenient, but I didn't grab any because I didn't want to have anymore of their food as leftovers. Overall, an overrated restaurant that is only popular by their name, not their food. Give it a try if you dare, but if not, go and taste the best BBQ in town which is 'Pinnacle Peak'!.

I visited here with my wife because we heard a lot of good things about Phils. I went to the hillcrest or northpark one. The line was out the door so I had really high expectations of this place. However, Phils did not deliver for the following reasons. The wait was terrible and we had a difficult time getting a seat. This made me more hungry than usual. This usually mean the food will taste even better. It didn't. We ordered the pull pork sandwich with coleslaw. The bun and meat etc wasn't what I expected. The ribs were okay but somewhat dry and the sauce was nothing special either. I felt like I was cheated somehow and lied to. It was more on the pricey side also. I guess I have been spoiled by the Wrangler in El Cajon and Everett's and Jones in SF. I originally rated Phils 3 stars but as I was writing this review and thinking back about my experience, I got pissed off and downgraded them to 2 stars. I am not coming back.

If you call for take out, they'll just ask you show up and then prepare the food for you - no wait at all. We ordered the full baby back rib dinner and it was served on fries. Yum!

Phil's BBQ SD: Midway Thursday February 8, 2012 Five Star I am always surprised, when I have not review a place that I have been too at least 20 times.  Today, we went to Phil's at 1:30pm and there was no wait for food or a seat.  Don't get me wrong, the place was still crowded but manageable.  This was my first time eating in the main dinning room. (Usually I sit at the bar section to avoid the other hungry barbecue lovers and their barbecue loving kids.  Plus BBQ is much better with booze.  I had the Broham  with Coleslaw on the sandwich itself.  My food took a while but it was worth the wait.  The BBQ sauce is so flavorful that my taste buds tingle - perfect combo or salt, vinegar, and spices.  The meat was moist.  The Bread had a crispy outside but soft inside.  (I only wish that the bread was more easily cuttable).  The baked beans were good as always. The french fries are delicious- it comes salt-free which I love, because the potato tastes smooth.  Well enough my rambling, Phil's is truly a five star establishment!

I don't really like beef ribs however I love them here.  Nice, tender, and will fall off the bone.  I also love their famous onion rings, baked beans, and their coleslaw.  Definitely a MUST eat place when you are in San Diego!!  Avoid the holidays (wait can be 2+ hours) and peak times.  If it's too packed and there's only two of you, try going to the bar (right next door) or if it's really bad I would do take out (separate line).

PHIL'S BBQ - 12.17.11 [The Story] It's College Bowl Game Saturday & all my bro-in-law has in the beer fridge is an abundance of COORS & a half case of his wife's Longboard Lager (which is a'ight, but wasn't about to dent her supply). I ask if it's possible to make a (craft) beer run before the afternoon games start..."SURE!" he replies. His buddy, Armando G. says "Phil's BBQ is right around the corner from BevMo, let's pick up some ribs, you fly I'll buy!" "Beef ribs?" pointing at my wife... "Beef ribs?" pointing to her sister... "Beef ribs?" pointing to bro-in-law... Before pointing towards me, I tell him that I'm still full from brunch, so I'm good. I guess he wants BEEF ribs. I'm not a real fan of beef ribs & prefer baby backs, but hey, he's buyin'. Armando is on the phone placing his order before we're out the front door. He asks for 2 orders of Beefy Rib Dinners, which consist of 5-6 bones each & a couple of sides, which is more than enough. Beef Ribs ONLY (no sides) - $18 per order Beef Ribs w/Sides - $20 per order "30-40 minutes? Cool!" After picking up a couple sixers of assorted IPAs, we headed for Phil's. The girl on the other end of the phone order assured "Mondo" that the order would be ready when we got there. [The Skinny] WTH? There's a line around the building! I've never been to Phil's so I was somewhat surprised. Thank gawd it was the "dine-in" line. As we head towards the front doors, I was happy to see that there is a second line...the phone-in/pick-up line. Mondo asks about his order & the girls says, "it should be about 5 minutes" & hands him a paging coaster. No worries...we wait outside & there's a beer cart which also sells Phil's BBQ sauce. COOL! So we purchase a beer for each of us and before we're done with 'em the order is ready to go! It's a great idea having beers available for those waiting in line. That line IS long! [The Downlow] We get the beers & ribs home and sure, I had a rib...and as expected, a little tough, but by all means, meaty AND tasty. The baked beans were delicious, but the potato salad seemed...familiar. Nothing special. Pricing is very comparable to some of the better BBQ joints in my neck of the woods (Los Angeles). I'll give Phil's beef ribs 3.5 stars since I've had worse, but not nearly as good as most. I'm definitely going to order the baby back on my next visit...so please look for the update in the near future. BTW: Phil's bbq sauce is the shiznit! I'll have to pick up a bottle on my next visit to S.D. Eat, drink & be awesome. deez® out!

Out of the 700+ photos from this restaurant, not nearly enough pictures of the lines. It wraps outside around the restaurant like a Disneyland ride, even the way the line moves is similar. Slow but moving. I waited over an hour just to make the order, but the food was ready within 20 mins...Dont come here on a Saturday at 6pm-9pm (rush hour). Honestly, it was really good bbq.  but i rarely crave food that needed to wait 1.5 hrs for the food to arrive.  Which is the reason why i still havent tried Pinks yet.

4.5 stars Had to come here on my Mymy vs. Food tour in San Diego! The wait wasn't too bad because we came before the dinner rush and the food came out pretty quickly. Had the baby back ribs which were super tasty and melted off the bone. That bbq sauce is a freakin winner! Had the large side of a baked potato with everything aka melted cheese and sour cream. Wish I got the potato salad because it was hella good, but stole a few bites from a friend. Wish they had mac and cheese on the menu; that woulda hit the spot! Phil's BBQ has got their formula down and they are doing everything right. Definitely worth stopping by and waiting for it! Oh and in the battle between Mymy and food at Phil's BBQ, Mymy won.

4+ star rating w/ over 2600+ reviews?!  Kind of impressive, and unbelievable at the same time.  Made me skeptical, but with that many positive reviews, how could it be bad?   We had no choice but to pay a visit with these stats, unfortunately after eating the food, I thought Phil's was just OK. We first showed up on Saturday at 2pm, the line was so long, that we decided to leave and come back another time.  There was no way the little BB would wait around for an hour or more quietly... Tried again on Sunday at 11:30am, we had much better luck this time.  There was still a line, but it was only a 20 minute wait.  Definitely doable. Good:  This place is super efficient at serving a large number of hungry customers - you wait in a line, when it's your turn, you order and pay, they give you a buzzer, you serve yourself drinks, pick any open table, then when your buzzer buzzes, you pick up your food at the counter, and grub!  Portions are large, and prices are very reasonable. Not so good: I don't know for sure, but from the look and taste of the ribs, I doubt they are 100% slow smoked.  Tell tale signs - no smoke ring, not much smoke flavor, meat very shrunken off the bone.  I would guess that they make smoke the meat for a short period, then finish it off by baking it in the oven.  Furthermore, the sauce is TOO sweet, salty and sour.  It has the taste of chinese sweet and sour sauce, which is not really my preference. I ordered the beef rib dinner (3 beef ribs, coleslaw, potato salad), the total price for this meal was $13.95 (not including tax and tip).   The meat was tender, but I couldn't finish my meal, because it was just way too salty.  Maybe it would have been better if you ordered them dry with sauce on the side...? In any case, it was pretty good, but I probably wouldn't wait 20 minutes in line or suffer the hour long drive just to eat there again in the future.

The El Toro sandwich and baby backs are awesome! 4/5 only because they don't have mac n cheese, biscuits, or mashed potatoes. Place gets crazy packed, but we showed up at 5pm, so the wait was only about 20 minutes.

I got to Phil's around 7. The line was wrapping around the building but luckily we had some friends that had been waiting a while and saving us a spot in line. If we started at the back it would've been 2+ hours. (Note: If you plan to eat in-house, I suggest logging onto their website and checking out the webcam of their line. It is a great tool- use it!) The line is the reason I give it four stars. I've chose to eat elsewhere on many occasions because I just didn't want to wait forever. When you do finally get in you go up to a cashier, order, and wait for your food. Much like a fast food resturaunt.  A hostess type person will point you in the direction of a seat and then you go to town. Now for the good part... The food! I ordered a half chicken/ half ribs dinner. Definitely the best BBQ ribs I've had in San Diego. They are amazing. Cooked to the point where the meat just falls off the bone.  Not over or under cooked; just right. Then they cover it in their special BBQ sauce which has such a great flavor! The chicken wasn't anything special. A bit underwhelming after the ribs. The bbq sauce is the only redeeming quality. If not for that it would just be plain old chicken. I got the french fries and baked beans for my sides.  The fries were the same thing you could get at any old resturaunt, nothing particularly special, and the beans were okay.  They have this seasoning at the table that I think is meant for your fries but I added it to the beans which actually made them really good. My suggestions: -Go for the ribs or a pulled-pork sandwich. -Order take out. You can eat in the parking lot or at home. You're really not missing anything by not eating in-house and the line is a million times faster -If you do want to eat here, try to avoid weekends and any time after 7 or you'll be in for a nice long line.

MEAT GALORE.....Beef RIbs is where its at.  Portions are insanely huge so order accordingly. There are so many reviews for this place you'd be nuts to not try it. Friends got babyback which falls straight off the bone and bbq chicken(bleh).  The sides are also delicious so make sure you get some potato salad and fries.

I eat at Phil's fairly regularly. The wait may be long, but the food is truly worth it. My favorites are the Broham, El Toro, the Baby back ribs and the to die for Macaroni Salad. While waiting in line, talk to Doug. He is great to help pass the time.

I was on vacation visiting my girlfriend for her graduation from UCSD, I was told by many to give this place a try. After doing my research on http://yelp.com it did not take much convincing for me to head over. The first thing that you see upon driving up is the long line that wraps around the building. The line was ridiculously long, but the people did not seem to mind waiting for 2+ hours. I myself eagerly walked up and took my place in line. The smell of the smoky bbq wafted its way into the parking lot. I swear I was salivating profusely. Eventually I made my way in and ordered. I got the pork ribs and cole slaw and fries. It did not take long for me to polish off everything...boy was it tasty! I am so sad that I don't get to enjoy this on a weekly basis.

I miss you, Phil's Sports Arena! I used to work right around the corner and haven't been back since, only because of the distance. Lunch here was a weekly routine and never disappointed. We learned to call our order ahead of time since there is ALWAYS a lunch rush, no matter what day of the week. However, the BBQ chicken is delish and I can't shovel their fries in my mouth fast enough. Sometimes I would be "healthy" and order a side salad instead of the fries, and even that was great, with a tangy raspberry vinaigrette. I'm a simple girl who likes simple food, and Phil's delivered every time.

LOVED that we didn't have to wait in a 2 hour line (sorry can't tell you the secret to that). Pros: RIbs were tender and the juicy meat fell off the bone.   Fresh cut fries were addicting. Eric, our server was nice. Cons: I wouldn't order another Sangria there. The 2 hour wait looked horrible. I'd be a grumpy hungry bear by the time I got to the front. I don't know how I feel about the self-serve everything.  It seems convenient and effective for the size and traffic they get, but it just means more people walking around and possibly bumping into trays of bbqed food and drinks.  Just sitting down at our booth, a server dropped a  tray of dirty plates and a rib landed on a friend's seat. Overall, I would come back, but only if I didn't have to wait more than 30 mins OR if I came with a bunch of friends willing to wait and be entertainment for 2 hours.

cold Sat night and was itching and craving for some ribs. So made the long trek from oceanside.  I arrive in good spirits and starving like a holocaust prisoner and see people standing in a line that went from the front door that wrapped around the side all the way to the back about 100+ft. Aw man was I bummed. Can't stand in the freeze for an hour+ so I called  and asked for take out. They said yes but there is a separate line for that as well. It was much shorter but I still had to stand in line for 45 min...for phone order wow, lucky phil. restaurants are closing down and look at this place. Ok now for the grades. A- for service even though it was a complete mad house on sat + valentine's day. Food was knockout, even eating from take out carton. And separates phil's from all the other bbq places that has been disappointing are the sides. Here their beans are just right, not too sweet an rich which is the culprit at most bbq's and the fresh cut fries were not dry like in n out burger's. For that amount of volume and quality is unheard of and mind boggling....my 1st 5 stars review. They should def open one up here in N county to relieve some of the massive orders from the main location.

Ok. There are so many mediocre reviews on this page. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, My husband and myself have traveled a good part of the US and know good food when we taste it. This BBQ joint is fabulous. Yes, on Saturday night it was crowded. We waited in line for 45 minutes. We did find a place to sit once we ordered and our food was served promptly after we ordered. The bbq sauce that Phil has concocted is by far ingenious. The sweet tangy spicy mixture is sure to please even the most picky eaters taste buds. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves an adventure and some good food!

Oh, the long line phenomenom. You know a place is good when there's a busy crowd abrewing. And Phil's is no exception. We came here the same night as the Glee concert. At least the almost 2hr wait had an entertaining crowd. It was nice to see some of the staff outside, which made the wait even more fun. The food here was really good. I ordered the babyback rib tickler which comes with 3 ribs, coleslaw, 2 onion rings, and a MOUNTAIN load of fries. Way more than a tickle, I will say. Afterwards, I felt like I was attacked by the tickle monster and put into submission. My minus one star is because of the sauce. Although it was pretty yummy, it tasted really familar. It reminded me of the jerk sauce at Layalah's patties. Weird. I think that confused my tastebuds, seeing as I was eating American BBQ. I will defintely be back to try out the rest of the menu items. However, I'll probably opt for the order out option. No more waiting eons that delicious food.

I went to Phil's BBQ on a Friday night, that was a bad idea! Packed with lots of people, meaning they have really good food. They also have this new rule that you have to order your food first then find a table to sit at or else an angry black woman will chase you out of your table. So remember to order then find a seat! I got the full rack of ribs with fries and potato salad. The only thing that I didn't like was the potato salad. The ribs are really good along with the BBQ sauce. Try it but wouldn't go there every week or anything.

Okay so I think if you read enough reviews of this place you'll find that there are two camps, those who love this place for what it is, namely a pretty damn tasty bbq joint in San Diego. Or there are those who hate it for what it isn't, namely, their mom/dad's BBQ in Tennessee. To be sure, there are some things I would change, and I've only had the Broham (pulled pork sandwich) and the Toro (steak). Both are really tasty; whether or not they qualify as southern BBQ is not for me to judge, since I've never had southern BBQ. However, I do recognize that the BBQ sauce is really vinegary and that the meat lacks a bit of seasoning, so to that end, because of it's simple menu and mission statement I'm dropping it a star. Other than that, To the people who give poor reviews: you are expecting an eskimo to make the best chorizo, it's not going to happen, and it shouldn't either.

I need to preface this with the fact that I lived in Texas for five years and have had BBQ in both Dallas and Austin, so I may be a little picky about my pork.  So to speak. That said, I really enjoyed my meal at Phil's. I ordered the BBQ Broham which was a pulled pork sandwich topped with coleslaw on a giant whole grain bun.  I also had a side of sweet baked beans. The sandwich was enough to feed 3 people (I've still got at least a half-pound of pork in my fridge).  I pulled off half the meat and tried to eat the sandwich, but not only was it just too big, the bun wasn't all that.  It was kind of tough and bland, so I skipped the bun and used my fork to munch on the pulled pork, which was tender and delicious! The coleslaw was good - fresh n' crispy, could have used a slight kick.   The baked beans weren't memorable, though... I didn't even finish them.  They weren't bad, just didn't make an impression on me. The sauce was sweet and slightly spicy... good, though I have had better BBQ sauce.  I know people can throw down over BBQ sauce, so I really can't say on a scale of sauce how good it is.  It could be award-winning for all I know.  I'd eat it again, so it couldn't have been crap. That's the best I can tell you about the sauce. I did have an onion ring from someone else and that was quite good. They were those big-as-your-head size onions with an inch-slice, battered (not breaded) and deep fried.  If you want a heart attack, bad breath and deliciousness all in one food, go for the onion rings. I also had a bite of corn, which while good (how can you mess up corn on the cob?), it wasn't grilled, but boiled. So it was kind of flavorless and mushy, in my opinion. But my friend was really enjoying it so I didn't want to burst his bubble. The staff was attentive, bringing us extra sauce and whatever we needed.  The guy at the counter where you picked up the food barked at us quite a bit, but I figure when you've got that many people asking where their macaroni salad is, you're bound to snap at some point. They cleared tables pretty quickly... which they had to because it was PACKED. We got there at 4pm sharp and by 4:15, there was a line hanging out the door and wrapping around the building. We *just* missed the rush. The atmosphere was similar to many of the BBQ joints in Texas, but it lacked a bit of that authenticity of those places.  It had an ever-so-slight "chain restaurant" vibe to the decor inside, but I think that could just be because it's newer. It lacked that  iron brands, dusty floor, down n' dirty cowboy feel.  You order at the counter and then they buzz you to come pick up your food, though, which is a fairly typical set-up for BBQ places. Overall, was it the best BBQ I've ever had?  No.  Would I go again? Totally!  I'd like to try some of their other menu items.  There aren't a TON of BBQ joints in San Diego, so I'd say Phil's is your best choice for authentic southern BBQ.

Phil's BBQ.  As of today, there are 4.5 stars.  I rarely give out 5 stars so I'm giving this place 4 stars.  It is good. The sauce is good. And I'd try it again.  But I don't think it is one of those things that I'd ever have a craving for (like an In N Out burger. Did I just lose all credibility?). I ordered the beefy ribs and chickless with the large side of potato salad.  The ribs were beefy and the chickless were boneless, as they should be.  The potato salad was a little bland.  I had to dab it in my BBQ sauce to make it good. The parking is so tight!  And when I say tight, I mean it in a literal sense.  Their parking spots are so small.  The wait time wasn't all that bad.  They have a sign that says "21 minutes from this point."  It kind of makes you feel like you're at Disneyland.  They also have menus outside.  You have to tilt your head upward to see them.  I guess it is their way of having you "keep your chin up".  Okay, not funny.

Food: Thumbs up Service: Friendly Price: Reasonable, about $20 per person All our friends from SD or that have recently visited SD were raving about this place so we had to try it this time around. We had just come from a long day of walking around Wild Animal Park and the Beach so were waiting in anticipation for a belly full-o-BBQ that night. Alas, we arrived at 6PM and the line was out the door and around the building. We heard there was a concert at Sports Arena, hence the extra demand, but we waited FOREVER in that line. 1 hour and 30 minutes, to be exact. And then another 15 minutes for the food after ordering at the counter. What is worth it? I would say yes. We got a full rack of beef ribs and baby back ribs. I liked the baby backs better than the beef - the baby backs were tender and meaty with just enough fat and sauce. The sides included: 1. Corn on cob (nothing special, kinda dry and not that sweet) 2. Baked beans (nothing spectacular) 3. Coleslaw (highlight of the sides - probably the best coleslaw I've ever had. Lightly marinated with mayo, lots of fresh cabbage and other veggies). Look forward to going back, but hopefully we won't have to wait more than an hour next time!

After my last experience at Phil's, I had been wanting to give them another shot, but never found myself in the area.  Finally, I found an excuse, and headed on down to get myself another BBQ burger. Well done, Phil's.  Well done. Well, no...the burger wasn't well done.  It was medium-rare, and cooked perfectly.  And smothered in BBQ sauce goodness.  Their job was well done.  Or rather, done well.  You know what?  Nevermind, this is confusing. Now I know that they can kick butt all around the BBQ, not just on the ribs and chicken.  Very satisfied with the food, quick customer service, and speed of food prep, I'll be returning here faster next time.

The Verdict: "Wait, let me wash these ribs down with some fries." Finally, after years of hearing about Phil's BBQ, I went and tried it for the first time...and man was it delicious! I'm not usually a fan of BBQ, which is probably why I didn't feel the urge to drop everything and run there, but when I finally did make my way out to their new location, smelled the tantalizing aromas of roasted, bbq meat in the air and then sank my teeth into the most tender, moist and flavorful baby back ribs ever, I was hooked. Because we went at 2:30 pm, we only had to wait in line for 15 minutes. Normally, I'm told, the wait is longer and the line usually curves around the entire building and then some. Parking was a bit of a hassle, but we managed to find a spot in the nearby lots. While waiting in line, we were aided with large menu singage to help us make our decision. To ameloriate the chilly weather, they provide space warmers near the entrance. Once we got to the counter, we ordered the baby back ribs dinner, chicken dinner, the best of both worlds plate, a chicken sandwich, onion rings, and for sides we ordered fries, steamed veggies, and potato salad. We were given a buzzer to let us know when our food was ready. After about 15 minutes, our food was ready and that is when the flavored-packed, tender bbq meat eating session began! The baby back ribs were the best I've ever had, with the meat falling right off the bone. My only complaint was I didn't like the dark burnt pieces on the meat, which I picked out and left on the side. The chicken was also great, but not as good as the ribs. The fries were perfect to compliment the saucy and bold flavor of the bbq. The mixed veggies were also a pleasant surprise because of the good portions and that they were not overcooked - al dente. Service was also friendly and fast! Prices were reasonable - for 6 people we spent $55 (tip included). I loved that there was a sink to wash our hands when we were done, right next to the soda fountains. It was obvious that cleaniliness was also a priority here! The decor was also cool - a combination of sports bar meets country-western style. Overall, I had a great experience and enjoyed fantastic food. This is great for families, large groups or couples, a real charmer! Would  I Recommend It? Yes, I'll surely be back! Hee-haw!

1502 reviews...WOWZERS!!  My friends and I rented a house at Ocean Beach for Memorial Day Weekend, and since I'm the only one from all 20 of us that Yelp, I was in charge of looking for places to eat.  And with all the reviews from this restaurant, this was a definite must try in SD.   We pretty much had a little of everything: baby back ribs, beefy ribs, BBQ chicken, steamed veggies, baked potatoes, & sweet baked beans.  My favorite was the beefy ribs, and I mean BEEFY, fall-off-the-bone tender ribs!  Might I also add that they're huge!  I was pretty much a carnivore that day so I didn't try much of the sides.  But I think I'll be dreaming of those BEEFY ribs for the days to come.  We definitely need a Phil's BBQ in LA, or better yet, in the San Fernando Valley. Oh, and one last thing, we ate here Saturday, and because there was still food leftover, I was able to bring some of the beefy ribs & chicken back home to the Valley.  We ate it for dinner last night...boy oh boy was it still finger lickin' good, oh yes it was!

BEST BABY BACK RIBS I'VE EVER HAD. In short - these are the best baby back ribs ever. The meat FALLS off the bones. The sauce is sweet and smokey and zesty. I can't stop thinking about those ribs. I even wrote to Phil's and asked them if they could open more locations; I really hope they do it. I'm thinking about driving back down to SD just to get these again...! I am happy but now I am more mad at Phil's BBQ because now I can never eat baby back ribs anywhere else!!!

Maaaannn... it seemed like everyone and their MOTHER had eaten at Phil's BBQ -   everyone except for Julius and me.  Could you blame us?  Every time we drove by the place around dinnertime (starving), the line was wrapped around the building. One Sunday after bargain-hunting at Kobey's Swap Meet, we decided it was the perfect opportunity to see if Phil's BBQ would be less crowded.  Lo and behold, it wasn't.  As I walked towards the end of the line, I passed by a sign that read "25 minutes from this point."  WTF!  Julius then told me to check if there was open seating at the bar, so I bulldozed my way through the herd of people, with a Zen-like mindset.  I utilized the Law of Attraction and the Power of Positive Thinking to visualize two vacant seats at the bar, and like magic, in the midst of a sea of diners,  a beacon of light shone over two perfect, empty seats as angels sang the Hallelujah chorus in the background.  Sarcasm aside, I just couldn't believe my luck! I ordered the Pork Tickler which came with fries (that I doused with malt vinegar) and a really tasty coleslaw.  I've heard so many accolades about Phil's BBQ that I was pretty surprised that the meat on my pork ribs wasn't falling off the bone, and the BBQ sauce wasn't anything special.  Still finger-lickin' good nevertheless.  Julius ordered the Beef Tickler, apprehensive at first because the menu said it came with only one rib.  To his delight, this one rib was like a big brontosaurus rib straight from the Flintstones! Adding to Phil's lively atmosphere was a flamboyantly fun friend from high school that we happened to bump into at the bar.  He and his motley crew of friends kept the Sangria and the slurring that accompanied it flowing.  "Sunday Funday!!!" they kept toasting. Phil's BBQ was a fun time, atmosphere scoring higher than the food.  Now that we've finally eaten there, we can cross it off the list.  Yeah, yeah, we may have been the last people in SD to go to Phil's, but you just try beating me at my mad seat-snaggin' skillz... Word to ya MUTHA!

Best baby back ribs I've ever had.  Hands down.  And the sauce.  Damn I love the sauce.  I heard the chicken was dry, so I didn't get that.  But DAMNNNn I love pork ribs nom nom nom. And their onion rings! Delicious!  Heart attacks are definitely served at this place haha

Damn.  That's my adjective to describe this place...just...Damn.   If you ever take a girl here on a first date, just remember she will be neglected because you will be focusing so much on those dam tasty ribs (baby back OR beef).  Sorry babe for neglecting you lol, but it was your idea to come here.   This is probably the best bbq place in Southern Cali...hands down.  The meat on the baby back ribs fall right off the bone and the bbq beef ribs are so meaty and flavorful, smoked to perfection.  Another delicious delight are their onion rings,  deep fried in all its glory.   My gf and I drive down here at least once every two months from Los Angeles/OC just to eat here.  No joke, it's that good.  Even though sometimes we need to wait in line for over an hour, it's still worth it.  But if you can, try getting here early, maybe around 5:45ish to save yourself some wait time.

PHIL'S!!!! Ever since the sister brought me to Phil's, i have never gotten a more satisfying southern food fix than here. Lucille's and baby blue's has got nothing on phil's! the line to order is always so ridiculously long, unless you go once the restaurant opens or in-between meal times, like at 4pm. you may also track the barbeQUEUE to check the status of the line. the service there is awesome... they know southern hospitality. the food is to die for. they use their own barbeque sauce that customers can purchase at the restaurant and the meat falls so easily off the bone. i always get the ribs, my preference siding towards beef ribs. either way, the portion sizes are HUGE.... and relatively inexpensive. all of their sides are nummy... even the fries are fabulous. i love their biscuits and buttered corn. i have had friends who have driven down to sd on a whim for the sole purpose of eating at phil's... it's just that good :)

I must be spoiled. There are over 2000+ reviews for Phil's BBQ, and I just want to say that between the wait and what I got to eat, this place was kind of a disappointment. I have been here before two times awhile ago. Once was sit down, which was probably over 4 years ago and admittedly forgettable and the other was maybe a little over 2 years ago for a To Go order(to cheat the wait). It's like when someone tells you that you have to go see this awesome movie and about how it's the best movie of whatever year and it's worth seeing in the theater. Then it turns into a letdown. Not what you expected. That's how I feel about Phil's. The wait was about 30 minutes in line. Felt like we all were waiting for an amusement park ride. I went with a few friends and my wife and it made the wait faster. You get to the front and then you order from a counter. After you order, they give you a pager and then you head out in search for a table. I got the BBQ Broham(pulled pork sandwich). Again, I have to be fair, because I did not order ribs or the BBQ chicken plates/dinners, so I went with the safe choice. I mentioned I being spoiled earlier. My wife makes a bomb pulled pork sandwich and Phil's did not have me really wanting to come back for it. It was good and the sides were really really good! I got coleslaw and baked beans. Oh, the portion was quite good if you're into portion sizes! I couldn't finish the bottom half of my sandwich cause there was so much pulled pork to eat! I tried my wife's Tri-Tip sandwich and although the meat was of great quality, I felt that there was a bit too much BBQ sauce. It would have been okay if the sauce was a little more subtle, but it overtook the meat easily. In the end, maybe I'm just not so crazy on Phil's, and I know there are tons of reviews of people that say they are. I would go again for sure, but it's not a place I'm really excited about. Parking can suck, so be forewarned.

It's hard to hate on Phil's.  The food is good, they are super generous, great atmosphere, and I take basically all my San Diego guests to eat here at least once.  I've never, ever had anyone say they didn't enjoy their meal.  So, it's hard to complain.  Their sandwiches are great can feed a family of 14.   The ribs are moist and flavorful ... they do in fact fall off the bone.  But truth be told that's where the problem starts.  Boiling ribs makes them too moist.  Proper ribs are smoked so when you bite, the bit you bit should come off the bone clean.  At phils, you take a bite and the whole rib comes sliding off the bone.  So, if you really know BBQ don't expect it here.  Expect good food, generious portions, and super moist ribs. That said, I do enjoy Phil's and since it's so close to home I'll keep going back.  But when I got hankering for some real BBQ with that true smokey goodness, I'm heading to Coops in Lemon Grove. P.S. The line at Phil's blows! Out.

Came here after recommendations with friends. I don't eat ribs often so can't really compare but the food is pretty delicious here. I got the baby back ribs, the sauce flavors is very strong which makes it salty. But the meat is cooked well. The place is pretty packed, even on weekdays.

I'm from Texas and when it comes to real BBQ not grilling.  I have the right idea about how its suppose to tastes and look like.  When we arrived at Phil's BBQ the line was about 35 mins in 100 degree weather.  Eventually a hostess came out to us and asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar.  I gladly accepted and thanked the nice hostess who helped us find our way inside the restaurant.  Since it was a hot day I had to order the Stone IPA on tap which cooled me down slightly.  On the menu there were all kinds of dishes with sides that are made to perfection.  When you see the prices you will be amazed to see how much BBQ you get for the price.  The portions are enough to last at least 2 meals.  For only $6.99 I ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  It was amazing I loved the mildly smokey flavor and the juiciness of the meat.  Everything was cooked right and the sauce was almost perfect.  It might of needed a little bit more vinegar but either way it was still a very good sauce.  Trust me if you like American Smoked BBQ and been to Lucilles this place will leave you with and overall better experience.  The quality of food is a whole lot better at Phil's BBQ.

When I got there I wasn't sure if I wanted to wait in the long line.  It was lunch time and the wait was about half an hour.  The people around us said it was worth the wait, and it sure was. I forgot what I ordered, but I know the next time I'm in San Diego, Phil's will be the first stop.

I hate you Phil.  You and your delicious barbecue have cost me precious hours of my life that I will never get back.  Ever!  And yet you would keep me coming back.  Making the drive from god knows where; it could be anywhere in SD and if someone would utter the words "oh, I've never been to phil's" then, of course, it was on like Donkey Kong.  And then the wait when you get there... excruciating.  You can see them grilling your ribs in that fantastic sauce, and the messy grins of the happy patrons that are seated and eating or were smart enough to order ahead.  Such torture! Yet still, 5 stars.  It's that good.  I would walk through hell and back for some Phil's.  A good choice if you're feeling indecisive is the Rib Tickler or the Chick Tickler (sounds dirty, don't it?).  You get a takeout box full - literally FULL - of crispy fries, onion rings, yummy slaw, and three ribs or chunks of chicken for around $6.99.  It's really a lot of food, and it's all so damn tasty!  They are also nice enough to provide a handwashing station in the middle of the restaurant for dine-in guests.

I didn't really know much about Phil's when I tagged along with a friend and her mother on a trip to their favorite restaurant.  After scanning the menu, I picked out a chicken dish and a side of corn on the cob, filled up my soda, and sat down at the table to eat. Oh.  My.  God. Can we say heaven in all it's chicken-y goodness?  The first bite of tender, perfectly cooked meat slathered with the tangy-sweet homemade barbeque sauce left me licking my fingers and wishing my stomach could pack in about four more of those meals (although reason stepped in and told me that if I gave into my cravings I would indubitably burst all over the restaurant booth).   Phil, you are a genius.  An evil genius.

Very Casual: benches and serve yourself.  The baby backs are great so here's what you do: CHECK THE BBQ CAM on the website!  (How cool is THAT!) 1) Call in your order.  Order double what you can eat. 2) Ask how long is the wait to pick it up. (BTW: Parking is GREAT) 3) Enter through the East Door, stand in line, run to car with the food. 4) Serve half the order at home, with lots of napkins (=2 rolls paper towels)  Pretend you made it. 5) Eat the rest for breakfast tomorrow. 6) Double your cholesterol pills. ENJOY!!!!

(Tip: sprinkle pepper and use the ranch from the onion rings order as a dip and it's yummolicious!) DELICIOUS fork-split-fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs!!!! Worth the drive from Orange County, CA!

I don't really want to give Phil's 4-stars because a dinner there didn't incite a "Yay! I'm a fan" reaction in me, but peer pressure (1600+ reviews for this place!) bumps my rating up rather than down. FOOD // I ordered the Baby Back and Beef Rib Ticklers. Yes, it was good, but compared to the BBQ I've had before (Baby Blues in LA is fantastic), it isn't stellar. It's slathered in sauce, it's tender, everything is...good. Do my salivary glands start automatically go into overdrive when I think about their food? No. Am I counting the nickels and dimes in my piggy bank to save up for the next meal there? Nah. And: THEY DON'T HAVE CORNBREAD. WHAT. That's like a Chinese restaurant not serving rice. EXPERIENCE // The line! I think part of the reason people love this place so much is how desperate you get from hunger standing in line while staring at people eat, smelling the aromas, and fantasizing about the combo you're going to get. Denial makes the heart grow fonder. I do like the feel of the place. It's casual, familial, and I believe the manager/owner came by our table to say hello and make sure everything was going well. Good food. Good prices. Good is good, but with a line out the door and around the block, I wanted AMAZING and it just wasn't there. And I can't get over not having cornbread with my ribs. whuck ;(

ZERO STARS!!! As far as the BBQ goes, it's good. Not great. Certainly not great enough to wait for over an hour in line! Really! Oh yeah, and before you say, "Dude, go somewhere else then!", you have to remember that this is one of only a couple of decent rib joints in San Diego proper. With that said, I'll sum up my review this way. Get a bigger joint or risk eventually losing all your customers to the perception that you have to wait an hour to eat. Believe me, my family and I can live without eating ribs!

Phils offers the best BBQ in SD. In case 120+ reviews isn't enough for you: Beef ribs are my favorite.  The baby back ribs, bbq chicken, and pulled pork sandwitches are great also.  And OMG - Fresca from the tap!  The wait can be long and portions are large so be sure to show up early and hungry.  Would you believe you could stuff yourself silly with just 3 beef ribs?  I didn't think so.

I have to tell you all a little story.  Here we were, wandering Target, wondering what to eat: "Santana's?  No.  Con Pane?  No.  Starlite isn't open yet.  Just went to Neighborhood yesterday.  (Now walking out of Target) Where the hell are we going to get something to ... what's that smell?  WE'RE GOING TO PHIL'S."

It was nearly a month ago that I was instructed to "get my ass over to Phil's" without any delay, and in the way one does of my adopted San Diego home, I took my time. Three weeks later I made it over to Phil's, and I did so without Sarah and with the full understanding that I was going to get some serious ass kickin' when she learned that I excluded her from the first try. Of course, this also meant that I was gonna have to find some way to make it up to her. And actually, what I like to do is treat her to something real good and when she's riding the high of that... that's when I hit her with the news. Poor form I know, but it seems to work. I had the pulled pork sandwich with a small side of potato salad. That and their beer of the month. The line was a solid half hour long so I darted straight for the bar, ordered and was out of there, mouth abuzz with bbq delight within twenty minutes. GREAT! It's kinda clean. And it's a huge operation. Menu is simple. Food is fantastic. I knew I could take half for leftovers, but I didn't.

Man, I love this place!  If I had to chose to eat one last meal in San Diego, I'm pretty sure I'd pick Phil's. I'm not the only one who loves this place, so be prepared to wait for a seat.  That line out the door?  Normal.  Just get in line, and bring your appetite. When you order, you MUST get the baby back ribs.  They're ridiculously good.  The other stuff, like chicken and beef.  They're good and all, but Phil's is know for their ribs.  Don't make a mistake.  Order the baby back ribs! Once you order, enjoy!  Your stomach will thank you for coming here. BTW, I'm not the Phil that owns this place, I'm just the Phil that dreams about owning this place.

Freakin' awesome place! Fun atmosphere and friendly service. The food is so delicious! I came for lunch and had the Broham, which is a pulled pork sandwich. I ordered it with a smalll side of fries and a soda, which came to about $8.50. When I picked up my order, I was happy with the amount of food. The sandwich was huge and overflowing with meat!  Tons of fries for a small order. Did the sandwich taste as good as it looked? Yes! Tender tasty meat drenched in BBQ sauce. Don't worry about making a mess on yourself. Besides regular bathrooms they have washing stations. Two stand alone sinks for you to wash your hands. Very good idea. I liked the food so much I thought about coming back the next day for the ribs. I didn't, but next time I'm in SD (or San Marcos, where their other location is), I'll be sure to drop by!

I love good barbecue and over the years I've seen restaurants come and go with most not leaving much of an impression on me or my taste buds.  And then I found Phil's BBQ!  Although I think I prefer their first location and it's homey atmosphere, I can live with the larger, more distant place they're in now.  Getting to Phil's takes a bit of time from where I am, but if you know how to get to the old Sports Arena you'll have no trouble finding this restaurant.  I've always dined during the lunch/late afternoon period, and it's always busy, so it might be wise to plan ahead if you're up against time constraints.  I've not ever waited more than 10 minutes for my food to be ready, but sometimes finding someplace to sit down and eat it is a bit of a challenge.  However, in addition to the very large sit-down dining area, Phil's has a moderately sized, full-service bar just inside and to the left of the front door, and this is where I choose to have my lunch on most occasions.  It's got all of same 'accessories' as the main dining area, a I kind of enjoy sitting where I don't have to yell to be heard and don't have to constantly dodge other diners and they come and go.  Having easy access to my favorite beer or cocktail only adds to the pleasant experience. Depending on what your idea of real barbecue is, Phil's may be on your list of favorites or at the very least, a great alternative to the usual burger routine.  The food is freshly prepared to order, and the prices won't send you to the poor house.  The same applies to the bar menu - drinks are reasonably priced, in my opinion.... especially considering Phil's location and it's proximity to the beach and sports complex.  Locals and tourists mingle quite nicely at Phil's, and I can certainly understand why.  I give this family-owned establishment two thumbs up and look forward to many more happy dining experiences.

This place is overrated, food quality I'd give it 3 star, but for the service and food portion I'll give it 5 star. ADVICE? the food portion is really HUGE!!! a full rack meal with 2 potato sides can really feed up 2 ppl..no kidding, THINK CAREFULLY before you order lol!!! I was suggesting to get different items and share with my friend so we can try everything, but my friend was being selfish and say he'll eat up all his full rack of baby back ribs..so we ended up both getting the full rack of baby back ribs..at the end..we both couldn't finish half of our plate n he regretted: why did we order so much food? (we also ordered a 1/4 BBQ chicken and a small size onion rings) This feels like a BBQ fast food place because the foods come really fast, when we finished ordering our food and when my friend walked to our table, the buzzer buzzed already, our foods were already ready!!  for the food portion, price, speed..simply amazing. :) Not the best baby back ribs I ever had, their "baby" are pretty huge and meaty but doesn't taste that "baby", what m I talking about? it didn't feel like I'm eating baby back ribs, more like child back ribs, but it's all good, it's better than barely having any meat on the rib. The sides:  Potato salad turns out good after I sprinkle some cajun seasoning, but be careful don't sprinkle too much/hard they are pretty salty. Onion Rings:  don't know what's the deal with the rings, they are just huge that's it....yes they are good but I can imagine each of those ring contains maybe 150-250calroies.   What I dislike: sauce!! Their sauce are way too tangy and overwhelming..way too much that it overcome the taste of the meat, I had to use my fork to get rid of the excessive sauce on the ribs.  I wish if they could have different flavors of BBQ sauce to go with, like Lucille's.  I think Lucille's beats Phil's on the sauce selections, I like Lucille's BBQ sauce and sweet/hot BBQ sauce, they are much less tangy than Phil's sauce and the hot BBQ sauce adds spicy to the ribs. What I would suggest them to improve on: 1. sauces - more selections would be nice. 2. wings!!!! BBQ wings is a must for a BBQ restaurant. Next time I think I'd rather order by phone and just go pickup instead of waiting 30min+ in the line.  But overall, good experiences!!

I was visiting Shamu with my family and our friends told us to check this place out. We arrived at 5PM on a Tuesday and their was only 2 people in front of us. The ordering process is similar to Armadillo Willy's where you order at the counter, they give you a pager, and you pick it up. I ordered a full rack of baby back ribs with cole slaw and potato salad. When my order came up I got my paper towels ready and dug in. The sauce has wonderful flavor and has just the right amount of spice to it. The cole slaw and potato salad was also very good. By the time 6PM came around the line was around the corner. I must say if the line is going out the door on a Tuesday, this place must have some good ass ribs!

Go early, because the line gets pretty ridiculous here. But I would have to say it's worth the wait. Like I said in a previous review about BBQ ribs, I'm not exactly an expert, but I do-so-love the baby back ribs that they serve here. The side of fries is fairly large...I got macaroni salad, too, but it wasn't that good, so just stick with the fries. One thing I do need to mention is the service: EXCELLENT service. They are super duper friendly and they really want you to have a great experience. One lovely worker came by and asked us how we were doing and what not, and then added "Was it PHIL-nomenal?" OKOK it was a little cheesy, but I'm just trying to say that they try really hard to make it a great time for all. =D

There's not alot I can say about Phil's that hasn't already been said here in the 800+ reviews. So I'll keep it short. Phil's BBQ has the BEST ribs and onion rings I've ever had. It doesn't even matter if you don't like BBQ - you should try Phil's. It's like a SD culinary landmark (we have few enough of those in SD). I even took my aunt and grandma from San Jose here - two old Vietnamese ladies who eat ribs like once every five years, and even they liked it so much they wanted to come back! Also, for those who have never tried the Beef Ribs, TRY IT. I stuck with the traditional Baby-Back Ribs my first few visits, thinking "what the heck are beef ribs?" But ever since I've taken my first bite into the ginormous Beef Rib, it's been getting harder and harder to go back to the baby-back. Damn, just writing about these damn ribs is already starting make my mouth water. GO TO Phil's!

I've always wanted to be review #1040. Now is finally my chance! Pork Ribs -- awesome. Half Rack (6-7 bones) with two small sides (beans and slaw) was the perfect amount for me, and I would say most people. = $12.95 They have beef ribs and chicken too, which I'm sure are excellent. 1 star off for not having corn bread. Say WHAT?! Also, I'm a fan of a spicier bbq sauce, but it is still so delicious. Lines can be long, but service is fast. Come hungry!

Phil's, a love story... I love your delicious meaty sweet and tangy goodness. From your Big juicy behemoth beef ribs, to your delicate, virtually fall off the bone baby back racks, you are one sexy carnivore heaven! Your sauce, oh how I love your sauce.... I must have a side of you to drench my meat and douse my crispy Phil's fries. Onion rings, I have not left you out, your so damn good when your hot and crunchy, a side of ranch makes you look so mouthwatering good, I can hear your crunch right now. We go way back you and I, Goldfinch still holds a special place in my stomach...um...I mean...Heart! It kinda bums me out when I drive by and see a pizza joint there... it just doesn't feel right. I love the new location, its so much bigger (HUGE compared to Goldfinch) and faster and there is so much parking!! Phil's, my stomach and your food, we make a good team.

I've always loved Phil's. You just can't go wrong on their menu. The new location is amazing at moving through the BBQ loving crowds. Service is always fast and friendly. Although I love the baby back ribs, I'd recommend trying something new. The El Toro, tri-tip sandwich is delish! My latest visit reminded me why I love Phil's. My 2 year old son got sick while we were waiting in line outside. The staff came over quickly, helped to clean him and the area around him up, rushed us over to order at the to-go line, gave him a Phil's BBQ shirt to change into, and got us all drinks incredibly fast. This just epitomizes family friendly. On previous visits all the staff chat with my kids and give them tons of smiles. It is refreshing to go to a dining establishment that not only tolerates kids, but enjoys them. Thank you Phils!

DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE LINE!  THE LINE IS NOTHING! This is hands down the best BBQ you can get in San Diego, and probably some of the best I've ever had, period.  The line wraps around the building almost all the time, but the food is well worth the wait.  Oh, man is it awesome! The baby back ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender, smoked to perfection, and covered (but not smothered) with a tangy, spicy BBQ sauce.  The Beefy ribs are also excellent, and are some of the tenderest (is that a word?) beef ribs this side of the Mississippi.  Just delicious.  The chicken is very good, but you'll want to pass on the poultry and just go with the ribs.  Trust me, they're the best.   The sides are also delicious: I'm partial to the fries (which you use to sop up drippings from your ribs) and cole slaw, while my wife prefers their macaroni salad. If you're wanting a lighter meal, or want to save some money with a less expensive entree, try the BBQ Broham sandwich.  It's a big pulled pork sandwich with sauce and coleslaw.  So good. If you haven't been here yet, you owe it to yourself to try it.  Soon, you'll be a Phil's line regular.

I've been to Phil's many many times over the course of my residency in San Diego. It is also the first place that comes to mind whenever friends from out-of-town come down to visit. I had always ordered the Best of Both - beefy ribs, chickless chicken with macaroni salad and fries as sides. DEFINITELY GET THE MACARONI SALAD!! However I've found the chicken to be dry and not as enjoyable to eat, so the past few times I had ordered the Best of Both I didn't touch the chicken and would bring it home and not touch it. This time, I finally saw the Beefy Rib Dinner on the menu which was just $2 more for 3 bones and a choice of 2 sides (got the macaroni salad and fries). However, I was delightfully surprised to find that they had actually given me 4 BONES OF BEEFY RIBS! :O It was most definitely awesome, and no (chicken) food wasted!

There's something extremely magical about Phil's BBQ. I remember the first time I dined at this fine establishment. The very first bite I took of those crazy tasty ribs overwhelmed me with powerful flavor. So amazed was I by the sheer deliciousness, my past 1000 lifetimes flashed before my eyes in an instant, but none of those memories could top that first bite. Only 1 bite and I was already in ecstasy. My eyes lay upon the entire plate of ribs, a mountain of coleslaw, and a sea of crispy golden french fries. I knew this expedition would be most excellent in every way, and upon its end, paradise awaited. Who can claim they've experienced nirvana, the whole of the universe existing in their very being? The answer: the men who have dined at Phil's BBQ. Because the portions are so ridiculously gargantuan, the very task of consuming an entire plate of ribs likens to swallowing everything that ever was and will be. Kingdoms will fall. Empires will rise. History is always changing. But if one entity deserves to last throughout all eternity, Phils is most deserving of such prestige. Long live Phil's BBQ!!

I LOVE THIS PLACE. Obviously, I am a huge BBQ fan. Love it. I have been to this place twice and always leave with sauce all over my face and I am too full and happy to care about wiping it up. I am not toooooo in love with the sides they offer. Although the beans are pretty good. Forget the sides and just go for the meat. The line is always wrapped around the building. It's probably the amazing intoxicating smell of BBQ that fills the square mile around Phil's. Sometimes the line is just too daunting for an instant gratification girl like Sweaty. So, I call ahead, bypass the line and pick my food right up. I can't say enough good things about this place just like everyone else. BOTTOM LINE: Worth the wait. Do it.

Giant succulent beef ribs? Crispy delicious onion rings? Good portions for a good price? Phil's is your place. While long lines are characteristic of this humble abode, it moves quickly and is well worth it for a taste of the meaty goodness. I'm not one usually for meat unless it's nicely grilled or battered so Phil's is definitely my kind of place. Always with efficient, friendly service and food that will leave you quite satisfied, this is the place to go to satisfy those bbq cravings. Usually I'm not a big fan of onion rings, but this place has ones that you can't resist. With a thick crisy batter on the outside and soft sweet onions on the inside, I could munch on them forever were it not for the amazing beef ribs that are the main course. Beef ribs so big, meaty, and fatty that three or four will satisfy even those with big appetites. Deliciously flavored barbeque sauce tops it all off for one great meal. Be sure to come early though if you don't want to wait in line for an hour or two.

Visited on a Friday around 5:00 pm. Very busy, line out the door. Atmosphere fun and very friendly and I really liked the decor. Service was fast, dinning room attendant brought our food which was very nice and I'm perty sure you're suppose to get it yourself. Food was excellent, and the price was very affordable. Only complaint's.....no Tabasco?? You gotta have Tabasco in a rib joint, Tapatio is the standard hot sauce they offer but it isn't fitting with this menu. Our server was nice enough to offer a bottle that some other customers smuggled in. Also, it was raining and I would suggest that they not seat people on the west side on rainy days because of dripping water. I also noticed in the west patio is it was very humid because of the moisture and the heaters. Because of it we requested a different table and were very pleased with the patio area on the east side.

These reviews do not lie! Phil's BBQ is the place to go, whether you live in San Diego or not. If you haven't eaten here yet, you haven't experienced BBQ! Haha. No, seriously. You will not regret it. Go to Phil's when you are semi-hungry because there is always a line wrapped around the building. By the time you get to the door, you will be in perfect condition to eat some good 'ol BBQ! Their ribs and chicken are SO GOOD. They have the "i melt in your mouth" thing going on.

Best BBQ in San Diego! If you have never been here make it a point to go! The food is AMAZING and the atmosphere is great! The line of people that wraps around the building can be intimidating but know that the line moves very fast and there will always be a seat for you inside once you order. The food is usually ready for you within 10 mins of ordering which is great because I nearly start eating off of stranger's plates once I sit down. The food smells and looks so good ya'll! I always get the 1/2 chicken dinner all white meat with baked beans and coleslaw. My mouth is watering just typing up this review. The chicken is so juicy and the BBQ is sweet and tangy. The beans are also a favorite because they are smokey and they pack a little spicy kick which pairs well with the chicken. The cool and creamy coleslaw round out the entire meal. My family and I usually will order some fries to share and we enjoy eating the with the house ranch which is AMAZING! I have been coming to Phil's for years now and I can say that I have never had a bad experience. The food is always great, the staff friendly, and the atmosphere and blues music playing really makes it a complete dinning experience.

First off, Phils BBQ has no real bbq competition in San Diego.  We waited over 1.5 hours in line outside to give this BBQ place a whirl.  So I was expecting it to live up to my expectations.  I lived in Texas for over 2 yrs and experienced the real deal "Texas BBQ" many times. Phil's bbq concentrates only on the bbq sauce and not the meat.  You only taste the thick bbq sauce which is slathered all over your ribs and chicken that you can barely taste the meat itself.  Phils bbq cooks its meat twice.  Boils or pressure cooks all the meat so its really tender then bbqs it up and slathers sauce on it at the end.  This is why the meat is super tender and falls off the bone. Phil's BBQ only serves chicken, baby back ribs and beef ribs.  No beef brisket!!  What kind of BBQ place doesn't serve beef brisket or bbq sausage? If Phil's BBQ was side by side next to a real Texas BBQ place like "Rudy's" or "County Line" Phil's BBQ would go out of business for sure.  Hands down no question! I've experienced way better bbq than Phils BBQ and will not be going back any time soon and waiting in an insane line for below average bbq.

I am not sure what all the hype is about.  We stopped by Phil's on our last trip to San Diego.  The line was insanely long.  My gf who lives out there said she has ever seen it this long.  I think we must have stood in line for well over an hour....long line = great bbq.  My assumption.  It wasn't bad, but def not the best I have ever had.  Portions are great.  We ordered baby back ribs, beef ribs, beer battered onion rings, cole slaw, steamed veggies and caesar salad.  The beef ribs were a bit on the dry side for me, sauce has a little kick to it.  The kids seem to like the baby back ribs.  The onion rings were probably my favorite thing that we ordered.  Really crispy, crunchy and had a nice size piece of onion.   When we left hubby was standing in line and was talking to a random person there.  The guy drives down from LA to come here.  Apparently we ordered it wrong.  We are suppose to ask for the bbq sauce on the side.  So MAYBE on our next trip to SD, we may make another stop here.

Can't believe I've never reviewed Phil's before. It is the best BBQ I've ever had. Ever. Go, don't look back. I can eat an entire rack of ribs on my own. That is saying a lot! If it wasn't so good, I would knock it down for the struggles to find seating (it is all open) and the long wait. But it is too good to do that. If waiting really bothers you, order take out.

A line worth the wait. Got the baby back rib tickler and it was perfect. Not too much not too little. The heaters weren't working in the enclosed patio so that was a bumber since it was late and chilly. But I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the hand washing trough next to the soda machines. Wish they had more desserts. All in all it's a must try while in SD.

Can you say BBQ.......Uum Humm Simply Outstanding. No reservations, but if you don't like to wait in line which you will do, I suggest calling ahead and taking it to go. I BBQ, grill, smoke slow cook.  There is a lot of time and work that goes into this style of cooking.  You have to have a passion for it, because it is a labor of love.   I have never had BBQ outside of California. So I can't speak about how other states like Jeff l. has, but I have eaten at other BBQ establishments in California, and IMO Phil's has them beat hands down. Onions Rings---hot Crisp sweet Fries-----------not oily, hot fresh Beef ribs-----Makes me a carnivore Pork ribs-----meat following of the bone MESSY MESSY MESSY, need a shower after eating here, but like Carl said, If it doesn't get all over the place it'as not worth puttin in your face.

Craving BBQ?!?... This is the place to go if you're in the area.  I came from the bay to visit some friends down in SD and this place is awesome!  I'm going to keep this review short and simple. RIBS TO DIE FOR! Meat that falls off the bone, so tender and the marinade and spices they use is delicious.  Just don't forget to grab a whole roll of paper towels.  Tri-tip sandwich is also very good but to be honest, still doesn't beat San Lois Obisbo's Firestone's tri-tip sandwich. If Firestone and Phil's had babies, they would have the greatest ribs and tri-tip sandwich ever!

I LOVE RIBS!! I hate crowds and I'm not a fan of the location but I'll keep coming back to get my rib fix.   This most recent trip my sister had the El Toro and that thing was YUMMY! I ordered the baby back ribs, the sauce is flavorful and sweet with a spicy kick and not an overwhelming smokiness also very YUMMY. For bbq sauce it can be a bit on the oily side. As for the side items I'm not to well versed but this time I passed on the French fries as I remember them being kind a soggy and just OK but this time we split an order of onion rings and they were good. There the battered type not the crumby type. The line can be long but they do a good job at keeping it moving and getting your food out to you in good time.

I didn't want to love this place because I already have a local BBQ place I rave about back home. But Phil beat Joey in the ring :/. I got the exact same thing I usually get at joeys- pork ribs, bbq beans, fries..  And Phil's came out to be a huuuuge portion and meatier ribs.. And it's cheaper for more food. Like really cheap!!! I didn't even finish it had leftovers for my evening cravings. Yes I have to wait at least 30+ minutes here but totally worth it. Will definitely come back here when I'm in the SD area

My friend David introduced me to Phil's BBQ and I am in debt to him for this great kindness. Originally I was skeptical, so solicited Yelp's help for a confirmation, then head out to this SD gem. The food was phenomenal the portions we're enormous. There are so many different styles of BBQ and I am not sure if I am correct by saying it is more of a Texas style (sweet and tangy)? The sauce is OK, only because I like dry rub better. My advise is order the beef and pork ribs. On any given night one will be better than another. Avoid the chicken. All of their sides are great, especially the onion rings, slaw and beans. I will give your 2 reasons for going in early, first the lines are shorter early evening, and second, unless the laws of smoked BBQ has changed, the meat continues to cook as time passes. I think this could be the best BBQ on the west coast!

Frequent visitor. Just wow, some of the best baby back ribs I've ever had. If you think you can't handle a full rack of ribs, just order the whole thing, you won't be sorry. Detailed review: I've been going here since this place was on Goldfinch.  The strange thing is, I've never lived in San Diego.  I don't even have family in the area.  Yet I've been here on numerous occasions.  I was visiting San Diego once and a friend told me I had to try this place, I'm so glad I did.  They have the best pork ribs I've had at a restaurant.  Very tender, very flavorful.  Ever since my first visit, I've made from NorCal to SoCal just to go to this restaurant, it's that good. The actual restaurant is huge now, but there will still probably be a wait.  In my recent visit, my girlfiend and I arrived 30 minutes before opening and we were second in line.  By the time the restaurant actually opened, the line went around the corner. I can't say much about the other food because I devote all of my stomach to the ribs.  There is one small negative, if you like crispy fries you'll be disappointed.

DONT BE INTIMIDATED BY THE LINE! Oh Phil's how i have missed you! You are still good! I may not live there anymore, but your still near and dear to my heart!  I lived in SD for years and was an original Hill Crest Patron. Was disappointed to see it close, but excited when it opened up in Sports Arena at 10x the size. The lines were always big, but it seems like every time they grow, the lines get longer! lol  The lines were long at Sports Arena, back then. Ive been gone for 2 and the line was jaw dropping BUT they move quick. Even when its to the back of the bldg, its still only 30min. You'll do that next door at Red Lobster. Good job to the people working the lines, you are good comedy and keep the people entertained while waiting. To the lady that works the front of the line before you get to the register - you are awesome! My mom loved you every time we went. She always remembered you and even though she has passed, she would be happy to see you're still there entertaining! What to know before you go: If the line is TOO big when you arrive. and can't wait in line, call in a to go order, and pick it up immediately. DO NOT try to take a table, just go to the beach and eat it, its less than3 min away!

"Dry w/ sauce on da side," is how I order my baby back ribs here. These are the best ribs in San Diego hands down! They are knock-u-into-a-coma flavorful and ridiculously tender, like Miguel Cotto's face after a Manny Pacquiao pounding. I'm not from the South, nor do I ever care to go there! I have been to every joint, here in America's finest city, that serves baby backs and none of them can compare. Maybe all you transplants need to go back to where ever it is you came from that way I don't have to wait in line as long. Louisiana, Kansas City, Texas who gives a she-I-it bout type or style?!

It was my first time going, the long line frightened me but by the time we got up there I was ready to eat! I'm not that big of a meat person but the BBQ sauce was prepared very well & ribs were delicious.

There's really no place like Phil's.. This place is definitely worth the +25 minutes wait on a week night! I love the "Best of Both" half rack of ribs & 1/4 chicken with french fries and sweet baked beans. I'm usually a big fan of potato/macaroni salad, but I don't think it's mayo-y enough for me here haha. The little chickless pieces aren't that bad, but I just prefer the skin with the 1/4 chicken. Plus it's a little bit juicier! That's not to say the chickless pieces are dry, they're really not that bad! The onion rings here are great as well with a side of ranch dip. Haha I sound like such a fatty, but Phil's has the one of the best BBQ sauce I ever tried. It's a perfect mix of tangy goodness that coats the ribs perfectly that's hard to find elsewhere. Definitely a must if you're in the SD area!

My three star rating is probably going to make some people mad/angry/confused, but it's my honest opinion of Phil's BBQ. My #1 standard order for a BBQ place is Tri Tip. When I checked out the menu I saw that the only tri tip was a "deli sliced sandwich" hmmmm that doesn't sound right this side of Subway, so I went for my #2 choice, pulled pork sammie. The gist of this sandwich is quantity over quality. I had to take out half of the pork just to call this a sandwich and then douse the pork in bbq sauce because it was so dry. I tried the onion rings which are visibly appealing, but are disappointingly soggy. The worst of the meal was the baked potato. It was a baked potato with a slice of processed Kraft cheese folded inside it. It was inedible. My final conclusion of Phil's is that it is for children who enjoy BBQ or for people who want to shovel in the food without much dependency on taste. I would have given them 2 stars, but I really liked the BBQ sauce. I bought two bottles. The next day Mr. R and I made a Tri Tip and had used Phil's sauce and it was fantastic. I would choose Famous Dave's in a second over Phil's, possibly even Lucille's. Here's a recap: Pulled Pork Sammie: 2 Stars Baked Potato: 1 Star Onion Rings: 2 Stars BBQ Sauce 5 Stars

My friend and I went to this place after watching some BBQ special on the food network channel. We took an empty spot at the bar. When we asked the bartender if we could order food at the bar, he informed us, with an arrogant attitude, that we have to wait in line, to order food. I was a waiter and a bartender for many years and I don't understand why some people in the hospitality industry have such a bad attitude. It takes more time and energy to be a rude to a customer than to provide people with good service. Maybe the guy was having a bad day, who knows. Luckily he was finishing up his shift when we got our food and was replaced by a cool bartender. We decided to call in our order and then eat it at the bar. When I went to pay for our food, the counter girl said that she would have to check with the manger to make sure we could eat in the bar (since we phoned the order in). The manager did not have a problem with this and was very friendly. I hate their order at the counter setup and then hunt for a table. Would it kill you guys to get some servers in this joint, sheesh! When we received our food, we were very happy with the portions and quality. I ordered the ribs and chicken which could easily feed two people. Everything was very tasty. It was a great experience other than the first bartenders surly attitude. We got to eat at the bar and beat the system. Ha ha angry bartender! In spite of the rocky start, I would definitely eat here again.

A week later and I'm back at Phil's  I took my review and personal curiosity seriously when ordering.  I ordered a beef rib and chicken sampler with fries and macaroni salad as well as onion rings.   The line this time put our other line to shame.  The line was out the door and around the corner to past where the outdoor patio ends.  Considering the length the scant half an hour it took us to get in wasn't bad.  Luckily we also scored a table as soon as we ordered.  When we later got up to get our food (despite the full sodas covering our table) our table was almost taken TWICE. I have finally found beef ribs I enjoy.  After spending my entire life loving delicious pork ribs (and nearly every other pork product under the sun) I found delicious and meaty beef ribs which satisfy.  Usually you find beef ribs which are greasy, fatty and are mostly connective tissue.  These ribs were low in connective membrane with minor fat deposits.  The beef was rich, flavorful and tender.  I contemplated while waiting in line how they can justify charging 4 dollars for a single beef rib and I now know.  The two ribs I ate were quite filling and the bones make a nice pile on the plate.   Chicken can be good and chicken can be bad.  Chicken can also just be plain old chicken.  Phil's BBQ chicken is tender with the grain and cooked to perfection.  The flavor is that of a mild chicken covered by a musk of smoke.  The tangy and sweet bbq sauce covered and accentuated it all.  I would recommend the chicken (chickless- without bones in this case) to anyone not interested in beef, or who wants to try a combo like I did. The macaroni salad was similar to the potato salad, but more light and refreshing.  There were nicely diced chunks of white onion that pop in your mouth.  The french fries were plentiful and fresh.  When hot they were of high quality.  The topper of all sides is the "small" order of onion rings.  This "small" order covers an entire plate.  The batter was crisp and crunchy, and the onions inside were tender, thickly cut and oh so deliciously sweet.  I cannot stress enough how much of a mistake it would be to eat at Phil's and not get the onion rings.

BBQ Meat (Pick your poison), Fries, Coleslaw, Onion Rings Is there anything wrong with that other than a bulging waistline at the end of the night? I think not Line sucks but hey you want meat. If you don't wanna wait theres always the strip clubs down the block.

Ridiculous portions.  Fantastic food.  Friendly staff.  Expect to wait a bit, but it's worth it.  Think of it like waiting in line for a great ride at an amusement park.  Getting a table is never an issue and they are very good at accommodating large groups.  FYI, there is open seating in the bar.     Bring a large group, wait in line, have a fun time, and then eat some dang good BBQ. Parking can be a bit challenging, but I've always found a spot.  Don't park at Red Lobster--you will get towed.

Hmm...3822 reviews!!  I guess mine will be #3823.  Overall, I'd give it a 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5.  The 0.5 stars deduction is because they don't serve brisket or sausage nor do they give you extra BBQ sauce (you have to purchase extra sauce). Phil's BBQ is kinda like a Disneyland ride.  You wait in line for a long time until you finally reach the end with all the cashiers.  It's an order and then sit down type of BBQ place, sorta like Rudy's BBQ in Texas.  However, you don't get your order right away as they give you pagers and page you when your order is ready for pick-up.  Line is definitely long.  We waited about 1 1/2 hours until we finally reached the end. The line on the right is for sit-down while the line on the left is for take out.  The cool thing was there was a very friendly lady who works at Phil's BBQ giving out small samples of their AMAZING onion rings. So the free sample worked and we ordered a large order of onion rings (which was way more than enough) for $5.95.  It's delicious!!  It's definitely a heavy batter on the rings, and oily, and probably really bad for you.  But it's sooo good!  Awesome crunch to their onion rings. BBQ wise - definitely get the baby back ribs!!!  There was actually a lot of meat on the bone and it was so tender and almost fall of the bone!  I got my sauce on the side but hubby said he liked it with the sauce on the meat.  You can actually choose to have your sauce on your BBQ or on the side.  Hubby and friend liked the beef ribs more than the baby back ribs but my friend and I liked the baby back more than the beef ribs.  The beef ribs were cut in a different way, in that you get more meat on one side of the bone, if that makes any sense.  It looked smaller than the beef ribs we get at Wood Ranch BBQ but hubby said they are the same size, they just cut it differently, so that one person can get a lot of meat. Their menu is pretty simple.  BBQ baby back ribs, beef ribs, chicken, combo - ribs and chicken, and sandwiches - like pulled pork sandwiches.  Their combos come with 2 small sides (like fries, baked beans, macaroni salad, etc.) or 1 large side (things like steamed veggies or corn, etc.).   Price wise it's about an average of $12.95 + up. After you order, you can sit down and find a table.  Don't sit next to the window if you don't want strangers looking at your BBQ. ;)  Which we were guilty of doing.  haha. Cool things about this place:  You can also get bibs for those who tend to be really messy with BBQ.  And they have a sink station in the back so you can wash your hands after all that messiness. Hubby is from Texas so he knows good BBQ.  He said Phil's is probably his favorite (outside of Texas).  Even more so than Lucille's!  Although, Lucille's has better sides (like their apple butter biscuits, mac and cheese, etc.) and BBQ chicken.  Hubby said his BBQ chicken from Phil's was a little too dry. BBQ comparisons: Meat tenderness:  Phil's BBQ Sides:  Lucille's Meat selection:  Lucille's Price:  Phil's BBQ Sauce:  both pretty good If you're in the SD area, definitely a must try at least once!

I'm trying really hard NOT to take a crap from all the good food i ate at Phill's BBQ. It's that good! If you visit San Diego, you've got to stop at Phill's because there's a reason why it's got more than a thousand reviews. I've tried the half rack baby back rips with Cole slaw and macaroni salad on the side. it was like eating ribs made for a king but for a peasant's price. You will NOT regret sampling Phill's.

I'd have to say, when you first experience BBQ, Phil's knows how to do it.   Although you wait maybe FOREVER to get inside, the wait is definitely worth it in my opinion.  (Not a place to go if you want food right away, or to sit down right away) Phil's offers your generic bbq of the south I would have to say. Their ribs are amazing.  I prefer the beefy ribs because I love to taste that bone. The chicken is a little dry most of the time, but I can get through it by drenching it in sauce.   The fries are pretty good too; however, the onion rings, a bit too much batter for me.   I can't handle having that much batter because it makes me a little sick to my stomach. The pulled pork sandwich is awesome too.  They give you so much meat, it's more like you have bread with your pork.   I normally wouldn't wait for something like this; however, I usually can wait if I know I'm going to Phil's.   Parking lot sucks because it shares with others and is very small.   The servers and waiters are really nice and caring (Except for that one cashier...).  They are always willing to get you sauce, fill your cup with water and make sure everything is in place.  I would have to say there is this one guy, if you don't pay attention to what he says, you'll sit there thinking for a bit, because he says "how you all doing?" and if you don't respond, he'll say, "thanks for asking." It is a great atmosphere, definitely a place to hang with friends if you really want to go watch the game or what not, although they can't change any of the channels, so if you do want to go watch the game, go to the bar.

Dear Phil, First and foremost, I know you cater so I'm curious if you would cater to me in San Francisco. If not, have you ever considered coming to San Francisco because I desperately need you in my life. Although, I needed to drink plenty of water to wash down the salt, those beer battered onion rings and your amazing baby back ribs, their calling my name. You make the best bbq ever. I can't even begin to describe your mouth watering flavors for I will set myself into depression knowing I can't simply go to you and feast out. Until my return, I want my baby back, baby back, baby back ribs. xx Estranged lover

Phil's BBQ is the best place to get ribs in San Diego! The pork ribs are extremely tender and pretty much fall off the bone.  The sides that come with the dinners are pretty much standard.  They also serve massive, crispy onion rings with actual cooked onions inside but you have to order them separately.  The main focus, however, has got to be the beefy ribs.  These behemoth ribs are cooked to perfection (don't worry if you have bad teeth) and are in hefty proportions.  With the sauce that they slather on top, these ribs are truly a sight and taste unparalleled by any other bbq place in the area.  Also, if ribs are a little pricey for you, they have alternatives like the pulled pork sandwiches that are just as delicious but a little more affordable. The only downside to Phils is the long wait.  I've been there several times and each time I had to wait around an hour (even at 3:00 p.m.) to sit down but the wait is well worth it!!!  If you don't like to wait, there is a line for phone-orders (to-go) which is much shorter.  But if this is your first time at Phil's, I would recommend standing in line to enjoy the buzzing atmosphere of the restaurant as the service is extremely friendly and attentive from providing paper towels, extra bbq sauce, to even a friendly joke or two.   It really is an amazing restaurant and is definitely a MUST GO if you are visiting San Diego!

Phil's BBQ is the place you want to go for BBQ in the San Diego Area.  They are not messing around when they provide you with portions or quality overall.  I remember them being a small joint on the other side of town that always had smoke billowing out the front, yet had a line around the block.  Now that they are becoming a multi-location BBQ place, they haven't sacrificed quality for a money trade out.   I typically go for the TIckler plate and my meat choice will change from time to time depending on my mood.  The Tickler offers you the meat as well as two sides, and you are more than full when you are done.  The rib plates are also generously portioned and leave you a fair amount to take home for dinner and lunch the next day.   I recommend, if you don't want to wait, go to the bar and snag a seat and a beer.  They will call you when your food is ready and it's better than waiting in the long line around the building.

Had never wrote a review before because of its thousands of raving reviews already, but I feel compelled to write, even a short one for it due to it literally making up a large portion of my college memories. Once this location opened, I have been a frequent patron of Phil's and it has never disappointed me.  My favorite order are Baby back ribs with fries and mac salad.  The ribs are always tender and the sauce is unmatched.  The fries are also delicious and the mac salad is the best I've ever had anywhere.  Furthermore, the servers and staff are nice and helpful even when it's a busy night. The only gripe is how popular this place is now, but I still make it a requirement every time I visit san diego to hit up this place for old times sake. I've found BBQ places in Los Angeles that have great tri tips, or great ribs but bleh sides.  But I haven't yet found a place with the complete package with savory ribs, excellent sides, family fun atmosphere, and friendly staff that Phil's consistently delivers on.

If you like bbq, ribs, chicken, fries, and anything really fattening and glutinous, Phil's BBQ is the place to go.  Come here hungry and come here ready to wait in line.  Try to call your order in to avoid the mad chaos.  Order the chicken and fries and onion rings and ribs or one of everything on the menu.

You know that feeling when you go to eat with a group of friends and are yapping away and then finally the food comes and you all suddenly become eerily and strangely silent? And then one of your friends even starts crying and you know EXACTLY the reason why everyone isn't talking and crying? Yeah. You know what I'm talking about. And then you actually, for the first time in your life, don't mind the long line because of how much it enhances that moment when you feel that vibration. Yeah.

Food is ok to me, but everyone I ever go with loves the joint. I just hate waiting in line for two hours! I actually won't wait that long, so if the line is too long we'll go somewhere else. I know you can always do takeout, but that doesn't always fit the bill for the night.  They need a second location for sure. Otherwise it's a pretty well run restaurant. We take all our out of town friends here, unless the lines are too long. After further consideration, I'm editing my review from three stars to four because I didn't know about the second location up in San Marcos. Although that just means they need to open a 3rd location ASAP because this one's line is too darn long! It's a good place to go though, fun for the experience of eating at Phil's if nothing else.

I'm on this mission to review all the BBQ restaurants I've been to, and Phil's has got to be the best one! My brother took me here when I visited him in San Diego while he was in law school.  There's always a LONG line out the door and for a good reason.   Ribs are so tender.  It's actually better without additional BBQ sauce in my opinion.  I didn't like my ribs smothered with sauce.  Ask for it on the side.  Roasted chicken was good too.   Definitely will elevate your cholesterol after eating here, so spend a day at Seaworld or San Diego Zoo to burn off some calories then head over here to fuel up!

I'm not too partial to BBQ but damn, this place has good BBQ. Their BBQ sauce was one of the best I think I've ever had - sweet but not too sweet, smokey but not too smokey and just a HINT of tang. The full rack of ribs fell off the bone with meat so tender you barely have to chew it - cooked to perfection. Their sides not to mention were phenomenal as well. I really liked their coleslaw which contrasted nicely with the incredibly savory meat. It was also nice that they had rolls of paper towels everywhere for easy clean up and take-out containers located at a spot easy for anyone to grab and go. A great family restaurant or a chill hangout to kick it with your buddies.

The ribs are just so delicious ! omg, the portions are huge and the wait is not bad if you go at the right time. Me and my friends, party of 6 i think only waited for 20 minutes at 5 ish but right when we were leaving at 7 the line wrapped around the corner ! When I go to Phils I can never decide between a half rack ribs or chicken so I would get the best of both and they are so delicious ! Phils is a place you must try if you live in San Diego. They also have one in San Marcos.

What is there to say that hasn't been said? Having been there once and stood in the ridiculously long line (which seems to ALWAYS be there regardless of time or day of the week) and also having been there once to pick up an order, I can definitely say that picking it up is the way to go if you have someplace close by to eat it. Heck even if you don't you can chill on the grass outside and save yourself at least an hour if not more (their 'the wait is __ minutes if you're at this spot in line' sign is very inaccurate and desperately needs an update.) They do have a bar section that may take less time to be seated in, but I'm not sure as I've never tried (and it always looks full anyway!) The ribs are quite delicious, but I really enjoy their 'Chick Ticklers'. These are bite sized pieces of grilled white meat chicken smothered in their famous BBQ sauce. Plus the tickler meals automatically come with 2 of their HUGE beer-battered onion rings (yum), slaw, and fries. It's a pretty good deal for $6.75! You can also get it as a baby back rib option (but you only get 3 ribs, just a heads up!) Overall they seem to have a great reputation for a reason. If you're visiting, on vacation, or if you live here and have never been then give it a go. But unless you really love standing in lines that rival amusement park rides I'd strongly suggest calling it in!

The best BBQ RIBS EVER!! I love the fries and the sauce. The portion is HUGE, a good idea not to eat anything before you come here. The wait is long depends on the hour. The longest I've ever waited for this place was probably 2 hours and a couple of minutes. The staff is friendly and the smell of BBQ coming from the kitchen makes you excited to get some bomb BBQ ribs. They have really good coleslaw, and the prices are decent! Best to come around lunch time, not so much people or waiting a long time in line.

DEFINITELY believe the hype for this place. This is as good as bbq gets in california. yes the wait  typically is 1-2 hours depending on what time you arrive but its so worth it. It was my first time here and when i saw the line, i was really considering going somewhere else. The long line is really intimidating...BUT because of a suggestion that it will be worth it, i decided to stay and ended up waiting a little over 2 hours. Heres what i tried: -Baby back ribs (yes. the meat really did fall off the bone!!) -onion rings (one of the best onion rings i've tried, but eating more than 2 or 3 can make you a little tired of them. i had a group of 4 and we ordered the large size and couldn't finish half of it! the portion is very big so be carefll) -macaroni salad (definately get this as a side. this was one of my favorites) -Fries (other favorite side) -potato salad (this was ok) -coleslaw ( i liked this as well) I heard from a person who works here that their tri tip sandwhich is also very good so i am going to try that next time i am here. overall, i found myself craving Phils the next day and even now.PLEASE open a location in the OC!!

Lives up to the hype!  I heard about Phil's when I moved to San Diego a couple years ago and I was skeptical about a southern California BBQ joint.  But Phil's is really as good as you hear and totally worth the long line.  We have gone a bunch of times now and have loved everything.  My fav is the beef ribs dry, just get the sauce on the side.  # 4000 review ...

Would have been 5 stars except for the BBQ sauce. The ribs are fantastic, perfectly cook and fall off the bone. I have had tenderloin that wasnt nearly as tender as these baby backs were. The BBQ sauce on the other hand was lathered on and WAY too sweet. If you use some hot sauce that is on the tables it balances it out a bit and makes it tolerable.

This place (original location) was just up the hill from where we lived in SD. I've had a few different things here- the RB sandwiches, pulled pork. But I kept coming back to the ribs.

I'm sorry but I really can't say I'm a fan of Phil's.   Perhaps it was the late hour at which we came to eat, and it most certainly is a very crowded place to eat, even around 9 PM.   Still... long lines, tragically small side orders, expensive prices...   The BBQ ribs were tasty, but they weren't that good.   If I compare them with Back Forty, a BBQ joint in Pleasant Hill nearer to where I live, Back Forty dominates completely and utterly. They also close at 10, which is a bit of a drag...  We were a large group on the patio and pretty much were pushed out at 10:15.   Of course I completely understand that employees desire not work extra hours, but the owners should probably consider extending their hours on holidays... Then again, 10PM?   They probably should consider extending their hours all the time! Would I come back?  Yeah... the food was good.   Still, I don't think Phil's is owed all the admiration and adulation it seems to have garnered.

Came here on a Friday night (around 8:30pm) and the line was out the door.  It took about 10 minutes until I was able to order, so don't be deceived by the long line (its worth it btw).  The place was packed, but my friend and I were able to find seats in the bar area (we wanted to drink beer anyways).  Food came out about 5 minutes after I ordered (just enough time to get a beer from the bar). I got the half rack of rib dinner and my friend got half chicken dinner.  The ribs were AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!  Phil's sure does live up to the reputation that I've been hearing.  The bbq sauce just marinates perfectly into the meet.  The chicken was very disappointing... it tasted like chicken with some bbq sauce on top.  The two sides (I got fries and mac salad) were a good portion... A little too much for me.  I would rather have gotten a full rack with 1 side.   They had some good beer on tap too and it accommodated the ribs quite well.  Get the Yellow Tail Pale Ale for a light and crisp beer (a bit too light for me though). Overall, I'd definitely dine again.  Just don't get the chicken.

My work Christmas party was held here this past December. I would give this place 5 stars, but I would never wait in line for more that 15 minutes to eat here, not matter how good the BBQ is here. Before I had eaten here, I had heard that Phil's is the absolute best BBQ in San Diego. That was no lie. It is the best! The San Diego Expo Design Center (which is now shutting down-so so sad) employee committee booked the convention room. For the number of people that attended this location from my store, this room was too small. It only fits about 100 people more or less. We were crammed into the room. Our employee committee knew we had too many people to fit the space, but went ahead with the party. On the positive side, the food was absolutely amazing and the best chicken BBQ I have ever tasted. I was surprised that I actually liked the onion rings with the ranch dressing. Other than that, go to Phil's and go early -even if you have to arrive before the restaurant opens just so you don't have to wait in line. It is well worth it.

My interest was piqued when we saw a line wrapping around the building one night of our recent stay in the area. 9 times out of 10, when doing a cold search for a good place to eat, the line doesn't lie! My outrigger canoe team decided to have lunch here the day after my fiancée and I spotted it, and we were overjoyed that we made it before the line had a chance to get longer than a couple people. Wow, you can literally smell this place almost a mile away in your car with the windows rolled up. It's the sweet aroma of meat cookin' and saying, "C'mon! Let me do your taste buds and make it a double!" Service was super, super excellent. From the cashiers, to the busboys, to the bartender. They are really well trained to be this great or just genuinely nice, or both. Our cashier was very patient with us because we had some visually impaired people with us and she didn't bat an eye or show any impatience whatsoever while we described the menu to our friends. The busboys and servers roaming the tables kept checking in on us to see if there was anything they could get for us... and it was packed by the time we got our food and they were still doing this. Amazing! The food is awesome. I got the baby back ribs and chicken combo. Most of the people in our group got the tri-tip sandwich. Everyone was extremely pleased with the quality and quantity of food. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and well-seasoned. The chicken was cooked to perfection and not a bit dry. I had a bite of the tri-tip sandwich and it was no letdown. Even the sides were good: the potato salad had some bite to it and the cole slaw was solid. My fiancée wanted me to review this place as being the best BBQ joint in California, but seeing that we haven't tried enough places throughout the state yet, I'll hold off on that for now. Let's just say it's the best we've had so far. Definitely will be coming back!!! Come early or be prepared to face the consequences! You've been warned!

First thought as you drive up to Phil's BBQ is "WTH? the line wraps around the building?!" The line only looks intimidating but it's actually not all that bad. I think our wait was only like 20 minutes or so. This isn't your typical sit down bbq restaurant. You pretty much order your food, get a pager, grab a table, then chow down. There's a sign that says "no holding tables before ordering," but it wasn't really enforced. The food is okay. I ordered the half chicken dinner with macaroni salad and my friend ordered the half rib with corn. The chicken was juicy and very flavorful and the macaroni salad was just the way I like it...not a lot of mayonnaise. The ribs were good but the sauce on it was overwhelmingly sweet :[ If my review was based solely on food I would have given it a 3, however, the service at Phil's is one of a kind. Darrell our "server" came by frequently to see how we were doing and was very efficient.

Over 900 reviews with a pretty much overall rating of 5/5. What more can I say that hasn't already been said? Visiting San Diego, we were craving something that we didn't have in the Bay Area. Passing by I see Phil's BBQ and the line was around the corner on a Tuesday night. We were hungry and did not want to wait, so we said lets come back tomorrow morning. I go on Yelp that night and see the numerous reviews and high rating and knew we couldn't leave without eating here. So the following day comes around and we go there right before noon. The line is just right out the door, but that's still better than waiting last night when it was around the corner. We start walking towards the entrance and they have the menu, which has a variety of choices yet not overwhelming, plastered everywhere. It's hard to miss. My gf and I decide to share the full rack rib meal, with beans and mac salad. Our other party members got the same thing, but beef rack. Just as everyone before me has mentioned, the rips were nice and tender. Falling off the bone. The beefy ribs were not as tender, but still very good. The full rack was good to share between 2 people. What should be noted is how tasty the mac salad is. Definitely give that a try as one of your sides. The atmosphere wreaked BBQ. There is no mistake to what kind of food was served here. Self serve refillable fountain drinks. You grab your own plates and utensils. There are helpful staff members going around asking if things are ok and if you need anything. They will gladly remove excess plates. Bathroom was clean as well. What's nice is the huge sink that is outside of the bathroom. So if you just need to wash your hands there is no need to wait to go to the bathroom. Maybe if it was only a few reviews you could say this is hype, but after 100 it then becomes the real deal. Now coming close to 1000, believe it, this place has be checked out if you are craving some BBQ.

I'm still dreaming about the baby back ribs.  They were heavenly!!!  They were moist and falling off the bone, the way all ribs should be cooked.  I ordered both the baby back ribs and the beefy ribs because I didn't know the difference.  Hands down, the baby ribs won my vote.  The sauce was perfect, not too sweet and not too tangy. The BBQ Broham pulled pork sandwich was excellent!  The meat was moist with crispy edges and  the bread was toasted. I need to fly back down to SD again before the year ends.  It's that good!

Awesome. Best ribs restaurant in California. I also went to that one place in NorCal that was featured in Man vs Food on the Food Network and that place wasn't good at all. This place definitely gets my vote. Be aware that you will have to wait about an hour in line outside. And when I say that you will... you will wait for at least an hour. Doesn't matter when you go. Also get the arrogant Bastard Ale.

I said I would write an update when I finally had their pulled pork sammie. It's called The Brougham....not sure what that means, but who the hell cares! It's THE best pulled pork I've had so far anywhere and again, I'm a Los Angeles food snob. Deelish, smoky, crusty on the ends if you're lucky enough to get them, and the roll it comes on...wow. I usually am disappointed in most breads I get in restaurants...who wants mushy, soft rolls, yuck. Gimmie some texture baby. This one is lightly toasted, a bit chewy and I just eat all of it. There is enough pork on this to actually make two sammies if you are watching your waistline..but why the hell are you eating here if you're watching your waistline...geesh. It comes with coleslaw on it, which I'm sure is good...if you like coleslaw which I don't, so I tell them to leave it off. I actually think I like this sandwich more than their ribs which is hard to believe for this bone freak. But the pulled pork is cheaper than ordering ribs and you get totally filled up. Like $6.50, but nothing comes with it. Another $1.50 for a gigantic order of their very good fries. Ok Phils...you get a bit of redemption from me since I'm not crazy about your sauce. Your Brougham has won this BBQ lover over!!

This is my go-to spot for barbeque. The portions are more than enough and then some. It can get pretty busy; the line can easily file right out the door. I don't like that you can't reserve seats before you order but seats usually become available as people order so it's not that much of a problem. The food always comes out in a timely fashion; faster than the time that the cashier usually gives you. I hate that you have to pick and choose when you go so it won't be as busy as other times. It was definitely an ideal place to go for dinner on Halloween when everyone else was out partying and dressed up like a slutty whatever. There was a minimal-to-nonexistent line and seats were available throughout the night. Despite the long wait, Phil's is always worth it! Come hungry and you will leave very happy... and with food coma.

The best ribs I've ever had (so far) in my life...  the meat just falls off the bone.  Yes, it's that tender. I don't know what else to say... except that if you want good ribs, this is your best bet.

I haven't been disappointed once yet going to Phil's.  Even the line usually moves pretty quickly considering how long it can be. Positives: Extensive selection of dishes. Decent serving sizes. Really enjoy the "boneless" options for the ribs and chicken. They offer a veggie burger and turkey burger. Good quality of food. Negatives: Cant really think of any, have a hard time not comparing them to some of the BBQ from the south and east coast though (why they arent a 5 Star in my book).  Do wish they offered some smoked sausage and stuff like that. Lots of meat!

If you like tangy bbq, this is the place to go.  Unfortunately, I do not like tangy bbq.  The Baby Back Rib and bbq chicken was very tender and moist.  Both the coleslaw and bbq beans were pretty good.   Since we arrived before 12, we didn't have to wait long.  When we left, there was a line going around the building.  People love Phil's.  Its efficiently run and hostess is very nice.  You line up, go up to cashier, order your food, pay for it, get a buzzer, get yourself a table, get your food, eat, and you leave.  It's a very casual dining experience. Although I didn't like the BBQ sauce, the meat is good.  We also ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich.  That was also good.  My sisters like this place. I prefer my bbq sauce less tangy and sweeter.

Yay for the best BBQ place in SD! I have to thank a close friend of mine for taking us there while we visited his home town! Baby back ribs.. delicious, tender, juicy, and filled with flavor. Want more? Want something better? Their pulled pork sandwich is probably the best I've ever had. It was like something off of the Food Network or something you would find in Texas or something! The line at this place is always long, especially long during the weekends, but it's worth it. The line wraps around the restaurant. You would think it would take hours to get in but for being towards the end of the line at one point it only took about 30 minutes to order. This place is fast, TASTY and very convenient!!! These are two things most restaurants try to strive for but fall short! Can't wait to go back!

I had Phil's BBQ yesterday and now my stomach is growling as I write this review because it's no longer filled with pork goodness. I came here with a large group of buddies (9 people) which they accommodated well even though it was a busy night. I had the half rack of baby back ribs with sides of fries and bbq beans for ~$12. I've tried to make bbq pork at home before and I will gladly pay someone else to do it! The ribs are tender and the bbq sauce is sweet and tangy (a little TOO tangy for my taste). The portion of fries is huge and filling. The beans were good but nothing amazing; I wish I had gotten the macaroni salad (my friend got it and it was mouth watering). To drink I had a suicide combo of ice tea, lemonade, Fanta, and Hawaiian punch (I survived!). Service here is fast once you order and the busboys are really nice. I come here once or twice a school quarter and never get disappointed (aside from the long lines). Definitely check out Phil's if you want BBQ because it's worth the drive.

Don't be daunted by the long line that will inevitably greet you at the door, it goes by fast! And plus, I'd probably wait hours to get that BBQ in my belly if I had to, it's SO worth it! The food here is, literally, finger lickin' good! The ribs are the absolute best, both the baby back & beef ribs are so meaty & saucy, they're worth every penny. I always have to wear the bib b/c I get BBQ sauce all over my face, haha. Their gigantic onion rings are also very tasty, definitely look homemade rather than frozen, & they have the perfect onion to batter ration. Good pulled pork sandwiches, good cole slaw, good corn on the cob, good everything! I always always order ribs when I come here, because no where else are ribs this good. I usually get the tickers ($6.45 each), which include either one beef rib (huge though) or 4 baby back ribs, 2 onion rings, fries, & cole slaw. A very very generous portion of food, I usually have to struggle to finish it, or accept defeat & leave a few french fries/slaw behind. So come on down & try it! Trust me, I'm from Texas & this BBQ is the good stuff!

We arrived on a Friday evening and found that there was a line around the plaza. Instead of waiting, we decided to call in our order instead. We ordered the full baby back ribs along with baked beans and fries and the full beef ribs. Based on previous reviews, we asked for sauce on the side. Our total was about $40. The beef ribs were really tender and moist - definitely the best beef ribs I've ever had. The baby back ribs were also good, tender, etc. We eat quite a bit of bbq so the ribs didn't seem all that different from other ribs that we've had. The fries were pretty greasy and the beans were not very good. We preferred the beef ribs over the pork ribs. Overall, the food here is good. The restaurant looks like it has a fun atmosphere but I probably would not wait in line just to eat here.

Two words: ONION RINGS. Another thing that makes me smile!! Yeee! I swear, this is just sosososooooooooooooOOooo bomb. Words cannot describe the sounds that came from our mouths that night.. Well, besides those orgasmic onion rings, Phil's is a WONDERFUL place. Our party of 3 came to Phil's seeing a LONGASS line .. one that is of Kogi status. We only waited maybe about 40 minutes?! Not bad for such bombass food. I got a half rack of baby back ribs, and a large side of steamed veggies (cause somehow I wanted to feel healthy that night.. riight). The meat was really good - super tender, fall off the bone. But I didn't really like the sauce, it was good but a wee tangy for my taste. Veggies came with squash, cucumber, cauliflower, broccoli.. carrots, and ranch :D This was about $15.. sooo good/cheap. One of my friends got the full rack (you fatty I swear :P) and a corn on the cob.. my other friend got a pulled pork sandwich, which was SUPER HUGE!! It was good but a wee dry. Price you CANNOT beat though.. oh man. Our waiter was super chill, loved him :D Chris? was his name? My underage friend at the time charmed one of the servers into giving us free cups of soda.. awkward turtle forreal. But yeah.. Phil's, I heart you to the maaaaaaaax.

Been going to Phil's since it was in Hillcrest and it's by far the best BBQ in San Diego. It tastes to me like it's a Vinegar-based BBQ like North Carolina style. I'm partial to the broham which is their pulled pork sandwich, but I prefer it with the coleslaw on the side (vice on the sandwich). Price point is good and none of the sides that I've tried have been bad. It does get crowded at times, so I suggest calling in your order and asking for extra BBQ sauce. In short: If you like BBQ and you're in San Diego, you've got to check this place out.

This place is soooo good I didn't mind eating here two times in three days.  I felt like my heart was going to stop and my stomach going to burst but who cares?  Occupational hazard for foodies. I use to always get the Best of Both combo (chicken AND ribs), but now I know that there's just no substitute for a full BEEFY rib dinner.  Five massive beef ribs with sides and extra BBQ sauce - that is what dreams are made of.  And if I'm feeling extra sinful, I'll add their outstanding onion rings to the mix. Do I feel guilty demolishing a cow?  Absolutely not :) Phil's BBQ knows their stuff, so cows, pigs, and chickens alike, BEWARE!

FOOD: 1.) Ribs 2.) Beef ribs 3.) Chicken 4.) Coleslaw 5.) Onion rings = Really big, crispy. Makes me think it's a onion ring inside a Chinese donut 6.) Macaroni salad *I'm sad I'm not giving this place 5 stars after all the fanatic recommendations from friends. I'm sure it has to do with the fact brought it to-go, so could not eat the food completely hot off the grill. But otherwise the taste was good. And for someone who's not the biggest carnivore, I ate a good amount of it. SERVICE: You order and pick up at counter with a pager. They seem professional, and very well organized ATMOSPHERE: Had a sports bar area, covered out door seating. Inside is otherwise casual big chain restaurant feel.

This place sure fills your rib cravings, and makes you want to come back for more!! Their baby back ribs were awesome -- with meat falling off the bone, and not too fatty!  The sauce was a euphoria of tastes all coming together-- sweet, tangy, smokey, with a little spicy kick.... yummm!  The sides were just sides (we tried the french fries and potato salad).  Once you enter, you just order and sit down.  They will buzz you when your food is done.  The food is well-priced with decent service, and no place comes close to the quality/taste!! We'll def be back for more!!   May I propose a Northern California location?!?! :)

This was my first trip to Phil's after hearing everyone rave about it. We went there on a Saturday night, the line was around the corner and ended up taking us an hour and forty five minutes in line. There was a sign that said 23 minutes from this point, it ended up taking 50. Aside from the wait I enjoyed the Ribs & Chicken. I liked the ribs much more here than up at Joey's Smokin BBQ or Brett's BBQ up in North County. The onion rings were also pretty good, I didn't get a chance to try out the frys. The server was also nice as well. Phil's site also has a web cam outside so you may want to check it before heading down. Very good food but standing 90+ minutes outside is not worth it to me. There is a San Marcos location opening this Fall so will probably visit that one when it opens up.

Phil's BBQ is responsible for killing the Buddhist inside of me.  It was instead replaced by some of the best artery-clogging, sinfully delicious Southern food I have ever eaten. Growing up in the Bay Area, I never had a penchant for "meat" places, let alone Southern dishes.  So when I tried the baby back ribs it was a great surprise to bite into something so succulent and tender.  Their onion rings were also made to perfection- the onion was very sweet, the batter was deep fried to perfection, and their were made in a way that made the crunch feel satisfying without the tendency for the onion to get separated from the batter that often happens.  My favorite side was the macaroni salad- its light taste was in contrast with the juicy meat. Some "mehs" include their chicken- I've had better chicken and this one tasted too dry.  Their fries weren't especially noteworthy and their coleslaw had a little too much dressing for my personal taste. Overall I'd definitely recommend this place to anybody who's in San Diego.  I've eaten here twice already and I'm already looking forward to coming back a 3rd time.

Holy cow, over 1500 reviews? I'll keep this one quick, the food here is pretty awesome and it is impressive after moving into a location 10 times bigger than their old spot on Goldfinch, how the line still can stack up outside during lunch hr or on the weekend. Ribless dinner is what I usually get, full of flvaor and quite tasty. Not quite like BBQ in the South, but it is the best in SD. I usually get it go so since I always have a hard time finding a table.

This is definitely some of the best ribs I've ever had in my life. But I knew it'd have to better than the amusement park seaworld ribs. but i didn't know it was going to be THIS good. The baby back ribs were super juicy with lots of meat the tenderly just fell off the bone, it wasn't difficult to eat at all. The beef bone was just as good! But they were so different from one another it's hard not to choose just one, I'm glad I got to share it. The fries slightly resembled in-out fries, but a little bit better. Some crispy some not as much. Sadly, I didn't get to try the onion rings that I heard were delicious, they looked huge through the looking glass as you're starring in from the anxious line. I will make sure I do that next time I come back. Phil's is a definite must, if you're visiting SoCal. I'm glad we made time for this on my summer vacation. That late lunch, definitely hit the spot and made my day. The wait was probably the worst part. The sign that said 21 minutes & 14 seconds was wrong ): I was a dork and timed it, and it was a little more than thirty minutes before we got to order, but once we ordered, it was a breeeezze. we got our food in like five minutes tops.

So we came here after a day at Seaworld, recommended by someone. The line was long, stretching from the door to around the outside of the restaurant. Insanity! They do serve complimentary french fries while you wait in line! A definite plus! We ordered the food at a counter, sort of like a fast food restaurant. Then they give you a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready. You can get the food yourself or have your waiter get it. I ordered the full baby back ribs with sides of baked beans and macaroni salad. I'm usually not a BBQ person, but it was good! We shared the onion rings and those were amazing! Large onion rings too! The waiter was very friendly and efficient. Don't sit too long after your meal though, because they will politely kick you out as tables are limited. I believe this place was voted the best BBQ restaurant in San Diego...?

Simply the most amazing tri-tip sandwich I've ever had. The baby back ribs are really good and onion rings are pretty good. There is a catch though: the line is freaking insane. Worth the wait and parking is hard to find in the very crowded lot - tho maybe it was cuz it was a Saturday night - but judging from other reviews: it's always full. Their sauce is so good and distinct that SD area Costco's sell them now! The food comes out fairly quickly and you can sort of seat yourself. Or you can order ahead of time and/or take it to go.  Pretty decent bar area as well. I'll definitely be coming back for more.

I want to make babies with Phil's. Yes folks, we're aware that you can get "much better" BBQ in Texas, or Kansas City, or where have you, but this is San Diego and Phil's has no competition here.  Judged up against the other BBQ options in San Diego, I'd give Phil's SIX stars if I could. Lots of deliciously tangy sauce smothered all over my meaty ribs?  Heck yes.  These ribs are the real deal.  The baby backs have so much meat on them which just falls right off the bone.  The cole slaw is good too.  The line?  Sucks big time, so call ahead and get your BBQ tastiness to go.  The vibe inside is kitschy as can be, but what BBQ joint isn't?  The chick less chicken is pretty dry, so skip it and just pile on more ribs.  I could eat this place every night, it's that good. Phil's is a San Diego staple.

Even though the line into the actual restaurant is a long wait, you can make this experience worth it if you go with friends. The food is exceptional with many choices and the service is great! I'm basically writing this review in regards to the service the past time I visited rather than the food. I'll talk about the food first: - Baby back ribs, colossal onion rings and baked beans is about all I get whenever I eat here. The meat on the ribs slide off and is ransacked with savory BBQ sauce. The onion rings have the right crunchy texture as well as the perfect caramelized onion within. Partnered with the dipping sauce, the onion rings are heaven for onion ring lovers. Baked beans are the perfect amount of sweetness to your mouth. This is how wonderful our server was: - When he found out we were keeping some of the baby back rib bones for our dogs, he mentioned that the bones were so soft that they might give our dogs upset stomaches or other health problems (which we didn't know). Seeing how upset we were, he said he'll go in the back and grab a few real-meat bones that were going to be thrown away. We were so grateful! Not only because he showed concern for our dogs, but because he also took the time to get us those bones. If you're reading this, man, my dogs LOVED it and they THANK YOU for it! - Being my cousin's first time there, she saved a few ribs for her mother. The server saw her trying to wipe up the last BBQ on the plate before putting it into the to-go bag and so told her they supply extra sauce to-go for free! We never knew that and were once again grateful he informed us. Once again, great food + great service = WONDERFUL TIME WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS!

Waited over an hour to get Phil's BBQ but it was definitely worth it! What's great is they have time markers posted throughout the line, so you know approximately how much longer you have to stand in line. We got there pretty late and the line was still ridiculously long, so we knew this place was worth trying. After waiting for so long, you can't help but want to order the entire menu! We had the pork and beef ribs, I definitely liked the pork better. The BBQ sauce is amazing, to the point where you'll find yourself licking your fingers. The beer battered onion rings are delicious!! The corn would have been better if it was roasted rather than just boiled, but it completed the meal. Definitely worth trying and worth the wait!

GAH I HATE THE WAIT. BUT, it is soooo worth it. The line is usually wrapping around the restaurant but once you are in and you got a table, the food comes out so fast it makes you forget about the initial wait. I always order the rack of baby back ribs and fries. Their fries are okay, nothing too special but delicious when you coat it with their bbq sauce. I think their sauce is something that really stands out. The meat is very tender and always falls off the bone nicely. I sometimes hate going to this place because it makes me eat soooo much. But, definitely a fun place to go with friends and just pig out. I love it. Definitely need to try it if you are in SD. probably best bbq place in town.

What can I say about Phil's BBQ that hasn't been said already?  **sigh**  There are no words that can describe Phil's... All you have to say Phil's and I start salivating and want BBQ that only Phil's can offer. It's different from all the BBQ joints I've been to. The wait was about 1 1/2 hrs, but they serve you Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia with cookies (Phil, you know exactly where to get me).  The only bad thing that day was when we got to the hostess, and said we were a crew of 16 :) That's how I roll... I digress. One of the wait staff pulled us aside and said wait here with a bunch of tables that weren't pushed together and left us alone for about 10 minutes. We started to put the tables together, because we might as well do something... However another wait staff yelled at us for moving the tables and said we were supposed to be on the other side. wtf. Then they told us that we all had to order under one cashier. ugh? ok. I would have removed 1 star... but as soon as the food arrived, everything was forgiven. Yes, it's THAT good. I ordered the Tri-tip sandwich with fries and a soda, which is all you can drink. They even have Fresca on tap. woohoo! I had one of the baby back ribs, it was so tender, the meat just falls off the bone. Onion rings... mmm. beer battered onion rings. mmmmmm. I sampled pulled pork from one of my peeps.... mmmmmm. ::drools:: words. cannot. describe. PHIL's. Just be patient, chill, bring some friends... and you'll finally be able to order.

For years, I've passed by Phil's BBQ and was slightly intimidated by the long lines I've seen this establishment have. After seeing this restaurant being featured on the Travel Channel's "Man Vs Food" (no food challenge - Adam Richman just ate there) and a few friends of mine eating there, I decided to give Phil's BBQ a shot. I got there around 2pm and was at the sign posted "20 Minute Wait"...The wait wasn't that long to my surprise (approximately 16 minutes) and I ordered the Babyback Ribs/Chicken Combo. It didn't take too long for my order to be done so I soaked my teeth into first, the Babyback Ribs...The sauce was excellent and the meat was falling off the bone. I had the same experience with the chicken and the tanginess of the BBQ sause had my taste buds wanting more. I also ordered onion rigs and was I ever into a surprise...a Huge one. The onion rings were gargantuan in size and it didn't disappoint. Now your wondering why I gave Phil's BBQ only 4 stars instead of 5... The truth be told, even though this was excellent BBQ, it's definately not the best. I've gone to quite a few University of Southern California (USC Trojans) Tailgate parties in my lifetime and they make the best Ribs ever...with Phil's BBQ coming in a close second. I highly recommend this place...it has a great atmosphere where friends and family can enjoy. The prices are pretty decent and I see a lot of social activity going on in this place...

I'm usually not one of those people who have to have meat in every meal to count as a meal, and sometimes even eating too much meat makes me feel sick. Every time I come to San Diego to visit friends though, I always make one trip to Phil's. The line may seem long but it isn't too bad. I went on a Saturday around 1:15 and waited about 20 minutes. While in line, employees will tell you to feel free to grab a cup of water from inside, and they hand out menus to save you time at the front. You order from the front then pick up your food from the counter when they buzz you and you find your own table. Last year when I came I ordered the baby back ribs, which is probably the most basic and popular. Very good, even though I'm not a huge ribs fan. This year I got the El Toro because I tried some of my friend's last year and really liked it. It's a sandwich with LOTS of thinly sliced meat and their bbq sauce. When I say lots, I mean the meat is overflowing. I ordered that and a small side of baked beans and small side of fries. I was basically full off eating the meat that was overflowing from my sandwich plus the side of beans and half the fries. The sides are very sizable portions and a small is definitely enough. Good portion, decent prices, delicious!

Been here many times. Always great. The ribs here is always great. The meat on the ribs are tender and can easily taken off the bone. The sides, I'm not a big fan of, mostly because you can't top the ribs, thats the main reason why I come here. The service is one the best I have ever experienced. The staff here are friendly and always helpful. Out of all the times I've been here I never had a bad experience wit the staff here. Also, I have never seem them other than happy there. The place is clean and the atmosphere is great. Parking is isn't that bad, the only problem I have is the long line to get in here. But that just tells you how great it is.

This place is gooooooooood ... my gf's parents took us here and they weren't kidding about how good Phil's BBQ is. We enjoyed a full rack of ribs - tender and perfectly rubbed.  The sauce isn't overwhelming or drenching as you would find at some other places.  Very tasty! The onion rings are probably the best ones I have ever eaten.  The most unique thing is how tasty the batter is and the onion itself is tender where it just rips off when you take a bite instead of dangling and you end up dragging the entire ring of onions - leaving you with just the battered ring. The Broham was pretty good - I was too busy enjoying the rack of ribs that I only took a small bite.  The pulled pork was tender and tasty. The fries were average at best. The next time I am in SD I will have to visit Phil's again to enjoy another rack of ribs ... maybe try the beef ribs, cole-slaw, and mac'n'cheese. One bit of advice, I am glad my gf's parents took us at 11:30am because that is just before the mad dash.

Broham.  Get it.  It's good. Phil's was cool.  The line was pretty long, but the time passed pretty quickly.  I think the anticipation makes the food taste better.  If you're with children, you better make sure they have a Nintendo DS, a bag of chips, and a bottle of water.   ------------------ I went there again, and this time I'm giving them five stars.  Chicken sometimes is "hit or miss" at BBQ joints, but the chicken I was served was expertly cooked.   Is it worth the wait?  Absolutely!

Three stars for their food and the fourth for the warm and friendly staff that not only asked us how we were doing, but really went above and beyond to take care of my family and I! But food first. We got two orders of the Beefy Ribs with fries, one order of the Best of Both (a couple of baby back ribs and a quarter of a chicken) with fries and macaroni salad, and the El Toro Sandwich. The BEEFY RIBS were cooked very well, maybe a liiittle overdone. But they were good and had a lot of meat. We were in awe at the size of these things! The ribs were as long as my face and it takes two hands to eat a rib! They aren't something a fork and a knife can handle; we got down and dirty with the ribs. The BEST OF BOTH offered really the best of both worlds. Though the BBQ CHICKEN was charred on one side, the meat past the skin was moist and I actually liked it more than the ribs. It also came with a small rack of BABY BACK RIBS that were perfectly cooked. They're much more manageable to eat than the beefy ribs, too. The EL TORO's tri-tipped beef was drowning in barbecue sauce. Maybe it was because there was so much food already, but the sandwich being drenched with sauce made it an unappetizing choice. My cousin commented on the smoky flavor being overwhelming and I completely agree. For folks who aren't really used to eating so much barbecue at once, I wouldn't recommend this sandwich. The BARBECUE SAUCE was really good. I liked the bit of heat to it the most and it has something unique about it. It's not like any other bbq sauce I've tasted before! Their FRIES were delicious, albeit a bit soggy after being crushed by the ribs on top of them. They go very well with the ranch to add some variety in flavor during the meal. The MACARONI SALAD was okay. It was macaroni, mayo, and bits of celery. I'm not a fan of celery, but the macaroni was alright to eat. It was about a 50 minute wait for us at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. During our wait, we were greeted three times by someone from the restaurant. First time, they gave us our menus so we'd be ready to order. Second time to tell us about how much longer and to see if there were any big groups. The third time was to see if anyone else wanted a menu or wanted to be green and return the menu to the restaurant. When we were eating, a couple of folks came by and asked to see if we needed anything. Someone even offered to help me take my plates to the table. There was ample parking and they take credit card. :) Definitely must try at least once in your life if you're in town.

I don't know if this place needs any more reviews.  Haha!  Just kidding!   It was my first time coming to Phil's and as I expected there was a long line.  Waiting for Phil's BBQ is like waiting for an amusement park during the summer.  My friends and I waited a good 30 to 40 minutes.  Hopefully the San Marcos location will not be this packed.  I guess I just have to find out this coming October.   Overall, the food was delicious.  I was surprised with my "small" side order of fries.  Personally, I thought it was a large.  I wouldn't mind coming here again.

I called Phil's at around 10AM, asked them if they take reservations (NO) and how busy it is around 6 (VERY BUSY) and when they were the least busy (FROM 2 TO 5, USUALLY). So my boyfriend and I decided to get there at 4:30 and eat an early dinner to avoid the infamous ridiculously long lines. We get there at 4:30, and the line is LONG. But we figure, it's ok, it's four thirty, we have time to spare, we're not hungry yet. So we wait. The line gets longer as we move up in line. And at last, we're at the front! Our wait time was a little more than an hour (!!!!) and we got our food at around 6. Wow. What luck - dinner at dinner time. By the time we got our food, the length of the line outside had probably doubled. If their business is completely constant from at least 4:30 til 8pm every day? That's amazing - the food is probably delicious and they're probably doing everything right. The food was delicious. My boyfriend got a full rack of baby back ribs (with fries and potato salad) and I got the best-of-both with baby back ribs and chicken (with a baked potato). Both were super tender, super delicious. My chicken was drowning in sauce (minus points) but it was extremely tender. Much much better than expected, and I really recommend it. The ribs were also really tasty. I'm rating four stars instead of five because although the ribs and chicken were deliciously tender, their flavor wasn't anything special. The fries were alright. The baked potato was just a baked potato. And the only non alcoholic drinks they have were fountain sodas. Ribs go so well with serious sodas, I don't know what they're thinking! They're missing real bottled root beer. And it almost ruined my meal :( Next time, I would recommend ordering to-go. Unless you have nothing to do for a couple hours, the line isn't worth it, and you can eat it just as messily at home, and wash it down with a root beer float.

Our search for tasty BBQ finally brought us to Phil's one evening. I had heard about the popularity of this place, but NEVER could have expected the line that snaked around the building. Wha???? Well, we weren't in any hurry, so we decided to wait, entertaining ourselves with Nate's Charades iPhone App. (If you were in line with us that evening, yes, we are always that entertaining...) Finally, after about an hour and a half-ish of waiting, we entered Phil's, ordered, and DEVOURED. I had the Beef Brisket sandwich with the coleslaw on top; I can't remember what Nate had. Doesn't matter; I loved mine; so much I practically inhaled it. Maybe that's part of the ploy - you make people wait long enough, anything tastes good... Anyway, I must say that, having tried many a BBQ joint in America's Finest City, Phil's is at the top of the heap in my book. -1 star for the wait.

San Diego isn't known for it's BBQ, but there are a few places that don't bring shame to the term "BBQ". All their meats have that pink smoke ring and are extra meaty. Compare to most midwest or southern BBQ joints some of the sides are lacking in creativity and flavor. Don't get the fries, it's not that they aren't good, but you get your BBQ and you dig in and by the time you realize how good the meat and you see other food on your plate is the time the fries are cold. The sandwiches are good, but the breads are subpar and the lines are long. If your a traditional BBQ enthusiast I'd stay away from the sauce, which for most people is good, but still overused. If you've got 1-2 people just belly up to the car as you can order from there rather than wait an hour or more. Where was the sweet tea also? The reason i gave this 4 stars and not 3 like the majority of the review would suggest is that the meat was very good and there was alot of it.

Whoa! For a visitor like me seeing that line wrap around the plaza, I bolted! No way was I gonna wait in that line. Who know how long it would take? But the staff there reassured us that the line moves pretty quickly and that it'll be worth it. So we took his word and waited in line. It did move fairly quickly and by an hour or so we ordered, took our seats and began to feast. The BBQ was indeed delicious. The meat fell off the bones and the sauce was finger-lickin' good. I also liked the macaroni salad. And yes, scoop me some steamed veggies so I can at least pretend like I'm eating healthy. So was the wait worth it? Yes, only if you have some good friends to keep you company.

It almost feels redundant to write another 5 star review for this place on YELP, but it really is that good.  Because everyone has beaten the deliciousness of this place to death, I'll offer a concise recommendation of what to get. To get a taste of all the goodness, I recommend going and splitting the El Toro (tri tip sandwich featured on Man v Food) and a combo plate of baby back ribs and chickless with fries and macaroni salad.  Also get a side of Onion rings because they are deliciously lightly breaded.  My favorite part of it all is when the fries on the side of the ribs seeps into the sauce and you get the great tangyness of it. If you're looking for something cheaper, they offer baby back ribs plus fries plus 2 onion rings for $6.50 (or so-ish)!!!  So don't think that everything is expensive here.  You get a lot for your money. If you ever feel like making a trek for other BBQ, Firestone's in San Luis Obispo still has the best tri tip sandwich I have ever had.  Do what you can to visit this place at least once in your life!! Best tri tip sandwich and seasoned fries.  INCREDIBLE!  But, this is a Phil's BBQ review, so just come here and bask in the glory that is Phils.

Full disclosure - I don't like bbq. Well, I don't like bbq sauce anyway.... (please don't kill me!) I decided to give Phil's a chance because my friend was raving about how it had almost 2000 yelps and a 4.5 star rating. We prepared for our visit to Phil's by shopping at the outlets, having a very light lunch and arriving at the "off" time of 3:30. Well, even at 3:30 we ended up waiting in line for about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad. Plus it gave me time to contemplate the menu. I ended up with the rib-less dinner with beans and fries, plus onion rings. The rib-less dinner consists of chunks of tender, nicely charred pork shoulder. I was happy with my choice which left me relatively clean and sauce-stain free. I was a little bit surprised by how spicy the bbq sauce is here. It's not like sriracha spicy, but it definitely has a kick. The onion rings were massive and delicious. I love battered onion rings and Phil's did a great job. Portions are huge and our plates were overflowing with food. Check out the pulled pork sandwich which is literally overflowing with meat. I took some of my pork home and I think it almost tasted better the next day cold. If it's your birthday be sure to tell the staff because then you and your party get to cut to the front of the line and I think I heard something about a free moon pie?? I wish I knew that before I arrived, it would have saved us 20 minutes of standing! Phil's basically just has chicken and ribs. I wish they had brisket and burnt ends (my fave!!). But I can't blame them for sticking to what they do best.

My go to BBQ spot in San Diego, gotta love this hometown place! Favorites are the beef and pork ribs, but i love to order the tickler, which gives a little meat but a lot for your money with the fries, coleslaw, and two onion rings. Great for people like me who have trouble choosing the side orders sometimes, since this way you get a little of everything. Regardless, the barbeque no matter what option you get, is always tender, flavorful, and nom-nom-nom all the way. Also, best time to go is outside of the normal lunch/dinner hours on the weekend... my favorite time is an early lunch or early dinner on the week days. Everyone there is always happy, so you get great service each time. Probably one of the best spots for customer service even if you're not a big fan of the food!

Mostly I'm writing this review to say this one thing. A few 1 star reviews??!! What are those people smoking?! Crack?! Oh right. Anyways, this place has rekindled my love of ribs and outside of somewhere in the South, Phil's is as good as it gets. Tip: If you have a small party, like less than 4, you can usually skip the line and go right to the bar.

Yep.   Great place.   But you know that.  You were probably in front of me in the line.  Bastard. The thing is... I really wanted to not 5 star Phil's.  Because all my friends are like "oh... Jimmy's?   Well... not as good as Phil's."   "Kaminsky's?  hah... go to Phil's" But damn... they were right.  The most impressive thing past the BBQ itself... the people that work there.  They have it down.  COMPETENCE ROCKS.  Thank you. p.s.   El Toro.  Very good.  Pulled pork sandwich.  Even better.  Mac Salad.  Great.   Onion Rings. OMG.  Baby Back Ribs... wonderful. But the most surprising thing to me, is that beef ribs.  Wow.  I never order beef ribs because they just aren't as good as pork.  Except at Phil's. And the quantity of food?  Holy crap.  That is a lot of  bang for the buck.  LEFTOVERS!

I used to live in San Diego for four years, and only ventured out to Phil's .. maybe less than ten times. I should've gone more.  I was thinking about their baby back ribs with coleslaw and fries this morning and nearly cried because I'm now 150 miles away from Phil's, and my friend is there tonight. Phil's is the place to eat at if you're in San Diego.  Where else would people wait up to two hours with big smiles on their faces just to eat? Had to throw in this review for the love of my life in San Diego.  One day, we'll meet again....

Prior to coming here, I had high expectations. The rave reviews and the long lines told me this was supposed to be great barbeque. My first bite took shattered all those expectations. It was even better than I thought it would be! The tenderness of the meat and the full force of the flavor was overwhelming. Phil's was a life changing experience for me. You must get the beef ribs without sauce. Eat it as a dry rib.

This place is dellliccciousss!  I found this place on Yelp so decided to give it a try since there were so many good reviews on it.  When my boyfriend and I got there the line was out the door.  We were about to turn our car around and go somewhere else but we chose to stay and wait since we were already there.  And plus we're not from SoCal so when are we ever going to come back again to try this place out.  We probably waited in line for about 30 minutes which is not bad.  And I do recommend sticking it out and waiting because its really that good. This is not the typical restaurant where they seat you and then you order from a waiter/waitress.  You order at the front and then they give you this pager.  You then walk around and look for a seat.  When the pager goes off you go up to the front and pick up your food.   They have a pretty decent selection on food ranging from chicken, hamburgers to your typical ribs.  We went with the Baby Back Ribs since that's what they're known for.  I got the quarter rib dinner which comes in 4 bones and 2 small sides or a large side.  I went with the 2 small sides of macaroni salad and fries.  I also got a large side of corn.  My boyfriend got the half rib dinner (6 to 7 bones) with sides of cole slaw and potato salad.  The ribs were really really good!  The meat was really tender.  The meat just fell right off of the bone.  And it had this really strong hickory taste to it.  I loved it!   The atmosphere and the service was above excellent.  Our waiter Louis was awesome.  At one point my boyfriend accidentally spilled my cup of water on the floor.  Louis came right away to clean up the mess.  He later came back with a fresh roll of towel and also a large cup of water for me.  He's a sweetheart.   The price on the food is decent.  For the both of us we spent about $25 which is not bad at all.   Loved this place and I hope to come back again soon!

Does Phil's really need another review? After all it already has 2000+ reviews and still coming! Dirts: -Parking sucks! Good luck finding a spot around the area while you still have to wait in line. -Wait is approximately 40ish minutes if you're around the corner Perks: -It's worth the wait! :) -Large portions -Clean facility -Decent prices -Savory BBQ baby back ribs, beef ribs and chicken! (baby back was my favorite) -Coleslaw is awesome -Yummy onion rings with ranch! -Combo Ribs & Chicken is good enough to share (unless you've got a big appetite) Overall: highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the SD area!

Phil's BBQ is ridiculous. My brother and I got here on a Saturday around 4:40 pm and there was already a line around the building. Seriously?? Come on, people...is there nothing else to eat in San Diego? We left and came back Sunday at 10:40 am (it opens at 11) and there was still a line, but it was much shorter (only to the "20 minute" sign). I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs, and it was pretty big...definitely enough for a full meal (half rack is $12.95 before tax and comes with 2 sides). I would have ordered a side of onion rings (not one of the sides you can get), but I wasn't really that hungry since I had eaten breakfast. The ribs were pretty tender and the sauce was very good, but my life wasn't changed or anything (a requirement if I'm going to wait in line for that long). I'll have to come back and try the onion rings some other time. Oh, and there's a separate line for take-out and the bar section...I think those lines were shorter.

Phils BBQ is pretty good.  The lines can get VERY long so beware! I went at around 6pm and the line wasn't that bad, but after we finished eating, the line was super long. I got what everyone else got: the ribs.  The ribs was good, but it had too much bbq sauce on it.  The fries were really good too.  However, I do not know what the big commotion about this place is.  I guess it's because I am not a big meat eater so I wouldn't really care to go here or not if I was in SD.

I went to Phil's a few years ago in their original Mission Hills location. I remember it being very good. I returned to Phil's in their new location last night and found them to be overpriced and overhyped. Let's talk about the good stuff first. The beef ribs are fantastic.  The meet falls off the bones. And there is plenty of it.  I ordered a 3-rib platter and ate just one rib.  If I return, I'll get the one rib teaser. (My hubby got the baby back ribs and chicken combo and was less impressed.) The soda fountain selection is fabulous.  Sprite Zero and Fresca are always on tap. I know it seems like a minor point, but there aren't many places that serve the caffeine-free and diet soda combo, let alone two options. The onion rings are fantastic.  The potato salad was good.  The fries were also yummy.  The whoopee pies for dessert were also good - the chocolate one tasted like a ding dong on crack. My son loved the grilled chicken. The portions on his plate were so big that he had it three nights afterward.  The fact that he ate it for those three nights shows how much he enjoyed it. The new location has good parking. However... The line is always way too long.  Forget going on a weekend.  Forget going anytime past 4:30pm.  You have to be geriatric and go at 3pm in order to avoid a 21 minute wait or longer. The food is totally overpriced.  The total for three of us came to $50. Ha.  BBQ isn't meant to put you into chapter 11.   There is no kid's menu.  I know I sound like a total station-wagon mom, but come on - between the long lines, high prices, and lack of kids' options, there is little reason to come there with your tots. The lady that took our order was not knowledgeable of the menu items.  Because of her advice, we ended up ordering a gigantic plate of extra fries for our son when, in fact, his meal did come with two sides (including fries).  I hate to fixate on one employee's little screw-up, but if you saw the amount of food on our table (and the ratio of fries to everything else), you would scoff. The last thing I want to say is that the sauce was not great.  It was way too sweet, syrupy, and tangy - kind of like cheap sweet-n-sour sauce from a ghetto Chinese place.   I lived in Austin and Houston for four years, and I've been to Memphis.  I've had great BBQ.  This just doesn't compare. My advice? Save yourself the time and the money by going to Baby Back Jack's instead. It's better food, less hassle, and cheaper.  (And you can actually hold a conversation with your hubby without competing with 2 billion other people in the same room and 40 large-screen TVs.)

I have eaten here a couple of times but have learned very quickly the best thing to do is call ahead and take your order to go.  It tastes just as good in the comfort of your home or on a Thursday afternoon at work (mmm that was a good day at work).   When you do eat there, if you end up sitting at a table by the window be prepared to feel like a lion at the zoo. The people waiting in line to get in will start staring at you through the glass hungrily being jealous of the food you are happily consuming.  It's a bit awkward.  Once a guy took a picture of me eating while he was in line. Umm....what do I look like to you man, just leave me alone to enjoy my damn tasty ribs! I love the beef fibs and the Chick-less as far as main dishes.  All the sides are incredible, too.  I like getting a little bit of everything, so I lean towards the Best of Both worlds. Also if you are a bit of a voyeur you can go onto their website and check out the Phil's cam they have and see the state of the line.  Helpful and a bit of a creep move at the same time, do the creep ahhhhh do the creep ahhhhh, get your knees flexin' and your arms t-rexin'.

Oh good I'm just the 2387th person to review this place. Luckily, I wasn't late or anything... My bf is a total snob when it comes to BBQ. He grew up in the South (not Mexico, but Arkansas)...so he feels he knows when the presence of good tastin' BBQ is present and even he simply LOVED this place. Personally, south or no south...I thought it was better than ones he took me to down in AR. Well, I always preach that the food speaks for itself and this place is no exception. Not only did it speak...it sang!! Ahh the sound of Fall-off-the-bone ribs and juicy tender bbq chicken is music to my ears. The side dishes are pretty standard. Normally, I'm not too keen on baked beans, but even that was quite tasty here....along with their potato salad and slaw. They're around the clock busy, so if you have a big group...make sure everyone is on time or else they won't seat you.  Plus, they're not your typical restaurant where you sit and order, but rather you line up...order first, then sit.  Another nice touch about this place is that they serve beer from many of the local SD breweries on tap, but worry not...they also carry imported bottles as well. I think with 2000+ 5 star reviews...not too much else needs to be said...Phil's is worth a try.

I came here again today with a friend, we've been craving Phil's for months. And when I say months, I mean MONTHS. It's been passed due, so we decided to go today. We never actually went on a weekend, which means we never went through the massive line. But when we arrived there I didn't think it was that bad. The line moved pretty quick. We ordered the usual except this time we had a full rib dinner. I had half and she had the other half. And we had a side of fries and potato salad. And is it me or the large side of fries is the same size as the small side? At least I thought so. Usually we can eat a half rib dinner together and we would be full. But nope today we were extra hungry. We chowed down like we haven't ate for days. People might not think it's a lot, but I think it is. If you look around everyone's boxing their food. Not us though, we demolished it. One of the workers came around and was like "Damn, that's pretty good." While staring at us with disbelief. What? He hasn't seen two little Asian girls eat? Haha. I love this place, never disappoints me. And I doubt it disappoints anyone else. By the time we was leaving the line wrapped around the restaurant. People want their Bbq! haha

Funny, every time I dine at a new place with rave reviews, a tiny part of me always hopes to find something horribly flawed with it so that maybe I can be that lone asshole giving the restaurant a measly 1-2 star review. But no, I'm going to tell you right now that Phil's definitely lives up to the hype. First of all, the service was awesome. Although you'll encounter a line that hugs the building, it is always moving. Theres even an outside beer garden near the entrance complete with free water to keep you hydrated as you wait. There are no servers at Phil's, there are plenty of tables to sit at, and the food is ready and in your belly just a few minutes after you order! I recently switched to a pescetarian diet, making very few exceptions for eating mammals or birds. But when going to a BBQ restaurant with a group of friends (including one who can't shut up about how orgasmic the food is), what are you going to do -- eat a garden salad by yourself? No way. I tried the half chicken meal with sides of macaroni salad and baked beans. Both of them were excellent! Usually, macaroni salad is a hit or miss for me (since I hate it when they're made w/ too much mayo) but this one was one of the best I've had yet. As for the chicken...outstanding! Tender, meaty, juicy and sauced up just how I like it,I was beside myself with every bite. One of my friends got the tri-tip sandwich (which resembled the most epic sloppy joe you can have) and I had a couple of bites of it and boy, was it tasty! I swear that thing was BLEEDING with BBQ sauce. Oh, did I mention my whole meal was under $10? SCHWING!

Wow, where to begin. I guess I'll start off with the atmosphere. This place is your classic BBQ restaurant, with that classic look, some nice blues playing in the background, and everyone grubbin' down on some great BBQ without a worry of getting dirty. It cannot get any better than this as far as atmosphere goes. However, this is the part that least concerns me, since I'm all about the food and service, so I'll move on. The wait. Not much too say about this, except that if you go to the San Diego location, expect to wait more than 20 minutes if you're going around dinner time. However, the San Marcos location is never crowded, and it's closer to me, so I usually always go there. Next, the service. Both this location and the San Marcos location have AWESOME service. First, when you enter, the host at the front is always friendly and makes conversation, asks you if it is your first time, and then sends you up to a register. Then the cashier, who is also very friendly (who isn't here?), takes your order and gives you a pager so you can pick up your food when it's ready. Don't worry, if you order many plates, they will help bring it to you! Lastly, I'd just like to mention that Phil's gives all of their employees the authority to handle everything in almost all cases. That's why everyone is so happy here. They always come up to you while you're eating and ask you if you need anything - more BBQ (which is WARM by the way!), Ranch (yes this is free if you ask for it after you order), and will even refill your drink for you! Overall, the service is excellent and I can't complain. Now, the price. I have to say, Phil's prices are extremely cheap for the portions they give you. A Sandwich is $6.95, but mind you, it is piled high with meat, and practically a moat of meat around the sandwich. I will talk about the food later on, save the best for last :). Overall, the prices are very fair and affordable. You can expect to spend from $5 to $20 for a dinner, but the latter being only if you're a huge eater. I'm a huge eater and can go home stuffed for $10 of food! Now, the best of all. The food! I need to say right off the bat that the Broham is absolutely delicious! It is a pulled pork sandwich made from pork shoulder that is extremely tender and practically melts in your mouth. It's drenched in BBQ, put in a toasted bun, and topped with coleslaw (I always get this on the side), all for $6.95! This and large fries (which is $2.25 and serves 5, but 1 if you're me :) ) is around $10 and fills me up for sure! I have tried mostly everything here, including both types of ribs, the chicken, and the tri-tip, and while all are GREAT, nothing can compare to the flavor of the Broham. Not to mention the generous portions of everything. Lastly, their BBQ sauce is the best I have ever tried. Words can't describe it. It has a hint of spiciness, it's very sweet, and after debate with many of my friends, we are certain their is a hint of apple/cinnamon in this. I swear, we can taste it! Other things I enjoy are the onion rings (I normally hate onion rings) because they are huge which means more batter! Also the fries + the BBQ sauce is just awesome. The only thing is, Phil's doesn't have a food challenge! I wish they did, because I feel like it would attract even more people! They were already on Man Vs. Food, but not for a food challenge. Oh well, one can only hope! Overall, Phil's deserves the 5 stars and I am pleased that it made the top restaurants of 2011. Special shout out to Jessica S. at the San Marcos location for excellent service :)

excellent BBQ. i always order BBQ sauce on the side. by doing that, i can dip my baby back ribs and the chicken. the only complain, very long line at the sports arena location; between  30mins to 1.20mins. the san marcos location is good, waiting time max 20mins.

I wanted to give Phil's 5 stars, but their fries and onion rings aren't the greatest.  Their BBQ IS however extremely good.  Been there twice with big groups and surprisingly we got tables pretty quickly both times (at around 1pm).  They're reasonably priced and the sauce is really good....not the best I've ever had, there's no spiciness, but really good.  I love the TriTip Sandwich and the pulled pork was great too.  The guys I go with usually get the ribs and they love them.  There are no reservations and usually a big line, but the line goes quickly and there's surprisingly lots of seating.  If you're thinking about trying it, think no more and go!  You won't be disappointed.

Phil's BBQ: Hi Phil, how's it going? It's been a long time hasn't it? I've heard you've been staying busy. You always seem to be busy (even during odd hours like 4 pm on Sunday afternoon, etc). I guess when everyone knows how wonderful you are, I can't keep you to myself. I know I'm being forward and all, but I love your ribs. Beef ribs or baby back ribs, I don't discriminate. I love them both equally. I can't choose between them and I'm glad you don't make me. And your sides, macaroni and potato salad are my favorites, but you have so much more to offer. I dream about your ribs from time to time and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I know I don't get to visit you as much as I would like, but when I do, I want to see you. I will overcome the longest line and wait over an hour for you (or call in, pick it up and take it to a friend's house instead), you are def worth it. And I appreciate you putting up a live cam on your website to show me how long the line is to get to you. Not many people know this, but it saved me a few times. From the rib dinners to ticklers (never really had anything other than ribs, but why would you?), it doesn't get much better than you. I heard girls were better in the south, but it's hard to imagine anyone better than you. It's like we have a love/hate relationship between us. I love your ribs and hate when I'm done and have to leave knowing that it will be awhile until I get to see you again. Until next time. Love, Chris

It's the best in San Diego for sure, and maybe the best ever.  Wow.  What tasty food.   Was in SD on business and was recommended to try Phil's by the hotel concierge. Went for lunch.  The line was outside the door.  Good omen!  We only waited 10 minutes to order.  We sat down, and then they call your number. We had the ribs and the brougham sandwich. OMG!.  So very tender and tasty.  The sauce was just right.  Sort of a combo Texan and Kansas City mix.  Tart, tangy and rich. The sides were outstanding also.  Fries and potato salad. The onion rings are a must. Well, over 2000 reviews, lines out the door, and most reviews are 5 star.   Highly recommended for the best BBQ ever.  Can't wait to get back there.

I was honestly not a big fan.  I heard so much about this place and was super excited to go.  I waited about 30 minutes in line for lunch time which was fine because I have waited at least 2 hours for good food before.  The aroma of the place smelt delicious however I was super disappointed with the food.  I got the pork baby back ribs with macaroni salad and fries as sides.  The barbeque sauce was a bit too acidic/tangy for me.  By the time I finished the second rib, my taste buds felt burnt.  Yes, the ribs were tender but I feel like I have had better.  The macaroni salad was okay--it wasn't the best.  The fries were super dry and they weren't even crispy so I wouldn't recommend them at all.  I think the only thing I truly liked here was their onion rings.  They are fairly large and very crispy.  The buttermilk sauce however is a bit too plain to accompany the strong flavor of the onion.  It tastes much better with the ketchup in my opinion.  All in all, I don't think I would want to come back--not because the food was terrible but because I do not want to wait in line for average tasting food.

I feel like just another 5 star review but I need to speak my mind.. Amazing beefy ribs!! They were just falling off the bone yummo..the line wasn't crazy when I got there but when I left it sure was super long..the people working here are super nice and very attentive. They frequently checked on us and before I asked for a box they showed up with it and soon after with a bag. I now see what the whole rave is about but it's so worth it the food is outstanding it's indescribable I honestly fell in love with the beef ribs and the bbq sauce was perfect. Too bad I can't frequent this place as much as I would love to since being from out of town.. hands down this is one of the best BBQ.

45 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon (around 2). My boyfriend and I wanted to try everything on the menu so we had two orders of The Best of Both Worlds. Baby back ribs &chicken with two small sides of macaroni salad and potato salad and beefy ribs & chick-less with a large side of baked potato. EVERYTHING was good! BUTthe baby back ribs and chicken was better than beefy ribs and chickless. OH YES! and a small order of the onion rings, A MUST! I was anticipating to have leftovers but everything was sooo good we finished every last bite! Standing in line, I asked a kind lady in front of me what was a must have here. She said everything. BOY WAS SHE RIGHT! She also added, this place is addicting. RIGHT AGAIN! Woke up this morning craving Phil's bbq D:

Best BBQ in ALL of San Diego hands down!!!!!!! This place is just downright amazing. I went with some of my friends for a late lunch, early dinner type meal around 3:00 on a Saturday because we were afraid if we would have gone around 5 or later there would have been a MASSIVE line, and you know what even at 3 PM there was a huge line so that right there tells you that this place has to be good and the wait was well worth it. As soon as we got in through the doors the line continued haha. I was immediately taken by the aroma of barbeque and great food. You better come hungry too and expect to have tons of food to go because the portions are huge and for incredible prices too. When you get seated at your table, they have a paper towel roll in the middle cause the food gets very messy. The overall atmosphere was awesome. Now getting to the food. So we all decided to order our own thing so we could share our food with each other. I ordered the EL Toro which was the tri-tip sandwich and loved it but I think my personal favorite was The Broham which was the pulled pork sandwich. It was so tender and juicy. I also loved the onion rings or colossal rings as they call them because they are huge and the french fries were very tasty as well. Surprisingly though the BBQ sauce was a little spicy which was actually new to me but it was good nonetheless. Overall this place is downright amazing and I can say that I will definitely be back soon. I also think I deserve a little pat on the back for finishing my meal and more especially being a mere 5'5" 122 pound dude. It was tough but I managed and pulled through. Thank God it was so delicious, that sure helped a lot haha. EDIT: No matter how many times you go here, this place never disappoints. After my third time here, I didn't want to leave. The difference between this time and the first two times is that even after eating all of my food on my massive bowl, I was still hungry lol. My friends both got full before me and weren't able to finish their food, so I finished it for them and still wanted more haha. I can never get enough of those amazing onion rings of theirs. They are the flat out best I have ever had.

We weren't even hungry at the time, but I knew we could not pass up the chance to try Phil's BBQ while we were in SD. I was in disbelief at the crowd outside when we first rolled into the parking lot! The line curled around the side of the restaurant, which reminded me of the lines at Magic Mountain. We decided to bypass the line and order take out to enjoy at the picnic tables by Mission bay. There was barely anyone ahead of us in the carry-out line... and after taking our number, it literally took 5 minutes for us to get our order. We ordered the full rack of baby back ribs and took a crapload of moist toilettes and napkins. When we got to the beach, we dug in and it was delicious!... and messy! The ribs were super tender and the sauce had the perfect amount of spice and tangy-ness. I don't know if I would have the patience to wait in line... maybe if I was majorly craving BBQ. PS. by the entrance, they had complimentary ice-cold water, which was lightly flavored with cucumber and lemon/lime so that was a nice touch!

I've tried. I've been to many different rib places, and I still can't say I have had anything better than Phil's. Too bad I no longer live in SD. I pray to the rib Gods that some day, good ol phil decides to expand up here. This guy could become a billionaire if he opened up a chain. The meat is fall of the bone tender, charred to perfection. The BBQ sauce is the BEST bbq sauce I have ever had. Sweet, tangy, and not too thick. It's almost like a bbq glaze. And the price. ~22 bucks for a full rack and 2 sides?!? That beats any of those chains like chili's, tony romas, that offer the same deal with crappy ribs. Sure, the line is long. 45 mins to an hour. but HELL! if THAT many people are waiting, then you know it's good.  It's definitely worth the wait. Some people say that the 'meat' quality is not that good. Then don't eat it. GO eat steak. This ranks as one of my favorite restaurants of all time.

Contrary to some of my other reviews, this is gonna be short and sweet, because there are just not words in the English language about how good the food is here. Ribs.  Beefy or baby back, you can't go wrong.  Order whatever sides you want, but for the love of all things good and holy, order the ribs.  You'll thank me later.

I love the BBQ at Phil's.  We are regulars. My favorites:  Beef ribs, Broham (Pulled Pork Sandwich), El Toro (Tri-tip Sandwich) My favorite sides: Corn on the Cob, Fries, Baked Beans I wish they had a good dessert, like bread pudding.  I'm not a fan of the moon pie thing. Phil's sells their seasoning and BBQ sauce.  We always keep these in stock at home. The lines are always long at peak times, but it is so worth the wait. We keep going back, and so does the rest of San Diego. I'm sooo happy they opened a Phil's up north.  We live between the 2 locations, so we have a choice. :) Great service Delicious BBQ Catering available Expect a line during peak times

I went here under the recommendations of many of my friends and ive heard about this place from random people too. I took the 2 hour drive here to buy in to the hype and needless to say it did not disappoint. The wait here can be a while i came on a weekday and waited approximately 40 ish minutes because its almost always crowded. Ordering is an easy process and theres plenty of cashiers to serve you. Food wait is not very long considering the amount of people ordering. I ordered 2 Full rack of baby back ribs with 2 small sides (French Fries and Macaroni salad). The bill came out to be $20.42, the portions here i can say are quite generous. Each rack has about 5-6 ribs one of mine had 7 and the other had 6 which i wasnt complaining about. The meat on the baby back ribs is very tender and just falls off the bone. The sauce on the ribs is perfect blend of spice and sweet and just offers an awesome baby back rib experience. The small sides here are actually quite large, the fries were decent but nothing special. The macaroni salad was above average to me. Overall i give this restaurant the highest of my recommendations. I thought the 2 hour drive was well worth it and would definitely come back again.

Came here for lunch today with 2 friends. There was a line winding slightly around the building from the entrance to about 50 ft. away. Don't be TOO discouraged, the line moves at an adequate tempo...well at least it did for us! Now about the food! :) What we got: -Full Beef Rib Dinner (5 bones) with Potato salad and macaroni salad with an extra side of baked beans The baked beans to be honest sucked. The flavor was extremely one-note and it didn't have that deep flavor good baked beans usually have. Not worth getting as a side. I prefer Lucille's baked beans...then again baked beans everywhere are too damn sweet. The potato salad is quite good; it had herb-y notes to it and it's just an overall good potato salad that is NOTHING like the kind of sweet  and yellow potato salad from supermarkets. The macaroni salad for me tasted very similarly to the potato salad, but that isn't a bad thing. The fact the potato and macaroni salad aren't sweet make them great! AND THEN THE RIBS... GET THE BEEF RIBS! I ate a bite of  half of the "Broham" and the "El Toro" and then took a bite of a beef rib. My eyes rolled to the back of my head and I didn't even want to go back to the sandwich halves. What does it taste like? Fatty in a way great beef ribs are, that great beef taste just about everyone loves with an aroma of smoke (a more hard smoke if that makes sense as opposed to a sweeter smoke taste Lucille's bbq has), then all that cut by a tangy bbq sauce. I'm pretty sure you could say the sauce has TWANG. Actually, anyone who comes here for the beef ribs...ASK FOR SAUCE ON THE SIDE. They do put a little bit too much for my taste. I mean I want to taste the beef itself! A little too much sauce can make it taste like smokey sweet and sour ribs. -Regular Beef Rib Dinner (3 bones) with cole slaw and potato salad. -Small order of onion rings that came with buttermilk ranch. The onion rings are pretty damn good. Rich because they're fried and you dip them in buttermilk ranch. The onions don't slip out when you bite into them which is always nice you know. If you like onions rings, these won't hurt you to try. Maybe. -One "Broham" sandwich (pulled pork with cole slaw on bun) Meh. I might have gotten it at a wrong time. The pork tasted like pork meat does when it is old. It didn't really taste of pork...and even more surprisingly it didn't have a smoky taste I was expecting. I will have to give it a shot another time. -One "El Toro" sandwich (tri-tip with bbq sauce) I saw this sandwich on Man vs. Food so I had to try it. The tri-tip in my sandwich didn't taste fresh at all. It tasted like it was reheated and has this semi-dry experience to it. Also, the meat was cut extremely thin like pastrami...which definitely added to the dryness of the meat. I was expecting better out of this sandwich. Tri-tip should be juicy and the texture however sliced shouldn't be like a cross between extremely thin beef jerky and pastrami. AND there was too much sauce. -One whoopie pie. Nothing special and I've had better. An oreo cakester tastes better quite frankly. It's so sugary that it's triabetes-inducing! OVERALL! I would come here again for the beef ribs and potato and macaroni salad. And I would remember to ask for the ribs with sauce on the side. The sauce is pretty good, but too much and it makes the bbq have an overbearing tangy flavor! I happily say that Phil's BBQ is better than Lucille's BBQ. It's cheaper! :)

Line might be long but service was pretty quick. The food is ok, we got beef ribs and bbq chicken with a small side of onion rings. OMG the order of onion rings were HUGE!!!! The size of the beef ribs were on the smaller side, but it was good - a bit dry on sauce (sauce is extra!!! WTF!!!). It was ok but not amazing. On a side note - when we were there the NBA game was on the TV but one of the guest wanted to watch hockey so they changed the channel, my friend asked them if it was possible to put the basketball game back and the guy answered, "I don't think there is a game on..." FAIL!!! LOL And he went and talked about it to his fellow workers and laughed, I laughed too.

Phil's can make some mean BBQ. Saucy, finger-lickin' good, this is probably the only time I wouldn't mind waiting an hour in line before ordering and another 10 minutes for the food to arrive. Service is great and the workers definitely know how to keep the crowd happy. The line usually wraps around the corner and down the side of the building. If you have a party of 6 or more, they'll let you in ahead as space becomes available. Come with a big appetite because with an entree and the sides, you get a lot of food; this is bang for the buck to the max. The chicken was a bit dry, so I'd stick with the baby back ribs. The ribs literally melt off the bone almost like ice cream off a popsicle stick. Grab a bib, some cold beer from the bar, and chow down. For your convenience, there's a hand washing station on the way out of the exit door so you don't have to leave with sticky hands.

If I am ever in this area again, I am definitely coming back... but only for the onion rings and buttermilk ranch. The BBQ itself was good; the ribs slipped effortlessly off the bone and were perfectly charred, but they were also smothered in an overwhelming amount of BBQ sauce. I liked the baby back ribs a bit better because they were 1) easier to eat and 2) more tender. The sides that we got (coleslaw, corn on the cob) were pretty good, but the onion rings outshone them in every way. Sigh, now I want onion rings.....

I'm really only giving this 4 stars because the line was so insane and the ribless dinner was a little dry when I was there mid-July, 2011. I went there with some friends who had family in the area who went here all the time.  We were very lucky to find two spots at the bar with two people next to them getting up to leave (Four people together at the bar is evidently uncommon). When we are at the bar we can order food/drinks from the bartender. However, if you wait in line like most people, you have to order at the front, sit and wait for your food to be ready.  While this my be an inconvenience it's worth it for the high quality of food and it's obviously worth it to all the other people that have a couple hours to kill by standing around the side of the building.

WOW!! THIS PLACE IS SO UNREAL. The Ribs are the Best! Best time to go is on a game night watch with all your friends. I get excited about someone saying Phil's BBQ. I think the wait is worth it but some people are just impatient. I'm a big food taster so if you love ribs GO TO PHIL's BBQ you won't regret it.

If this is your first time here, order this: Full rack of baby back ribs with sides cole slaw and fries with a Stone Smoked Porter. After you eat this once you'll probably wanna come back and order the same exact thing more than several times. Best bbq restaurant I've eaten at, one of the must do things in San Diego. My second time here on a saturday night. The wait was over an hour and a half; their 21 minutes and 14 seconds mark at a certain point in the line is false - it actually is another 42 minutes.

Wow. This place is incredible. The ribs absolutely fall off the bone, and the BBQ sauce is simply amazing. I got the pasta salad and the fries, and they were both excellent sides. The food is so good, and you get a ton of it if you're not careful with ordering! I had a giant plate that made me look like the fattest possible glutton. I've never had a plate of food that made me so self-conscious. But, once I started to eat it, I stopped caring. It was too good, and I couldn't be bothered to wipe the sauce off my face. This is the kind of place where you wait in line (and if you come during peak lunch/dinner hours, there will be a LONG line) and order, then sit and wait for your meal. So service is nothing special. Even if the line is long, if you're from out of town, wait - it's worth it.

Best BBQ you can have in the area, possibly all of SoCal and beyond.  The meat is flavorful and well cooked.  There's a reason why there's always a line! What I've done more than once is order it to go (you can skip ahead to the to-go line) and order drinks at the bar.  If you can find a tabled area there, grab it and wait for them to call up your order. Can be a bit pricey, but you gotta expect that of BBQ.  I will make a stop here in SD for this any day.

Now this place was Da Bomb too!! When we arrived the line was around the building but it moved fairly quickly. This was a full fledge restaurant and it was amazing to see so many people coming to this place, but you know what it was an awesome Beef Rib experience. Out of all the rib eating experiences this is by far tthe best Beef Rib experience ever. The meat basically came off the bone and the meat was so tender. This is the only thing I would recommend in the whole restaurant. We did order baby back pork ribs but they were not as good as I was expecting, but they were still tender. We also ordered their onion rings and the onions were sweet but yet again they were not up to par from past experiences and the chicken well that was nothing as compared to the beef ribs. Essentially this place is a self serve restaurant and it isn't a place to hang out after dinner because they have a line outside full of hungy patrons waiting to savor the meats. One recommendation is to expand their bathrooms because one for a man and one for a woman isn't cutting it.

for baby back ribs, there is no better place in California than Phils BBQ. in addition to the baby back rib, which is a must have, you must order the onion rings. Both the pull pork and brisket sandwiches are good choices. i personally prefer the pulled pork since it comes with coleslaw. The lines are long but it is worth the wait. it is also difficult to get a table but like i said, its worth the trouble. btw, i really miss the old school location on goldfinch. sure miss the days when phils was a hole in the wall restaurant in a residential area.

OH MY GOSH! I love Phil. I truly do. If I wasn't already married I'd marry him. That man can cook!! And I love to eat, so I'd say we are a match made in heaven. I ate at Phil's today, again, and I ordered the half order of baby back ribs, again. NO sides. No fluff. Just meat and bones. I ate it all and then I licked the plate. The patrons sitting next to me seemed to like the fact that I am a good eater 'cause they were smilin' and pointin' at me after I finished cleaning my plate. I thought maybe they were trying to tell me I had some sauce on my face, but I had just used the free plastic bib I was wearin' to wipe up, so I'm sure that wasn't it.  I just smiled back and gave a lil' wink.   Everyone is so nice at Phil's....I just love that about this place. Good food, nice people, decent prices. I only wish they served some sweet tea to go with all that yummy BBQ'd meat.

I feel this place is over rated.  I grew up in Indiana right on the Mason Dixon line along the Ohio River and the area is known for having outstanding BBQ.   I can remember as a kid going to the yearly church BBQ right before the new school year.  The pits would be dug out on Saturday and several men would stay up all night roasting the meat for Sundays big chow down.  After a full day of three-legged races, egg tosses, water balloon fights we would grab our plates and be given a generous portion of BBQ....mmm...the sauce, spicy and not  too sweet, drenched on the pulled pork and beef.   (please don't wake me from this dream.) Back to reality...Phils is ok, but the sauce taste like it is filled with high fructose corn syrup...way to sweet.  And they don't have fresh rye sandwich bread on hand.  Believe me, BBQ on rye bread with onions and  sliced pickles is amazingly gooooooood!   Sorry Phil...someone has to deflate the EGO a bit with all our 5star reviews on here.

Best Southern BBQ in the West Coast. Hands down. Both the baby back ribs and the beef ribs are fall-off-the-bone, licking-your-fingers awesome. Coming from the South, I've never had Southern comfort food like this since leaving town. The place is packed even in between meal times, and that just tells you how good this BBQ is.

Let's face it... when people think of BBQ capitals, San Diego is not the first, second, or third (or top 10), place on the average American's mind, but man, does Phils BBQ slap those people across the face. OK so I'm totally not a BBQ expert of any kind, but I do know what I like and I most DEFINITELY LOVE Phils. it's a bit pricy (thus 4, not 5 stars), but it is worth it in portions cause it's A LOT. My personal order is half a rack of pork ribs, 2 beef ribs, an order of fries and macaroni salad (I don't even like mac salad, but that's just how good Phils does it!). - ok... I know that sounds like a lot of food... and yes, it is... but it's so good you'll definitely eat it all, or if you're not a professional eater, you can eat all you can and take some home for dinner/ lunch the next day. seriously though... WOW.

It seems kind of silly to write a review about a place that's already received 1,620 reviews and has damn near five stars. I guess I'm that football player who jumps on the pile even though the guy has already been tackled. Screw it. Why not? There's not much more to say that hasn't already been said. Has anyone mentioned that Phil's is perfect? Probably. Unlike a lot of drugs where people have to chase that first high, eating at Phil's for the 100th time is just as good as the first time you ever tried it. When you take that first bite of food you experience a true state of bliss and a feeling of euphoria that you wish would last forever. But it doesn't. It's all over as soon as you pull back out onto Sports Arena Boulevard. Which is why you keep going back.

I usually hate leaving mediocore reviews for BBQ because it is always a touchy subject with people. In the world of BBQ, people have their favorites and hate everything else - I'm usually not like that. So I saw the line at Phil's and had to try it. Line moves fast, employees were super friendly. The Pulled Pork shoulder sandwich was just totally blah. The baked beans had no bang to them. The onion rings were the only saving grace. Maybe i just don't like the Carolina sweet sauce (but I usually do like that), so I don't know what it was. There was a lot of meat - but it just didn't work for me. I will give it another shot on another day and update. There has to be something better in San Diego than this. I don't really trust a place that is feeding 500 people at the same time.... Seating was hard to come by

I'm a self-proclaimed Q snob.  I don't take my reviews of Q joints lightly.  Having been to several of the top rated places in the US, I think I know what I'm talking about. Phil's is not one of the top rated places in the US.  It is a sufficient substitute though when you are in the mood for smoky goodness and can't get to some of the best. I had the pulled pork, baby backs, and beef ribs.  Stay away from the beef rib.  It was just okay.  The pork and baby backs were well done.  I prefer a little more smoke to my pork which I didn't find at Phil's.  A good strong smoke coupled with say a Bryant's type sauce is Q heaven. If you decide to do the ribs, ask for them dry with some sauce on the side.  That's probably a better option than allowing the kitchen crew to decide how wet you like your ribs.  I didn't do that and found myself sopping the sauce off the ribs. Fries are good.  I wasn't impressed with the onion rings.  Too much batter.  I'm one of the those onion loaf fans anyway.  That seems to be the only way to enjoy rings with Q, at least in my book. For those that complain about the line, try going at off times.  We were there about 2P and waited just a few minutes.  I know sometimes schedules don't allow but if you are not stuck on a time frame, this would be an option. We ended up sitting in the bar area.  Not sure how beer works in the other part of the dining room. I would return to Phil's if I were in the area.

I promised after I visited this place, I would yelp them and here I am. Given that it's over 2k of reviews, I'll be brief. Service: VERY nice, despite the business, he asked me what's wrong when I stood up and I said that I wanted a booth. He helped me look, it was futile. I guess I should be grateful for a table. Food: Beefy ribs-excellent, moist and melts in your mouth. Baby back ribs-same. Fries-despite expecting something generic, it was so crispy and good. Like it was literally just fried. Onion rings-could be crisper Mac salad-I'm not a mac salad lover so don't trust my opinion in this. I didn't like it. Chicken-dry, just get the ribs. Pro: you get bang for your buck, I have so much leftovers. Con: long line apparently, however, I didn't have to wait so long. Usually, it runs around the store.

Went to Phil's based on TV proram "Man vs Food".  Well after waiting 2 hrs to get in, the food was over rated, service nothing special and couldn't even get a beer with my meal.  Basically, they hoover you in, no dessert for quick turnover and out you go, for the next sucker in the lineup.

Great Food Horrible Service... After hearing about this place from a couple of friends i decided to finally check this place out.  I would have given this place a 2.5 star Review But ill stick with a 3 because this place has one of the best Ribs I have ever devoured.  The Baby Back ribs were Great and the sides of Cole Slaw and Macaroni Salad, Yummy! So why the 3 star Rating?  Well, i have no ideal this was a self serve restaurant.  My friend and I sat in the bar together to avoid the long line outside.  Bartenders were great in serving us and taking our orders but over here they had a pager to pick up your food, OK, that's fine i understand this is a busy place so i picked up our food.  Other then that nobody really helped us in anything else.  Only after closing our bill a server came by to check on us, who even called me a Lady when i was clearly a Man...!!! Here's the worse part, after paying my tab and drinking a little they forgot to give me MY DRIVERS LICENSE BACK!!!  This would normally be ok, if i lived locally in San Diego, but i was visiting from Los Angeles!! This caused so much problems!!! and i missed out on many networking opportunities and events because of a missing LICENSE!!!!  Don't expect much from this place in regards to service but def come here for the food.

Yes, I am definitely a fan. A must go for any visitor in San Diego, and you can ask any San Diego native. the lines are long, but you can phone in your order to have it to go, much more convenient option. I haven't gotten anything else besides the ribs here, because I have no reason to. I'm no barbeque expert, but I know what's good and what's not. and this stuff is good. what more do you need to know? I prefer the beef ribs, because they are huge and meaty. totally satisfied after 3 bones, but it won't stop me from finishing the entire full rack. come and try it. pretty much everyone else has.

Oh Phil. You make DAMN good BBQ. My mouth is watering just thinking about it... Can't go wrong with the ribs and chicken dinner. The only trouble I've ever had there is trying to figure out which sides I want. Baked beans? Fries? Baked potato? Corn on the cob? It's a tough life for an indecisive Libra like myself. Also, if you ever order from them over the phone (which I recommend because the wait is always crazy long), they'll see your phone number and call you by your name when they pick up. A nice personalized touch that always makes me feel oh-so-special!

After having several friends and acquintances tell me of this place, I was itching to try it. Then one day, I had another friend tell me that Phil's ribs were far better than my favorite over at Mr. Cecils. That was it. Now I definitely had to go and taste the competition. Well, as I found out eating at Phil's is a lot more difficult than I thought. The first try was on a Sunday afternoon and the line was down the sidewalk. So we get in line and after about 15 minutes, I decide to walk up to the front and get an update on the wait time. 2 hours? How can that be? Apparently, they sold out of all the ribs and the next batch wouldn't be ready until then. So the first attempt was a failure. After this I was a little nervous, sold out plus a line down the street. Could Phil's be better than my favorite spot? The second attempt was during a visit to the hospital, down the way, where a friend was being attended to. Unfortunately the line, again, was too long and we didn't have the time to wait since we needed to get back to LA. 2 strikes. Man... the food must be really good! Was what I was thinking to myself. Well, third times a charm and I finally got to experience Phil's. This time it was my mom, my brother and I and we ordered the BBQ Chicken and the Baby Back Ribs. Once inside, I realized that Phil's was much larger than it appears from the outside. After 10 minutes of waiting our food was ready. The smells in the air combined with all the people chowing down, my anxiety was building. I couldn't wait to sink my teeth in. The sauce was tangy with a hint of spice. If you love getting down and dirty while getting sauce everywhere, you'll probably like this spot. Think Carl's Jr., " if it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong..." For me there was a little too much sauce. I like being able to taste the meat, then seeing how the sauce compliments it. The meat was tender, but didn't fall off the bone as easily as it could have; which could be a result of how fast they turn over the food. Would I go back? Probably. Is it better than Mr. Cecils? Not even close. Happy me! I have recently heard that Phil's is now located by the Sports Arena. So, I'll have to stop by my next time in SD. Stay posted for a follow up on the new location.

This is the best BBQ Place that SD has to offer period. Im from Missouri and have been to the American Royal in Kansas City many times, so Im pretty picky. I really like the BBQ here: order the babyback for sure and come with an appetite b/c youll want more. :) I dig the small bar they have on the left, good selection of beers & friendly staff.  I like how they have the draft handles completely fozen. Im sure they are running the dead lobster next door out of business, maybe they could tare that thing down and expand the sports bar. :-) Its a real treat to eat here, plan forgiving eachother for manners when you visit, its messy, and your lady wont have any fun here unless she has a healthy appetite. Id suggest just bring the bros and let her have a girls night out.

Seriously great Tennessee-style BBQ. I came here on no particular Sunday...at 3:30PM. The place was PACKED. It's a large establishment, and there was a line out the door and around the building. Unbelievable. Not to mention this is an oddly-industrial sea-side part of town you can't quite put you're finger on. The presence of that kinda crowd was truly impressive. I skipped the massive line and headed straight for the bar, where a few things caught my attention: 1. They had several TVs turned to the NHL Network, and were showing the Calder Cup championship game. This wasn't an accident - they really watch hockey here. In San Diego! 2. The bartender was a guy's guy, with a 'tude to match. But he wasn't mean or anything. He was just a true-blue kinda bartender in a place that appears anything-but. 3. The beer is served in real American style - in super-frozen beer mugs. I had a Karl Strauss amber lager (which is surprisingly similar to Yeungling back east) and it was awesome. That aside, the ribs were great, true smoked BBQ for several hours. Tennessee-style serving slathered in a really great sauce. Not transcendent, but really great.

Right.  I'm gonna pile on with the love for Phil's after 330+ other people beat me to it.  I will try. First and foremost, I am a bad ass rib snob.  No one, and I mean No One does ribs like me.  I smoke loin backs and I do them dry and they will make you cry.  My ribs will rock your universe.  I just don't do ribs at a restaurant.  I go for the pulled pork sammich.  Phil's pulled pork and onion rings rule.  A nice smokey flavor, a zing to the sauce with the traditional coleslaw on top.  And a generous portion at that. So.  I get to jonesing for ribs on my last trip to San Diego and I order the baby backs.  My wife raised an eyebrow.  The "Your Just Setting Yourself Up For Disappointment" raised eyebrow.  The service was rather quick, seems we just sat down and the food was up.  These ribs rule.  Very tender and again the sauce that has just a little zip to it.  The meat pulled away from the bones very nicely but not that frickin' fall off the bones BS that corporate BBQ pushes on the uninformed and misguided.  Next time, I will ask for dry ribs, sauce on the side.  The beans were spectacularly BORING.  The side of slaw belongs on the pulled pork sammich, not with ribs.  Phil's has it goin' on.  Great selection of draft beer too.

One of many reasons I hate not living in San Diego... Talk about hitting spots, bring a pillow with you cuz you may need to take a nap after eating here. I absolutely love everything here but the ribs are my fav. So much sweet tangy smokey flavor all in one bite. The portions are fairly large and I would recommend getting a full rack just so you can enjoy the left overs later! Just thinking about it makes me want to move back to SD! I would pay for the gas if they deliver to San Jose.

This place is awesome. Every time I drive down to San Diego I must always stop by here for lunch or dinner. When you drive in to the parking lot you'll see that there's a long line sticking out at the entrance. The line moves fast so its worth the wait. You order and pay for your food at the registers and then they'll give you a pager and buzzes once your order is ready. You have to seat yourself at any table that is open but all the times I've been here it's packed but we're always able to find a table. But besides all that the food is just to die for. I always get the beef ribs and BBQ chicken. Everything is so amazing. If you're a big fan of BBQ this place is for you.

I didn't like it much ..... Not vegetarian-friendly. HAHAHAHAHA. I know. I know. Sounds dumb. But yes, I went out here with my family and I am the only one who doesn't eat meat. So, I ended up eating nothing but fries and mashed potatoes. Good thing I wasn't hungry in the first place. I give it an average rating, because the mashed potatoes and fries were alright. The fries though kinda bland were good with the Creole seasoning =D. And if you buy soda ... it's all you can drink. So I was happy. So, if you're a vegetarian ... you prolly don't want to be stuck here. (One could probably already tell that by the title of the restaurant though ...) =/

Last night we tried Phil's for the first time.  Actually Phils catered a lunch at my work last year, but I don't remember too much about it so it was a refresher for me.     I did a phone order and drove over to pick up the food.  My goodness.....I had no idea the magnitude of operation that is Phils BBQ.  There was a huge line out the door... on a weekday!?!  Furthermore, I was given a pager just to pick up the food.  That was a first for me.  It took good ten to fifteen minutes to get my food and I was on my way to feed my hungry wife ( and myself....and Mollie the dog ).   I ordered the Beefy rib and chicken combo and wife got the half chicken.  Ribs were excellent.  Chicken was....well, it was chicken.  Unfortunately, instead of concentrating on the chicken, wifey was more interested in the ribs, and rightly so.  They were pretty bomb. There were enough for leftovers which we had for dinner tonight.  For the portions they give, Phils is a mighty good deal.

Going to Phil's isn't just about eating good BBQ, it's about having an EXPERIENCE. We heard about this place from my cousin . . . who is from Modesto! Now if he knew about this place from all the way up there then it has to be good. First time for us in San Diego and at Phil's as well so we really had no idea what to expect other than some great BBQ (as indicated by Yelp). So we get there and there's a small line right out the door. There's big menus posted everywhere and people are looking at them while the line gradually moves up. Finally it dawns on me that we have to order at the counter and then have to seat ourselves. Luckily we figured this out in time and were able to order what we wanted. As the Phil's experience continued we realized that almost everything is self serve--from picking up your food and drinks, to finding seating for yourself, to getting your own utensils and condiments. All the while the servers and wait staff were jovial and helpful with whatever help us noobs needed. Now on to the food . . .Phil's definitely does BBQ right. First off their portions are HUGE! From the sides to the entrees I don't think you'll go hungry at Phil's. Their sauce is right on par as well, not too sweet, not too smokey, not too tangy, but just right. I had the pulled pork sandwich while my companion had the "no ribs" BBQ. For both of our dishes the meat was exquisitely prepared, moist, and not too dry. Needless to say things got messy, but you know a place is good when they have special sinks out in the open for people to clean themselves up with. To top everything off and make our dinner even more special, Phil himself just so happened to be there that night and personally asked us how everything was. Of course we said everything was great--which it was, but we also overheard him talking to other customers as well asking them how their dinners were as well, so we knew he was a pretty sincere guy. All in all a pretty darn good meal at Phil's BBQ, great food, great service, great atmosphere, good parking . . . all the hallmarks of a great restaurant. NOTE: They are closed on Mondays. We almost got caught in this trap.

This place is worth the long ass line, The staff is super friendly, espically the host!, I love her. The ribs are perfectly cooked and seasoned, if i could have sex with phil i would. too bad for red lobster being so close, they really fucked themselves on the location, who wants to compete with phils, i think i saw red lobster employees one time just staring at the line at phils, haha

"Bar- B Licious" [First impression] Where's the line?! We beat it! As soon as we got there, the line started building up-- fast! But this place is huge and operates smoothly. The staffs are friendly and open doors for you. With so many great reviews and an extensive menu, it's so hard to choose. You really can't go wrong. It's nice to go with a group of people and have everyone get different things. That way you can share. The portions are plenty so not to worry about not having enough food. [Suggestion] *Onion rings are crisp to perfection! *Have everyone choose different side dishes as well. From macaroni salad to fries to cole slaw-- there's no going wrong here. [Tip(s)] *Come just before the lunch hour to beat the line.

I have heard of Phils for years now and on my last trip to San Diego, I felt the time had come to make a visit!   Went with a pretty large group and that helped to cover most of the menu items!  All of which were delicious! Beef ribs were my favorite!  Tender, not tough, left with a clean bone!  The sides got astonishing reviews from friends as well as the tri tip and pork sandies.   It was pouring down rain when we went...so the line was not horrible...there was 6 of us who ordered together and we all got perfect orders in a timely manner.   We will for sure be returning to Phils on our next trip to SD!

I came here after reading all the 5 star reviews and wanted to experience the OMGBBQAWESOMENESS that everyone's experienced here. Ordered a rack of baby back ribs with a small side of beans and fries.   Fries were ordinary. The portion of the small side of beans were so small, it was...cute.  I know it's a small side... but still.  A friend pointed out how the beans were ordinary as well, "a bbq place should specialize in beans, it's part of the bbq experience".  And I agree with that statement. Baby back ribs were drenched in sauce.  I like sauce on my meat but it was too overpowering.  I like tasting meat, and sauce...not SAUCE and meat.  Capiche? I did like the fact that the meat just fell off the bone.   We know of another place that has more meat on the bone and has meat, and sauce so we'll hit that place next time.   Phil's bbq gets an A-OK from me.

I found it crazy to see a restaurant with 1,000+ reviews.  With that many reviews, it must really be a great place. We went for lunch, and decided to just take our food to go, since we had a 7-hour drive ahead of us back to the Bay area.  Place already had a line forming out the door, but it moved pretty quickly. As for the food, I wasn't blown away.  I got the El Toro (tri-tip sandwich), and my husband got chicken and baby-back ribs.  It was a'ight.  It wasn't the best BBQ I've had, but it was decent.  The sauce had a certain tartness/acidity to it, which made the flavor a bit fun.

Anytime anyone mentions San Diego, I always have to say, "OMG have you been to Phil's?!?" I don't like lines, I don't like waiting, I hate anticipation, and crowds make me nervous... but I think I'd forget about all that for Phil's. The reward after waiting in an hour long line would be the deliciously BBQed meat that they have mastered. Sweet, tangy, smokey, and tender ribs. I can never decide between pork or beef... JUST GET BOTH! Leftovers are good too! Along with a side of coleslaw and onion rings. DON'T go here when you're starving because you'll probably have to wait for a bit and DON'T wear a white shirt.

I sometimes wonder if my tastes are getting too pretentious.  I was a little reluctant when my cousin first suggested BBQ:  I've had my share of overcooked meats doused in sauce at BBQ places.  I'm so glad we came so I could be proven wrong. Glancing over the reviews, I have to agree about one thing with those who give a lower rating.  The wait here was epic.  Yes, epic.  You could make a modern-day remake of the Odyssey in which Odysseus is returning from the Iraqi War and stops here to get food.  He endures trials and tribulations in line here for 10 years before finally returning home to his wife. I'm sort of giving this place a double standard: I know I'd give it 3 or 4 stars if I lived closer.  However, being an out-of-towner, I'm more focused on their food quality and not how practical it is to dine here regularly.  The food is divinely complex.  I rarely experience what I call flavor-layering: when the food's flavor transforms in your mouth one or more times.  I'm writing this review from a month-old memory of this place, but I recall tasting herbal and savory melt into charred and sweet.  I tried some of the baby back and beef ribs, both of which were quite delicious.  The macaroni salad was also surprisingly refreshing. If I were in SD on a weekday afternoon, I might try coming back here to avoid the Greek mythology.  If I didn't get the chance, though, I'd still recommend this place as something to try at least once.

They've got great food and huge portions. I think that's been established. My friends and I had a great meal here and great service when we were visiting the area earlier this year. The one thing keeping me from giving it five stars is an interesting encounter with the hostess. Her: Where were you born? Me: Indiana Her: So you're just white then? Me: Ummm I guess so? Weird, right?

For those who love Phil's BBQ, I can see why. The meat on the bones fall off easily. The sides have been well thought out and prepared. The sauce has a tangy familar taste. For those who could care less for Phil's BBQ, I can see why. The meat lacks it's original flavor. The sides... well they're JUST sides. The sauce... that familar flavor is tangy watered-down spiced ketchup. I've have had the baby back ribs, full rack, pork... it falls of the bone with no problems, lacks the full robust pork flavor (maybe they should consider a better choice of cuts), but it maintains the charred flavor well. The half chicken was dry, I seriously don't recommend this unless you just love chicken. The potato salad was good, to be honest the sides didn't make enough an impression on me that I care for them. I still have to try the pulled pork & tri-tip sandwiches.  But I'm a little surprised on the lack of main dishes. If this is San Diego's best bbq... then I'll meet you half way and consider it a staple for bbq in SD.

Finally went there when my friend and fellow Yelper Steve took me there for my birthday. Upon arriving for lunch, the line was super long. There was a minimum 1 hour wait, and we didn't nearly stick out but we decided to stay. So glad we did! While the wait was an hour long, it actually went quickly. Once we entered, placed our order, found a table... in about 5 minutes we got our order. We each had the bbq pork ribs and chicken lathered with tons of bbq sauce with sides of cole slaw and potato salad. Not to forget we shared onion rings. The ribs were perfect. The meat practically fell off the bone! I could have done without the chicken but its still worth trying if you have not yet. The customer service was excellent with all their workers completely upbeat and helpful!

YES! I loooooove Phil's BBQ.  It doesn't take too much to impress me with BBQ though... I'm kind of a BBQ slut like that... Now that I got that out there, I can go on and gush about what I love at this place that I've been going to since my freshman year at UCSD. Food: baby back ribs: Hell to the yes.  I can only down a half rack, if I'm ready for it, but I've seen my friends put away the whole thing and it is impressive.  It brings tears to my eyes.  The sauce is deliciously sweet and I would bathe in it. Fries: Yummmmm... They put some sugar on it and it is amazing.  I like to coat them in the bbq sauce. Beans:  I'm not too big of a fan.  They're too sweet and syrupy for me. Cole Slaw:  This is a BBQ must have.  I need some sort of vegetable in my life when I'm gnawing on some ribs, even if they are coated in mayonnaise.  Although, these aren't too sauced up - which is a great thing.   Overall: Great place to have a hearty ass meal in SD.  The line does get long, but it's worth it.  I do, however, recommend planning this one out.  You can't just GO to Phil's, you have to be prepared to down this food... both mentally and physically.  Now, go out there and do work.

So, I made the drive to Phil's from Culver City because, like most everyone else, I saw it on Man Vs. Food and HAD to try it. Let me just say that I've had REAL Southern BBQ in the heart of Texas AND watch a shit ton of Top Chef so I'd like to think I'm a pretty tough critic. With that being said, here's my first yelp review--WHATTUP?!?! First off, the line looks really, really long but it does move along pretty swiftly. You can watch a live feed before you stop by to see what the damage is, which is pretty cool. If you really can't wait to get your fingers dirty, you can always go snag a seat yourself at the bar which is what we did. I got the baby back ribs and an order of onion rings. The onion rings take a while to make so you'll be waiting for your food a bit longer than your buddies if that's the route you take. The BBQ sauce is pretty damn good the ribs are definitely fall-off-the-bone tender. All in all, it still didn't top the Texas BBQ I was spoiled with so I wasn't THAT impressed....but then I bit into an onion ring (which literally was the size of my face!) and all was right with the world again. Oh my GOD, seriously the best onion rings I've ever had. I thought it was funny that I enjoyed the rings more than the BBQ itself but what can you do? Not sure if I'll ever make that drive again JUST to eat here but if I'm in the area I'll probably stop by for an order of Samoan-sized onion rings and an El Toro sandwich instead of the ribs. P.S. Phil, quit being so stingy with your BBQ sauce.

This seems like the place to be in San Diego.  I don't think a bbq purist would really enjoy this place.  They drench everything in sauce, and the meat itself didn't have a ton of tenderness to it. This just furthers my belief that San Diegoans, San Dieguns, San Diegans are just trying to puff up anything that is half decent, to try to make themselves feel better about living in a city that has very few amazing experiences.

Okay, so its not gonna satisfy people who are set on particular styles of BBQ (texas, memphis, etc..) because what they do is a style all their own, and they do it well. It could be hailing baseballs and this place will always have a line out the door and around the block. Its that good. Full rack with beans and onion rings and I am instantly in BBQ heaven. I have tried their sandwiches on occasion but their ribs are the star of the show, pork or beef, either one is done right and make me happy every time. Order ahead if you don't want to wait forever, and prepare to get into a fist fight to get a table because its seat yourself, and first come, first served.

I hate it when people hype up a place so much that my expectations are so high but when I finally try the place, it disappoints. I don't think Phil's BBQ is bad, in fact, it was really good. It just wasn't as good as the 2000+ reviewers raved, probably because I've already built up so much expectations due to their reviews. I really liked the portion size of the ribs. My friend and I shared a rack and I remember I was too full to finish the sides, but the sides were okay. The fries and potato salad were both decent, not to die for. Overall, a 3.5, and a will very likely return. But if you want to try this place, don't read too many reviews or raise your expectations too much because it'll ruin Phil's BBQ for you!

4.5 star rating with more 2,000 reviews and I'm not a fan? I'm devastated that this place wasn't my cup of tea (but I could see why everyone else would love it). My boyfriend and I were super ecstatic to FINALLY give this place a shot and decided on our day off from school and work to drive two hours down to San Diego. We arrived about 10 minutes before it opened and there was already a line. When it opened, we went in the Dine-In line where you order first AND THEN you find a seat. You can't just find a seat, hold it, and then order which makes perfect sense so no complaining there. We ordered the baby back ribs, fries, potato salad and a couple other things. As soon as we paid, we found our seat and waited to have a mind blowing experience. On to the food! Ate the fries first and it was pretty good. Went for the potato salad and it was even better. Saved the baby back ribs for last (because you always save the best for last or so I thought) and took a bite into one heck of a super tangy rib. Talk about DISAPPOINTING! I like my sauce sweet not tangy but apparently, according to all the reviews, the sauce is what makes Phil's BBQ a favorite for many. So, for all you barbecue lovers who LOOOVE tangy barbecue sauce, make your way to Phil's BBQ because I'm sure you'd love it. I wish I did so I would of enjoyed my visit but it was definitely worth the try!

Others have said it and its True. HANDS DOWN THE BEST. I order the ribs on every visit and they are amazing. I love this place! It is my favorite BBQ ever. writing this review is making me want to go and eat there right now. I will always come back to phils and i go about once every 2 weeks. Im very happy they opened one in san marcos which is closer to my house. A word to those looking to maximize your spending, if you get a meal with 2 sides and you order fries- they give you a ridiculous amount of fries. GO TO MEAL: babyback ribs and chicken- macaroni salad and baked beans. This is the spot i would recommend anyone to try when they come to San Diego.

Skip the line, order to-go and eat it somewhere else. The bbq is to die half because of the sauce and half because the meat falls right off the bones. Get more than you want and share with a friend because you'll always seem to want more after you finish.

Finally! I traveled all the way down from Santa Monica to try this place out after my brother and the yelpers were raving about it. Baby Back Ribs: Amazing, tender, juicy, just enough fat, not dry. Side Dishes: Not bad, it's about average with other places. Bread Bun: If you get this alone its soft and crunchy around the corners and makes an excellent soaking device for the sauce. Parking: Plentiful! Price: Affordable! I didn't think it would be this good! I came ordered a rib and chicken meal with two sides, an extra side of corn, a side of bread, and a soda and it all came out to be around $20 including the tip I left at the front and on my table. Service: One of the friendliest people I've meet. I loved the lady who was helping everyone out on the patio. She was always checking to see if she could refill our drinks, take out plates away, get us any more sauces or napkins, she even got our bips and tied it for us. I'm not sure if you tip there cuz the tip jar was all in the front, but we did it anyway since she was so nice and most of those things were more or less meant for self service. Phil's you did not disappoint! Now I am sitting here sadden that LA doesn't have one close by.

This place is over-hyped.

I think it's a little pricey for the quantity you get. But I'll be back again but only when my friends feel like getting Phil's

I start to salivate every time I think about Phil's! The boyfriend and I ordered the full beef rib dinner (5 ribs) with a side of baked beans and potato salad. We also ordered a side of cole slaw and large onion rings. What can I say, we were eating with our eyes! The beef ribs were huge and the meat really does fall of the bone. I was full after two! Their BBQ sauce was also good. Sweet and Tangy. I enjoyed the baked beans and cole slaw, however next time I think we can do without the potato salad, it was just too heavy for the amount of food we were eating. Their onion rings on the other hand, OMG, best onion rings I've ever had! When I saw our plate come out, the onion rings were humongous, and I instantly thought it would be seeping oil once we bite into it, which wasn't the case. The onion would break clean with every bite and the batter was just crispy and non-oily. My boyfriend made the observation that the plate it was served on didn't have any remnants of oil on it. If you live in SD, I would suggest going on a weekday to avoid waiting in a line that wraps around the building. We went on a Tuesday night, the line was still out the door but it moved rather quickly. Next time I wanna try their pulled pork or tri tip sandwiches because when I saw them in passing they were overflowing with meat!

It's hard to choose a favorite between beefy and baby back ribs. They're both wonderful! I'm don't like cole slaw, but the cole slaw at Phil's is probably the only thing I'll eat. The cabbage is so crunchy and fresh and very light. Their onion rings are also very good. While we were waiting line for over an hour, they were giving out onion ring samples. First bite, I was in love. Fresh out of the deep fryer, which made it nice and crispy. The taste reminded me Funyun onion ring chips and knew I had to order them. Wait times are a killer. Bring something to entertain yourself.

Phil's is about the best barbeque in San Diego, or at least that I have had. The chicken is done to perfection, mesquite grilled and well sauced in a tangy sauce. The beef ribs are huge and meaty, I  couldn't finish a full order of five in one sitting if I wanted to. The baby backs are the same, great pork, slow cooked, tender and tangy. The tri tip only comes in sandwiches as does the pulled pork, both are great and filling as are all the portions at Phil's. Don't wear clothes you don't want to get bbq sauce all over, the only way to enjoy Phil's is to dive right in! The downside of Phil's is it can be hard to get in. The line moves quick usually, but be prepared for a line that snakes around the building, but that is the price you pay for a place being the best.

I decided to try this place because it was on Man vs Food.  We were standing in line, and to my surprise, Adam Richman was right next to me.  He was there shooting for his new show "Best Sandwich in America".  Phil's "El Toro" sandwich was being featured for it, so I had to try it.  Their BBQ sauce was outstanding as well as their potato salad and the sandwich itself.  If you watch the show, my daughter is the little girl that they close up on who is holding a sign.  I am the goofball in the backwards hat.  (They made me turn it around so I'm not showing the logo.)

MMMMMMMMmmmmmmMMMMMMM Phil's BBQ is seriously good food. The portions are HUGE (a single beef rib sampler for $3.95 is no small snack) and the food is delicious! The Broham Sandwiches are great, abet a bit too charred-tasting (however there is more than enough meat in them to pick around). The onion rings are gigantic, the BBQ chicken is moist, and the fries were so-so. The meat is the star of this place (and the reason you will wait in line for 45 minutes) so get the straight-up pork or beef ribs (beef are better IMO), chicken or one of the delicious sandwiches instead!   The drinks were good. Sangria was not the best I've had, but it's hard to complain at $5 a glass. There was a wide-variety of soft-drinks available, including fanta and crystal light. The atmosphere was one of eating - if thats even possible- everyone was just chowing down on their food. The menu is posted on every available wall, I was surprised it wasn't in the bathroom too! Service was very friendly! Lastly, I'd recommend ordering beforehand and picking up the order instead of eating on site.

One of the best places for BBQ in the SD area!  Actually, the only one that I would even consider going to in SD.  This place has the juiciest baby back ribs and a tangy sauce to go with it.  If you go, you also have to try their onion rings.  Can't go wrong with giant rings deep fried to crispy and golden bites of goodness. On the weekends, this place gets ridiculous packed.  If you go in a big group, you'll probably have to wait a while - sometimes over an hour.  But it's well worth the wait and then some.  I guess your other option would be to go to Kansas or Missouri or some other random Mid -western state.

Phils BBQ I have been eating here for years when they where downtown , The new location is huge right off sports arena blvd , if you go there for lunch or dinner be ready to wait . El toro sandwich is really good. The BBQ chicken is the best . The ribs are so good and have meat on them and melt of the bones (not allot of work like most ribs) Its really hard to find a good bbq place and Phils is the place in San Diego for BBQ food.

Alright San Diego, I know Phil's comes highly rated for bbq, but for your information, this isn't real bbq.   I asked for any brisket and the guy stared at me like I was talking chinese.  So I went with the "El Toro".  A monster size sandwich with two slices of bread and a ton of sliced tri-tip in between coated with sugar-sweet bbq sauce.  No pickles, no lettuce, no "fixins" between the meat and bread. The cole slaw was okay and the potatoe salad was two thumbs down. The fries were pretty good. If you're ever near Austin, TX there are tons of great places to eat the true best bbq you will have ever had in your life.  Specifically, places like The Salt Lick or Rudy's.   Texas, Kentucky, and Tenessee are the three main variations of real bbq.  California....stick to your fish tacos and carne asada fries. Leave bbq to the South.

Best ribs I've ever had!  The meat just falls right off the bone, and is sooooo goooood! Beer battered onion rings are great, as well as their fries.  Try their buttermilk sauce for dipping.  It's delish. I guess the only con would be waiting in line, but it's so worth it!

Oh Phil how I love you. You make me happy when skies are blue sunny and glorious. Why does your sauce have to be so yummy. I know it must be the sugar...you have an open invitation to grease me up. Listen I'm a snob I guess. I have pretty much eaten my way around this world....and try my best to grease it up in all the cities I hit in the US - I've lived in the south...this is alright compared. Why...consistency. Every time I hit Phil's its good. Soggy bread, drippy coleslaw and more pulled pork than I want but enough that I still can't stop myself way after I'm full. It's good....trust us. My hint...if there is a line....just call in your order while waiting and you'll get it faster than if you waited on the line. But that's just b/c I don't like eating out I like hiding in my house when I gorge.

I Love Phils! Have loved it since i was introduced to it one summer on Goldfinch Ave.. summer of 1999. if i'm within an hr of the place, i'll call ahead and make the drive down. so what if it's not "real" bbq by texan/tennessee/kansas standards? hands down the best bbq i've had from the top 10 lists in los angeles, to the three i've had in austin; even one ones my friend harry makes cannot best the love i have for the ribs here. i love you man. and phil's such a nice guy too :love:

I'm from the Bay Area, but I often think of Phil's BBQ to motivate myself to take a trip to San Diego.  Their BBQ is just amazing.  The only negative side is that this place is ALWAYS CROWDED.  I can't count the number of times I've driven by and seen a line outside that wraps to the side of the building.  I normally call my order in for pick up on my way there to avoid their 45-60 minute wait.   Now let's talk about the food.  Their beef ribs have to be my favorite thing on the menu.  The "Fred Flinstone" sized bones they give you is enough to stop your arteries in it's tracks.   The reason the portions are huge is because when they cut the ribs, they skip every other bone so it's almost like getting two ribs per bone.  Their sides aren't bad but I wish they would give you bigger portions to accommadate your massive order of meat.  Personally, I go to the Chinese restaurant in that complex and order some rice so I can bring it to Phil's.  What can you say, I'm truly Filipino! Overall, this is definitely my favorite BBQ spot.  I often fly back home with a couple of individual beef bones stashed in my luggage =)

I don't give out very many 5 star reviews but come on, you have got to eat here. The price is awesome for the GINORMOUS amount of food that you get!!! AND what you get is AMAZING. Never ever dry and you really cannot go wrong with anything you order here. Come back and keep coming back. Unless you're watching your weight then totally game over.

Okay so everyone knows the obvious...Phil's has the best BBQ in San Diego.  What else can you say about a fantastic heap of ribs and a gigantic side of onion rings/fries.   But the best part is the sitting in the bar.  Hopefully this won't screw up my Friday tradition but have to say it....sitting at the bar is the best way to go at Phil's.  If you sit at the bar, you can order your meal there.  If you sit in the bar at the other tables, you have to order your food in the huge line that everyone else is standing in.  On top of it all, you get to watch all the good games.  If you sit at the bar on a Friday, Johnny will behind the bar.  He's a great guy and if you become a regular, he takes good care of you!!!   I also have to give a shout out to Josh, the manager!!!  He is always checking out to make sure that everyone in the restaurant is taken care of.   This is a great way to spend a Friday eve!  See ya there.

Let me be Phil's 775th review! LOOOOOOVE PHIL'S. Their onion rings are to die for. The line is not. I went this past weekend and maybe it was because of UCSD's graduations but dammmmn we waited in line for 30-40 minutes to order! But the cashier was so nice and gave us three free drinks for being so patient. Phil's has got their system DOWN! Got a table within 3 minutes after ordering and got our food within about 10 minutes. Love the Half Rib Dinner (comes with 7-8 baby back rib bones + 1 large side or 2 small side) - can easily be shared. Wish I had gone to Phil's more when I was living in SD.

Although not the cheapest place, it's where I go for my fixing of baby back ribs and hot corn. The ribs are falling off the bone, slightly burnt, tangy, and saucy, but not overly saucy. The corn, which is still in the husk, is awesome. Simple, hot, buttery. Love it. The sangria at the bar is also pretty good. Perfect to sip on while you're waiting for your order. I hate the wait and sitting at a loud place to eat so take out is perfect! Service here is awesome too...once they forgot to give me my corn and straight up just gave me one just like that. No questions asked. I wish I could see this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.

This is the best BBQ in San Diego, hands down!  Though it's important to note the caveat....in San Diego.  There is far better BBQ out there, in other cities, but here we have Phil's. Everyone I know raves about the ribs, but for my money the BBQ Broham (pulled pork sandwich) is the best thing on the menu.  It's as close to Memphis-esque BBQ as you are going to get in San Diego County.  The El Toro (sliced tri-tip sandwich) also gets high-marks if you are not swine-inclined. The only bad thing I can say about Phil's is when you have a hankering for BBQ the most (say on a weekend afternoon), the line seems to be the longest.  Those lines that weave out the door are such buzz-kills when you are cruising down Sports Arena Blvd looking for your fix.   The line does move quickly, but then finding an open table is more difficult.   And I guess if I'm bitching here, I have to say that old location in Mission Hills was much better in the ambience department. Phil's caters...which is a God-send.  It's extremely convenient and well-priced.

Been here twice - LOVE IT. Long waiting line, but trust me - it's worth it! The serving size can be quite big for just one person, so its really worth it when you share with friends - especially for girls :) Ordered the ribs both times - savory and delicious~ can get a little messy, but that's what BBQ is all about! Had a little taste of my friend's order of chicken - gooood too!  The servers/hosts are all very friendly too, some are even pretty funny! Even the sides are good, love the fries and onion rings! Can't wait to come here again :D

I decided to give this place another go about a month after my initial review.  This time, I brought my gramps along.  And because I love him and don't want to subject him to the Phil's Friday lunch line, I phone in to dine in.  Guess what?  It worked. I can't hate.  They put a lot of effort into service.  From top to bottom, everyone in this organization is friendly and helpful.  Even on a phone in to dine in, you need to find your own seat.  But it's a good thing the busboys are VERY responsive.  Not much later after finding a seat, we already had someone cleaning up the previous occupant's mess.  In another five minutes, our food was ready.  They don't screw around here. The food is a lot better than I gave them credit for, though I still maintain I've had better BBQ elsewhere.  Everything I've had there is well-prepared, which is impressive given their speed.  Too bad the food is a bit overpriced.  But it's still a good establishment if you want BBQ, or something close to it.

This place actually lived up to all the expectations. Now, I'm currently on a diet, but I had to take a "break" from it to try out this place. Wow, was this a GREAT cheat meal. We walked in around noon on a Tuesday (They're closed on Mondays, btw) and the line was out the door. It was nice to see the signs of their menu around everywhere so you could think of what you wanted to order. My girlfriend and I decided to share the pork ribs plate (working on our portion control) and while we initially ordered steamed veggies (to be healthy), I thought it might be better if we got more "bbq" sides, so we added cole slaw and potato salad. Service - One thing that really stuck out was how friendly everyone was. Usually when a place gets very popular and they know they serve good food, the service suffers. Not at Phil's! From our hostess who greeted us before we were about to order to our server who helped clear out the tables and get us napkins and silverware, everyone was REALLY REALLY friendly. Food - Ok, so the most important part. The BBQ baby back ribs were great. Cooked perfectly soft and just the right amount of bbq sauce on it. The sauce could have used a little more kick, but it was delicious nonetheless. It would have been nice to have an option of spicier sauce. The sides that we ordered were nothing really special. The cole slaw wasn't drenched in the mayo sauce which was ok cuz of our diet and the potato salad was nothing to write home about. I saw that everyone had ordered fries or onion rings, so we'll definitely have to try those or the corn next time. I was a bit surprised that there was no bread to go with the meal. Usually there is some cornbread or just some standard Wonder bread to go with the bbq. Atmosphere - I really enjoyed the casual eating environment at Phil's. It was a very efficient operation with multiple cashiers and many tables for everyone to sit in. It's self server, after you order, you take your buzzer, get your drinks and silverware, and you find a table  until your buzzer goes off. I'll definitely be back here. While the sides were pretty average, the mix of the bbq ribs and the friendly service made this a terrific place.Next time I'll have to try the beef ribs and the pulled pork sandwich!

Their beef ribs are huge. When I came here, my eyes were 10x bigger than my stomach, and I wanted to order 5 ribs for myself! Good thing I shared because I had no idea how big they were. The onion rings were good....oh! and the macaroni salad is sooo yummy. It was quite a long wait because I came with a big party and it was lunch on a Saturday. I'll go back to Phil's BBQ again when I visit SD.

I like this place. I found it on Yelp while I was in San Diego and decided to go there on a Monday. But the weird thing is they are closed on Mondays, so I went back on Tuesday for lunch. The line was almost out the door, but it was very fast service. The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't have macaroni and cheese and I wanted that. The sauce for the BBQ was yummy. I would go back if I wanted BBQ in San Diego.

OMG PHIL'S BBQ! you have to try it to believe it. I went to school in san diego, so I was around when phil's bbq was still a little hole in the wall in hillcrest.  after trying it for the first time, I was a believer! there's not much to say about it, just that it's the BEST meaty-fall-right-off-the-bone-ribs i've had. I like to get the beef ribs, but the baby back ribs and the chicken are just as good! don't forget the onion rings! the sides are amazing tooo... mm i miss phil's. after moving back to LA my friend claimed that baby blue's has the BEST ribs ever, and I gave it a try..only to find that it is FAR from phil's.   yeah, it's true about the super long wait, but that only shows that it's THAT good right??

It makes more sense to call in your order unless it's really a "Dead period" during the day.  You can forget about eating quickly at dinnertime anytime if you head over there to eat-in. Regardless, the food is soooooo good there.  I drool just thinking about it.

If you live in San Diego there are two things your are going to eventually try: Phil's BBQ Ribs and sufing. This is a San Diego institution and by the looks of the line outside the door and around the corner they are doing 1000 covers a day, and the volume of business they do at the end of the day is about as mouth watering as their pulled pork sandwich. Bottom line is Phil is a rich man. You have to try the beef ribs but if you're not a sauce fan

So after hearing/reading all the hype from San Diegoans and Yelpers, I had to try Phil's and was a tad disappointed. NOT because the meat wasn't good but because the hype had me expecting more. The meat was super soft and it DID fall right off the meat like people claim, but I didn't like how it was drenched it sauce. The half chicken we ordered looked like it took a dive in a bucket of sauce and made its way to our plate. The sides I got (coleslaw, macaroni salad, beans, and fries) were good. I personally love the beans and coleslaw. Nonetheless, my mom, sister and I killed 1.5 rack of baby back ribs and a half chicken. We ate more than the two guys that sat next to us... The wait wasn't too bad. We went around 2:30 in the afternoon and it was still poppin but we got our food in ~15 min, so I can't imagine the wait for dinner! But yea. Unfortunately, the hype knocked a star off for this place for moi.

1165 reviews?!  OK, this is for my friends who HAVEN'T been to Phil's or heard of Phil's. I would take out-of-towners here, but the far from exciting location doesn't warrant the drive from UTC to Phil's.  Still...if your friends are foodies and you guys have time, make a trip down to Phil's.   For my boyfriend and me, take-out was the best decision made on a Thursday evening.  The line was out to the parking lot!  For just over $11 we had two HUGE beef ribs, 3 pieces of pulled chicken with 2 large sides (among choices of baked beans, fries, cole slaw, potato salad).  Baked beans and fries were the best I thought.  The pork ribs were also delicious.  The best BBQ.

I ordered a small fries which are bigger than Mcdonald's LARGE. And one baby back rib because I wasn't too hungry-- though later I stole a friend's rib. The fries are those huge fries that I hate so much! You know? The one with a lot of potato and no flavor or crispiness? BLEH. The ribs were excellent though. It does melt right off the bone and the flavor just bursts in your mouth.Our server was very nice and genuine although he forgot the waters we requested for. Basically if you're a girl, you should share a meal of ribs and fries with each other. Theres no way you can finish it by yourself... I could barely scarf down the 'small' fries'. If you're a boy, well lemme tell you a story: a cashier said that my friend was manly enough to finish a large and  he's the one who ended up giving me another rib. :] It's ok, we headed to a bar after where he then proved how manly he was.

BBQ broham for me, Eva had the beefy ribs and chikletts plate, and my kids mowed through the kids meal combo!  This was my second time here, 1st with a review, and what really struck me how good of a place this was when we pulled up last Saturday, it was raining, it was 2pm, and there was a line out the door with a 25 minute wait!  Are you kidding me? The reason we went all the way to Pt Loma on a rainy Saturday was exactly because it was raining!  I posted a quick video I shot with my flip cam on facebook because I was really amazed that people come from all over the county to eat at this place.  Wouldn't you be?  Oh, an hour later, after savoring San Diego's best BBq....there was STILL a line!

Pros: Food is super yummy. The meat is tender/falls off the bone. The prices are good. The portions are huge! Good Service! Cons: Long Lines. Just a note, the lines are crazy to get in. Try to go after 9:30pm and the wait should be 20 - 30 mins. Handsdown.............. 5 stars! Everyone has to try this place. BEST BBQ I've ever tried! You have to try the Pulled Pork sandwich!!

This is good BBQ if you've never left San Diego in your life. But if you venture outside of the 92110 zip code, you will find better... First of all, it should be against the law to call yourself a "BBQ restaurant" if you don't serve beef brisket. Who the f**k are these people! When I asked the girl where brisket was on the menu, she looked at me funny and said she didn't know what I was sayin'. Really?! It's bad enough that they don't serve it here--BUT THE FACT THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT "BRISKET" IS MAKES THEM LOOK LIKE FOOLS. This is the way I see it: even though Burger King doesn't serve Big Mac's, I'm sure the people at Burger King know what a Big Mac is. So, since they didn't have what I wanted, and I was beyond the point of no return, I ordered the boneless ribs plate with a side of potato salad and macaroni salad. Pretty tasty, excellent portions, prepared quickly. For those of you who sympathize with my brisket concerns, I recommend BRETT'S BBQ. Excellent brisket sandwiches (if you don't mind driving to RB). Service is always excellent too because the owner is usually floating around the place. If you make eye contact with him, he will introduce himself to you and make friendly conversation.

for my 100th review - phils A+ for the quick friendly service, clean restuarant, hi-quality meat. I had the baby backs and wouldn't say it falls right off the bone (but pretty tender). Also I think the sauce actually takes away from the good meat. way to strong for my liking. but factor everything great place.

Wait Wait let me finish.... but this place is different. The vibe was good, the food was awesome and I am now a respectable BBQ eater once again. The chicken BBQ was really bomb too and the waiters were awesome.

Simple , delicious and pretty cheap.  The only negative is the wait but you work up an appetite.  The staff is helpful friendly, facility is clean. And then the food.....my favorites: Beefy Ribs...the meat falls of the bone, very tender and juicy (I suggest getting the sauce on the side) the baked beans DELICIOUS, onion rings, and the potato salad. Portions are definitely worth the price, I'd gladly pay $20 for tender ribs and 2 sides any day! If your in SD its a MUST. Food - * * * * Ambiance - * * * * Service - * * * * Price - * * * *

My friend and I were wondering how we might ever replicate it for our own ribs. Really good melt in your mouth meat too. My friend wasn't too fond of how they didn't separate our fries from the meat and decided to just throw them all together, getting the sauce on the fries (some people just like 'em plain) but I didn't mind. The macaroni salad was pretty good. The baked potato was your normal baked potato, cooked thoroughly. Love that they leave the individually wrapped wet naps for you to take home.... or to store in your car... Story: Later that night, after a good night at the club and bars, the friend is unfortunately yackin up dinner and for some reason... "All I taste is butter.... Why does it taste like butter........" Perhaps butter is their secret ingredient?!

I LOVE this place! Such good BBQ! I mean it's no Mississippi BBQ but it is delicious! The only complaint is the line because I get so excited and my mouth starts watering and standing in line just makes it worse to the point I find myself at times start to drool. AWESOME BABY BACK RIBS! AWESOME CORN ON THE COB! AWESOME MACARONI SALAD! AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! If you have yet to go here you gotta gotta go!

4.0 to 4.5 stars from me. However, I get the feeling that this place can easily be 5 stars on a good day. Briefly, Phil's BBQ is a top-notch place for your rib-eating needs. The modern-day equivalent would probably be a Lucille's. At any rate, Phil's BBQ can easily be seen as gold standard for a ribs/BBQ place. All of the other reviews have it right: you're going to wait in line to get in. It can be a long wait (my group, which was about 20+ people, waited about 30 minutes), but it really didn't seem like it was that long. Finding parking can be a slight challenge, but there always seemed to be a few spots here and there. OK, so what about the food? I got the Beefy Rib Full Beef Rib Dinner (5 Bones) for $19.95 plus tax. It includes either 2 small side dishes or 1 large side dish. I opted for the two smaller ones: 1) fries, and 2) beans (beans at the recommendation of a UCSD friend). The ribs were... tasty, but BURNT... and I'm not just talking about a typical burnt that's tolerable. Trust me, I know what's acceptable, even by my generous standards. The ribs on the night that I went, however, were too burnt. I did end up eating it all (which, I suppose, is a testament to how good the ribs were in terms of taste), but again, the ribs were burnt. This was one of the main reasons I dropped Phil's from an easily-attainable 5-star rating to about a 4.5. The side dishes were good, but not spectacular. The fries kind of tasted like In-N-Out fries (which is a good thing!), but the beans were either too salty or too sweet. I couldn't tell. Haha. As for the service, I thought it was fantastic. Everybody from the cashier to the servers were attentive and very helpful. 5+ stars in the service department. I also liked how there was a multi-person sink located just outside of the bathrooms. It sure beats having to use your oily/greasy hands to open the bathroom door in order to wash your hands. When it's all said and done, Phil's BBQ is an impressive place for ribs. I'm pretty sure I went on a bad day (which still allows Phil's BBQ to get a 4.5-star rating from me). I'm definitely going to give this place a second chance to redeem itself and earn a 5-star review update. That being said, I think it's pretty clear that I'd come back here in a heartbeat.

Does Phil's really need another review?  Probably not, but here it is anyway... Having been thwarted in my last attempt to try Phil's (they're closed on Mondays...whaaat), I was more determined than ever to stick out the wait.  After all, there's got to be a reason why the line wraps around the building like a Disneyland ride well before the usual dinner hour.  And with its woodsy decor, the establishment does sort of evoke the Splash Mountain ride...except that the critters are what's for dinner. I came here with a group of seven for Brother's graduation dinner.  You're supposed to find your own seats after ordering, but for larger parties they expedite the search.  Thank goodness for that because we were HUNGRY and didn't want to think about waiting some more for seats to open up. Thinking that it would take too long for seven orders to cook, we strategized and split up the ordering.  It didn't really matter because the food came quickly enough.  And onto it... The Good: - Beefy Ribs:  Brother raves about these, and he was right to.  I'm not usually a fan, as most of the beef ribs I've tried have always been so sinewy, and I'd rather not end the night with half my meal between my teeth.  But these really are the closest you can come to "falling off the bone."  I liked it so much I abandoned my own baby backs and helped my mom finish her plate. - Coleslaw: Nothing too special about it, but of all the sides this was the best.  The cool freshness really helps cut through all the heaviness of the meat. - Baked Beans: A tinge of sweet...the small portion was just the right size to avoid a night's worth of gas and indigestion. - Potato Salad: I'm not a huge fan of potato salad, but this was also pretty good.  The potatoes are cut into huge refreshing chunks. The Meh: - Baby Back Ribs: I usually love pork ribs, but these were kind of dry.  My mom commented that she makes them better, and she does; hers are way juicier. - BBQ Sauce: Salty with a kick, it overpowered my baby backs and I couldn't taste the natural flavor of the meat.  Next time I'll ask for it on the side. - Macaroni Salad: Bland, like eating plain noodles. - Steamed Veggies: Okay, you order steamed veggies not expecting much, but my mom complained the broccoli was hard. Overall the food was decent, but it definitely wasn't the BEST barbecue I've had (try Bludso's!).  I was also missing some of the other BBQ usuals like tri-tip, brisket, and pulled pork (they've got some...but in sandwiches). The best thing about Phil's is probably the value.  It's cheaper than other places and the portions are Flintstones-sized.  For what you pay, the food will do.

update: lost one star because we went back and this time I had the chicken dinner instead of the pulled pork and was again disappointed by the dryness of the meat.  The dark meat was fine but the breast was so dry.  The cole slaw was average.  The potato salad was great again.   Pushed the button for "sweet tea" on the machine and water came out.

Probably one of the best BBQ's I ever had. Line is super long but it moves quicker than you think.  Quicker but it isn't quick.  If you don't want too wait, they also serve in the bar.  It is first come first serve. Once you get inside the restaurant, you order at the register and pick it up when they buzz your little pager.. The Beefy Ribs and Baby Back Ribs are recommended.  I also recommend getting the Onion Rings. I also got baked beans and cole slaw as sided.  Eh... they weren't that great.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Take the safe bet and get yourself some fries. The portions are a big but not too big.  I just couldn't finish it because the BBQ sauce is thick and rich, a bit too much after awhile. One of the best BBQ's, not the best.  If you are in the area, definitely go.

Lines, lines, lines every time I go to Phil's. It's okay because I am usually with 7+ friends and we crack jokes while waiting. Also, the food is worth the wait. I've tried better BBQ, but Phil's is up there in competition. I love the well-roundness of the restaurant. You can sit at the bar to watch the game, sit in the big area with family, or take it to go for eating solo. You can pick to eat a big full dinner or order light. Ordered: Full baby-back rib dinner Full beefy rib dinner Chick tickler Fries Onion rings Cole Slaw Potato Salad I especially liked the beefy rib. The chicken was juicy. The baby-back ribs were above the standard. I am a sucker for onion rings. Cole slaw on point. Can't go wrong with fries. Potato salad was standard. I am a pig. When I die, maybe they can serve my ribs there.

Man, I was expecting the best ribs in the whole wide world.  Definitely not worth the wait.  Long lines even if you arrive right when it opens.  They have a live webcam so you can monitor the line.  Insane. Their food is decent.  Get the phil's tickler.  It's a good deal.  The baby back ribs were really tender, meaty and fell off the bones.  The tri tip sandwich wasn't too impressive.  Nothing special about it.  The bbq sauce is BLAH.  It is very watered down and overly tangy.  All I could taste was the vinegar.  There was nothing special about the sauce.  Wish they left it off actually.  Both the ribs and the tri tip were drenched in this unappealing sauce.  The fries are good.  Remember to sprinkle the special fries seasoning on  top.  They have a separate full bar which is nice.  Change the bbq sauce recipe and you could have a 5 star bbq joint.

I gave Phil's another chance recently. I ordered the chicken but got the BBQ sauce on the side. I enjoyed it a lot better. Instead of having Phil's control the amount of sauce you get, be sure to get the BBQ sauce on the side.

I've never been to any other BBQ joint before so I have nothing to compare Phil's to, but my taste buds tell me that it was pretty nom. After a long afternoon at the San Diego Fair and being stuck in the parking lot for 20 minutes on the way out of that darn fair, we were starved, so we decided to call Phil's and order for pickup. Even though we called a good 15 minutes before arriving, we still had to wait for the food. I think it was 10:50PM when we arrived, and the place was still bustling! We had the baby back ribs, beefy ribs, chicken, and two sides of fries. The baby back and beefy ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, but the chicken was dry. The chicken, I don't recommend cause you'd have to douse it in sauce to make up for the dryness. That's just my opinion though. The fries weren't crispy by the time we got home, which was a tad disappointing. Oh, on the way out, I swear we saw Phil! He even said goodbye to us! I'd never seen him before but one of my friends said it was him. Hahaha, guess I'll never know for certain.

I finally went to this place.  Line was out the door, so went and found a seat at the bar.  I had the beef ribs & chicken dinner with two sides, beans and macoroni.  The sides were great.  The chicken was very tasty and the sauce was very tangy.  The ribs were a tiny bit dry, but still good.   I definitely want to go back and try some of their other offerings.  I do like Lightening Jack's BBQ better for now, hence the 3 stars.   The service was top rate though, very friendly and attentive, even at the bar.

My favorite is the beefy ribs - so delicious that I must admit at times I have very bad cravings for them!  You are only going to live once so why not eat what you like! The price range is good compared to other restaurants in the area. We actually tried the catering last week for a huge back to school party : (  Of course everyone loved the food! We even got a discount because we ordered a TUN of food!. I like the fact they have a website all restaurants should have them!   The site had a webcam that you can check to see how crowded they are, how cool is that?!

This place deserves 10 stars!!! And sooo worth the wait! Before my affair with Phil's BBQ, I was not a huge fan of baby back ribs only because of the mess (i know, such a girl -_-). But after my first visit, I was in loveee!! Falls right off the bone, cooked perfectly, and smothered in smoky & not too sweet bbq sauce. And suddenly I am not at all concerned with the mess! It's THAT good, haha. They seriously have the best bbq ever in SD and the staff is always so friendly & welcoming! I go here a lot with my boyfriend (who is a HUGE fan) and we always order the full rib dinner with all fries and a side of onion rings. As soon as we pick up our food, we shut the hell up, eat, and look at each other shaking our heads because it's just too good to be true. Serious! BEST BBQ EVER.

It's good and all, but the line is a serious turnoff. We waited for a solid 45 minutes to get in, probably another 20 for the food. I was amped because everyone says this is the spot for bbq in San Diego...ehhh....I'd say it's on par (maybe slightly above) BBQ House in OB. The highlights were the onion rings haha. Ribs were good too, but nothing orgasmic.

Freaking good. Delicious BBQ sauce with something like cinnamon in it. Sounds weird, but it works. The veggie burger comes with two patties and a huge onion ring on top, all smothered on sauce. Yes, I get veggie burgers at a rib joint. The staff must be paid really well or be high on life because they are super friendly. My one complaint is actually trying to eat there is a nightmare with the insane lines. Ok, no worries, you think. I'll get take-out instead. But that will cost you your immortal soul in styrofoam. STYROFOAM! Minus 1 star.

The ribs are delish but you have to play the waiting game. Saw and heard of this place from Man vs. Food and the ribs taste exactly like it was described on the show. Sauce was smoky, tangy, and you could taste all the flavor packed into the meat. Their sides could use some work though, the better of them were the baked beans. Also this place has a crazzzzzzzy long dine-in line, over an hour at least? I didn't want to wait in the dark and cold weather. So I walked all the way around to the front of the building again, got in the phone-in line (which was about 20 people deep). Looked up the menu on my phone and called in the order :) They said the food would be ready in 15-20 mins and to anticipate a wait when I arrive because there's a phone-in line. But they actually don't start making your order until you arrive to midpoint of the line. Before you enter the door a staff member will ask for your name and boop boop beep look you up on their phone orders device, click on your name and then send the signal to the kitchen to start arranging your order. Then you step in and wait in another line, but short one, and pay for your food, and then receive a pager to wait AGAIN haha. THEN you finally get your food. Soooo, call it in if you can. Or wait in line foreverrrr for a table.

I'm like the one person in SD who's not a Phil's Phan, but today I was converted. The sauce was a perfect blend of sweet and peppery on my delishiously meaty slab of ribs. Wow. I was impressed. Also, my #1 complaint for years has been the boring beans. Today they were zippy, hot, and tasty. Now I'm a fan.

True to form, it's always a grub fest when visiting @dolldinedesigns in Daygo.  So, of course she was excited to bring me to Phil's.  Having eaten here last summer, I was all about eating meat (presently, I'm abstaining) so the BBQ was game on! The wait wasn't too bad, but then again we were a party of 4, so finding table tops were easier for us than a huge party.  The style of walk up, order your meats and sides and get seated coupled with the the semi-chaotic fun atmosphere added to the novelty of the experience. The fries are crackin! The mac salad, supreme! Even the darn beans were good.  A definite must for anyone visiting SD.

There are very few restaurants that I absolutely can't get enough of, but Phil's BBQ is a just THAT good. The sauce, to me, is amazeballs. It's the perfect combination of sweet and spicy and it makes everything taste good. I dip everything in that sauce. I've never had anything at Phil's that wasn't good and it's always a treat to be able to go especially since I don't live in SD anymore. They've turned this place into a well-oiled food-service machine since they first started with the hole-in-the-wall they used to be at in Hillcrest/Mission Hills. The staff here is great, super nice and super helpful. The past 2 times I've been here, I've gotten SOMETHING free of charge. First time it was their delicious Whoopie Pie and the second, we got a free basket of onion rings. First time here? Get yourself one of the Ticklers. Definitely the best value on the menu. The sandwiches are also fantastic. What am I saying? just close your eyes and point at something on the menu, you won't be disappointed.

Gotta love me some BBQ!!  I love Phil's.  There's always a line but it goes really fast!  I still remember when they were located in hillcrest!  Boy has this place grown.  If you can't wait go to the bar side if there's space and you can order right away at the bar.  The portion sizes are big.  I got the half chicken dinner with fries and coleslaw.  And a side order of onion rings the small size.  The bf and I shared it and still didn't finish it.  It only cost like $12.  So cheap dinner for two!  And everything is delicious!! I love the condiments!! The hot sauce, ranch, extra BBQ sauce, and the seasoning for the fries!!  Now I'm salivating and wanting more just typing this.  Haha The service is really great!! Really friendly and really clean.  Did I mention i forgot my new phone at phil's.  Yikes!! But luckily the employees were honest and didn't take it for themselves.  Boy was I lucky.  I haven't even paid for it yet.  So I went back and the manager had it. Yay!!  Praise Jesus my phone was there!   So if you ever want some good BBQ.  Phil's BBQ is a most!  With great service and great food, nothing can go wrong.

Best BBQ I've ever had on the West Coast.  The long wait with the line  that practically wraps around the parking lot is WELL WORTH IT!!!  I've been to Memphis before and I definitely know for a fact that Phil's would be some serious competition for Memphis BBQ joints. Don't be in a rush if you're coming here.   The ribs are falloff-the-bone GOOD here.  The Broham sandwich was good but the El Toro was GREAT!!  But I'd definitely say try both.  The Broham's pulled pork was a bit too dry on this particular day.

I think Phil's is letting me down slowly. Don't get me wrong, I will always love getting my BBQ here, the sauce is what keeps everyone coming back for more. But lately, the meat they've been serving me, is really not all that great. It doesn't easily come off the bone. I have to chew my way in = messy messy. And I've been getting several burnt pieces. Uncool. And also, too many people know about this place so you can expect to wait at least 45min if you come on a weekend night. I don't think it's worth it though. However the service continues with 5 stars. Don't miss your chance to talk to Kenny, he's the cool and funny guy whose over 6 ft. tall, you really can't miss him. You're lucky if he's your waiter! And everyone else is just as friendly. They always look so happy!

Heck yea I'm a fan! Come on its Phil's. Granted the line gets pretty damn long but you can't say you didn't know cause everybody knows when you go to Phil's expect to wait. And if you didn't know well now you do. You can always go on-line and check out their live cam that shows how long the line is. I think it is worth the wait when those juicy, meaty, tasty ribs make its way in front of you mmm... :) I have ordered the beefy rib dinner (finger licking good!). You can order 5 bones or 3 bones. It includes 2 small sides or 1 larger side. I order 3 bones with either 1 large side of fries or small fries and a small macaroni salad. I have also ordered the el toro sandwich it is thinly sliced tri-tip covered in bbq sauce. They put so much meat you can ask for an extra bun and share with someone or take it home. I have tried the bbq cheeseburger and I thought it was pretty good but I prefer the el toro. The colossal onion rings are tasty. I can only eat like 2 of the onion rings I recommend sharing. I'm not much of a fan of the chicken it was a tad bit dry maybe it was a bad batch. Tip know what you want to order before getting to the register gotta keep the line moving, so listen to the employee at the podium haha. They are not trying to be rude they just want everyone to get served. The employees are nice so just be patient and enjoy the food.

I'm kind of torn - I'm thinking it's probably around 3.5 stars, but given that I'm looking forward to another visit the next time I'm in town, I'm rounding up. Is this potentially real, authentic BBQ?  No. Did the food make me happy to eat it?  VERY! I got a pork shoulder sandwich and a small order of onion rings.  Shared a pitcher of Arrogant Bastard (gotta love a place with good local beer on tap) with co-workers while waiting about 25 minutes to sit down.  The pork shoulder was really good - got it with sauce and cole slaw on the sandwich and everything tasted excellent.  It was a little ridiculous though how much fell OFF the sandwich versus stayed on it, but it was yummy.  The pork was tender, the sauce was nice ( a little sweet, but good).  The onion rings were insane - a small order was huge!  But you can tell that they bread them here, and the were excellent.

I really hate to give Phil's BBQ 3-stars, but after much thought, I had to lower my star rating. Let me start off my saying, I am a true Phil's Fan (even from their OG location when not that many ppl knew of Phi's BBQ). I even used to order Phil's togo and take it to the library during finals week hahha. I would get nasty stares from other students as I chomped on my ribs + sides on the 7th floor of Geisel haha. Oh well. Their pork ribs are by far the best, I prefer them over the beef ones even after a few of my friends have said the beef ones are better. I found them to be dry and lacking flavor. The OG location had the best ribs, delicious, fall-off-the-bone tender and foodgasmic in yo mouth! After Phil's relocated to their current location, they were still just as good, but sad to say, I feel Phil's has lost their touch (hence the sad review of 3 stars). I tend to blame it the long lines and it getting more popular. The last 2 times I had Phil's, my ribs were burnt, and not as juicy and tender. I think instead of slow roasting it, they prob just char it and try to cook it as fast as possible in order to please the hungry customers (can't blame them, right?). Don't get my wrong, I LOVE PHIL'S BBQ! I will come back when I'm in SD and have that rib craving! Service + staff  - always friendly and helpful. Parking is never a problem. If you want to avoid the long lines during rush hour, I recommend to phone in the order and pick it up (tastes just as good). They have a bar area w/friendly bartenders + tv's to watch sports. Things to get: pork ribs (full rack), potato salad, corn, beans, french fries, tri-tip sandwich (super huge), and some delicious warm bbq sauce on the side!

Nobody does RIBS like Phil's!! {ORDER} * Full rack for 2 - juicy, tender, slips right off the bone!! (comes with 2 small sides, or 1 large side) * Chicken Tickler combo (comes with onion rings, cole slaw, and fries!) * Onion rings * Fries * Macaroni salad * Cole slaw {DON'T ORDER} * Burgers. The wait is not worth it!! It's a rib joint, so don't order something that they're not really known for! {SERVICE} Although everything is self-service, everyone is very friendly. They'll come by chat with you, take away your dishes, etc. {TIP} * Pour a side of the BBQ sauce and double, heck triple dip, your rib before popping it in your mouth! * Order first, ,then find yourself a table * Once you claim your table, get your dishes and utensils * Go during off hours, or else you're going to be waiting in a long line!

Though I went to the San Diego fair a couple months ago and had their tri-tip sandwich, it was better.... the guy knew his cuts very well and I was literally amazed by the way he knew how to make it so tender and delicious!! That's totally off topic though! The line here is crazy, truly shows that people are raving about it! In the future if my plans follow through and I move to San Diego, this place will totally be a regular for me. ps... i just used some of the sauce to make my own pork spare ribs haha.

I wouldn't trust anyone who DOESN'T give this place 5 stars. I've been to this place 2 times(before Adam n the friggin Food Channel) and it's been great! Yes the line can be long.  YES THE WAIT IS WORTH IT. I HIGHLY recommend the El Toro sammich!  Such deliciousness, I don't even know the words to convey to you the beautiful taste of the this little-OK, BIG masterpiece!   The fries are always worth it. I'd pass on the coleslaw, I've had better. The beans were pretty good, could use just a little more flavor. And my friends have ordered the ribs and they just LOOK amazing! And from what they've said they're also THE SHIT.   Just go, don't be discouraged by the line-it goes fast.  Quit ur bitching.

Probably a waste to even review this place since it's not secret that Phil's has really great yet affordable ribs. The lines can be disastrously long (so long that they even have a sign outside that tells you how long the wait time is) but once you get pass the doors the atmosphere is reminiscent of a BBQ joint in Texas. Phil's should be a secret though because we waited for an hour to get our food! My friend and I shared a full rack of baby back ribs with side of corn on the cob. The ribs were very flavorful and tender--so tender that the meat easily came off the bone. The corn was sweet(I didn't need any butter on it) and complimented the ribs well. It was also a lighter side compared to the macaroni salads and fries my friends ordered. The waiter who helped our table was attentive and because we sat outside, made sure our heat lamps were turned on and was ready to assist us with containers for our leftovers and wet wipes. I thought that was pretty good service for a fast food place.

It seems like a cliche to give this place a 5 star rating, but it really is a worthy rating.  My hubby and I decided to give this place a shot and brave the cold in the REALLY long line for dinner last night. We ordered Beefy Ribs, Baby Back Ribs, Onion Rings, Potato Salad and Coleslaw.  Every single thing we ordered was A+, especially the BBQ sauce - it's tangy, spicy and has the perfect amount of hickory and sweetness.  The portions were big and everything, including the sides was delicious.  The employees were all very friendly and the food was perfect.  My only complaint is that they seemed a little expensive.  $18 for a dinner with no side dishes is a little steep.  Regardless though, I'll be going back!

This place was featured on Food Network, so I had to try it out. LONG LONG LONG lines at all times. I would recommend getting it to-go unless you want to wait 40min-1hr. I always feel like the Flintstones when dining here. Their baby back ribs are my fav, so tender and delicious ..mm. I would have to agree with this place being over-hyped, but they are definitely one of the best in San Diego.

Stopped in at Phils late last  night for a beer and ribs for my boyfriend after having been out and about downtown. What a nice, warm, accomodating, friendly 45 minutes at Phil's as always!  We had just walked out of two different bars downtown (Yardhouse - 15 minutes there and we were treated with such attitude by one of the servers and no one even came over to take our order!!! then the crab place next door, 5 minute there and everyone ignored us)...Sick of the downtown vibe we headed to Phils and it was like night and day! Despite it being late, the servers showed us some of the best service I have ever experienced. My beer came ice cold and right away. Fries, onion rings, ribs for my boyfriend all lucsious and amazing. TRIED THE WHOOPIE PIE for the first time - SINFULLY DELICIOUS and actually sooo much more tasty than it looks!! I have to give this place props for BEST SERVICE and most sweet and friendly and warm servers of anyplace I've been in a long time. This place is definitely our "cheers"!!

The best place to eat in San Diego, hands down!  It helps that BBQ is not on my typical list of places to eat for dinner, so it is always a good change from the norm.  But Phil's is always our place to go in SD, and just on my last visit it was where I went within the first hour of my arrival! The sauce is what makes this place so well known, but also the fact that its smoked old school style and the meat is so tender it just falls off the bones.  I don't like the chicken as much, you have to go for the baby back pork ribs! And get some fries on the side to sop up the sauce, so good!  The mac salad is also pretty popular.   In all amazing food, great service, and friendly people.  There is usually about a 30-45 min wait, but even if you have a large crowd they will find seating for you and accommodate you, usually by the time you've ordered!  A place where you will get down and dirty, but won't mind it all!

Phil's BBQ is worth just about every bit of hype.  From the mind-blowing food to the personable and friendliest staff I've ever experienced. The line that awaits you when you arrive to Phil's is intimidating at first, but don't fret, the line moves swiftly... We started around the corner, about half way down to the side of the building and we were in the door in less than an hour. Coming here for the first time, I ordered a full rack of Baby-Back Ribs with BBQ Beans and Coleslaw.  My Girlfriend opted for their Babyback and 1/4 Chicken combo plate with Slaw and Potato Salad. The ribs need no utensils, nor do you need your teeth, really.  My suggestion is to just eat the ribs by digging into them with your lips - this way you can spend time smacking your them around to get enjoy every last bit of their tangy and spicy sauce.  This sauce contains so many different layers of flavors, you just have to check it out yourself to see what I mean. Coleslaw and Beans were great, my favorite of the two being the BBQ Beans (the sauce is just killer).  The potato salad is nothing too special, although everything was more than acceptable. Do yourself a favor and eat here again and again.  I nearly came back for lunch the next day while spending a weekend in San Diego. Oh, and before you leave, try a Whoppie Pie. Its like an Oreo Cakester with a moist cake/cookie and a whipped vanilla cream filling. My advice - Order your own... 'nuff said.

I am usually NOT a big BBQ fan, but everyone who I asked for food recommendations in the SD area said to come here, so I just had to. And I was not disappointed at all! The line was long, but they had heat lamps to shield me from the cold. We had a party of 10, so I thought we would have to wait forever to be seated. But luckily, within 10 minutes, the hostess asked if we mind sitting in the bar area, and we automatically cut that huge long line and got seated at a TABLE in the bar area. NICEEEE! The waiter took our orders quickly too and the food came out quick. I shared a dinner plate of BBQ Pork Ribs with 4 girls. Got two large sides and that was just the perfect amount of food. I didn't want to be stuffed with BBQ meat anyways. I can't explain it, but the BBQ Pork Ribs were soooo tender, the taste was amazing, and the meat just fell off the bones. I want to come back here! Next stop, Texas BBQ and we'll see if this place still holds up its 5 stars! :)

I came on a rainy Wednesday at 3pm and there was no line. I had the ribs and chicken combo with beans and macaroni salad. The sides were nothing special but there BBQ chicken really shined. Their ribs were good for Southern California but would just be above average anywhere else. I ordered a small order of onion rings cause they looked so good, but was not that impressed. They had a huge soda fountain section with a surprising amount of soda option for this reason. I still highly recommend this place because the BBQ is solid at a very reasonable price. I am not sure if I would wait in line if it gets as crowded as people say it can be.

There's a reason Phil's is rated as San Diego's #1 restaurant on Trip Adviser! This place is like heaven on earth for me. If you like good ol' American BBQ, then there is no better place in San Diego, bar none. Their BBQ sauce is so incredible, Costco actually sells it in bulk! Yes, the lines are ridiculous and the place is loud as hell; however, it's all worth it after you sink your teeth into the beefy ribs! ALL HAIL TO KING PHIL!

BELIEVE IT! THIS PLACE LIVES UP TO ALL THE HYPE AND MORE!!! I first heard about this place watching "Man Vs. Food" and then after a couple of my friends talking about how much they love it here, I finally decided to go try it. When I first got here, it was REALLY MIND BLOWING to see how BIG the line is to get inside this place! It's like standing in a Disneyland line, it wraps around the building, but I decided to try it anyway. After an HOUR wait, inching towards the door, I finally get to the front to order a TRI TIP SANDWICH. My first bite into the sandwich and my first thought was "OMG!! I HAVE TO GO BUY ANOTHER ONE" because it is literally THAT good! I just began to eat the sandwich in front of me and I was already thinking about getting another one! It's really crazy how mind blowingly GOOD this meat was! My friend got the RACK OF RIBS and I got to try one and that was DELICIOUS too!! I ended up getting ANOTHER TRI  TIP SANDWICH and PULLED PORK SANDWICH. Both were amazing! I was really baffled on how I could describe what this BBQ tasted like and the only thing I came up with was: "ORGASM IN MY MOUTH!!" Yes, I said it!! I know it doesn't sound right, but believe me people, you have not tasted meat until you've tried Phil's BBQ!! If eating an excessive amount of BBQ meat is going to clog up my arteries and give me a heart attack, so be it. This meat is worth it and I guess I"ve had a good run now that I know how good meat can taste. Will I come back? FOR SURE! And I'm totally gonna bring all my friends and family too!!!

This place is good. By no means is it Texas BBQ. Born and raised in Houston I tend to compare BBQ places to what we have back in Texas and place was NO where near as good. I would rather go to Texas BBQ on Miramar Rd. over this place. Just my opinion.

I missed the infamous line, and thank goodness I did since I was really hungry anyway.  I split a pork ribs plate with my boyfriend.  The plate also consisted of beans and macaroni salad.  I added a salad just because I wanted to balance my meal (and I looked like a vegetarian being this was right in front of my face).  I loved the taste of the ribs.  They were easy to pull and the meat was really tender.  The beans had a lot of flavor.  I only had two bites from it and my boyfriend ate the rest.  Sad face for me.  The macaroni salad was good, and salad is salad, so I overall enjoyed the plate.  I did try my friend's chicken (hehe, he ordered chicken), and it was just the white meat.  Nothing special.  So yes, get the baby back ribs.  Next time I may just have to order onion rings, too.

My favorite place to go for BBQ!! I always get the beefy ribs here. They're fall-off-the-bone amazing! I've recently tried the pork ribs also (because I was afraid to stray away from beefy ribs), and they are so delicious! Now I need to order them both everytime I come here. The bar also carries one of my favorite beers - Karl Strauss Amber Lager. I'd rate this place higher if I could just for that.

**BIAS ALERT** Ok so here is the thing.im from the south and I'm used to a different type of BBQ. So i feel that i should put that put there. Anyway here is my story. We(me and my girlfriend who gave it 2 stars) where looking for some BBQ and and yelp pointed us to this place. "best BBQ in San Diego" OK ,OK  so Phil went out his way to bribe a politician to put that on yelp Your pretty sneaky Phil i thought...but wait they have a live camera. So we took a look and  It just so happened to be four pm (1600)  That line was GINORMOUS a line like a Jay-Z concert or maybe Phil was giving out free money to every family. Phil cant be fooling this many people i said to my self. So i decided to give it a try but i refused to stand in that line and i feel that I'm smarter than the average bear so i called my order in. apparently there are allot of smart bears in San Diego because i still had to wait in a semi long line in the take out side which is to the left which happened around 5ish. I didn't mind the wait because my nose was being hijacked by the sweet smell of BBQ. "OK Phil...maybe just maybe you have something going on here." i got my order which was ribs and chick-less for me and ribs for my girlfriend. Got in the car and my brain decided it wanted to join in the rebellion that my nose had started. Needless to say i broke more than a few traffic laws to get back home. Now I'm sitting at home with my box open deciding how I'm going to re-murder my ribs and chicken. I decided to  go with the ribs first..first bite and they slid of the bone they where so tender..man they where tender. Fully excited now!!and they had a hint of sweetness in the BBQ sauce.."what is it that your hinting at BBQ??" as i waited for the BBQ sauce to give me the rest of the answer i realized that, that was all it had to offer.... a hint of sweetness.  "Don't worry Phil i wont give up on you yet i still have my chick-less" Now those weren't bad..but they werent special either. They tasted like BBQ chicken...with a hint of sweetness. The baked beans i didnt like at all. I look to my girlfriend who is just pissed all together. All in all it wasn't BAD...it just wasn't GREAT...to me at least plus i didn't pay for it. Not good enough to wait in line next to half of Point Loma. But as i said in the top im pretty biased about my BBQ. Would i go back?? ..sure.. at lunch for a special...it was alright and besides this is the best San Diego has to offer right?

I don't care what anybody says, Phil's is the best BBQ I've had. No I've never tried Tennessee or Texas BBQ (yet), so I can't compare. But in the San Diego area, Phil's BBQ is king. Hands down. I've pretty much had most of the items on the menu. The ribs are like dinosaur legs. They're pretty big, so be prepared. I like their sandwiches. Sometimes the ribs are too much for me, so my next go-to item is the El Toro, which is their tri-tip sandwich. The broham is tasty as well, which is their pulled pork. If you're travelling to San Diego, PLEASE take a couple hours out of your trip to visit this place. I say a couple hours, because (depending on the time of day), there's about a 30-50 min wait time. The whole Phil's experience is waiting in line tho. As much as you want to walk away and say, "Let's go eat somewhere else.", the smell of BBQ eludes your nose and you can't seem to walk away. By the time you know it, you're feasting on the most delightful of delightful BBQs in the southern california region. Trust me. You won't regret it.

Some of the best BBQ I've ever had in my life.  I saw this place on Man V. Food and had to try it . .  . and boy I'm glad I did.  I've been here 5 times now, and the best dish I keep getting is the baby back ribs.  So full of flavor, and the ribs are so tender.  Last trip, I got the beef ribs . .  . def awesome, but the pork ribs by comparison are much better.  I also had the tri tip sandwich and it was really good . . .  would also highly recommend it.  I always either do take out or sit at the bar . . . .

Came here on a Sunday around 7pm. There was a long ass line forming around the restaurant. The wait was for 2 hours, which my boyfriend and I decided to get it to go since we had a concert to go to at 8pm. We decided to share a Half Rib Dinner with Macaroni Salad and Potato Salad as our sides. We also got extra sauce, but you don't really need it unless you like it extra saucy! The ribs were pretty good and the sides weren't bad as well. I would only come back here if I am in the area, but as for the wait...I would probably just get it to go and eat it somewhere else lol.

Phil's is yummy yum yum. Saw it on Man vs Food and I knew I had to try it!! I'm a BBQ loving girl! Beat the crowd coming here, which was awesome- no wait!! I say come before the dinner rush as the line DOES get outside the door and around the building. I saw it with me own eyes! I like how it's a casual BBQ place. Seriously, I'm eating BBQ, it NEEDS to be casual! I love how they put everything out and it's kinda like self service. You order the food and they call you when it's ready. There is a server that walks around and helps to clear tables and will even refill your drink for you. I'm a do it yourself girl, so I's rather do it myself... unless I'm totally feeling utterly lazy haha. They have the napkins, silverware, wipes, plates, and even to-go boxes out for your left-overs. No need to wait, just help yourself. The food itself is good. It's more of the sour BBQ, which I believe is vinegar based. Portions are good size. The chicken was moist, not dry, but I'm a baby back ribs BBQ girl and I ate them up like no tomorrow. Very tender and juicy! Next time I'm in San Diego, I will most definitely be hitting this place up again!

What can I say about Phils, they have the BEST ribs I have ever eaten at a resturant in my life! They are always consistent and always crazy delicious! The interior is what you would expect from a bbq joint and it does get busy quick on the weekends so I would recommend going early or be ready to wait in line for a while. I will always go to Phils to get my BBQ and it will probably get worse once they open their next location in Santee!

i definitely believe that this place lives up to its hype.  when me and my friends first arrived the line went around the FUGGIN BUILDING! but you know, we came all the way to SD, so we HAD to try PHILS BBQ!!! we got in line and it actually went by pretty fast. they also gave us samples of their onion rings in line too so that was nice (': waiting in line is a part of the phials bbq experience in my opinion because they have this lil section where you can take pictures and you can look at other ppl eating and see what they get and all that shiz! pretty fun! OH yah! and this place is not one of those sit down and order restaurants! you actually go up to the cashier and place your order then pick it up when your number is called! props to phil for this because this is actually a really efficient way of conducting business if you know what i meannn! k now on to the food! well i wasn't really thaaaaat hungry so i shared a babyback rib dinner, which included a full rack of baby back ribs and 2 sides, with my friend. babyback ribs: like everyone said, it was mouthwatering. super tender and perfectly cooked! definitely recommended! finger lickin' good! macaroni salad: this was also very delicious. complimented the ribs very well and if you like macaroni salad, this will nOT disappoint! cole slaw: DEFINITELY recommend this side!! after eating ribs you need something to cleanse your palate, and this cole slaw is so refreshing and yummy!!! OH YAH AND THERE ONION RINGS ARE THE SHIZ!! THEY ARE HUGE AND BATTERED AND SO YUMMY. way better than jeff's burgers onion rings which are just like basic onion rings.... phil's are large and in charge... k anyways! this place was poppin forreals and if you are a meat lover or rib lover or food lover in general, hit up phils! he will show you a good time!

Sometimes when so many people tell you how good a place is going to be, it simply ups the ante to the point where if everything is just perfect, they've failed. We expected to and wanted to LOVE Phil's but alas, it fell short for us. It didn't bother us that it took nearly a hour to move through the friendly line of people waiting to place their orders. We actually met some nice people in line that we chatted with about food, restaurants that we had been to and what to order here. The menu was decent and prices more than reasonable. We were here for BBQ and BBQ we would eat. For the five of us, we ordered four dinners and a large order of onion rings. More than enough food. Here's what we got: 2 slabs of baby back ribs 1 order of beef ribs 1 order of a 1/2 chicken corn on the cob cole slaw macaroni salad potato salad

BEST BBQ SPOT IN THE WEST COAST!! I just wrote a review from another SD restaurant (see: Analog Bar) ranting about how douchebaggy this waiter was.... NOW i think one of the best parts of this restaurant, is that you pay, you get your food, you sit in clouds of happiness as you eat, and you get the F up and leave.  No tips, no waiting for your check, no having to deal with good/bad waiters... just pay eat leave. As for the food, that's definitely a 5 stars.  I've never not pigged out over here.  I usually come out with a BBQ smothered face, all up in my scalp which i don't even know how it gets there.  I usually follow it up with a confession at church for punishing my digestive system to work that hard.  Then I pass out for about two to three days, so it is advised to go here on a Friday night.  (I usually order a full ribs, and chicken and ribs combo). People get turned off by the line that wraps around the building several hundred times.  However that is part of the experience.  Its like lining up for free vaccine or lining up for your first roller coaster ride at six flags. 5 stars are hard to come but this definitely earns each of them!

There's a few rules you must follow in order to fully experience the Phil's BBQ greatness. Never come here after 4 or suffer the long wait Always get the macaroni salad Don't come here before going to a concert and standing for 4 hours straight My first time at Phil's couldn't have been more perfect. There was no wait, ordered my food and recieved it IMMEDIATELY after.The macaroni salad is out of this world. I finished half a rack of ribs myself because it was that delicious. Unfornately suffered the repercussions/food coma afterwards though. But so worth it.

Since I have moved to San Diego a year ago I have heard all about the restaurant called Phil's BBQ.  My fiance and I were at the swap meet one Sunday and the smell of the smoke coming from Phil's and I could not resist.  We got there at 11:15 and there was a line out the door.  When we got inside the entire restaurant was already full and there was patio seating only which was great anyway.  The greeter was very friendly as was the girl taking our order.  When we got to the table a young guy came by our table and picked up our ticket and said he would be glad to bring our food to us when it was ready and even went and got our drinks.  It didn't stop there and the entire meal was very pleasant and the food lived up to all the hipe.  We both took enough home for another meal.  She had the pulled pork sandwich and I had the full rack of baby back ribs.  When you hear someone say "You gotta go to Phil's"!  You definitely gotta go to Phil's!

Phil's is always worth the long lines. I am a big fan of the pulled pork sandwich which is both inexpensive and quite delicious. The portion is big as well.

Once you turn a corner, there's a sign posted above to let you know that it takes 21 minutes from that point to the cashier. You order what you want to eat, pick it up, and find a seat! Condiments on the table and paper towels. When you're all done eating and have leftovers, there is a little station where you can grab your own to-go boxes and plastic bags to pack up. The experience was awesome. The food was delicious too. I ordered the quarter pork rib dinner (4 bones and 2 small sides or 1 large side). I ordered macaroni salad and pork beans. It was delicious. The bbq sauce was tangy but yummy! The pork beans were sweet and the macaroni salad was perfect. If you get a little messy eating you can always grab a bib to wear so your clothes won't get stained! I would definitely come back!

Hands down one of the best BBQ experiences I've ever had. No trip to San Diego is complete without a trip to Phils! IT'S MANDATORY. First time I came here I got the half chicken with the pork spareribs. FALL OFF THE BONE GOOD. Just the right amount of BBQ sauce so it wasn't drenched or skimped. The beans were tasty and cooked to perfection. The cole slaw was alright, can live without. Fries were so-so. Expect a wait on the weekends for sure, but oh so worth it!! BBQ chicken - 4.5 stars Pork Spare Ribs - 5 stars Beef Ribs - 3.5 stars Beans - 4 stars Cole Slaw - 3 stars Fries - 2.5 stars I dream of Phils which is probably why there's drool on my pillow.

I live right across the street from this place and every time I've tried to go, it's been a ridiculously long ass line. Go for lunch if you want to avoid that. The food is really good and you get a good amount for your money. Affordable prices too. The food reminded me of going to family BBQs and didn't taste generic like some other BBQ places can. I can't wait to go back.

I've been going to Phil's for years - even back when they were located at their old location.  Unfortunately, I've been disappointed the past few times I've ordered take-out from Phil's.  It used to be handsdown my favorite place to get ribs but lately I've been getting dry ribs with hardly any sauce and stale tasting fries.  My most recent take-out experience there, my ribs were cold and super dry and I don't live far enough to justify them getting that cold that fast!!!  I for sure will not be taking any of my out of town family or friends to this place anymore.  Too bad!

MUST Have's at Phil's BBQ: Baby Back Ribs-- quite simply amazing. Tender meat that falls off the bones... I am not a big meat eater and am not so much into BBQ, but I would convert if all BBQ and baby  back ribs tasted like this!! Onion Rings-- Their batter is crispy, sweet but thin enough. The onions are layers of thick juicy sweet onions. Each bite is a perfect combination of sweet onion, crunchy salty batter, and the ranch dip is the perfect match for such an amazing onion rings. The small order is pretty large, definitely enough for multiple people to share. Corn on the Cob-- I feel like I am in the middle of summer at a family backyard barbeque eating this corn on the cob. Crunchy, sweet, and fresh. Just like summer. Baked Beans-- Baked beans! Enough said! They are delicious!! Yummy enough: Chickless- breast meat not on the bone but smothered in BBQ sauce. Chicken was a little dry and chunks of breast meat were kind of large, but it was definitely still yummy. Potato salad- red potato salad, with skin, and crunchy celery. Maybe rosemary? It was yummy enough... but not a must-have!

I would love to give Phil's 5 stars, but the few times I've been back, their food has taken a bit of a fall from the first time I took first bite. Lol. I always order the half rib dinner or the half rib and chickless combo, with a side of beans and french fries.  I've tried their bbq burger, and it wasn't the best.  If you decide to come to Phil's, do yourself a favor and get a full slab of the baby back ribs, it's in it's own league, not like the nasty Chili's baby back ribs. I've also tried the onion rings and pul pork sandwich, those are also good choices.  The potato salad and macaroni salad aren't that great, but I'm not a big fan of "salads" that use any type of mayo in it. Okay, reason why I gave only 4 stars is because the past 2 times I was there, the ribs were NOT fresh out the oven.  They were room tempurature and the sauce didn't have the "OOMPH" it usually has with it's sweet tang that bites your tongue after each bite.  That's and the line on Friday - Sunday are horrible, especially when you have to fend for your own table and act creepy while standing next to a table while there's still people eating at it, LOL.  They should improve their hostessing and at least try to do table seating. Buy yourself a glass of sangria or pitcher of heffen. and you'll be good to go.  Wear a black shirt and loose jeans too!

We finally made it out here. We were always kind of weary to go b/c of parking and the long waits, but it actually wasn't bad at all! I'm used to waiting for barbecue - back where I went to college on the Central Coast, we had a restaurant that had great bbq. We've been trying to find something to compare to it down here. Well - what else can I add with 300+ reviews? We had a great experience. I ordered a Beefy Rib Dinner with 3 bones - boy, was I in for food overload! The meat was tender, the BBQ sauce was flavorful, and the mac salad was great. My husband ordered the Best of Both with ribs and chicken. We definitely had to get to-go boxes, there was so much food! And so - I think the price point is great for what you get!! The servers/busboys/floor people were very attentive too, which really helped with the experience. Next time I'll know what to order - less!

This place is the best! Ribs were unbelievable, as was the chicken. Both were pretty lean, yet very tasty. I would recommend getting the chicken and ribs plate. I also had a pulled pork sandwich which was very good, but not quite as good. Macaroni salad was decent, but baked beans were very good. They also have a good beer selection as well, I had a brown ale from a local microbrew that was outstanding. Atmosphere was good as well. Lots of classic rock music, and they know how to cater to bbq lovers with paper towels and a hand washing fountain. When the waiter cleared my plate he even gave me a moist toilet and toothpick!

HOLY BBQ BATMAN!  This place has some mouthwateringly good bbq people, AND at a great price.  That is double the pleasure when you go to Phil's.   First food: chicken- solid baby back ribs- solid dry or wet onion rings- perfectly battered served with perfectly tangy ranch coleslaw- good, but i'm personally a KFC coleslaw fan macaroni salad- solid french fries- solid EVEYRYTHING melts in your mouth....*drool. Service: SO GOOD.  From the first person that greets you at the door, to the few employees that are walking around making sure that you are satisfied while chomping down on some good ol' bbq, service is awesome!  Even when I was standing outside, and wondering what the Phil's Special Events location was about, someone stopped to ask if I had any questions!  Who does that?  Phil's sure does. I know my review is one in a sea of reviews, but I had to put my two sense in.  I'm not a huge bbq fan, but this place always satisfies my fickle appetite.

Haven't really been to many BBQ places, but Phil's BBQ is great.  I thought we were going to get seated as a group but you just walk in and place your order at the cashier and pay. I order the Baby Back Ribs and Chickless combo with fries and macaroni salad.  The bbq sauce tastes great and is perfect with the ribs and chicken.  They give you a lot of fries and macaroni salad.  My friend ordered the baked beans as a side and it came in a tiny bowl.   I will definitely go there again when I visit San Diego.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed Phil's BBQ before today!  This is one of my favorite places to eat! El Toro! This is a must have menu item in my opinion. El Toro is their deli-sliced steak sandwich.  The meat is always tender and juicy!  The Broham, their pulled pork sandwich is also a fan favorite.  I am not a big fan of pork, and even I love this sandwich. Quite honestly, I have not found a menu item that I do not like at Phil's BBQ.  I am not sure that is saying much though because ever since I found the El Toro sandwich, I order it EVERY time now. The line can sometimes wrap around the building, but it usually moves pretty quick.  If you have a large party, make sure you send them off to find one of the larger tables before you place your order.  It is seat yourself, so you have to plan ahead a bit.  But all this "trouble" is worth it when you get your food. I may not be a BBQ connoisseur, but I still say this is THE best BBQ in San Diego.

There's a reason why it's a 20 minute wait to get in the door on a Sunday afternoon. :D Today, I went with my roommate and one of our friends there. I got beef ribs and chicken and ended up with more food than I expected. I got full from it halfway through even though I definitely wanted to eat all of it. Oh well, I have lunch for work tomorrow. Definitely worth the wait.

Hit up this place today since im in San diego visiting and my oh my, just stepping out from the car, the smell of bbq filled the air & i was salivating. I ordered the beefy ribs with chicken and 2 small sides of macaroni salad & fries for a very affordable price of $11.95. I was really really hyped of for the ribs because everyone was raving about it, but i was kind of let down when I took a bite. The ribs were ok, but I've had better. Texas Smokehouse in SJ is much more better. The BBQ sauce however was really good. The chicken was ok as well, just enough flavor & not too dry. Another person in our party ordered the rib tickler and that was very tender and good. We also ordered small onion rings & that was really really really oily, crunchy, but oily. I would come to this place for the atmosphere, it's nice and big and service was ok, the food wasn't bad, but i will probably return on my next visit to give this place another chance, seeing that so many other people love it.

Last time I came here i got the lunch special with 1 BBQ beef rib, coleslaw, fries and 2 onion rings. For under $7 it's a great deal. I don't think the beef rib is the best I've had. In fact, aside from being really meaty, I think its average. On previous occasions I had the baby back ribs and I think they are some of the best I've ever had. Warning: There is usually a pretty long line here. If you are ordering to go, it's a good idea to order in advance by phone. The food will be ready in like 20 minutes.

This is like a fast food joint for BBQ.  You order your BBQ, wait a few minutes, and find a seat.  The BBQ sauce is great.  I would love to find one of these in the Bay Area. Only negative is the long long wait.  The line during dinner time can wrap around the building.  I guess that's proof of how good the BBQ is.

This place is constantly packed with mostly middle aged men, police and navy dudes in their uniforms. They've figured out that this place is relatively cheap and decent food. This being said, maybe they should have been the dead give away that this food is not healthy and if you succeed in finishing your plate, your stomach will writhe from food overload? The drink bar is my favorite. There's over 20 options, this place even carries Crystal Light. -- I appreciate their drink bar, it puts a smile on my face. The atmosphere is awesome. You order at the front and pick up your meal. No waiters which means you don't have to put out extra cash for a tip! I love this place, but I don't love their BBQ sauce, which is unfortunate. Its super sweet and thick. I prefer a vinegar sauce, but thats my preference. Overall BBQ meat is moist, but the sauce is too sweet. The sides options rock! The drink selections are awesome! No wait service -- but employees will stop by to ask if you need anything! Lots of food for little cash! (meals range from $6-$18 with most options in the $6-12 range) Atmosphere is awesome. Guaranteed good times!

Perhaps a bit more hype than is necessary, but I would definitely go back. Great for macho men, dads with bottomless pits for stomachs and your all around meat lover.  Heck, Father's Day is around the corner and I can tell you my dad would be uber appreciative if this was the chosen venue for celebration. Come hungry and ready to eat.  It would also be best to wear stain-friendly clothing just in case.   The line outside (because there is always a line outside) looks intimidating but armed with a good group of people, you can chat away and be up for a table in no time. The handy dandy, pocket sanitation wipes?  Check.

Crazy wait times but this place is the real deal.  I'd say the average wait is about an hour.  If you don't plan on eating there you can always call in first with your order. I think what really makes this place delicious is the bbq sauce.  It's bold vinegar based sauce that has a real nice spicy kick as well.  They are definitely not shady with the sauce! Their two main specialties are the baby back and beef ribs.  I tried both and they were excellent.  The meats were tender and feel off the bone without being too soft.  Their famous onion rings were pretty good as well.  A small order was enough to share with 4 people. Although the line was crazy long, I think they have a pretty efficient system in getting customers in and out.  I'll be back the next time I go to SD.

Oh, how I love Phil's for my BBQ fix. I understand that there's differing opinions on what "great bbq" can be---smoked? low and slow? it's all about the sauce? NOT about the sauce? etc... I, personally, am a fan of tender, slow-cooked bbq, with a smoky hint of sweetness, and a touch of vinegary-goodness accompanied within the sauce. I am an avid fan of bbq sauce. Phil's has delectable sauce and there baby back ribs are fork tender. I usually get the baby back rib tickler for less than $7.00 includes a large helping of fries, two huge pieces of onion rings and slaw, and three-four baby back ribs. You really can't beat that price and I leave with a full and content stomach. Hubby loves getting a sandwich and adds slaw to it. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the LINE is ALWAYS long and it's sometimes difficult to get seating...but regardless, I will still continue to go here for the bbq fixes.

My husband introduced me to this place.  I'm not a huge BBQ eater, but OMG!!!  I'm sooooo glad he introduced me to this place!  We pulled up into the parking lot and saw a line forming, which LITERALLY wrapped around half of the building.  Don't let that fool you.  STAY IN LINE because the line goes pretty fast.  When you get towards the front door, there is a huge menu where you're able to choose what you want.  Halfway through the door, I wanted to change my order but I didn't want to make my way back out to look at that huge menu, but low and behold....once you're in the doorway, there's a menu to your left!  A few feet more, there's another menu....a few feet more.....ANOTHER menu!  You can't forget your order!  So we get to the front, order our food, got a booth, and waited for only 5 minutes before our order was called, even if the place was packed!   Must tries:  Corn on the cob, Colossal Onion Rings Fresh Batter Dipped, Beef Ribs and Baby Back Ribs!   My whole family felt like we were gonna drift into a food coma after our meal.  That's a good thing, right?   I would've given this place an extra star if they gave wet naps.  Luckily I have a two year old who likes to make a mess, so I permanently have wipes in my purse.

It's good here! The workers are nice & friendly. The food is pretty fresh, get ready to get a lil' messy-it's barbecue now! The place a decent menu size, but I was thinking more of Southern bbq before coming to this place, so I was looking forward to mac & cheese, cornbread- but none of that was found. I got the menu item where you get to select two things ribs & chicken, the ribs were fall off the bone good, which I haven't had for awhile, so I was surprise with chickless (boneless & skinless). The chickless was easier to eat. Rubs are always messy. Next time I'm going to eat the potato salad and/or macaroni salad. Both items looked good as I was checking out the others tables. Be prepared to do a little self-serve, which is better because it makes the dining faster, get your own drink, find your own table, nothing too harsh. Although, the line is long outside it moves pretty quick. The reason this place gets a 4, not a perfect 5 is because the food did not seem to be marinated too long the flavor sat on the outside of the food for the chickless, but I understand since there was no skin to absorb the flavor, the ribs were really good & flavorful. Service: 4 Stars, the people are helpful & patient, even if you have questions. Food: 4 Stars, fast & descent flavor. Atmosphere: 4Stars, it's what you expect for bbq. Cleanliness: 4 Stars, the table was a little stuicky when we first arrived, but it was cleaned immediately. Overall: 4 stars, not a bad experience at all. Would I come back? Yes, as long as it's on way to the beach again =).

The only place to go for BBQ in San Diego. I've never been to big bbq cities like memphis or st. louis, but i would imagine that Phil's would even compete with the likes of them. I always bring anyone from out of town to phil's. Pros - I've had both the baby back ribs and the beef ribs and both are excellent. The baby back ribs are tender and fall of the bone, and the beef ribs are pretty massive if you like a little more meet. The only rings are great to. I usually also prefer to get the sauce on the side for the bbq just so I can control how much sauce is on there. The busers there are also really kind and friendly, they go out of their way to help. Cons - If u come around dinner time expect a long ol line.

I would have rather gone with a 4.5 here but there is no option to do so, going to St. Louis has kinda ruined me on San Diego bbq. At any rate you won't find any better bbq in the COUNTY of San Diego then Phil's.  It has great prices, incredible food, great proportions a decent bar... what else could you want?  I would recommend every fan of bbq stop in some time and enjoy a wonderful meal.

Great ribs whether you're into pork or beef. GREAT quality/value! GREAT proportions! GREAT selection of sides (although a salad would be nice to balance out with the meat, cole slaw is excellent, but the mayo in it still resides on the heavy side) And they have beeeeeer yay. Definitely a favorite BBQ joint in S.D. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 5-star is the sauce leans a bit on the sweet side. If it went a little bit more towards the smokier side, it'd be perfect.

This place has really good BBQ.  My boyfriend and I went here just this past week and we both had the el toro sandwich.  It was our first time ever and we kept changing our minds and adjusting our meals to our liking.  Did the person at the register care?!  No.  Apparently it was his first time working at the register and the manager was helping him out.  Both of them were really patient and changed our orders for us so that we got our "bang for the buck". The portions here are HUGE.  The large fries is ridiculously large and my boyfriend and I couldn't finish it!  The sandwiches were overflowing with savory meat and I had to take some of the tri tip home.   The service was excellent.  The bussers that come around are very attentive to keeping the place looking clean and they always drop by with more napkins, hand wipes, and toothpicks. Great food.  Great service.  What else can I ask for? Oh, and don't forget to come early unless you want to be waiting in a ridiculously long line that wraps you around the building.

I'm not from San Diego (Rep Fullerton!!!), so when I visited my cousin he suggested we go try Phil's BBQ since he himself had yet to try it. Upon arrival, the line had stretched around the corner of the building. Conveniently, there was a sign that said "approximate waiting time at this point: 22 minutes." Straight up, the wait was long, but well worth it. I ordered baby back ribs, which included 1/4 of chicken, cole slaw and macaroni salad. It was a beast of meal, but too delicious to save for left-overs. We also ordered a side of large onion rings. Between 2 guys who eat their weight in food, we had trouble just finishing the onion rings.  Phil's BBQ will be the standard joint I dine at each time I visit San Diego. The only thing I had a problem with was the fact that although Phil's BBQ is a dine-in restaurant, you are required to find your own seat. I only expect self-seating at fast-food places. This kind of killed it for me because I had to walk around like a chicken with its head cut off looking for an open table. The food made up for it though. Be cautious though, the line can get VERY LONG. So be prepared to eat elsewhere if you can't wait. Food: +delicious +HUGE portions, worth the money Ambience: -can get really crowded -long line especially at dinner time +worth the wait -/+ you seat yourself so finding a seat might take some time depending how crowded it is +can't wait? then just order take-out. Price: +worth the money because the food is DELISH Overall: Phil's BBQ is too good to pass up, especially if you're hungry. For someone who isn't from San Diego, I'm recommending everyone eat here. You are missing out.

I love this place.  I've only gotten the half rack of ribs (I really probably could eat a full rack but it just seems wrong for a 5'4" asian girl to do that, don't you?) with the baked beans and potato salad as sides.  I've only eaten at the restaurant once (have you seen that line around the building?).   The meat is just fall off the bone tender.  The sauce is tangy flavorful wonderfulness.  We order ahead, zoom through to pick up, and leave in 5 minutes flat.  When you call, they have your information in the system, the staff is friendly, and they give you extra sauce. and then when you've cleaned off every single bit of food and sitting on the couch with a full belly and sinking into a nice food coma.....how could that not be just utter bliss?  I am SO GLAD I'm a carnivore.

Sunday night 6PM, we called, the girl at the restaurant told us it's about 1 and half hour wait, we ordered takeouts instead. When we got there, we realize we have to wait in phone-order line for about 20 minutes, after we paid, 5 more minutes wait. Back to the hotel, I couldn't wait to try the overly reviewed and praised ribs. I took a bite of baby back and disappointment just flooded in my mind. Right away, I am thinking just another over rated restaurant on Yelp. After the disappointing baby back, I was hoping and wishing the beef ribs would be the highly prized BBQ I was looking for. And BINGO, the beef rib was huge, juicy, tender, very satisfying with every bite. The tangy, sweet, and just a little kick of spiciness BBQ sauce was perfect for the beef ribs. I started looking at the over cooked and flavorless baby back and thinking what the waste of time and money. So I am giving the beef ribs 5 stars, baby back 3 stars which yields 4 stars.

Oh My Stars!  If you haven't had Phil's then you're definitely missing out! I've been a frequent customer but only just discovered the "Tickler"!  Your choice of the chickless, baby back ribs, or beefy ribs with fries, onion rings and your choice of a side.  CHEAP!  Under $10 bucks.  Just sayin' if you're on a budget, this is the way to go.  I can eat so this was the perfect portion with a great price.

The only reason I'm even writing this review is to bring this place's average closer to a five than a four-and-one-half. Easily the best BBQ in San Diego.  Prices are slightly high.  But the meat falls off the bones of the pork baby back ribs; and usually, the meat on the beef ribs are a perfect balance of lean and fattiness. The BBQ sauce is strong to the point of almost overpowering.  But its almost-over-the-top taste is what makes it special.  It's sweet and sour and smokey and peppery and all that jazz all at the same time. Of course, only eat stuff here if you are ready to call it a night.  Because you will fall into a serious food coma within minutes of having a plate of goods here.

Ok this is my second time to Phil's BBQ and now I am confident to bump it up to 4 stars! We ordered the Beefy Ribs and Chicken combo and it was de-lish! The only reason why I still rate it at 4 out of 5 stars, is only if the wait to get in there wasn't so long. But otherwise, we'd come back time and time again :)

I've only been here once so I can't say I'm a die hard advocate for the place, but I was impressed. While my pulled-pork sandwich was slightly dry in places, that is my only complaint. The sauce is fantastic. We arrived just before the huge crowd so I can't complain about my wait at all. I'm not usually a coleslaw fan, but the coleslaw at Phil's is delicious. Fries are also good. Parking was easy and prices were fair. Overall, not the best BBQ I've ever had but this is San Diego afterall, what more can you expect.

Is it even necessary to review this place?! lol all the good things need to be said are said. Food is excellent, no doubt. We went straight to the bar, didn't have to wait in line. Waited for about 10 min for ppl to clear up seats, bartender was very friendly, orders didn't take long to come out. Got the baby back ribs, 1/4 chicken, cold slaw, mac salad and a side of onion rings. The chicken is so much better than the chickless! so moist and tender. I dont even need to talk about the ribs haha It was just great food

Carnivore treat - BBQ RIBS and BABY BACK.. If you like then this place is a must try while your in San Diego. This place has over 1000+ review, so no need me to convince ya'll... I was sold on this place when I first smelt that bbq aroma pulling up to the parking lot...   The wait here can be a downer. There is limited seating, and you will wait at least 45min - 1 hr. Incredible fall off the bone texture, and a bbq sauce to match that quality.  It is all about the sauce that really makes this place delicious and unique.  The bold vinegar based sauce that has a real nice spicy untone. Good sides orders too (fries and onion rings) A++ for me. I like, and would recommend  =)

Reading the reviews I thought that this place was going to be overrated... but it is soooo not! Their food is seriously DELICIOUS. This is what we ordered: BABY BACK RIBS (delicious and very tender) COLESLAW (refreshing and complements the baby backs) CORN (cooked perfectly. my 2 1/2 year old chomped on it like it was her last meal) ONION RINGS ( perfectly crispy.. it was so good with ketchup. liked it better than the ranch they gave with it) Their food is so good that they don't even need good service.... but that is so not the case. I wish that all food establishments were as friendly as Phil's. My family LOVES this place. Every time we go to San Diego, we will definitely make a stop to Phil's!

I'm going to rate this place based off its other competition in San Diego. First off, you better run a half marathon before coming to this place, because you will leave full and fat.   So a friend and I came for lunch on a casual Wednesday and there was a decent line, but not too long.  We ordered a rack with a couple sides, slaw and fries.  Food came out, slaw and fries were decent, but really, who's here for sides right? The ribs were pretty good.  Fall off the bone tender, and extremely moist and flavorful.  Have I had better BBQ?  Yes, but like I said, I am comparing it to its local competition, which is ummm... nobody.  Okay, that's the review from a regular person's perspective.  Here's the review from a critics perspective. You can obviously tell that the ribs were steamed ahead of time, and thrown on the grill to finish off.  There simply was no smoke ring.  Is this bad?  By all means no, but I like the peatiness that comes from that low and slow smoke.  Also, the sauce was a bit too sweet compared to most other BBQ sauces I've had.  Maybe they're trying to distinguish themselves?  Who knows, just my opinion on it.  Next time, I'll get my sauce on the side, though. Now I digress.  If you're from the west coast and visit San Diego, go and try it, you'll enjoy it for sure.  If you're from anyplace east of New Mexico, or have had the chance to try low and slow BBQ, this place may not be for you. ****

1-Don't wait in the HUGE line! Just call ahead and pick it up. You will be out of there in less than 10 minutes. 2-The baby back ribs are fabulous but I also suggest the rib tips too, all the pork goodness but not the fight with the bones. 3-Best macaroni salad ever! 4-If you are not a pork or rib fan no problem. Get the chickless dinner. It is big chunks of white meat smothered in their fabulous BBQ sauce.

Yum yum Love love!!! I love this place, when I move this is going to be one of the places I'm going to miss the most.  I always get the baby back ribs with sauce on the side.  I'm not a huge fan of bbq sauce so its nice to dip as i eat and get just as much bbq sauce I want.   The cole slaw is my favorite ever! its not to mayoie and still has a nice crunch.  Their onion rings are amazing! They are breaded just right and they don't hurt your mouth when you eat.  They also make good potato salad and mac salad too.  Oh and their corn on the cob is fresh and never over buttered or over cooked!   The pulled pork sandwich (broham) is more than enough for one meal.  Their chicken is good, and sometime a little dry but still very flavorful.  Their beef rib is big enough for me to just eat one and be happy.   Oh and if you think they might skimp on their salads, nope! They make their Caesar salad dressing and its light and amazing! I sometimes drive there not for bbq but for their salad.   I love this place I can't express how much.  If you are planning on going be prepared to wait in line but you can always check out their website because they have a camera showing their line so you know just how long the wait is! They are so smart!!! Oh and if you sign up for their email list you can get to the front of the line on your birthday!!!!

What is there to add to the almost 1500 reviews? I just want to profess my LOVE, along with SO many others.. of Phil's. I LOVE this place. i don't live in the area, but on and off, for the last 3 years, when i make a drive down to SD (from Santa Monica), or i have sisters who do, i will make a point to stop by, or have people bring them back for me. I've tried a variety of menu items, and my favorites are: Beef ribs (HUGE, and satisfyingly meaty), baby back ribs (not falling off the bone, but tender and yum nevetheless), and Chicken (oh so tender and juicy). The sauce is a little spicy, and sometimes it feels more spicy than others. Its a preference. I like it (sometimes, it has too much vinegar after taste that assault my nostrils, and i dont love it so much), some people don't. Just wish maybe they offer a plain non spicy version, to cater to kids or people with milder palette. The place gets packed. Came at 11:30 am, line out the door already. But it moves. So just be patient. And once you are in, the food won't be too long. Seating is self serve, tho the host/ hostess directs you to an area. Get ready to be eat messy, spill some sauce on your shirt, and be stuffed.

2nd time here and it's still great, maybe better. We went in with a party of 26 and when I thought that it'll be too crazy to accommodate, it's actually the opposite! Apparently they have a policy where if you have a group of more than 6, the other groups may join the first group's that's already in line. So, we all arrived in different times but ended up at the same spot in line and got seated all together. Service was GREAT: We went around 6:00pm on a Wednesday night and the line wasn't too bad actually. While in line, we told the person that takes care of large group that we have a group of 20. 10 Min later, we told him we actually have a group of 26 and he will try to accommodate this change for us and surprisingly, HE DID. We also got our food really quick and servers often come by to check on us and making small funny comments/ small talks as well! Food: was great!! I actually finished everything on my plate and I ordered the baby back ribs/ ticklers. yummm! Will definitely be back here again!

This is also a must-have in San Diego. :) I've been here so many times with friends and especially friends that drive down 2 hours + just to get phils bbq! WHY? Because Phils BBQ is the bee's knees and you will more than definitely leave with a full stomach and a meal for another time. Despite the occasional 40 + minute wait, it is hard to tell that time has passed when you finally sit down with your ribs. I highly recommend the Beefy ribs 3-bone meal! I get it all the time and I always end up leaving with a lot of it in a to-go box. I generally don't like to get dirty when i'm eating, but the hell with it when I'm at Phil's BBQ! It's okay to get a little messy here! :D Enjoy!

Go here. It's the best barbecue in San Diego. I don't eat red meat and I still love it! If you're vegetarian, there are a couple options, mostly side dishes and while not entirely healthy, the macaroni salad is to die for. Only downside: the restaurant's popularity some times results in a long long line out the front door. The line actually moves pretty quickly, but can take up to 30minutes, and the delicious smell of barbecue while you wait in line makes the wait time seem even longer. SO, go early, go often, go barbecue!

at 10:30pm on a saturday night, I had to fit this into my plan for the day. A per Adam Richman's suggestion me and my girlfriend ordered two El Toro sandwiches, a side of potato salad and fries, all super delicious, the best sandwich I ever had, although the overflowing meat could easily have been served alone in a bowl, I would have still enjoyed it as much.

Wow, I could smell the hickory scent from Phil's as I pulled into their parking lot.  As I walked closer to the restaurant, I could see the line snaking to the end of the side of their building.  Total wait time ended up to be an hour and 10 minutes to get to the cash register, and another 15 minutes for the food to arrive. Their beef ribs were semi crispy on the outside from being barbecued, yet the meat was still juicy and almost falling off the bone.  It was easy to eat, yet still somewhat messy from the BBQ sauce.  Their was a hint of hickory smoke flavor and tangy BBQ sauce in every bite. Mmmmmm. The BBQ chicken was surprisingly juicy was well, since many places barbecue their chicken pretty dry.  Not at Phil's.  It too had a hickory smoke flavor and was slathered in the same tangy BBQ sauce. I had the corn on the cobb as a side, which was large and sweet. I've love to eat at Phil's again, but the wait is just too long.  Next time I'll phone in my order for pickup =)

Best BBQ ever! We shared the rib and chick-less combo with beans and fresh cut fries. We also shared the ginormous pulled pork sandwich. We could only finish the chick-less platter and had to take the entire sandwich with us! They are very friendly and helpful. We had never been there and had no idea where to start on their extensive menu. The cashier took her time helping us even though there was quite a line. We sat down and within 7 mins our food was at the table. They come around quite frequently to see if they can get you anything or do anything for you. The food was soooo good. You could smell the smoked hickory scent immediately. All the meat was tender and juicy. The BBQ sauce was to die for. Nice mix of tangyness and smokiness. The ribs were perfectly cooked practically falling off the bone. The chicken was not dry in the least bit and very good quality white meat. The beans were pretty incredible for such a staple item. Fries great too. Thank god they had a huge roll of paper towels at the table cause the food got pretty messy. But isn't that the point? What would good BBQ be without a little mess? CANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK!

We were in San Diego last weekend for a wedding, and a group of 8 of us went for a pre-wedding lunch at Phil's.  We arrived 11 AM on Saturday and the wait was minimal; about 15 min.  From the parking lot, the aroma of wood smoke was thick in the air.   My wife and I ordered pulled pork sandwiches, a half rack of baby back ribs, and fries.  Absolutely delicious!  The pulled pork had a glorious smoky flavor.  The ribs were meaty and falling off the bones tender.  The meat had that beautiful pink smoked color.  The smoke flavor in the ribs was also marvelous.   The only negative, however, was that the meat was over-sauced in my opinion.  The sauce was also too tangy; although I am aware that this is a personal preference.  I was agree with the other review here that recommends getting the sauce on the side.   Overall though, we were extremely pleased with the meal, and we will definitely be back when visiting San Diego in the future.

I can't come up with enough expletives to describe how good this place is.  I admit, my BBQ experience has mostly been with likes of Lucille's and Tony Roma's.  I thought they had good ribs but noooooo, after trying both beef and pork ribs at Phil's, I now see the light. As I bit into my first baby back rib, this is what I said, "This shiyet is puckin gooooood!"  When faced with something this good, only the most down to earth human expressions suffice. Basically a fastfood joint but as you wait in line for minimum of 30 minutes, they ask how many peeps are in your party and tell you to go grab a table if one opens up.  That's pretty nice of them, eh?! Definitely a must go place if you're a meat eater.

I went alone, which allowed me to skip the 20-30 minute line out the door and go straight to the bar to eat.  The menu is kind of small, but what they have is very good.  I ordered the BBQ beef ribs and chicken, with fries. The ribs were huge, with lots of fall-off-the-bone meat, very tender and flavorful.  There was at least a half pound of chicken on the platter, also well cooked.  The sauce was excellent, thick and just a little spicy.  The fries were also pretty good. Great food, great prices, this is definitely a place I'd frequent if I lived in San Diego.

Honestly, I can't think of any reasons why this shouldn't be five stars.  Phil's is synonymous with awesome BBQ here in San Diego (at least amongst my friends).  This place can be a little pricey depending on what you get, but the guarantee is that it is worth it's money. Until my first Phil's experience, I don't recall ever having eaten beef ribs.  I probably have but I never realized it because I've grown up on baby back ribs (pork for those of you who don't know the difference).  The beef ribs are my personal favorite because the meat is so tender and doesn't stick to the bone like super glue as some other places.  The fries are deep-fried and seasoned perfectly.  The fresh-battered colossal onion rings are the best I've had in my life.  There is no way to describe how much food that is if you get the full beefy rib dinner with fries as its large side and a large order of the onion rings.  It usually makes me VERY full if I share it with only one other person, so I usually suggest sharing that order among three or four people with another order of just ribs.  And you can never forget about the fantastic barbecue sauce they make at Phil's. The service here is excellent too.  The cashiers work fast here and do their best to keep the line moving because it can get extremely long (note: if you're not patient, this would be the worst possible place to go to if you go at the wrong time; wait times can range anywhere from 30 minutes to nearly two hours sometimes).  The bussers (especially this one black guy) are VERY nice guys.  They are always so kind to bring plates, utensils, and wet-wipes before you get your food and are always asking how you're doing. In the end, you really have to go there to experience it for yourself.  Any native San Diegan who has lived there for at least five years and has yet to try Phil's BBQ should be ashamed of themselves.  This place is the standard for great BBQ in my opinion.

I waited an hour and a half in line to sit down and eat.  SO WORTH IT!  I was really full and brought it home as a leftover and it still tasted great; it wasn't dry at all and didn't lose flavor.  The colossal onion rings were really good too.  I couldn't place it, but there was something about the baked potato I didn't like too much, but oh well, this place isn't called Phil's Baked Potato.   I can't wait for the San Marcos location to open up.

Came here with a friend for the first time and was kind of surprised that there wasn't that many people. I then realized that we got there a little a early before the lunch rush because when we left the line was around the building. The service here is awesome! Everybody that we talked to was very friend and helpful. They all smile and is always willing to help. An example is one of the employees asked if we needed help find a seat and found us a table, even though this place seems more of a seat yourself restaurant. Also it's self serve drinks but an employee saw that my cup was empty and offered to refill it for me. I ordered the Baby back ribs and the chicken combo with fries. First the bad, the chicken was nothing special, it just tasted like regular chicken with sauce splashed on top of it. The ribs were pretty good compared to some of the other places that I've had. My friend got the tri-tip burger, which i thought was the best thing that we got. It was juicy and was big enough for one person. The environment of this place is a restaurant but also felt like a fast food joint since you have to find seats for yourself and also get your own drink refills. But it also seems like everybody was in a good mood from employees and cos customers. Over all i would come back to Phil's BBQ again but try something different. Also i would recommend this to anybody who's looking for a good BBQ place.

I really like Phil's, but I would never ever actually eat at the restaurant. The line is simply too long, and the place is always packed. I got take out recently and I still had to wait a total of 40 or so mins for my food. I really enjoy the smoky flavor of their chicken and their baby back ribs. The pulled pork was neither here nor there, though the fries were crispy and the coleslaw was really tasty. My suggestion- make your own pulled pork with a pork shoulder and a crock pot, and buy the pack of Phil's BBQ sauce at Costco. I did that this past week and it was delicious and satisfied my craving for a good BBQ meal. I didn't even have to wait in line!

I think anyone who wants to give Phil's BBQ 4-5 stars is just all for formality's sake since all the evidence (featured in Man v. Food, lines that wrap around outside, etc.) proves that it serves great tasting barbecue.  And if you decide to review it and give it 1-3 stars, I would be willing to bet money that it's not because Phil's ain't good, but rather because something's wrong with your tastebuds and you probably need to check your temperature.  Perhaps you are sick? Anyway, I live in Los Angeles but I would be willing to drive 150 miles south on the 5 to Phil's without hesitation for some barbecue fix.  My wife and I go to SD quite often for family visits and casinos and when we do, we always put Phil's on our list. I've tried the Beefy Ribs, BBQ Chicken, Baby Back Ribs, and their Colossal Onion Rings.  I'm not a big fan of their sides.  I've tried almost all of them but it's something I can do without.  If you're a pure-bred carnivore like me, you'll never go wrong with their Beefy Ribs.  It's just plain yumster in the tumster.  Their Baby Back Ribs are good too but there was just one time I was there that for some reason, something was a tad off on the texture.  The barbecue taste is there, it's just weird.  But that was forgiven since it's just that one time.  There's nothing special about their BBQ Chicken.  I mean it's good, but only because of the sauce.  If you grill your own chicken at home and take home a bottle of Phil's BBQ Sauce and pour it over, it's probably just as good. I'm really not big on Sandwiches so needless to say, I haven't tried their famous El Toro.  But since I've seen it featured in Travel Channel's Man v. Food, I've put the El Toro as my number one priority when I go there next.  I just want to see what they hype is about. If you're from the SD area, I'm sure you've tried this place out.  But if you're from the LA area and have plans for some R&R in SD on a weekend, make sure to include Phil's on your list. My $0.02.

The BBQ here is definitely good but not mind blowing amazing. The sauce is tangy and the sides are fine. The meat is cooked perfectly, I had the pork ribs and chicken combo dinner. They give large portions of everything and the price is very good. It def. gets a 5 stars in terms of value (price for quality of food).

Phil's is a San Diego institution and for good reason. They have awesome BBQ, and I've had Rudy's in Texas and Pieces in Virginia and so on. Long lines at lunch are best avoided by getting there before 11:30AM. We've used Phil's for catering as well, and the catering was on time, piping hot and delivered with great service. At the restaurant, get the El Toro. It's the best. I found it to be a little inconsistent though, sometimes really tender and others a little on the fatty/chewy side. Side dishes like corn on the cobb and moon pies are overall good quality, but the buttermilk onion rings are amazing as long as you get them while their hot. Parking is tough if you go during peak hours, so carpool if you're taking a crowd there.

I've eaten a lot of ribs. So many in fact that I'm convinced I will be forced to come back in my next life as a pig. That said, these are absolutely the best ribs I've ever had. Better than my own even. Very tender, fall off the bone pork ribs. They pour a good amount of sauce over them, so if you don't like that, ask for it on the side. The sides aren't anything exciting and the burger was a little weird. My eight year old will eat just about any burger, but wouldn't finish this one. Any good sporting events are only shown in the bar.  They put the "B" games on in the main dining room so that people don't stay too long. The long waits are every night, so be prepared for that, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. I definitely would eat here again.

I am shocked that San Diegans got this one right! Waited in line for almost 2 hours. I kid you not. It was well worth the wait. Loved the baby back pork ribs. LOVED the beef ribs. L.O.V.E.D the onions rings. Yes, these are the best onions rings. Fries and baked beans topped my list of small sides. What else can I say? Other than, and I repeat, I am shocked that San Diegans got this one right! tip: If you need ranch or extra bbq sauce, ask for it when you get your food and not when you order. It saves you the few extra cents they would charge you.

Yum! Phil's has some of the best BBQ sauce I've ever had. It's sweet, creamy and goes great with just about everything on the menu. I tried: the BBQ Broham: pulled pork piled high on a toasted bun, smothered with the sweet goodness of Phil's BBQ sauce. I think it's best to order the cole slaw on the side, but you can have it on the sandwich too. the El Toro: tri tip BBQed to perfection, overflowing the bun and covered with its own BBQ sauce. I noticed this sauce was different from the BBQ sauce on the Broham, but it was just as good. Fries: only $1.25 for a small order of fries but it satisfied FOUR of us in addition to our giant sandwiches. Why Phil's is fun: -they have GREAT customer service, so the long line is no big deal. -they give you a free Phil's BBQ pen :) -Extra ranch and BBQ sauce is free -there's a bar where I've heard the sangria is amazing--I had to drive back to LA that night so drinking for me was a no-go. Parking looks like it can be an issue depending on when you go (even though they have a large lot). I've also heard the line can wrap around the building.

Best BBQ on the west coast hands down. Every time I go to San diego, I have to eat here. I even brought sauce back. It amazes me that people line up for long lines. I never wait, but I can see it being worth it. I've had the beef ribs which are amazing and mac salad and fries are awesome as well. I had my friend bring like a crate of ribs for my gfs bday, so its worth the money and worth everything! I'm actually hungry thinking about it now.

So here is the thing on their famous "el Toro" trip tip sandwich...there is WAY too much BBQ sauce.  It is too bad, because the meat is so tender and full of flavor, but it is literally swimming in bbq sauce.  By the end it was a chore to eat it, as I was sick of the sauce. The lines were long and the onion rings were great.   A small order of rings at Phil's is the equivalent of a XXL order anywhere else.

Phil's BBQ is to die for!  Went here after a trip to the San Diego Wild Animal Park with the bf eating some lower than average burgers and couldn't wait for a nice hearty dinner.  My friend randomly recommended this place based on great reviews on Yelp and this place was definitely worth it! Ordered the half chicken half ribs combo with baked beans and fries, and did not regret it one bit.  The meats are so tender and the sauces are delicious!  Also ordered some onion rings (also a great buy).  Only plate I thought was mediocre was the coleslaw, but it might be to some other people's liking since I'm not a huge coleslaw fan.  Portions are quite generous and the pricing is extremely reasonable.  The staff is super friendly and the place is spacious.  This place doesn't take reservations but the line going out the door goes through quickly.   Ever since I've eaten here I've been raving about it nonstop.  I think I'm due for San Diego trip for more Phil's BBQ! :)

Man have I taken you for granted! I went back home and tried a BBQ place and it did not even compare to Phils! Now I understand the long lines at this place! The baby back ribs are SOO good that it gets me drooling just thinking about it! And the rib tickler is just the right portion for me and cheap! Oh yes, and the cashier gave me one of their giant whoopie pies too! It was so moist and huge that I shared it with about 4 of my friends! Staff here is always really friendly and fun to chat with while we wait =]

Like this place needs another review.  Best BBQ joint! I prefer the beef ribs.  I never had tender beef ribs before I came here.  That's why I always ordered baby back ribs.   But here, it's all about the beef rib.  They're HUGE, so I just need one.  The onion rings are big and tasty too.  I like my BBQ sauce with a little kick so I just throw on a little Frank's Hot Sauce and it's perfect. Lines are always long.  Try going during the week on off hours.  Never go on a long weekend.  I've waited an hour and a half!

Everything has pretty much already been said, so I'm going to keep it short and sweet with a haiku: great food at reasonable price. mouth waters while writing this haiku for Phil's I will comment on the sauce: perfect kick, spices pulling through, and not too tangy or sweet. Perfect compliment to the food as it really accents the meat and smokiness without covering it up.

Sometimes it's difficult to qualify 'awesomeness' in words, particularly with your mouth stuffed full of Phil's ginormous portions of bbq.  While I typically had acquiesed to the safe pulled pork sandwich, it wasn't until recently that I tried the baby back ribs - infatuatingly delectable.  I have no memories of better ribs - nothing from my childhood days in backwater bbq joints in the southeast resonate remotely close to the memories Phil's baby back ribs instated in my cranial cavity. Word of wisdom to the wise:  call ahead and pick up to skip the line as the amazing aroma will test your nerves - unless you want a flavor of what life was like during the Soviet Union bread lines.

This place is HEAVEN... One of the best BBQ joints iv been to in SoCal! With over 2100 reviews, it is definitely the spot! The line to get in and dine literally wraps around the whole building to tell you the truth! If you come here around lunch time, aspect to wait about 30mins to an hour before you get in. Every meat I tried here is literally mouth watering and delicious... The meats were juicy, smokey, and had just the right amount of flavor. The ribs were fall off the bone and just melts in your mouth. The ribs though were slightly over sauced, so one thing I can suggest is to ask for light sauce. The service and hospitality everyone had there was great. Everyone was very friendly and greeted me with much enthusiasm. I rate this place overall a 5 and I would definitely come back for my 3rd time. :)

All the rumors are true -- it is amazing. And the line is also amazingly long. For future visits I would definitely call in advance and then just stop by to pick up the order, though standing in the to-go line was not half bad (20ish mins). The line to get seated inside was a nightmare, wrapped around the building and definitely discouraged me from staying. Best part of waiting in line was a server offered us fries/dip as we waited. Such a tease, but so gooood. Ordered the full baby back ribs with a large side of fries as well as another side of onion rings. Since we got it to-go, the ribs and fries all came in one box. Which is not necessarily a bad thing if you like soggy fries. Personally, I am not a fan. So I would order them in separate boxes next time. The ribs were appropriately amazing and delicious, fries also quite good. The onion rings were massive and extremely oily but what do you expect? Gotta indulge every once in a while. Overall very good experience. Staff was also extremely happy and attentive especially considering the flocks of people they have to accommodate on a day-to-day basis. Would definitely visit again, I've heard some of their sandwiches are worth the try!

Phil's BBQ IS SO GOOD!! People come from all over to eat here. Whenever I have a friend come in from out of town, I always take them to Phil's because they will never be disappointed. Whether you get the chicken or the ribs, it is cooked to perfection and lathered with their delicious homemade BBQ sauce. My usual is the 1/4 chicken dinner (1/2 chicken if I want to have extra to take home). The El Toro (I think that's what it's called) sandwich is a HUGE pile of meat... Props if you can finish it all in one sitting. The beans and the potato salad are both really good sides. The fries are not as crispy as I usually like my fries, but they'll definitely fill your plate and your stomach, Only thing... be prepared to wait. The line does move fairly quickly as long as you don't go at peak dinner time. You can't make reservations, so I don't recommended going here with a large group. If they see that you are a large group, they will find a way to accommodate you, but you will wait. If you live in SD and have never been to Phil's, then you need to get with the times and go to Phil's.

Yes, it is one of the best BBQ place in SD.   I remember way back when Phil's was in Mission Hills tucked away in a little hole in the wall place that they called home.  I used to get my hair done around the corner and could smell the wonderful smoke while I was in the salon.  Let's just say the saliva trail on my chin did not look pretty (even after an awesome hair cut). Anyway... After moving to the Sports Area, Phil's has really grown (literally and figuratively) into a delish dish joint.   Just about everything on their menu is great.  I am partial to pulled pork and sausages so those are my go-to grub.  A meal is not complete without the onion rings and oh yeah baby wash it all down with some sweet potato fries. BUT, all you die hard BBQ foodies be psychologically prepared...there ain't no mac and cheese or cornbread to be found.

Super / Amazingly Tender Meat!!!! Came on a sunday night around 7pm and the line was an hour long.  Which is not bad.  Definitely worth the wait! Ordered the Beef Ribs... which is to my standards the best test for BBQ.  The beef ribs was so tender that it fell off the bone.  Also the quality of the meat was perfect.  What I mean by that is, the meat wasn't too fatty, it had the perfect balance.  I also got a chance to try some of the baby back pork ribs and hands down the meat was good. Now for the reasons why I only gave it 4 stars. Sauce:  Sauce was more on the tangy side.  I have to admit that I am still a huge Lucilles fan.  I still love that sweet and tangy bbq sauce.  The BBQ sause at Phil's BBQ seems like it was drenched on top.  Which felt a little too much at times.  So as you can tell I am definitely basing Phil's BBQ with Lucilles Smokehouse.  And when it comes to side orders, Lucilles wins my heart too.  Phil's BBQ fries were nothing special and nothing really stood out when I was trying to decide on which sides to get. As for Price... It was decently priced especially for the amount you get.  Compared to Lucilles which was slightly pricier. Would definitely go again!

Broham sandwich you never fail me. So juicy, tender... and... BBQ-ey. And the coleslaw just adds to the whole experience. Don't forget the stack of onion rings. A small stack will satiate 2 people. The boo says the El Toro is good too, but the Broham is more tender and the meat has more flavor. Last time I came here, I arrived 10 minutes before they opened and we were 10th in line. A longer line of about 40 people formed behind us by the time the place opened. Needless to say, get here early if you want to avoid the long lines, although they do move quickly.

My hubby and I ended up here last night for dinner. He ordered the El Toro- delicious~! We shared the beefy ribs and it was fall off the bone meaty goodness. After reading some reviews, we got the sauce on the side. YUM! We had the baked beans, coleslaw, and onion rings as sides- all good. My husband didn't care for the onion ring batter though. The wait outside was 30 minutes (we wouldn't have waited over an hour for it), but as others have already said, with the right company, it doesn't seem that long. Depending on the wait, will definately eat here again!

(2.13.11) OMG once we arrived to PHIL'S BBQ, our eyes immediately drew to the infamous long line. Clearly, this was the best BBQ in SD. We ended up standing in line for an hour and a half.   Defintely order: 1)Baby Back Ribs- meat falls off the bone (yummy!) 2)Colossal Onion Rings 3)Sides- Macaroni Salad, Baked Beans (definitely goes well with the ribs~) 4) Chicken was alright BBQ SAUCE: WONDERFUL!!!!! The servers was so nice and attentive! The long line wait was DEFINITELY WORTH it!!!! I wish it was closer though!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!! =)

This place is the place to go for ribs!  As far as BBQ goes this place is the king of ribs.  They dont offer brisket though and their pulled pork doesnt have much menu space, but it is some good pulled pork. Only thing I didnt love were the fries, but there are many other sides to choose from. I went midday on a Thursday and the line was only about 5 - 10 mim. long. Some cool touches that they have are a hand wash station, a station to grab to-go boxes and bags and a ton of fountain drinks. Anyhow, I highly recommend trying this place if you can. If you like ribs then you will love Phil's.

I thought this was way too overhyped but after eating ribs @ stonefire grill, I finally understood that these baby back ribs are actually REALLY good. Went today after service at The Rock and the line was loooooooooong... never waited that long for Phil's before. But man, was it worth the wait. Shared a full rack with a friend, with the fries and the cole slaw. The fries are sooo delicious when they are drenched in the BBQ sauce! Also, the onion rings are so good! Better than Hodad's IMO. I personally do not like the beefy ribs and didn't really like the sandwiches (pulled pork shoulder and tri tip) that my other two friends ordered. (I tried them both). I always get the same thing! The lady working at the front was so funny and entertaining, too. I was getting a little grouchy waiting in line for that long and being in the front made it even worse. Seemed like I was sooo close but the people were taking so long to order! But yeah, she was super nice, joked around with us and even danced with one of the other workers! I'm getting hungry just writing this review. You must come here!!!

I haven't written a review for Phils because they already have so many =) When I was in college, my reward after finals would be to go to Phils (which was in Hillcrest) and eat.  Eat so much that my stomach would feel like it was going to burst.   I wouldn't say a word to anyone, because I was so busy stuffing my face with Phils. The wait is long, but the food is worth it and their service has always been great - and continues to be great!!!  This location works like a well oiled machine. I am glad to see it growing as it is truly a San Diego gem.   Every time I am in SD I MUST go =)  Keep up the great work!!!

Came here expecting something amazing because of all the reviews and hype my friends gave it.. overall, I'd have to say, the ribs were okay, nothing special and I left disappointed. Menu only consisted of baby back/beef ribs and chicken as the meat. Missing the brisket! Bludso's bbq in compton is way better and the best bbq I've tried in California by far. If you haven't tried it, definitely make a trip. Phil's is good, but not worth the drive/wait.

This place is finger-licking good(LITERALLY!). The menu offers a variety of choices for both meat and poltury lovers. My usual is the El Toro(Tri tip) sandwich. I have a habit of adding a personal touch to all of my food so I add on Coleslaw, which is how the broham is served. Phil's definitely does BBQ right! If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor and give in to the hype.

Reason I'm giving Phil's only 3 stars is due to how sad their side order portions are. Are you kidding me? I ordered full slab with what was supposed to include a large side and what I got was 2 individual sides. I think these folks have made so much money and have so many fans that they pay no attention to anything ele but the ribs. My advice? Order the ribs and skip the sides!

This place is BOMB.. Im actually going there right now after this review.. HUGE portions..  If you go during dinner time, expect a line around the corner but I always call in my order to go and get my food within 5 minutes after I arrive. I used to always get the BBQ broham sandwich with small fries.. Can never finish it.. I tried another thing on the menu 2 days ago.. The baby back rib tickler. comes with 3 ribs. cole slaw and fries. and 2 onion rings.. It was priced $6.95.. I thought ok . has a little bit of everything but not that much food.. Nope... It was another massive plate for a small price.. Ive never ordered the higher priced menu items that go for about $17 bucks.. I could imagine its at least a meal for 2 maybe 3 people..alright.. tired of thinking about the food and taste.. Time to head on over there.. Might try something different again..

Ahh sorry dude, Texas still does it better. But I had to try Phil's out! I recommend the onion rings, RIBS RIBS RIBS and maybe occasionally the mac salad. We ordered: * The best of both worlds (chick-less & w/ ribs) w/ side of corn: The ribs were really delicious! They fell off the bone and the meat wasn't tough or fatty. The bone-less chicken was just alright. I didn't' really like the BBQ sauce too much and the chicken could have been less dry. The corn was a big ear of corn! I was expecting a little portion of it! I felt like I was at the fair. There was a little sauce carousel w/ cajun seasoning and it came with butter. *Large onion rings: Onion to batter ratio was PERFECT. They were crispy and the onion never slid out of the casing (personal onion ring eating peeve). Came with a side of ranch. Doesn't taste as good the next day so make sure you finish it all! *Mac salad: my friend got a side of the macaroni. I usually don't like macaroni salad but I liked the celery in it which gave it a nice refreshing crunch. And they don't use your typical elbow macaroni! Yay! *Fries: reminded me of wing stop fries. I love fries so I don't have any complaints here. *Pulled pork sandwich: There was a LOT of pulled pork in this bad boy. I liked that the cole slaw provided a nice tangy textural difference. Next time, I'm getting it in the sandwich (as opposed to on the side). The slaw wasn't too bad!   Would I come here again? If I'm in the area I guess.

Phil's BBQ is amazing. The lines may seem long but it goes by pretty quick, and they give you samples of their onion rings while you wait. I am not a big fan of ribs, but the beef ribs were fall apart tender and packed with flavor. I also tried the coleslaw, potato salad, and french fries. They were prepared well without being drenched in mayo and the potato salad is just perfect. The employees there are super friendly and it's just a great place to enjoy food with friends and family.

First time there last night! It was SOOO GOOD! I had the ribs and chicken plate with macaroni salad and cole slaw. NOTHING tasted out of place. I ordered the cheeseburger for my kids, took a bite and was wow'd! It was so fresh! Husband ordered the El Toro. That was amazing too! So much smoky flavor! And lets not forget about the onion rings... OMG! You have to try them... CLEANLINESS ABOUNDS!! Hand sanitizer at the entrance. There are hand washing stations outside of the bathrooms! GENIUS! And the best part is there is an arm hook to open the bathroom door from the inside, so you don't germ up your hands all over again after using the "turlets"! More businesses need to incorporate that arm hook! We will be back many, many times I predict! So worth it!

Shared a full rack baby back ribs dinner with a friend and to my surprised I was pretty satisfied. They do not skimp out on the meat! I heard so many things about this place before coming that I thought it was being overhyped, but Phil's did not let me down! Didn't get to try all the sides, but the fries and the onion rings were perfect compliments to the ribs. If you're in SD anytime, this is one place you should definitely give a try.

After much talk from friends raving about this place for months and almost years, I finally got too jealous and had to come here.  We made a trip down here and grabbed lunch on the way to a day in San Diego.  I was forewarned by friends that the line will be long, but they also gave me a tip to go straight to the bar area to the left of the lines...the tables are first come first serve basis but the bartender will take your food order right away.  When we drove up to it, holy crap, it was almost 130pm and yes the line wrapped around the place.  Is it that good?!  And thank goodness for the tip because I did not want to wait in that line.  I happily walked by all of this and luckily found two spots at the bar.  Yes..my mouth was already watering, it smelled so good.  The place was packed! The bartender was super busy but he was very nice and attentive.  He knew who walked up, needed to order, asked about drink refills, he was all over the place..he was good.  I was impressed.  He took our drink orders right away, then our food order.  The menu is not too expansive, I wish they had brisket or pulled pork on its own, more meat varieties since I'm such a meat eater, but I guess the ribs will do.  :) I ordered the half rack baby back ribs and an order of onion rings.  I was hesitant about ribs because I have never eaten ribs anywhere else that Ive loved.  My favorite is from Houstons.  Their ribs are deliciously fall off the bone.  YUmmmmmmm...and yes, I know it's not the most sophisticated place but I grew up on Tony Roma's hahah, and I do like their ribs.  But I was excited to try someone else's ribs! The half rack was huge, more than i can handle.  It's about 6-7 ribs and I ate three.  They were definitely meaty and pretty tender.  The sauce isn't anything too original but pretty good.  The ribs were definitely enjoyed.  MMMMMMMM....the onions were crispy and huge.  Loved those.  I would definitely come back to satisfy my craving for ribs, but maybe after Houstons hahahah...mmmmm.....great stop for a trip to San Diego!

There's a reason why this place currently has 2553 comments and STILL is 4.5 stars.  Everyone is going to comment on how great the food is, so let me just give you MY preference. Story time... I bring a friend who had yet to try Phil's, along with a few other friends who HAD tried Phil's.  They LOVE the pork ribs (with just cause); however, the beef ribs here are AMAZING (X infinity).  So when my friend asks what to get, I immediately tell him to avoid the chicken (which I consider to be kind of dry) and to get the beef ribs!  But my other friends trick him into getting the pork ribs.  Halfway through our meal, I offer a beef rib to my friend, just because I feel bad for him.  As he takes his first bite, he immediately says, "I should have got the beef ribs." Not saying that it's for everyone, but THEY ARE AMAZING!!!!!!  but then again, you just can't seem to go wrong here.  Even all the sides are good here.  and with every table provided with Frank's hot sauce.  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmm..   Sad part is the WAIT, also, the WEIGHT!!!  haha :P

The best plate here, Beef Rib dinner (3) is more than enough even though they offer (5), which is A LOT and have to be extremly HUNGRY!! The onion rings are also the best and well worth the wait!

Yum, yum, yum. Just remembering my rib tickler (I prefer beef) makes me happy.  The rib tickler is the perfect amount of food: 1 hearty beef rib, generous helping of french fries, coleslaw and a couple of delightful onion rings. My only two gripes are the insanely long lines to eat in-house and sometimes the beef rib can be a lot more bone than meat.

get there early - we went there for lunch last saturday and when we arrived 5 minutes before they opened, there was already a long line of people waiting.  it was SOOOO worth the wait though :-) we ordered ribs and chicken platters( with onion rings, french fries, baked beans, macaroni salad and potato salad) and they were all good.  the pork ribs were so tender that the meat falls right off the bone.  the chicken was very good and tasty.   their platters are big enough to share! we'll be back the next time we're in san diego!

This is my favorite BBQ place of all time. I've been to quite a few BBQ places in the west, but Phil's is by far the best. The line scared me at first, but it was definitely worth the wait. You also just have to be smart about it, like anything. Obviously if you go around dinner time on a Friday or Saturday, there is going to be a HUGE wait. But, duh people! Its common sense! The baby back ribs are delicious. The corn on the cob is sweet and the homemade onion rings rock. Oh and the customer service is awesome too! I don't live in San Diego, but I will be driving back soon to get some Phil's.

First, I am a foodie.  Second, I am a beef-loving Texan.  We passed by this place last night and there was a two hour wait out the door. I then checked out the reviews online and was interested.  We went by for lunch and got a table in 10 minutes. GREAT food. I got the Toro Sandwich (tri-tip).  We got ribs, onion rings (HUGE, YUM!), fries (excellent), pulled pork and chicken. It was all good. Noisy and a bit chaotic, but the food is very memorable and a bargain for the size of the plates.

Phil's effin rocks! Before Phil's I couldn't (or wouldn't) eat meat on a bone. Then, after trying Phil's, I fell in love with ribs! People who know me couldn't believe it. I actually thought about getting an "I heart ribs" shirt after eating here. No kidding! I'm also not really a beer drinker but holy crap, put their ribs together with a tasty glass of cold beer while sitting at the bar and I'm in heaven. This place is crazy busy whenever we go on the weekends. The line is literally wrapped around the corner. It's. That. Good. I usually get the ribs and chick-less dinner which is ribs and some delicious, mouth-watering chunks of chicken. All smothered in that wonderful bbq sauce! It comes with 2 sides and all of their sides are yummy! I like the fries and slaw, but they have others to choose from. As other people have pointed out, don't wear white on your trip to Phil's. It won't be white when you leave. This place is great! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Go, check it out, it's that good. You'll thank me afterward!

Pulled pork sandwhich is so good.  Don't mess with the Broham!  Not a big fan of coleslaw but even that was good too.  Only things is there's bound to be a long wait which is why I can't give them 5 stars.  Be smart, call ahead and skip the wait.  Love BBQ?  You'll love this place.

something useful: long lines but quick turnaround and heat lamps in the waiting area forget the chicken (breast really dry), get the full bbq back back ribs with cole slaw.  the ribs were smoked so much that there is kinda too much char on the skin (hence the 4/5 stars).  Taste wise it's absolutely the most tender, savory meat combined with the super tangy bbq sauce to make this a must try when in SD.  another reason why the ribs is better than the chicken is cuz the char on the ribs you can lightly wipe away while the char on the chicken is stuck on the skin, harder to wipe out. food this rich and good should be eaten once every month or two (too unhealthy, but too good).

The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because its unbearable to eat at this place.  I only order it to go now, and luckily I live nearby.  If you have to come from far and eat in the restaurant, be prepared to stand in line for over an hour.  Brutal.  But, the food is obviously top-shelf if so many people are willing to wait that long.  If you can do to-go, its a win-win.  No hassle with the mob and you still get your bomb grub.

I HATE standing in line like cattle for anything! I definitely don't want to do it for dinner. That being said, the food is VERY good for BBQ in California. A couple of ways to avoid the line, eat at the bar the other order it to go. The prices are reasonable obviously by the size of the lines.  Give yourself and your party 45 minutes to get from the back of the line to where you order. You won't be disappointed. Cheers!

I love this place! When I was in England for a year I would dream about this place and its yummy ribs!..lol My favorite is their baby back ribs they are so tender and yummy they just melt in your mouth! I love the bbq sauce to, its got some tang and spice to it which kicks up the flavor of the meat. The fries taste so fresh and are soft and fluffy and are best when you dip them in the bbq sauce. The onion rings here are amazing too! They are about the size of your hand and the batter has a good mix of flavors that go well with the ranch dipping sauce! When you come on a weekend night be prepared to wait awhile. If you don't want to wait in a long line then go to Phil's around 1pm after the lunch rush because then you get right in. Tonight the line was out the door and around the building which actually is not unusual for this place, but the line moves pretty fast and we only ended up waiting about 45 mins. The wait was well worth it!

Best BBQ I've had, hands down. No where else in San Diego can you get food that simply tastes this good. I've waited in line for an hour and a half before for some ribs and I'll gladly do it again. Prices are reasonable, atmosphere and staff is top-notch, their sauce is amazing (and available at Costco), and food is incredible. I would vote that their baby back ribs and the El Toro burger are the best things on the menu (although their beefy ribs are incredibly tender). Love their corn on the cob too, and their onion rings are huge and delicious (i'm not normally a fan). There is a reason that this place was featured on Man vs. Food!

I am a BBQ snob. Been having BBQ (Texas style) since I was barely able to stand on my own. I've had it all over California, and from places in-between Florida and California. Phil's is hands down one of the best. For me, it's all about the sauce. I judge places by their sauce (and Mexican restaurants by their sauce and salsa). The meat at Phil's is unbelievable but the sauce is what takes this place over the top. The beans are awesome, the coleslaw (another thing that makes or breaks a place for me) is fantastic and I just can't get enough of Phil's. The only downside, is the line outside and how long it takes to get in the place. I don't go there often enough because I hate the line and waiting so long to get in. But, if you plan right, you can organize your trip there at hopefully a time when you're in-between crowds.

So had to try this place cause look at the reviews!  It was very good.  Wait in line for 2 hours great?  Nahhhhh.  We ordered the baby back ribs, they were very good.  Tri tip sandwich was good.  They slice the meat really thin and I like that and the bbq sauce is good.  Onion rings were bomb diggity.  They really don't have any desserts.  I think my beef with it (no pun intended) is that the line was really long, it cost us 80 bucks for 4 people and then we had to find our own table and get our own drinks.  It's too much work especially when you have kids!  For an $80 dinner, I want to be waited on.

Really? "Top 10 BBQ restaurants" nationwide? No chance.  It's not bad, just nothing to write home about. Not worth the wrap-around-the-building wait.  Also, I find the service model a bit frustrating: you wait forever to get into the restaurant, order at a counter and your food is available almost instantly.  It's not a real "dining out" experience.

I would highly recommend to order the dinner meal. So chicken and ribs and 2 side orders that is only worth $13? I think... yeah that is right! So come here and eat some BBQ!

Wow to the wow.  Phil's BBQ is everything you could want in a BBQ place. Logistics first, then food. Yes, the line is LONG.  But it actually moves.  I waited in line for about an hour, which is about the same wait time as a ride at Disneyland.  But, honestly, the line is constantly moving, and by the time you get to the front, it isn't too difficult to find a seat (then again, I went with a party of 2).  It definitely beats signing your name on a list and waiting to be called.  Your eye is always on the prize, which makes it a pretty encouraging wait. What's great about this place is that they don't only serve great food but great customer service.  During my wait in line, the manager and maybe one or two other workers walked up and down the line to chat with the customers, to see if it was anyone's first time, and to see if anyone needed information on the restaurant or the menu items.  I found this to be a nice touch considering I've waited for hours for a restaurant in the past and have always felt like the workers are on another planet until you are called and seated.  As you get closer to the entrance, there is a sign that reads "Before ya start Yelp'n Let us start Help'n."  This sign says it all--this place wants your experience to be the best.  And it really was.  By the time we got to the front of the line, we were extremely haggered from hunger and our long day at Sea World.  But everyone in the restaurant had nothing but smiles on their faces, from the hostess to the manager to the cashier to the bus boys.  I appreciate great customer service because I know how hard it can be to offer it, especially when things get busy and stressful.  The manager even did me a huge favor and helped me out when I forgot to order a drink.  Best customer service I've had in a long time, hands down. Now on to the main event...we ordered the Pork Baby Back Rib Dinner with fries and potato salad, a small order of Onion Rings, and the BBQ Broham (pulled pork) sandwich and split it between two people.  My eyes oogled and oggled when I saw the food.  The portions are HUGE.  Just looking at the food made my mouth water.  Then, I took my first bite out of that huge onion ring and couldn't believe what I had just eaten.  The crisp batter is unlike anything I have ever tasted.  Then, I dipped the onion ring in the buttermilk sauce and wanted to DIE.  I was in HEAVEN.  I have never tasted an onion ring that was that good!  I took a fork and ate a piece of the pulled pork sandwich and stopped chewing.  The meat was soft and the sauce was unbelievable.  I wanted to dig right into the ribs.  Just as I had expected--soft, tender meat right off the bone and a semi-spicy, semi-sweet BBQ sauce that did the already amazing meat some extra wonders.  The potato salad even impressed me--herby and potato-salad-y without surprisingly overdoing it and without any of potato salad's worst attributes.  To be honest, I didn't get to try the fries or much of the sandwich while they were fresh--I filled up too fast (probably because I was tired and devoured the food a little too quickly).  But eating the sandwich as a leftover was a joy, which is hard to say for most leftovers.  The pulled BBQ pork is placed on top of a bed of coleslaw (which I usually don't like by the way).  Even as a leftover, the combination of the two was so delicious; I can only imagine what it would have tasted like fresh. This is probably the longest review I have ever written on Yelp, but it was well worth my time (as was the line at Phil's).  If you're ever in the SD area, check it out and don't be afraid of the line!  It will definitely blow your mind. Thanks for the great experience and the great food!

Okay, so I have been to Kansas,TN and Texas for some great BBQ but this place owns it! Who would have known that a place down on Sports Arena would have such succulent, tender, juicy BBQ? The sauce is great. I had the baby backs and a friend had the pulled pork and always fantastic. Busy - so if you are going for a quick lunch forget it. The line is all the way outside. I gave it only 4 stars cuz I was not crazy about the sides. The fries were nothing special and the beans and slaw were okay.

The food is excellent.  I don't like their sauce though.  It's a bit too "tangy/bitter"  I prefer Baby Back Jack's sauce better because it's a little sweeter.   The meat is awesome because everything is so soft and tender.  You can peel the meat off with a fork!  I have tried the beef, baby back ribs and chicken and they all were really good.  I have to admit that the beef ribs are better than the baby back ribs. The service is great.  They got a lot of people on their staff.  One drawback:  the long line.  Expect to wait 20-40 minutes for dinner.  The environment is also kind of loud if that's not your thing. You should totally go here.

A family member took us here, and we've been fans since! The ribs are fall-off-the-bone good here, with that authentic taste of BBQ.  Portions are pretty good, but I always leave stuffed.  The place gets packed, so I do recommend calling in your order prior to you heading out.  By the time you get there, all you have to do find a table (although I admit, that can get near impossible at the wrong time!). Is it worth the drive out to San Diego from where I live?  Maybe not.  But it is a guaranteed stop when we're in town.  If I lived closer, I would definitely be a regular!

Phil's BBQ is definitely one of the better barbecued foods I've had in a while.  I ordered the chicken tickler because I didn't want a huge portion, and it wasn't.  It was a good for one, with some leftover fries.   The chicken was a little over-cooked to me.  It wasn't tender enough, it tasted a little like when you cook frozen chicken, the overly-soft-crumbles-and-falls-apart-after-one-bit kind of texture, but that's probably because I'm so used to eating fresh chicken.  The taste was nice though, and it smelled amazing, even though it was to-go. :)   The onion rings were HUGE, onion-to-batter ratio was good, not overly batter-y.  The fries were good as well, even after they cooled down a bit, they were still good. :)   I think their ribs are better, they're probably better at cooking ribs than they are chicken.  So my suggestion, order a slab of ribs, they're a lot more tasty and when you're going for BBQ, definitely a treat!
###Jeff B.	Petaluma, CA	2009-07-18	5.0	38	52	null	null	0	0	Useful  	Funny  	Cool  	
Huge Tip: Call the order in and eat it somewhere else. I'm too impatient to wait 30-40 minutes for my food. The most amazing thing besides the food is how friendly the staff is even when they are packed and busy from open to close. I have a special assistance dog and have never had problems bring my dog in, and they hook me up with bones all the time. Another Tip: This place is known for its ribs, so you should be getting those, especially if it is your first time. And the french fries are the best side as far as amount of food so the full rack (beef or pork) with fries is your best combo. Do I really need to say anymore? Everyone else already killed it in reviewing this place. You can small the goodness from a mile away, and I am not exaggerating either. That is why they moved, people got tired of smelling amazing BBQ 24 hours a day, probably because it made them hungry all the time.

I could have sworn I already wrote a review for this place, since this is after all one of my favorite places in San Diego. The barbeque is legit.  I think supposedly their bbq broham sandwich is supposed to be the item that they are known for.  I almost never get that though because their ribs and chicken are so good that I will exclusively get the ribs and chicken combo. Ribs - whether you get baby back pork ribs or beefy ribs they are always cooked to perfection.  I dont think I ever had a time where my ribs were too dry or overcooked.   Chicken - the chicken is delicious.  Many chicken places have issues with cooking chicken and they come out dry.  I understand that because I can never cook a chicken at home that is not dry.  But Phils has apparently mastered the art of cooking chicken because it always comes out moist and perfect.  The chickless (boneless chicken), on the other hand, almost always comes out dry, do not get that. BBQ sauce - whatever they do to make their secret recipe, o man it is the best BBQ sauce ever.  Just the perfect amount of tangy-ness so that it isnt over powering. Finally, sides - when you order, get the macaroni salad.  It is the best macaroni salad out there.  The fries are good too, but the Mac Salad is where its at.  Usually you can order both so this is not a major concern.

I am a big fan of BBQ Ribs and this place is the best I've had. For comparison in Southern California, I've tried Dinah's, Robin's in Rosemead, Lucille BBQ, Chicago Ribs, Tony Roma's, and Baby Blues. Phil's is to me the best in Southen California. We came at 3:30 PM on Saturday and the line went all the way to the parking lot.  Same long line when I tried Phil's for the first time last year. So I decided to come back the next day  (Sunday at 11:30) and the line was much shorter. Menu is quite simple: baby back ribs, beef ribs, bbq chickens, and pull porks. You can order each meat as dinner (includes 2 small sides or one large side) or ala carte. The full slab baby back ribs dinner cost $18.95 or $16.95 for the ala carte.

BABY BACK RIBS all the way baby~~~ all i gotta say is, best BBQ in town. i love how the meat just falls off the bone. delicious goodness. almost too good. i get the half rib dinner w/a side of corn. i took my family here, my cousin, and i've gone with friends a bunch of times, the quality is always there. also, line gets pretty long sometimes, but if you have a small party, 2-4 i recommend going over to the bar, you get your food a lot faster, but Shhh..dont tell everyone or else it won't be a secret anymore. they have some pretty good beer on tap as well. their staff is super friendly and always ready to get you some more towels. btw i don't use the bibs, they're for noobs. price is definitely reasonable. will be coming here again soon! i love phils!!!

I should be embarrassed to admit this but I have tried EVERYTHING on the menu and let me tell you, Phils has got it all figured out! They have managed to make me eat things I don't usually like. In fact, the cold slaw is so amazing I order at other restaurants just to see if they can do it like Phils does (better luck on that one). My suggestions for you and a date: full baby back dinner with macaroni salad and cold slaw and a Broham (the best pulled pork sando you ever had!). Sit at the bar and wash down your tasty food with some local brews on tap. LOVE THIS PLACE!

Came here with my cousins and bf. When we got here the line was literally out the door and around the corner. I thought it was going to take forever for us to get in but my cousin assured me that it wouldn't be that long and it was worth the wait. So we stood in line for about half an hour. When we got in I understood why there was a line. Once you walk in you automatically go to the cashier and order and pay for your meal. So it's best to get a menu while in line so that you know what you want. The have a policy where you can't save or do preseating which sucks because then after paying you'll be standing around looking for an open seat. The place is really crowded and from the time we went in to the time we left, the line never seemed to die down. Now off to the food. We got 1 order of the meaty beef ribs with a small side of baked beans and potato salad. That one order was enough for the both of us with 2 left over ribs. The ribs were very meaty and the sauce was great. I would have liked it better if the ribs were completely smoked because there were a few burnt pieces and parts of the meat weren't really as juicy as I would have liked. But overall it was good BBQ. The baked beans were good because it had a little kick to it. Also tried their onion ring and it was good. Not too much batter and just the right size. I would love to come by here again if I'm ever in town. One of the best BBQ places ever.

I have to say...Phil's BBQ turned me from a non-bbq fan to a I love and crave bbq ribs.  I usually don't like the taste or smell of bbq anywhere near sandwiches and perhaps is why I stayed away from it.  But I am now forever a loyal Phil's BBQ fan.   A couple of regulars that we went with recommended splitting the ribs dinner plate for 20 for two and getting one big side dish rather than two side dishes, and they were right!  Their fries and macaroni salad were just as amazing as their ribs were.  We even used most of the fries to clean the sauce off the plate and then lick it off our fingerstips. It's usually the wait in line that kills the reviews for most restaurants, but even though there was a rather long line, it went by really fast and was worth all the anticipation.  The only thing that makes me sad is that there is no Phil's in NorCal!

I'm not a connoisseur of BBQ, not being from a BBQ state or anything, but the two meals I had there were pretty decent. There's no excuse for the line, though; the food is not spectacular.  A 45-minute wait? There's a lot of hype to go along with this place, and hats off to the marketing person who pulled that off.  I found the portions, price and food itself reasonable. Heidi is cute, too!

If I could go here every day, I would. It's that darn good, as evidenced by the line that goes around the building every day. The ribs are TO DIE FOR! They fall of the bone and the sauce is amazing. I just can't say enough good things about this place. I got all my friends addicted to it as well. You must go here and try the baby-back ribs. Ohhh and Man v. Food was just there a couple weeks ago so you KNOW it's good if it's going to be featured on tv. Go here. Do it. You won't regret it.

I absolutely love this place! The BBQ is amazing whether you're eating ribs or a pulled pork sandwich. The onion rings are also delicious. We come here for family gatherings all the time, just be sure to call ahead for big groups to reserve an outside dining area. If just stopping by for a bite to eat, the line can be rather long but don't worry it goes pretty quick. The hardest part would be finding a table after you order, so best to split up and have one person search for a table while the other orders. The service is great, the food is great, and if you don't mind a little noise then you will definitely love Phil's.

I'm proud to give Phil's 5 stars. Only once in my life have I ever not finished my food at Phil's and that was the day after I had a cardiac arrhythmia. Fuck it, I wanted Phil's. It's worth the heart block. Yes, there is a line. A line that I enjoy waiting in. Where else can you stand in line, be on a webcam, smell the finest cue this side of the Rockies and daydream about a hunk of cow covered in their sauce? Nowhere. That's where. Wonderful. Here's to many more years of business, Phil!

this review is solely for the tri tip sandwich: BEST. B.B.Q. SANDWICH. EVER. I tried the pulled pork one and I actually was not that impressed. the sauce didn't strike me as very tasty and the meat tasted a lot like pork. i think i just don't like the taste of pork really. The sauce on the tri tip was sweet and tangy and complimented the meat well. And the meat? MOIST. I'm always afraid of getting tri tip anything because it has the tendency to be dry. but not this sandwich. it wasn't even really a sandwich, but a plate of meat with a bun on top and the other half of the bun hiding under the meat and sauce. delicious. did i already say that? oh and the onion rings? bigger than the bangles on my wrists that i was wearing that day. i'd go back down to san diego just to eat there again.

Phil's got me back! Last time might have been a bad night or something.  This time around, they had just the right amount of sauce on my baby back ribs.  Ribs were juicy and soft with just the right amount of spice and sauce to it. I went with the Onion Rings instead of the usual fries and beans on the side.  Forget the other sides, the onion rings here are crazy good and dont fall apart after the first bite like some other places.   Got to give it up to the service this time around.  Everyone was extra nice today.  Well done Phil's, you made me a believer again.

Here we go, after over 1300 reviews, I too get to write a review for the best BBQ house I've ever had. I've been here 3 times, so I'm still in the experimenting phase in terms of what to order. After reading what fellow Yelpers have to say about the menu, on the third trip, I decided to order the Ribless meal. Hands down, this was my favorite thing on the menu after ordering the chicken and pork ribs twice. With the ribless meal, you get way more meat and way less mess!! I got it with fries and cole slaw. The sides were both good, but nothing to really brag about. The pork pieces were covered in a perfect amount of BBQ sauce and was tender upon first bite. The onion rings are another great thing to get on the menu. They have the perfect crunch. With ranch, they complement each other like lamb and tuna fish. :) The environment is a great atmosphere for friends to get together and have a sit down with the game on any of their many TVs up above. Of course, the worst part of the experience was the wait in line. My last visit on a Sat. night (not recommended, go on a weekday!) took almost an hour. OR maybe the waiting in line is part of the Phil's BBQ experience that should be cherished. Depends on your take of it Overall, a fine San Diego establishment that is a reason for anyone to stay in San Diego. The worst thing that can happen is if this place closes. The second worst thing that can happen...if I leave San Diego. Let me leave with a closing analogy... Phil's BBQ is to San Diego as In N Out is to the Southwestern United States.

Pound for pound the best restaurant in San Diego, for their specialty.  Just look at the line of people every time you go.  The people have spoken! I get the Beefy Ribs and Chicken with potato salad.  The BBQ sauce is excellent and the quality of the meat is top-notch.  My wife always gets the boneless chicken, which I am glad they have.  I hear the burger is killer too.  It's a great place to watch a game and take in some local beer and wine as well.  Don't wear white!!!

I wasn't expecting much when I was told we were gonna get some BarBQ while I was visiting from TX.  I had never heard of Phil's before, but I was pleasently supprised when we arrived. The meat was in large portions and covered in their signature sauce.  It can be intimidating walking in because of the large line out front, but it moved rather quickly, and there was seating available.  Very reasonable price that left me feeling like a fat kid without much of an impact on my wallet.  I have a feeling Phil's will be a regular stop each time I come to SD from now on.

Rather than rehash all the reviews, I'll just tell you a story. So, I took my friend from the midwest here, and I'd hyped it up for some time before that.  He would always say, "There ain't no good BBQ out here.  They only know how to do it in the midwest."  Finally, I got him to come down with me.  In a not-too-excited voice, he opined, "It was alright..."   Next thing I know, the next weekend, he was texting me.  "Guess where I am?" So guess where he was?  :) Just the place with the best ribs I've had!  And wow... Now they're coming to San Marcos.  I don't know how I'll handle this.  I better get a second and third job... My choice for a meal:  Full rib dinner (baby backs) with all fries underneath to soak up that BBQ sauce! Parking sucks, and the line is even worse.  I guess that's the price to pay.  If you want a short cut, call in advance, and take it outside to your car to eat.  Warning:  it's messy.

As a hardcore Man v. Food fan, after seeing this featured I knew I had to go since I was within a drive-able distance. So, a friend and I drove over 100 miles to get here (I did all the driving from Arcadia) and arrived here Saturday night at around 8:20pm. The parking lot surrounding the establishment gets filled up quickly (we saw a line that wrapped around the corner from the entrance to the side of the restaurant) but I was able to secure parking without too much trouble. Once you get out of your car you instantly get a whiff of that mesquite smoke smell emanating from Phil's. Stomachs rumbling for a taste of the real thing, we stood in line and waited over 45 minutes before being able to order. Due to the large side windows that allow you to glance into the interior and of customers gorging on their glazed ribs, and the somewhat slow-moving line, I only salivated and felt stronger hunger pangs as the line moved. The mesquite smoke smell when you get out of your car? That smell gets way more intense when you finally enter the restaurant from the front and near the ordering line. You first order your food, then you get your receipt and a "buzzer" signaling that your order is ready (which I thought was a nice touch). There are twin soda fountain machines on both sides of the restaurant and you are welcome to free re-fills for the duration of your stay. (I can't stand establishments that charge you for soda re-fills). You also need to locate your own table/booth which may prove to be a challenge, but we found a booth pretty easily (it was about 9:15pm or so by the time we ordered our food). We ordered the "El Toro" sandwich, which was tri-tip that was grilled simultaneously with their famous sauce, 3 of the beef ribs, and a full rack of baby-back ribs with corn on the cob as a side. The food came out very quickly; it didn't feel as if 3-4 minutes passed after sitting down at our booth before the buzzer rang. The staff were very friendly and helped carry the trays of glistening ribs to our booth. They also provided wet naps and plates. I ate two of the baby-rick ribs first. There's something to be said about the bbq sauce. Slightly sweet and tangy before leaving your tongue with a bit of spicy heat, it was unlike any bbq sauce I've ever had. The ribs themselves were tender and meaty and fell off the bone easily. The tri-tip sandwich was incredible. The Kaiser roll was nicely toasted but not hard to chew and it complemented the juiciness of the meat. The bbq sauce was a perfect companion to the tri-tip and the flavor was indescribably delicious. The beef ribs were only okay for me. They were very meaty and tender but I would prefer to get the baby-back ribs. I was a bit put-off that our full baby-back ribs dinner order (which comes with 2 sides or 1 large one) only came with 1 corn on the cob. I thought it would have came with two but I guess I know now for next time. The corn was pretty decent but for the money you spend it's best to get other sides with your dinner. They do thankfully take credit cards and if you can stand the wait you're in for some of the best bbq ribs around. I can easily say these were the best baby-back ribs I've ever had. For sure I'll be making another 100 mile trek on a random Saturday evening soon.

I'm not big on BBQ nor am I big on picnic tables with screaming kids and paper towels on the table instead of napkins.  In this case - the food is so good I put away my Hee-Haw hating ways (ok dirty secret-I watched it every week as a kid) and enjoyed the best BBQ on this side of the Lone Star state.   Ribs-awwesome Chicken - delicious the sauce - hmmmm The food is so good, you wont care about eating it at a picnic table and after you've spilled something on yourself or wiped your hands on your jeans you won't even notice those kids at the next table.  Just grab a beer, chill out and enjoy it.   It's perfect for a casual date or a big family gathering.  (We were celebrating Chinese New Year there of all things!).   Everyone leaves happy and stuffed - isn't that what life is all about?   Tip:  If you have a big party, make sure you tell the hostess for priority seating!

The last time my boyfriend and I were in SD, we headed to Phil's BBQ and were discouraged by the long line that wrapped around to the back of the building. "It must be worth it to stand in a line that long..." But we were so hungry so we decided we will be back another time. This weekend, my boyfriend and I took a mini-trip to SD and the first food stop? Phil's BBQ. 5 pm, Friday evening, the line was just out the door. It is counter service, so when we got to the front of the line, we were ready with our order because it breaks up into about 6 cashiers... ordered, took our pager, got our drinks, sat down and buzzzz pager went off all within a matter of 5 minutes... I hurriedly tie the bib around my neck and I dove in. Bib is optional. I wore white. We ordered chicken and ribs. Sides: sweet baked beans, potato salad, fries and baked potato. The meat is so tender, so juicy, so flavorful. The sauce is sweet and tangy with a tiny tiny kick of spice. The baked beans were sweet and the texture was just right (not too beany, not too saucy). The potato salad was good. Tasted traditional. The fries were good. Normal fries. That BAKED POTATO WAS THE NEXT BEST THING. It was soft and warm and it melted in my mouth... it was soo good. The meal was almost perfect! Personally, I believe a slice of watermelon would have topped it off. Anyway, I was so full. I wanted to come back for Phil's BBQ for dinner the next night but the boyfriend said, "It was good babe, but we should try other foods too since we're here." Okay... :( The next next best thing (after the chicken and ribs and baked potato) was the PRICE! So damn cheap for all this delicious slathered meats. Cheap. Fast. Good. Period. Phil's BBQ. Thank you. We will be back. Soon. By the way, it would be so great if you opened one in OC or LA somewhere... it. would. be. so. great.

NOT WORTH THE WAIT, FOLKS. The food here is okay but most certainly not worth standing around for any length of time, much less OVER AN HOUR. There are lines all the time and although there is a big parking lot next to it, you can never find a spot. I know fatties from the Midwest that have eaten here and were appalled at how many people line up for the "food" at this joint...sorry, but BBQ is not a classic food for San Diego (I'd much rather stick to Mexican food). The service is decent especially in the event room next door, but other than that you might as well as just go to Joey's Smokin' BBQ where the food is just as good and there aren't lines around the block. And no, I don't work for Joey's...it's just science (and truth).

Pork Ribs are the BEST!! Boneless Chicken is pretty dry though. They have awesome fries!!!!!!!!! Definitely always need to wait in line. I suggest going on their website and ordering to go unless you want the whole experience. The line usually goes around the building. It's even longer now since they have been on the TV show Man v.

Ok, Phil's = good, tender meat in savory sauce, with plenty of sides to choose from. I had the El Toro beef sandwich with fries and potato salad. The meat and sauce was was really tasty, and it came on a huge bun. It was kind of messy to eat, so I decided to make it a fork-and-knife sort of affair. I really liked the fries and they were actually one of my favorite parts of the meal for their crispy goodness. The potato salad was lackluster, with chunks of potatoes and not much seasoning at all. Overall, though, the meal was pretty good. What wasn't so good is the wait to get in. When we arrived the line was wrapped around the corner. I saw a few people in line with chidren, and by the time they got to the door the kids were whiny and cranky.  Although the line serves to build suspense and anticipation, I didn't think the food lived up to the enormous hype. The only real selections they've got for meat is beef, pork, and chicken (ribs, beef sandwiches, chicken on the bone, and boneless chicken)... I'm used to BBQ places serving hot links and even fried fishas well and I was disappointed when I arrived and there weren't any.

I love this place, I think everyone does and I almost didn't review it - yet just want to affirm that it's worth the wait and sooo delicious. Rib Tickler is the so good baby back ribs that fall off the bones.   Huge onion rings can be worn as bracelets (edible ones of course!). Baked beans are great, Beef Ribs are so meaty and ohhh Tasty! Had red velvet woopie pie not sure if always on the menu yet it should be (even though I never have room for dessert afterward) but it's Good! Drinks bar I love it all different kinds of sodas, ice teas, juices waters etc!!

In all honesty I was so excited to go to this place after hearing all of the great things I have heard about Phil's, but I must say I was disappointed. I thought the bbq sauce was not very good and with the giant wait out the door maybe my expectation was too high. I really like another hidden jewel in Kearny Mesa for bbq called Abbys. In my opinion, a much better sauce, great sides, and a more intimate atmosphere.

My friends and I were in San Diego for training this past week. I remembered that Man vs Food had visited this place, so we decided to try it out. The line was out the door(we were number 20 in line), but it went quick.   3/4 of us got the El Torro(slice tri tip w/sauce on a big bun).  It was great...  Everything about it was good... The meat had a great smokey flavor to it(plus there was a ton of it), the sauce was tasty and not too overpowering, and the bun was just right.   We also split some fries(which were fine) and onion rings(which were huge and tasty).   If In San Diego, I would definitely go here again...

If you need to find the best bbq in San Diego, Phil's is most definitely the place to go to. In my previous Phil's BBQ experiences, I didn't have to wait very long because I'd come at the mere hours of 2-4pm. Last night was the first time I went to Phil's around 8pm and I sure did wait an hour in line with my boyfriend. It was his first time and obviously the long line was getting to him but I told him not to doubt their food because the wait will be worth it. I ordered a baby back full rib dinner with potato salad and fresh cut fries. He ordered a BBQ cheeseburger and a large order of the colossal onion rings. Now, I love baby back ribs very much and I've tried many baby back ribs, but they do not compare to Phil's baby back ribs. Their ribs silde off the bone and they are just too juicy. Their bbq sauce is just one of a kind. Their servings for the fries and potato salad I consider is a lot if you're going to eat the whole full rack of ribs. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger and his onion rings. The onion rings are very crunchy and huge! When we ordered the large order, we didn't think they would give us so much but it got to the point where we had to take some of it home. The staff overall are really nice and really helpful. I've noticed that they always ask if it's your first time there and really seem happy when they get first timers. Other times, they've asked me if I'd want extra bbq sauce for my ribs and willingly of course I'd say yes! At the end of the night, we both left Phil's with our onion rings, smiling faces, and full stomachs.

I've always gotten the "Best of Both" and it definitely is the best!! It comes with moist, tasty chicken and baby back ribs slathered with barbecue sauce.. mm-mm mmm! It also comes with two huge sides-- I always get the coleslaw and fries. SO GOOD! Servings are incredibly generous and service is always friendly, all for a great, affordable price!! Make sure you come at irregular eating hours though, or be prepared to wait in the never-ending line. I had to wait 2 hours on a Saturday night once. Totally worth it in the end, though!

Got take-out a couple of weeks ago and it was, as the star rating says: meh. To start on a positive note, the call to place the order was very pleasant.  The woman was very friendly and almost conversational; considering how busy the place was, she never sounded harried and i never felt rushed during the ordering process.  Not only did it make me comfortable on the phone, it also made me confident the the order was taken completely and correctly and not just scribbled on a bbq sauce-stained napkin that happened to be by the phone. I got the "chick tickler" -- which sounds vaguely dirty *giggle*.  It was served in a standard 3-compartment foam take-out container.   One small compartment contained exactly 5 small chunks of admittedly tender chicken drowning in bbq sauce. The sauce is *ok* but has a heavy synthetic taste to it.  The heat of it was interesting and unexpected, but was overwhelmed by smoke flavoring.  By the line of people waiting to be seated that wrapped almost clear around the building, I'm wondering if they put trace amounts of cocaine in the sauce to keep people coming back for more, but I certainly wouldn't stand in line for hours on end to have it again. The other small compartment was filled with a fair-sized portion of slaw (can't comment on it cuz I'm not a fan of slaw so I didn't eat it). The third and largest compartment was absolutely packed full of limp, flavorless fries.  It's bad enough they were almost inedible, but the portion size being over 5 times the amount of the chicken was an extra slap in the face.  On top of the fries were two large onion rings; easily the best part of the meal.  The breading is a bit over-done, but the onion inside is substantial enough to balance the breading.  I didn't feel I was biting into a ring of deep fried air like a lot of restaurants make them. This is actually the second time I've had food at Phil's; the first time I'd gone with a group of friends and ate in the dining room.  I wasn't terribly hungry, so I think I'd just gotten an order of onion rings.  I do definitely remember a very friendly and gregarious woman who walked around talking with everyone and making sure people were enjoying their meals.  I believe she may have even been the owner, which I thought was a really nice touch.   Sadly, I don't think I will be seeing her smiling face again because I can't imagine waiting in the insane lines for the same type of food I'd taken home.

Best BBQ in San Diego!!! Hands down! I only ever order the dinner plate with baby back ribs, potato salad AND macaroni salad... with ONION RINGS! So I can't rate anything else... but what I order is perfect, so why try anything else?? The large plate of onion rings is enough for 4 to share if everyone has their own food, and probably good for 2 if you share a dinner plate with your friend/significant other. Although I've only ever had the ribs, I hear good things about the El Toro sandwich. And I've seen the monstrosity! It has so much meat that it overflows... definitely a great portion for its price! The only downside is the possibility of a long wait, but if you don't mind eating at random hours, you can get lucky and not wait very long, or even at all!

We are from Los Angeles and we took a road trip all the way down there one Sunday afternoon just to try this place because it was recommended by Man v. Food host Adam Richman on his website. Man, was that trip worth it.  We have never, I repeat, NEVER, had such good BBQ food.  My boyfriend and his buddy are still saying how we need to take a trip down to our "Mecca". I don't know what you do to your food, but the drive all the way down to San Diego from Los Angeles and the over an hour wait in the line was all worth it...once we tasted the food we understood why there was a line. The portions for the price are a huge value.  We had all gotten the BBQ Broham (Pulled Pork) sandwich (they did not skimp on any meat), shared a huge plate of Fresh Cut Fries (and I do mean huge) and the Ginormous Onion Rings (biggest rings I've ever seen), and then ordered a Half Chicken Only (All White) to go. We loved it all and were in hog heaven...can't wait to go again to try more items.

It' s in the magical sauce! Met Phil tonight and that man is as sweet as can be. I have only been to Phils twice and both times have been a wonderful experience. I ordered from the best of both worlds and that is no lie. I had the beef rib & chicken dinner with a side of baked beans and macaroni salad. I love the fries here but decided to try something else. I don't know what Phil does to those beef ribs but they are truly way more wonderful then the baby back I know most would disagree but the super meaty rib meat came right off the bone and was super succulent. I have never had a beef rib that great in my LIFE!! I didn't get to taste my chicken that looked superb because I was done after finishing both super tasty sides and my 2 beef ribs. Organic tropical ice tea is the BEES KNEES!! I discovered a new trick tonight, if you could find a stool at the bar you can order without the wait of the long line for the dining area although it does go fast. Went in and we sat right away didn't have to wait more then 10 mins before we got our food. Our waiter was fast and made sure we had everything we needed. I can't wait for the new opening on Grand ave.

My mouth is just watering thinking of their ribs right now. The 2hr wait is worth it. Bring a snack stupid.. if you're hungry and can't wait the wait... then get out of line or dont come. Its expected to wait a long time before actually sitting. However, they are VERY organized about it. Phil (well, a person that worked there) came up to my party (15 people) and asked how many we had and had our table ready when we all finished ordering. Ive noticed there is NO wait after a certain time. I now wait till that time to go so i can just walk in... munch... and boogie happy and full :)

Phil's is a definite local favorite.  We normally stop here before we go to the Sports Arena.  This last time, was Black Friday, we went in the evening and waited about 30 minutes.  They also have a bar, outdoor patio and do phone orders. Usually we each get a sandwich but that has been way too much so we shared a chicken BBQ sandwich and large order of onion rings.  We should have gotten the small because we couldn't eat it all!  I ask for the BBQ sauce on the side because there is usually too much on the sandwich for me.   You have to stop by Phil's (http://www.philsbbq.net/) - be sure to check their day's open/times before going!

Wow!  I had been wanting ribs for awhile and the only place that I can even think that is worth the money is Phil's. I went here this afternoon and it was just so great I had to share on Yelp. I like beef ribs and not many places have them, or if they do they just don't taste good.  At Phil's the beef ribs are amazing.  The meat, the sauce-everything!  My husband eats pork ribs and he says the same thing.  Completely tender and tasty. Lots of meat on the bones.   The sides are yummy too-baked potato, corn on the cobb, cole slaw, potato salad.   The only downside is that it can be a long wait to get in. So much so that I don't go there when it's typical dinner hour.  But...they have a live cam on their website, where you can see how long the line is.  The line goes pretty quickly though, so even if it's outside, you may not have to wait for too long. They aren't open for a couple weeks during the Christmas and New Year times, which doesn't make sense to me (although I saw a sign that their new San Marcos location will be open). The best! I can't think of a better place to go for ribs and can't wait for the next time I go!

Get the El Toro!  Everything lived up to the Phil's BBQ hype.  I highly recommend eating at the bar.  You can walk right in, without waiting in line and get your order in more quickly.  Everything, from the meat, to the fries, to the DELICIOUS onion rings were fantastic.  I don't about the appetites of others, but this is a single meal for the entire day.  Mmm... We also noticed that the crowd dies down around 2:30, if you are one who likes to avoid crowds.

Good "own backyard BBQ party" kind of BBQ... ^^ It's so popular you have to stay in line, and I mean a really long one, just to order your food.  It's set up kind of like in a fast-food way... you stay in line, order from the cashier, pay, then get seated and wait for the buzz to pick up your food... I like their pork ribs (baby back ribs)... it's juicy enough for me... ^^  One time the BBQ sauce tasted a bit too sour to my liking for some reason, but the rest were good... the side dishes were meh, not something to rave about... ^^ The onion rings were okay, though...^^  The portion is very, very big for a half rack, I always make half of it to-go... hahaha... *speaking from a girl's perspective, guys might find the portion just right...hahaha...* Be prepared to spend around $15-20/person.... unless you share.. ^^

Never really understood the concept of "the meat just falls off the bones" until I went to Phil's BBQ and tried their baby back ribs. THANKS GUYS! THAT KIND OF CHANGED MY WORLD. But in all honesty, Phil's has the BEST baby back rib's I've ever had. The line can get long at times, but once you get a whiff of that smoky bbq aroma you are trapped. TRAPPED I TELL YOU. Like a moth to a flame. Except instead of burning up, the moth is treated to a really nice meal. The service is ALWAYS great. Everyone that works there is SO NICE. Prices are just right. GAH! Phil's is overall an AWESOME PLACE. GAH! I"M NAMING MY SON PHIL OK BYE

OH MY. I don't even know how to explain my love for Phil's BBQ! This is some legit BBQ! And if my mom likes it (she's not a BBQ person), then this is good! I loveeee the atmosphere of the place. It's like shakey's like....but better. The seating is super cool and comfortable and the place is a all happy and lively. I love it! First off, my family got there pretty early, at around 5:30, so we beat the crowd! YAY! Anyways, we ordered a rack of ribs with 2 sides (fries and macaroni salad), and a turkey BBQ burger. After our food was ready, we ate and realized we wanted more. It was just that good. So we ordered another rack of ribs and a small side of their COLOSSAL onion rings. oh man, THOSE ONION RINGS ARE OH SO GOOD Man, my mom and I loved it; it was really good. I can't wait til the next time I'm back in SD, cause this place is so worth it!

Mmmmm Phil's BBQ.  So freakin good.  The baby back ribs are to die for...The meat is so tender it just falls off the bone.  And it is lathered in BBQ sauce.   The portions here are HUGE!   Normally when you order a half order of baby back ribs you get maybe 5 ribs and are usually still hungry.  Well not at Phils!  When I picked up my order I was like...Holy Shinigans!!! This is huge.  It comes with two sides. I usually choose.  Corn on the cob...yum and the BBQ baked beans.  The fries are good too.  You get a whole bunch of them.  They don't mess around here. I also tried the regular ribs and they were ok.  I like the baby back ribs better. Anyway, if you want to eat here come early like at 5...because the line to eat here gets LONG.  Sometimes you have to wait an hour. If you are too hungry and can't wait... order it togo and eat it at home.  This way you skip the line and it tastes just as good. Phil's BBQ....mmm...so so good!

Great Great Food!... Im not gonna take away just because you cant find parking sometimes, there is a long line, and you have to wait. Im rating the food not the wait and parking. Sure its a struggle to find parking, but thats just part of it, once your out of your car you smell them ribs and you head to the line. As you wait you mouth waters and as you get closer, you find out that line is a good thing. Why? well because the have menus outside so you get time to figure out what you want haha. Honestly, its well worth it, finger licking good ribs, delicious chicken, and mouth watering sandwiches. The sides a great too very tasty. Even though there is a line service is usually pretty quick and the staff is real friendly. Honestly, i have never waited more than 40 mins 1 hour tops.  I usually go with a group so time passes pretty quick chatting outside. 1 hour is fine for me especially if youve never been their or are with people who have never been their. If you really dont wanna wait, you can always call in and order out. Dont be afraid the line and the wait, this place is guuuuoood!

Parking isn't too hard to find. The wait is usually around 20-40 minutes. If you check the website, there's a camera that's pointed at the line, and you can tell how long you're going to have to wait. This place is known for their ribs, so I'd suggest you go for the pork or beef ribs, and skip out on the chicken and sandwiches. In my opinion, the chicken is too dry, and the sandwiches don't satisfy. I usually get the half rack of baby back ribs, with a side of macaroni salad and french fries, but if I'm not that hungry, I get the baby back rib sampler.

One of my friends recommended me this place to eat at. We were heading to Sorrento Parkway to pick up some things and we decided to head to Phil's BBq and oh my freaken god the line was extremely long and i didn't want to wait. I guess i forced my myself to wait in the line and it all paid off in the end. The bbq was extremely delicious and the sides were just a bonus to the bbq. The price for ribs is a lot, but you get what you pay for and all i can say now I WANT MORE!

My wife and I where visiting her son in the Navy.  They said before we left we had to try Phil's BBQ.  When I got there and saw the line wrapped around the building I was not overly eager to wait.  After a bit of convincing I agreed to get in line, and boy am I glad we did! The line greater, Tamie, was a bundle of welcome energy that saw fit to be sure we meet Phil and his wonderful mother.  A quick photo and conversation about both our home state, Ohio (north east Ohio to be more specific), we ordered some grub.  The beef ribs where outstanding but the babyback ribs where simply delicious. We washed our tasty treats down with a pitcher of Stella and enjoyed great conversation with two of the Navy's finest (names withheld for nation security).  A special thank you to Phil, his mother and Tamie - you guys rock!

This was my first time trying Phil's and I had a unique, but good, experience. The talk about the lines were correct. When I arrived, the line was to the parking lot. I would highly recommend calling in your order. I called in my order. They told me to pick it up anytime I wanted to. I was perplexed so I inquired about it. Turns out they don't prepare you food until you arrive, so it's fresh right out of the batch. There was a separate line for call in orders and there was no one in that line when I arrived. I was able to go straight to the counter with no wait. I can't comment on the dine in experience as my order was to-go. But the dining area was big and loud with all the people there. I ordered the baby back ribs and chicken dinner and it was probably the best BBQ I had ordering from a restaurant. Most restaurant BBQs are dry and have no flavor. The ribs were juicy and flavorful. They gave me a chicken breast and I was afraid it would be dry as sand, but it too was juicy and not overcooked. The cooks at Phil's definitely know how to cook BBQ. If I lived in San Diego, I would be going there almost every day.

Not the best BBQ I've ever had, but it's still tasty. I have no idea why the line is so long, I just don't think the food justifies a two hour line. So if you're in the mood, call it in and get it to go. I waited about 10 minutes after I got there and was laughing at everyone in the line as I drove off :)

This is probably the best bbq i've had... just minus one star for the wait... i got there at 4:45 and didnt get to order til 615.  My friend and I sat down at a table and a lady told me we couldn't sit there cuz it was for large parties. So I went to get my food and asked the guy where we could sit. After a few minutes we ended up where we sat in the beginning...

Came here again with a big group of people, but it didn't take that long for us to make it inside the restaurant. Since it was a hot day, they even had water for people who were waiting in line. We were accommodated to sit outside in the patio area. I ordered the El Toro sandwich and it was delicious! The best tri tip sandwich that I ever had!! The tri tip is barbecued to perfection. The tri tip is smothered in bbq sauce and packed in between the buns. I do warn you that it is a messy sandwich to eat, but boy is it worth it!!!

This place is amazing. Anyone rating this place less than 5 stars is crazy. BBQ pork and beef ribs are always cooked perfectly and fall completely off the bone. Their sandwiches are delicious, and the rolls they come on are very good. All of the sides are very good as well. I definitely recommend the baby back ribs and chicken dinner. It comes with more than enough food for a very good price. I have eaten at Phil's BBQ several times and it has never failed to disappoint. The food and service are A+. The only bad thing about Phil's are the long lines, but it is worth the wait.  There is even a camera online where you can check the line. If you are in San Diego or San Marcos and want some great BBQ then this is the place.

I did not get a chance to eat in the restaurant, but had the pleasure of having take-out.  My family has always raved about this place and I was overly curious.  I let them do the ordering: ribs, pulled pork sandwich, onion rings, potato salad, and coleslaw.  Yum, yum, yum!  The ribs had fall-off-the-bone meat -- perhaps the best ribs I've ever eaten!  I enjoyed the onion rings greatly because the shell was crispy and thick -- nothing irks me more than an onion ring that falls apart because the onion to batter ratio is off.  Potato salad was also really delicious.  Next time, I will make a trip to the actual establishment.  This place truly deserves the reputation of serving the best BBQ in SD!

My first time wasn't all that great but after that I was hooked! ;) I always order the baby back rib tickler which comes with baby back ribs, fries and coleslaw for $6.95. Always satisfying unlike other places where you try something really good, come back to try it again & come to find it wasn't as good as the first time. It's something about their special BBQ sauce that makes it taste awesome. It's so good that Costco is now selling Phil's BBQ sauce in them ketchup looking containers. It doesn't taste exactly the same but it's still bomb.

First of all, I don't give that many 5 stars. I am also not a big BBQ fan like my husband, but I was very impressed with almost everything here.  The lines are always wrapped around the corner, but that's a good sign for a restaurant. The Broham sandwich is a pulled-pork sandwich topped with coleslaw.  They are not cheap with their meat...the meat is piled high. BBQ sauce is great, they actually have it bottled at Costco. The onion rings are super crunchy, if you eat it there or else it will get soggy if you bring it home. The beef ribs are huge and amazing! This is a must try place if you're visiting San Diego.

Came here because everyone that I know raves about it.  Not really a big fan of sauce based BBQ but that being said I can still enjoy it.  Phil's is a sauced based BBQ place that has a bad sauce.  For me that's lose lose.  There is one key tell that is the easiest thing in the world to tell if something is good BBQ.  Can you smell it, that is key.  If you cannot smell the smokey, meaty deliciousness then don't bother.  I knew better but went with my football team from church and as it was tradition I didn't want to complain.  So here's my complaint: BBQ is meant to be a matter of patience in the cooking process.  Their pulled pork was not smokey, not tender, kinda stringy and smothered in sauce.  Pulled pork is meant to be rubbed in spices, smoked for 10-12 hours, and served with a light touch of sauce if the consumer is the type.  The pulled pork here had no smokey flavor and texturally seemed like it had been boiled.  The chicken was tolerable since its not meant to be slow smoked, but their tri-tip/ brisket, whatever it is, is not even as good as mine when I cook at home.  The beans were muh, the sauce was like sweet and sour, and the meat was bland and stringy.  Avoid this place based on quality. The line is a different story, maybe they are good at marketing, but the quality needs to be there for this line to make sense, and it really just doesn't.

Not much can be said about Phil's that hasn't been yelped a hundred times already.  They have some of the best Barbeque in the state, and the lines often reflect that.  Baby back ribs, hamburgers, tri-tip, even the damn veggie burger is good.   If the power goes out I'd recommend stepping out, it gets really smoky.

Let me start this review by saying there were 12 of us including 4 who don't eat pork and a vegetarian.  Don't ask me how we even ended up at a barbecue place.  So, with half the group already sour on the place we took our place in line, it was moving pretty quick, but gave us time to go over the menu.  Plenty of beef choices, a veggie burger, and salads. Whew, dodged that bullet.  Then there was the matter of seating us all together.  Some one who worked there (I never gathered if they actually had a hostess) grabbed someone from our group to "hold our table".  We were still far enough away from the entrance to not know what the protocol was inside.  Once you get to the front of the line, you wait until there is a free register.  As all 12 of us were on one tab, we were efficiently split into to groups sent up one after the other.  Paying was a breeze, and we were all able to sit together.  It seemed chaotic in line, but Phil's pulled through.  The bar is separate so we went up and got pitchers of beer once we were seated.  Our food took as long as one would expect for 12 plates, and everyone enjoyed their meal.  At one point one of the staff said that some times the wait can be up to 2 hours!  I don't think I would wait 2 hours for Phil's but I would for sure come back - even with a large group which is saying something, because I feel that as busy as they were it could be easily messed up.

Re: the El Toro- barbecue trip-tip sandwich. Granted the sandwich is awesome- however let's get one fact straight. I dispute the fact, as quoted again this morning in the UT, Phil did not invent Tri-Tip BBQ between bread. Anyone who's ever been to the California Central Coast- Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Paso Robles, and the epicenter of it Santa Maria, knows that Tri-Tip barbecue has been going on since the early 1950's. On any given day you can find wood fired barbecues outside of restaurants and even grocery stores selling this classic sandwich. I was blown away when Adam Richman (who's research team should have checked out the fact) claimed that Phil was the first to think of putting tri-tip between bread. No matter how good it is, that's just not true! Just saying, Santa Maria style barbecue tri-tip sandwiches have been around since before Phil's BBQ was a charcoal gleam in his eye. Congratulations Kudos on winning best sandwich on west coast

What can I possibly say more than Phil's BBQ is AWESOME.  The service is excellent, the food so far as I have traveled our country has no comparison with any other (and believe me, I'm on the hunt) and the wait is worth my time.  A must if here on business or vacation.

The BBQ sauce on the ribs was very thick and tangy, not sweet at all! It masked the flavor of the meat too. One of my order's to go was with fries, The fries were all hard and dried up, like if they were leftover ones. I called and let them know but all they said was sorry.

They're fricking quick, I'll give them that. And the portions were HUGE. I can usually down some onion rings, but not here. It was embaressing. The food taste though was just "meh." Nothing I'd rave about.

You can't say anything that hasn't already been covered here by other faithful customers of Phil's BBQ. Take it from me, this is the best place ever to get ribs in SD. All my friends from out of town that come visit me, this is usually the first place I take them to. Before they leave it's a guarantee that they will ask to eat here again before getting on the place. I don't know what texas bbq taste like but to me this would fit the name well.

I have been coming to Phil's on SportsArena almost from the time they moved there. I never wait in a line because I come at 9:45 PM. The Baby Back ribs are the my first choice but occasionally I have the tri-tip or pulled pork sandwich; there are names on the menu, but you can figure it out. Fries and onion rings are the excellent. And Franks red Hot sauce among the condiments.

The line is absurdly ALL DAY LONG but the food is quite delicious.  It's not your typical restaurant - you order in a line, then find a seat if there's one avaialble (no hostess to help with seating), and wait for the buzzer to go off so you can go to the counter to pick up the food.  The ribs, colossal onion rings, and sides were spectacular.  We ate so much but never felt bloated from eating all those baby back ribs, onion rings, macaroni salad, coleslaw, etc...  Despite the amount of food I ate, it was satisfying and not sickening.  I couldn't believe I didn't feel sick after eating all that food!  Definitely the best ribs ever.  The meat was very tender.  Definitely the best ribs I've ever had.  Will definitely come back again.   Was the wait worth it?  Not sure.  It's long, but it does move. . .   You can always order to-go and pick it up at the counter if you don't want to eat in.

It's decent BBQ. I don't care that it's not smoked but it's not comparable to southern BBQ.  Not worth the 1-2 hour wait in line. Try the San Marcos location instead and you can walk right in with maybe a 5 minute wait.

The stars say three, but I want them to say two and a half. I stopped going there. After three or four times in the new place, I just couldn't do it again. Mission Hills was DA BOMB, but sports arena...an over crowded feedery that has replaced excellent food with customer turnover with only profit in mind. I don't want to even go into the details of the food because I really don't want to ruin it for most of the customers. At least they got rid of the stryofoam containers on every meal. Oh well, good bye to Phil's until I need to bring out-of-town guests who are easily impressed and want to see a diverse crowd chowing down.

Good saucy ribs.  So, I'm slowly learning about the cheap eats here, mostly from my foodie friends (and from Yelp) and this place was one of their recommendations for staving off meat cravings.  I couldn't agree more.   The people were warm and friendly, even when they had to herd us; loved that there were ample rolls of towels and wet wipes (the most foresight of any BBQ place I've been).  And the then there's the food!  So worth the wait and the anxiety of securing a booth.  Delicious delicious stretches of meat that fell off the ribs--my fingers smelled like sauce the next day and I was very close to making the drive back there for more.  I'll do the take out next time.

Delicious food!   Service is hit and miss, however.   The people behind the counter really couldn't care less-it's quantity, not quality of people they serve.  Once you get through the line, there's usually a very nice, helpful larger black woman who directs you to which counter person will take your order, and where you'll sit.  She's always there, and breaks the tension that's been building inside you for having to stand in that line for so long.  You think to yourself, wow, she's having so much fun, everything is gonna be alright!  The food is delicious, no matter what you get.

One word describes Phil's = Amazing. There ribs are the best in San Diego. I first had them at their mission hills location when it was a hole in the wall restuarant. Then then grew and started gettting complaints becuase of the smell. But There ribs, chicken , onion rings, BBQ sauce are one of kind to San Diego's BBQ Food. If you want some great BBQ food for reasonable prices then head over to Phil's at the their new expanded location on Sports Arena Blvd.

This is the best barbecue in Southern California.  The line and resulting table hunt is a little anxiety causing, but it's more than made up for by the ribs, burgers, and onion rings. There might be better barbecue outside of SoCal, but that's too far to drive.

Phil's almost lives up to the hype. I've been going to Phil's a few times a year since they were located in Hillcrest. During peak meal hours the people queuing up outside resemble the lines for Space mountain, so avoid that if possible. Is it the best in SD? That depends on your favorite style of BBQ and let's be honest Cali-style BBQ--which this is--never seems to pop up on any top ten lists. That being said, if it's going to be good BBQ then it's gotta be pork and the Broham, a good sized pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on top is far and away the best thing on the menu. The "Toro," a beef version of the Broham is pretty good too. I've ordered the ribs (both types) a couple of times, but always found there was a little too much char on them for my taste. The chicken... really? ...who cares? All the sides are good, but again there's one true standout: The Onion Rings are phenomenal, and when dipped in the ranch dressing... well I'd go there just to eat them.

Being that I'm not a BBQ person, I'd have to agree with the majority of these other reviews; their BBQ is by far, probably the most delicious I've had.  I've been to the south and I've tasted some fine BBQ, but Phil's comes pretty close with a hint of their own unique flavoring.   Though the line to wait for a seat can be a real *bleep* it's all worth it in the end.  My favorite would have to be their Chickless dinner with a side of beans.  Beans can be a little peppery but who cares?  We're there for the BBQ!

I see many of you have reviewed Phil's BBQ and for me, being a San Diego native, Phil's is the Best-Bar-None! If want to Impress anyone with Barbequed Chicken or Ribs Phil's is the best, not only for the large portions of food, but for the atmosphere that is poppin, rain or shine, day or night, doesn't matter. Usually packed, but that's what makes it fun. They have their act together, their roming greeters are the best and are on top of their customers every second. I love em! They make you feel like you are the only group there. Beyond friendly. By the way, don't let the long line fool you, if goes very fast and it will be worth it. Don't forget their water trough during and  after you eat, you might need it, I for one make a mess of all the good BBQ Chicken on my hands and face. I need a water trough after I eat.

I've been going to Phil's since the day they opened their doors in Mission Hills, and I was just youngin going to St. Vincent's school around the corner.  Suddenly my lunch money was being saved and pooled together for afternoon binges at Phil's.  The food is great, and definitely worth the wait.  These days though, with the line the way it is at the new Sports Arena location I always just call in my order and bring it home.   I can't act like I'm not a little disappointed that they decided to close the doors on the Mission Hills location for good.  That was where it all started, and I have a lot of good memories there...  But I got over it as soon as I drove by the new location and smelled that delicious Phil's smell again.  It's definitely not the type of food you can eat too often, but every once in a while a ribless/chickless dinner with fries and onion rings REALLY hits the spot.

I didn't read any of the other reviews, so I'm sure I will say things that have been mentioned multiple times, but... Phil's is a true meat lovers Paradise. Everything is cooked to perfection and Phil's sauce is incredible (cue mouth watering). Just driving by this place gets me salivating. I was running down the San Diego River Canal yesterday and could smell Phil's. Why oh why did I have to run within a mile of Phils. The chick-less nuggets are great for those who want some white meat, but for the $ shot, try the broham w/ onion rings (beer battered of course) and a rib tickler for an appetizer. The meat falls off the ribs and the pulled pork of the broham is the best I have ever had.  Better than VA, TX, NC, KC. Unless you are going w/ the family, or live too far away, I recommend calling in and taking it home. Get there a few minutes early for a beer at the bar - you don't have to wait in line. That line is a beast. Arrogant bastard on tap. Only thing I miss is that they aren't going to reopen the Mission Hills locale. But riding by yesterday, they have a Lefty's Pizza sign up, so we got that going for us...

Loved the bbq! You definitely gotta go here if you're in san diego! I went at 7 on a saturday, waited about half hour in line and then couple minutes for the food, totally worth it!

For the price you pay and the amount / quality of food you get....this place definitely hits the spot. Even though this place seems to be always busy, the staff continuously are very friendly. ...from the greeter at the door all the way to the staff cleaning off the tables.  I've been here numerous times where the chef comes out and visits tables to see how everyone is doing.  Sometimes it's another staff member (not your waiter) who does this, but it adds to the down to earth charm and home style setting it tries to achieve.  Kudos for this extra added customer service.  It's these little things that mean alot to many of us that make us feel at home.  Thank you!  That's a hard thing to do in a busy place like this and I commend you for achieving it. I first started going to Phil's way back in the original location.  I missed that place because it had more of a hole in the wall / home vibe....small and intimate.  This new place sort of loses that charm for me.  Decor looks too new and commercial for my liking.  I understand the move to a bigger more centrally located area however.  I just wish they left opened the original place too. As for the food... Let's just say I always walk away feeling full and with leftovers to bring home!   That's a good thing!  I always order the Rib-less / Chick-less (half-order of rib-less pork BBQ and half order of boneless BBQ chicken).  This isn't on the menu....the old school people from the original location remember this though!  You can still ask for it.  Phil's barbecue sauce makes everything taste so good.....a little bit sweet and spicy and tangy. Negatives: -it's a popular place so expect a long line to get in especially during peak meal hours....expect a wait. -there's no reservations taken here -big groups can be hard to seat...it's possible just be patient Pros: -unlike the old place there's a bar here!  woohooo!  BBQ and Beer....so good! -the bar is a separate room apart from the main restaurant -patio seating...perfect during a hot day -they take phone orders for pick up! Some advice: -if you wanna miss the long lines try coming here off peak meal hours or during the weekdays. -if it's just you and a friend try grabbing a seat at the bar area...you can order food there too.  Please order a beer or two and don't be a bar hog taking up space and not drinking.  I need room when I get there! For San Diego, this place deserves these five stars.

One of my favorite spots in San Diego.  Everyone you know has been there or has heard of it. The prices are reasonable, but the food is finger licking good!  The meat melts right off the bone for the ribs, which is what I usually get. The only downside is that it's constantly packed, but you can't really blame them for that!  I usually will call in my order and eat it at home.

900 + Yelpers can't be wrong! I had the baby back ribs, beef rib, onions rings, fries, sweet beans and cole slaw. The ribs were great! I am a fan of the pork ribs which were cooked so the meat almost fell off the bone. Good clean eating! I am a huge fan of the tangy BBQ sauce (hate the sweet stuff) so along with the rub these are very tasty ribs. The onion rings reminded me of the type you might get at a Fair, which could be good or bad depending on your taste. The beans were average as were the fries. The cole slaw was a bit above average. Finally, the price is fair for what you get. The seating arrangement is a bit odd, and you will probably stand in line, then feel rushed to leave so others can sit.. but hey... I'm telling you its worth it!

This is one of the best bbq restaurants I have ever been to. Believe me I've eaten alot of BBQ. This is the way BBQ restaurants should be. You order, sit down, they give you a pager, pick up your food, and devour. The BBQ is so good that I hate beef ribs and their beef ribs are almost better than their baby back ribs. BBQ without the hype (Lucille's). I like Lucille's but this place has reasonable prices and better food. Oh their southern hospitality when you arrive can be felt. They make sure they take extra good care of you. I usually get the ribs and chicken. The onion rings are awesome too! Cool thing is when you are finished, they have a sink right by the drink station so you can wash your hands. Gotta go try this place when you are down in San Diego, it's right by Sea World and the Sports Arena. My BBQ Top 3 1. Phil's BBQ 2. Famous Dave's BBQ 3. Lucille's BBQ

Well after a thousand or so reviews that this place gets, I'm pretty much going to say that this place is by far the best BBQ I've ever had. Yeah, yeah I know preaching to the choir here but hey. I ordered the ribs of course and was more than satisfied. Northern Ca restaurants don't have anything on this place and yes that's where I'm from. A half rack of ribs here is what they consider a full rack up there. Just to give a proportional visual. Now I know why this place is packed during dinner.

Best BBQ around, and prices won't kill you. Little bit of a drive for me, but worth it. Lines can be a bit long, and seating sparce, so come during off-times. The service is A-1, portions BIG, and the BBQ is great. Not gourmet food, but "real" BBQ fare that will leave your hands and face dripping & asking for more. Onion Rings are good, but they take a second to Wahoo's onion rings. (Sorry Phil)

This past weekend I had the wonderful t opportunity to try Phil's BBQ. And all I have to say is...AMAZING. When I arrived at the restaurant Sunday afternoon, the place was PACKED. I thought to myself..is this even worth it? But once I started chowing down on those delicious baby back ribs it was most definitely worth the wait. This is probably one of the best ribs I've had in awhile. The portions are great. One large meal of BBQ ribs was enough to satisfy me and my boyfriend. As for sides, I had the potato salad which was quite yummy as well as the baked potato which wasn't that great. As far as appetizers, I'm obsessed with the onion rings. They're a must have! Overall, I really enjoyed Phil's BBQ. Great food. Fast service.

THE BEST Macaroni salad and baked beans I ever had. Needless to say the perfectly done baby back ribs. Went there on a weekday around 3pm and still found the restaurant about 80% filled. An old man standing in line behind me told me that Phil's has the best macaroni salad in the world. I decided to follow his word and ordered a baby back rib full dinner with a side of macaroni salad and baked beans. The BBQ sauce is tangy and savory, once I started eating it I couldn't stop. It was just so good that my mouth already bit onto it before my stomach told my brain that I was getting too full. Being a selfish eater, I tried to keep my girlfriend from stealing my macaroni salad. Cooked to Al-dente macaroni with sufficient mayo, pepper, finely diced celery, egg white and so many other flavors going on in this simple side dish. She thought she wasn't hungry when we got there and ordered a small side of fries for a little over $1, which turned out to be a small hill of crispy and perfectly salted fries. Can't really get better than that. After trying the macaroni salad, my girlfriend decided to go back to the counter and ordered a small side of mac salad for herself  and the cashier girl nicely offered her a large side instead. Friendly staff is one of the key components that keeps comfort food enthusiasts coming back. Staff always come up to your table and ask about your day, creating a friendly and homely atmosphere. I wish I could describe the deliciousness of the baked beans I had. I finished the sweet, tangy, slightly sticky baked beans in about 4 spoonfuls. It was just so good that I couldn't stop. Phil's, you almost made me tear up about how amazing the food is here.

I don't know what people are thinking giving it four stars, but I absolutely love this place. Yeah the line is sometimes a bit long, but it goes by fast and if your standing with your friends and talking it sure passes the time more quickly. The food is great and the price is pretty cheap. I usually get the Tickler from them which is great because it's a smaller portion of the baby back ribs.  Their BBQ sauce is pretty delicious and they're known for it. I also like their cole slaw and onion rings.

As a native Texan, I feel that my opinions on BBQ are rather picky. I gotta say though, Phil's is real good BBQ. My "baby-back" ribs were tender and delicious. I also ordered the Pulled Pork Shoulder sandwich, which was absolutely GIGANTIC (It should have been advertised as an open face sandwich) . It came with a side of Cole-Slaw that was a perfect combo of hot and moist / cold and crunchy. Service was great too! MY ONLY COMPLAINTS: 1. They put a TON of BBQ sauce on my ribs and sandwich. It is a solid BBq sauce but it was just tooooo much. 2. A bit pricey for BBQ I'll be back to Phil's 4sho.

I am not sure what the hype of Phil's really lived up to it's expectations.   Don't get me wrong, great BBQ for SD, great atmosphere if you are looking for people/games, hanging out. I really really liked their baby backs, their sauce is above par, but not outstanding.  I agree with Glenn R., too much suce, it's almost to the point of wanting meat to go along with the sauce! Definitely come here either really early or really late, or guaranteeded you will be standing in line for a long time.  Think Disneyland 4th of July weekend for Space Mountain or Indiana Jones. One of the things I didn't like is that I found that the other meats I could get at Stonefire Grill or another order and sit. In the end, the good baby backs, other decent meats, and the above par bbq sauce doesn't make me want to wait in line for 1 - 1.5 hours. Good, but not good enough!

Best BBQ Experience ever! Came out to San Diego on 3/16/2010 to puchase a car, decided to drop by Phil's after reading hundreds of yelp reviews about how good this place was. I had to give it a try for myself. I came hungry, I ate like there was no tomorrow, I failed to finish everything, so was forced to take the tasty sensation back to Los Angeles with me. Finished it the next day, and still tasted great! I highly recommend the onion rings! They are simply amazing, I have no words to describe how orgasmic these onion rings are!

I don't think I can say anymore than has already been said...but I love this place! We recommend it to friends on a regular basis and accompany them as much as possible. I would say that this is the BEST BBQ place in all of San Diego and LA. You normally have to wait a good amount of time to get in, but I have never been unsatisfied with my meal, it's definitely worth the wait! The meat always falls right off the bone, and the sauce is the perfect blend or sweet and tangy (it has a bit of kick to it, too). If you're not sure you'll enjoy a lot of sauce, ask for it on the side and put the amount you like on yourself. The sides are even something to brag about: my favorites are the fries and coleslaw. You can't go wrong with the slaw! Anyway, I haven't been going here for years, but I've already gone WAY too much :) It's just soooooooooo good!

I can't imagine this being the best BBQ in SD....however, SD is more know for fish tacos so that statement may not be too far off. I got the combo pork ribs and BBQ chicken breast with two sides meal. The pork ribs were tender and full of flavor but the slather of BBQ sauce seemed too be overkill on sweetness. The chicken was on the dry side and the thick layer of sauce didn't help it. Also, other than the fries, I wished the sides were more generous. The service was top notch. Very friendly and very helpful. All in all, I left stuffed and satisfied. I'll be back to try the beef ribs everyone's been raving about. Bottom line: I know there is better BBQ than this....it's probably not in Cali, thou.

What can I say that a thousand people have already said? Nothing really =D It's good bbq but having tried some Texan bbq... it's just not the same. If the owners are reading my review though... IF YOU BRING BRISKET ON THE MENU I"LL EDIT THIS INTO A FIVE. But other than the food, the service is fun an great. There's this lady who stands at the front of the line the last two times I've been there has hugged me and squeezed my arm and given me the loving tenderness only a mom gives to her kid. She makes me smile. but anyways. about the food again. Get the baby back never beef ribs Pulled pork is good but why the hell would you get that when you can get ribs. Chicken is pretty darn good but it's not baby back ribs. Seriously though...get the ribs. If you don't like ribs than ... I don't know try these cause they will make you like them. I've picked up a bone and had the meat slide all off. Crazy kind of tender. Also I would call in advance but I want to see the lady at the front of the line. Seriously, you should try to get to meet her.

I have been eating at Phil's FOREVER* but have just never gotten around to writing a review. I love Phil's. Always have, always will. I love their bbq sauce, and I know a lot of the naysayers don't like it but I put that down to personal preference. The "chickless" is my meat of choice, the spice rub on it is divine. The fries are excellent, made from fresh cut potatos. And the onion rings are to die for if you like 'em big and thick. Also love the bbq cheeseburger, no one mentions how good the burgers are so I'm here to tell you this is one of the best hamburgers in town. Another great item that doen't get a lot of talk is the cesar salad - they make their own dressing and it has a nice peppery kick to it. Something else that doesn't seem to get much mention in the reviews here is the beer bar. Know all those places that claim to have the "coldest beer in town"? Well, Phil's really does. On a good day my pint of Arrogant Bastard has ice crystals in it because it's so cold. The beer selection is very good, a nice cross section of local microbrews and the big names. Oh, and to all you folks who complain abut the line: whatever. I remember when at the old location there were a few times when the wait was four hours. Phi's is worth the wait. Now if I could just get them convinced to bring the fresh made ice cream back... *And if you don't believe my "forever" claim - do YOU remember back when they were in Mission Hills and only had 4 tables? Before the coffee bar and the ice cream? Didn't think so...

Arrived at Phil's at 6:40 pm on a Friday. The line had already wrapped around 2 sides of the building and extended into neighboring property. 8:10 pm...finally got inside and placed my order. I am starving at this point. I ordered the full rib dinner baby back ribs (10-12 bones + 2 small sides of your choice) with extra sauce, corn on the cob, macaroni salad, sweet baked beans, and colossal onion rings. Like I said, i was starving, don't judge! WOW...the meat just fell off the bones. Oh so yummy in my tummy!!! I am not a fan of BBQ but I think they just found themselves a new convert! The sides were also good except for the onion rings. I didn't care too much for the way it was battered and it was slightly undercooked. The wait staff were excellent! The place was packed, yet they still managed to tend to your needs. The wet wipes and disposable bibs were also nice things to have as well. Overall, well played! If I am ever in San Diego again, I'm coming back.  I want my baby back baby back baby back baby back riiiiiiibbs.....BBQ sauce...

No other place will do!  This is the spot for really good BBQ!!  The line can be ridunkulous!!!  Avoid the line by getting there early avoid  12-1 and 5-7.  If you can't then hit up the bar for beer and wine and if you're lucky a seat!   Ribs are a def must at this joint.  The baby backs will deliciously fall off the bone and the beef are seriously beefy goodness!  Onion rings are huge beer battered, fries are great with malt vinegar and the cole slaw is pretty tasty.  The rib tickler is a good value.  The homemade ranch is delish.

I have no complaints really about this place.  I understand everyone LOVES this place, but really, I'm not too sure if you can take what everyone says at face value.  Have you tried Texas style bbq??   There are literally NO other bbq places in San Diego to compete with and everyone goes here.  I've had better, BUT, like I said, there isn't anywhere else to go for bbq in this town.  So, Phil's it is!   Phil's is good enough, but I will have to agree with others, the sauces are somewhat bland.  If you are used to Texas style or Kansas bbq, this isn't exactly similar.  The meat is sometimes overcooked and the coleslaw isn't very flavorful - maybe they need to add more vinegar.  Some pulled pork would be nice :-) or did I miss that on the menu?   Anywho, worth checking it out - but I think bbq is a "to each their own" kind of thing.  I'll go back until there is something better in town. In reference to that there are more BBQ joints in town:  most of them are mom and pop shops - it's like comparing a Walmart or Target to a small boutique.

All you people who put less than 5 stars suck. Yes, the line is long...that's not their fault; lots of people love their food=long line. If you are SO worried about the long line, just call ahead and take it home, the food is ready in like 15 minutes or less and you can just eat it in your car if you want. That said, I LOVE Phil's. And yes, I have eaten at GREAT bbq joints, like The Shed in Mississippi (AMAZING), but that doesn't mean that Phil's isn't simply awesome. I've tried almost everything on their menu, but their mac salad is TO DIE FOR. I always get the Ribless Dinner (I hate dealing with messy bones) and for my 2 sides I get ALL mac salad, and each and every time the meat is super soft and tasty and the bbq sauce is finger-lickin good. I also share a small order (not that small!) of onion rings with the people I come with because they are the best onion rings ever and their house ranch is just creamy goodness. I love Phil's BBQ so much I ordered it for my wedding rehearsal dinner and the price was super reasonable and they even helped us put the enormous amount of food in our car. It came with everything you need, too: napkins, forks, knives, hand-wipies, serving stuff, paper plates. A little more relaxed for a rehearsal dinner, but it was a good price; it saved money for the actual wedding itself... Great service, great prices, great food. Couldn't love Phil's more.

WHAT. San deezy's #1 BBQ pig-out spot. HOW. Family vacay in sd, less than a mile away from our hotel. And oh.. another man v food feature spot. Geez, what a no brainer. TASTE. Lemme start off by saying.. EVERYTHING HERE IS GOOD. Believe me when i say that. Whether its beef, pork or chicken - rib, pulled or bits - whatever floats your boat. The meat detaches itself from the bones the minute it makes contact to your knife/fork. Then it releases this hypnotizing aroma that is the epitome of bbq greatness; smokey not burnt. Then it melts in your mouth just like butter. To top it off, their home made cole slaw seals the deal by contrasting the meat's flavor with its own dose of freshness and tanginess. Seriously, it doesnt get better than this. SERVICE. Being that popularity exceeds expectations, all is forgiven in the land of phil's. Usual complaints here include long lines, hours of waiting and (hence) jam packed parking. But ask anyone if that was all worth the hassle and dont be surprised to hear a resounding "YES". There are plenty seats to accomodate everyone, a nice bar to get your alchy-side on and servers (my age) here are aint bad to look at either. FYI: they do accept phone-in/pickup orders but if you're stuck in line, no worries - the "bbqueue cam" will keep u busy (a live cam feed streamed to their website). PRICE. Entrees range from $10-20 depending on what and how much of it. Descent at first glance, worth it after the first bite. Overall, Phil's BBQ packs a whole lotta punch when it comes to delivering midwest style barbecue to the west coast. This spot isnt for the veg-minded but is totally meat-lover friendly. So next time when your in town make sure to check this place out.

4.5 stars after 1773 reviews--that's gotta say something.  Been there twice now, and their service is impeccable.  All the waiters are so friendly and enthusiastic, and they're willing to help with just about anything! The beef ribs and the onion rings are the best--never had better anywhere else.

Oh God...where do I start with Phil's? This place is definitely some of the best BBQ in all of SoCal. You may be deterred by the enormous lines that often stretch around the restaurant, but let me tell you friends, it is TOTALLY worth the wait. You can pretty much expect a line on any day at any time, so be prepared. Once you finally get to order, their menu is quite extensive. Everything on the menu is pretty amazing. I love their pulled pork sandwich. They are extremely generous with the pork as they pile it on the bun...and they top it off with coleslaw. Such a genius combination. Their beef and pork ribs are simply amazing. The meat just falls right off the bone and it's nice and juicy. None of that dry disgusting meat here. The BBQ sauce is perfect. Sweet with a hint of tangy. I can't forget about their sides. The onion rings are HUGE and is probably the best side you could order. It's seriously some of the best onion rings I've ever had. Their baked beans are great along with their macroni salad. Pretty much everything on the menu is amazing. If you love BBQ, this is the place to go to. Oh and you'll usually leave here weighing about 10 pounds heavier. So bring a book or some sudoku as you wait in line. It's worth it in the end.

Wow - majorly hyped.  Went on a Saturday evening, so pretty packed.  The 1 hour line was not cool.  I like places with a wait, but I hate when they make you wait in line.   The ordering system was nice.  I liked avoiding the bill splitting in the end.  Tried baby back and beef ribs.  Baby back was good, beef was fatty.  BBQ sauce was a bit tangy for me.  Beans and macaroni salad were so so.   We spent a lot of time after the meal chatting and were politely encouraged to leave by the hostess.  She wasn't mean, but it was annoying to have the pressure.

Phils BBQ. This place is AMAZING. Friendly staff members and amazing food. I love this place. I always starve myself the day I plan to have Phils. The pricing is great. It's not expensive for what you're gonna get. I always get the BBQ baby back ribs with fries and cole slaw. AMAZING combo. They give you like 50000K pounds of fries!!! Coleslaw is amazing too. I haven't tried the beef rib yet cuz I know I haven't had ENOUGH of baby-back ribs. LOL. ( I had baby-back ribs like at least 15 times) I never want to stop going to this place. Thank God they're opening 2nd location. Also, here's the con. They're closed on mondays... :( What do I do if i'm craving Phils on MONDAY!!! PEOPLE GO TO PHILS~~ :D

When i was going in the parking lot my JAWS just dropped because of the long line outside the restaurant. In my mind I was thinking to myself this must be bomb. I finally sat down got my food. When you come and eat here prepare to get your hands and face smouthered with PHils famous BBq sauce. I tried the BBQ broham sandwich, BBQ chicken, the BBQ ribs, and of course the onion rings. Nothing beats phils onion rings. ITS A MUST! out of the chicken and broham the ribs were theeee bestt. very high energy and super friendly employees. no wonder it has so many 5 stars

Phil's BBQ is the best barbecue place that I know of. Compared to Lucille's BBQ, not only is it cheaper it tends to taste better! The ribs are nice and tender and will make everyone except the biggest of critics happy. They also give quite a bit of fries which is a nice touch. The only downside is that the waiting line can tend to be quite long! Luckily they serve in a fast food style where you take your order up in the front and pick up everything yourself. I tend to prefer this style for large parties.

There's tons of other reviews for this place so I don't know if there's much I can add.  I've gone here twice.  First time, my fiancee and I had beef ribs and the El Toro, the BBQ tri-tip sandwich.  It was good but not as good as I thought it would be.  Adam Richman from Man v. Food described the El Toro as "without a doubt, one of the best beef sandwiches" he has had anywhere.  Knowing that Adam Richman has literally had BBQ and other food throughout the country, I had really high expectations.  Don't get me wrong - it wasn't bad and in fact it was really good.  Just not as good as I was hoping. So why 5 stars?  Because I had the pork baby back ribs and the Big Broham the second time I went.  Now THAT was worthy of all the hype and praise in the world (although neither dish was featured on Man v. Food).  The ribs were incredibly tender and had great flavor even without sauce.  Heck, it's so good that you really don't need Phil's very tasty BBQ sauce.  With it, however, it goes to the next level. The Big Broham is a pulled pork shoulder sandwich.  The smoky flavor of the pork really stood out.  Loved it.  Great.  Now I got myself hungry just writing about it but I live 100 miles away.  Ugh. The long and short of it: go for the pork BBQ!  Worth 5 stars without a doubt.

MMMM so good Although I cannot believe the line! Luckily I didn't have to wait in it. That would have been a bummer. Anyhoo, at the suggestion of friends I ordered the broham sandwich with a side of potato salad. Delicious! I don't usually like pork but this stuff was so good and the bbq had the best flavor I've ever experienced in the realm of barbecueness. The potato salad was good as well. Lots of dill and red potatoes which I like. I had some of my friend's fries and they might have been the best fries I  have ever tasted. Maybe. They were pretty impressive. This meal was pretty cheap too. I would definitely recommend this place but I'm not sure I'd want to wait 40 minutes for it.

After Years And Years Of Hearing & Reading The Raves, I Finally Decided To Order Some Saturday Takeout At The Sports Arena Location. Good Thing It WAS Takeout, Since The Place Was Full & The Line Out The Door At 11:25, & They OPEN At 11:00!! I Ordered The Half Baby-Back Ribs Dinner W/ Beans & Fries. As I Do With ALL The Take-Out Baby Back Ribs I Order, I Put A Dollop Of Bulls-eye On The Side, Just In Case The Sauce Doesn't Really Measure Up;MY Mistake! They Are Easily THE BEST, Fall-Off-The-Bone BBQ Ribs I've EVER Tasted!! The Ribs Were QUITE Meaty, Barely A Trace Of Fat On Them For Being SO Juicy. & The Sauce Is Perfect, Not Too Spicy Or Too Sweet. & For A "Half Portion" Dinner, They Sure DON"T Skimp!! The Plentiful Fries Were Fries;But The Beans Have A Nice Little Kick To  Them, Unique From The Usual Baked Beans Side Fair You Get At A BBQ Ribs Place. As A Natural Bodybuilder, I Can Only Allow Myself A Baby-Back Ribs "Cheat" About Twice A Year; But I'll Know Right Where To Make A Bee-Line For Them EVERY Time, From Now On!!

This place is definitely up to the hype. Unlike most things that are hyped this much. Got the beef rib, chicken, and pork ribs with some sides. All in all, the beef ribs are the all out winner by far. So flavorful and delicious.  Chicken was good. The pork ribs were kinda lacking in meat. Next time getting a bunch of beef ribs and nothing else.

In a word...spicy.   And, I mean that in a good way.  Clearly, Phil's is a local favorite.  I waited 25 minutes in line at 6 p.m. on a Friday night.  By the time I left, the line was at least 45 minutes long and people were still lining up.  We went here on a recommendation from a colleague and the food was VERY good.   I had a combination of chicken and baby-back ribs, both of which were very well-prepared and tasty.  I tasted the beef ribs that were ordered by a couple people in my group and while they were good, I recommend the baby backs.  Both sauces were a little spicy, which I love, but the pork was better.  All the sides were great, and the service was prompt, attentive, and generous.   Can't ask for any more...Phil's is a must-stop if you're in the SD area.

Quite possibly the best BBQ west of Texas. I'm very picky about my pulled pork sandwiches and Phil's prepares it perfectly. The BBQ sauce is a perfect blend of spice and sweet. The fries were prepared perfectly and addicting. You will not leave this place hungry. Don't worry if you see a line out to the parking lot on some nights. The line moves quickly enough and worth the wait.

Not the biggest fan of bbq but I thought since I'm in SD why not try what people consider the best bbq in southern California. My friend and I shared the quarter rack baby back ribs with fries and macaroni salad. When we got our food we knew instantly that we wouldn't be able to finish it, they gave us generous amounts of the "small" sides. The ribs itself were alright, I'm not a big fan of bbq sauce so to me it was a bit too saucy. The fries and macaroni salad were really good though! They had yummy fries seasoning too. All in all I think this would be a one time visit, it wasn't that great but it wasn't too bad.

As if this place didn't have enough positive reviews. The Misses and I were in San Diego for the weekend. We drove by Phil's during the top of the morning and saw the crazy-long line. Later that night, we drove by Phil's again and I told  her, "We are eating there. I don't care how long we have to wait." You first make your way to the register and order your food. Then it's open seating, which explains the long lines-- the entire city of San Diego is trying to eat there at the same time. Maybe all of Southern California. We first ordered the babybacks and the chicken dinner. I might I say, winner winner chicken dinner. Everything was good, the ribs, the chicken, the fries, the corn-on-the-cob, and even the coleslaw; I love me some slaw. The most surprising thing to me was the prices. Lucille's full rack = $24+ Tony Romas' full rack = $18+ Phil's...well it's $18. But they're damn good ribs. Soooo...we're fat. We were in town for 3 days. We ate there twice. Second time we got the babybacks again and the Broham Sandwich (i.e. pulled pork shoulder) YUM! Nothing left to say. Everything is yummy. Go eat there!!!

I have been daydreaming about Phil's BBQ sandwich ever since I had one on Saturday. I am from Virginia and I've tried quite a few kinds of barbeque, but this was amazing. The sandwich is HUGE...when you pick it up to eat it an entire 2nd sandwich practically falls out. The sauce is great but even the pieces that weren't covered with it were fantastic, kind of smoky. The baked beans were so-so and the onion rings were pretty much made of a stick of butter each but I am giving this a five because the sandwich far exceeded my expectations. I also want to mention that the staff was super nice and let us go back to the front of the line when we were on our way to wait again after deciding we wanted to add onion rings to our order. I recommend walking inside to the take-out line which is much shorter than the line wrapped around the restaurant waiting for a table.

Now it may seem like rocket science to find an amazing bbq joint, which is reasonably price, and screams deliciousness in more ways than one...but then you just get in line at phil's and its like einstein solved all of your problems. Phil's BBQ is incredible. I went to school in san diego and we would risk a loss of hours studying and potential food coma, to stand in line and enjoy one of the best bbq joints in town. Their ribs are NOT fatty - I doubt there is even a gram of fat on them. They are so tender and delicious, they melt right in your mouth, giving a symphony of flavor on your tongue. It truly is a magical experience. The fries and coleslaw are delicious and if you ask for extra bbq sauce and ranch, and dip the fries in a mixture of both...OH MY LORD! I assure you, you will be blown away. I have introduced many to this place. They see the line and want to turn around, but their curiosity is triggered as their tummy grumbles when they smell the strong bbq scents coming from the building. It is well worth the wait! I mean, there is a reason why there are hundreds of crazy people, salivating, standing in line. I mean I do it all the time, and I'm assuming I'm not TOO crazy! The service is great. Everyone is incredibly friendly and make you feel right at home. It really is a special place, full of laughs and immense enjoyment. I currently live in LA and have no problem making the trip to San Diego just for these bad boys. Phil's definitely a guy I'd love to date! ;] Personal Recommendation = 1/2 Rib Dinner, with Cole Slaw and Fries. And a drink...and the best part? This totals about $17 with tax, and keeps me full for the whole day! Bon Apetit!

I love this place.  If I could eat here everyday, I would.  But that would mean spending half my life in line and the other half in open heart surgery.  Still, almost worth it. Usually I get the BBQ Broham sandwich.  Silly name, but one of the better pulled pork sandwiches I've had on the left coast.  The meat is tender and juicy with a nice smoky flavor, and it is HEAPED all over a bun totally inadequate to the task.  Thats a good thing.  No scrimping at this place!  I'm not usually a fan of slaw on my pulled pork, but I like Phil's - especially with a bit of pepper and malt vinegar mixed in, on the sandwich or on the side.  Tasty. The pork ribs are also very good.  Like others have said, the meat does fall off the bone...a little too well.  You can (and I have) literally debone a rack of ribs without so much as a morsel left on.  That shouldn't be - gnawing on the bones and making a mess is half the damn fun!  I don't know why - maybe they sit hot for too long?  My father (a Texan) says they probably boil them, but I've never heard of such a thing.  Either way, this is a minor quibble - the meat is tender, smoky, and delicious.  If you come from a BBQ-rich region these won't blow you away, but anyone else will like them very much.  I ordered the beef ribs only once and wasn't thrilled, but lack the memory and experience to judge them properly.  The real problem may be that I enjoy the pulled pork and pork ribs too much to bother changing up. My girl gets the BBQ chicken or the burgers, both of which are tasty.  But not tasty enough to forgo pulled pork or ribs.  FYI, the burgers take a good deal longer than the other menu items, so if you're ordering separately be prepared to watch everyone else chow down.  Not good times. The sides: fries are great, onion rings are solid, slaw is unusually good.  The potato and macaroni salads are pretty bad actually.  Very bland, by-the-book, mayo intensive mushy food-like products.  The beans are tasty, but the portion is kinda small.  Of all the things to skimp on  - why the beans?  I mean, its beans.  Food don't get much cheaper than beans.  Still, recommended. Three complaints: the sauce, the cornbread, and the line.  In that order.   1. This is a 4-star review just because of the sauce.  I know, I'm a freak.  I do not understand the love this BBQ sauce gets.  Granted, its better than the other places in town I've had, but still...its waaaay too sugary and not nearly tangy/spicy/interesting enough.  I order my meals with the sauce on the side and dip my fries in it; that is all its good for.  All that sugar drowns out the quality meat.  Sad thing is - outside of a few blessed regions - most people expect KC Masterpiece, and it pays to make most people happy.   2. My biggest problem with the cornbread here is that they don't have it on the menu.  I just...I mean...BBQ with no cornbread?  For the love of god WHY? 3. The line is always long.  The staff does a terrific job keeping everything moving and getting everyone seated, but there has to be a better way.  DO NOT skip this place just because of the line though.  The wait will be trivial once you get your food.   All in all, minor quibbles. ***If you like their sauce try this - throw a bunch of ketchup in a pot.  Add enough molasses to induce diabetes - approx. 1 metric assload.  Finish with a tablespoon or two of malt vinegar.  Bring to a boil, then simmer for 30 minutes, stirring often.  Viola.

What else is there to say about this place.  Over 2000+ reviews.  I'll make it short and simple.   LOVE THIS PLACE.  Never go to SD without eating here! BEEFY RIBS!! mmm.. Oh, and don't come TOO hungry for dinner as the line tends to get VERY LONG (yes it's that good :D), but it'll be worth it once you're inside.  :) Come back?  HELL YA! PS.  I rarely give 5 stars ;)

Tangy, fall off the bone ribs. Baby back or beef, they're all good. The line is long, but the wait is worth it. There's a BBQ cam to check it out before you go there. The staff is outgoing and friendly; it all moves very quickly, if you can get a seat. I've gone in large groups, and they've been very accommodating of this as well. Food: Onion rings are awesome. I recommend fries and potato salad. The potato salad is light, and a good balance for that Phil's sauce which can drown everything on the platter.

Here's what you need to know: Phil's makes excellent ribs. They excel at making BBQ ribs. This means it's PROBABLY a good idea to order their ribs. (to those who complain their other meats aren't as good as the ribs...hmm, I wonder why...) Their BBQ sauce is good, but not great. If sauces are your thing, you won't be amazed with Phil's. Did I mention they're good with ribs (and to some extent the chicken)? They don't have too much variety of meats outside of that so don't expect links, brisket or anything like that. They had a pork sandwich I tried once but was a little dry. Remember you can ask for extra BBQ sauce when you order so don't let your meats go dry! They also lack variety on dessert and other sweet sides. Portions are average, but probably not enough for big boys who come here in groups. Treat yourself right--get a full rack of ribs. Onion rings are big, golden and delicious. Their fries go excellent with a few extra sauce containers. I come here every time I'm in San Diego. If you're in NorCal however, check out Everett & Jones BBQ in Oakland (see my review too :)) which does better in the BBQ sauce and side dishes. Almost every time, I order the full rack of ribs with fries. On the weekends, get there early or be ready to wait 15-30 minutes in line. Parking in the plaza is tight during meal hours. One gripe: Normally, you wait in line, order at the register, get seated, then pick up your food when it's ready. However, one time we were seated first and a waitress took a drink order for a friend who was sitting alone, holding the table. He was supposed to go back to the register when ordering and tell them about the drink he had already received. The waitress later comes back and implicitly calls my friend a thief for not paying for the soda because he couldn't find his receipt with the drink order! Well, at least the manager was nice, who apologetically gave us a complimentary order of onion rings when we complained. This was an isolated incident!

With the thousands of reviews Phil's already has, it probably doesn't need yet another one to ramble on and on about how freaking DELICIOUS this place is! I get the same thing every time because it is amazing every single time- THE RIBS! Half rib dinner with the baby backs, macaroni salad and fries- it doesn't get any better. Of course the only down side is this place is usually always packed and always with a line, but speaking from experience- I have waited about an hour in line and still was happy because of how yummy it is. Not to mention EVERYONE IS SOOO FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL. LOVE!

Phil's never disappoints. I've been to this location and the one in San Marcos several times. If you're a BBQ fanatic then Phil's is your one stop shop for all your carnivorous needs The serving sizes are massive so one should be prepared to wear those extra loose pants or ask for a doggy bag. My girlfriend and I will usually order two dishes and split them. If you're like me and has that one "go-to" item on the menu, then the broham is for you my friend. The pulled pork is very tender and juicy; it doesn't need much BBQ sauce. It has a perfect blend of smokiness and when added sweetness from the coleslaw. It just fusses together well for an enjoyable meal .

I'm proud to be a San Diegan, but hell, are we really this clueless about bar-b-que?  Some stuff here is terrific, such as... Great staff.  Overworked and friendly as all get-out. The onion rings are the best I have ever had.  Seriously.  They are cut super thick, are served blazing hot, and the batter shatters like glass when you bite them. The potato sal' and coleslaw are light and taste like they're made fresh all day long. The sucky parts?: My baby back ribs were dry and barely warm.  I admit, the leftovers were better nuked the next day. That sauce MUST be ordered ON THE SIDE.  It's so vinegary, it's overpowering.  WAAAY out of balance. A b-q joint that doesn't have brisket?  Are you kidding me?  I've also been to a few hole-in-the walls that made their own hot links.  No links! I'll eat here on someone else's dime, but not mine.  True score is 2.25, but I rounded my stars out. The hype is ridiculous.  Some people cannot be trusted.

Best barbeque I've eaten so far. Okay, my cousin and i were on this we-dont-care-if-we-get-fat day so we stopped by phil's. We knew we were there when we smelled the aroma of the bbq. We were sure we were at the right place when we saw a long line along the lot. Too think that it was 4 in the afternoon and a line that long is like..what? So we waited until...bad news for me. Wrong choice of companion, our teacup maltese. It hurt to be deprived of going in. My cousin just took an order to go and we enjoyed the baby back ribs at home. Although i had a heartbreak over there, my heart was easily mended once my teeth sank into those juicy savory ribs. I cant wait to go back. And ps, do not even think of bringing a pet if you want to miss the food to die for.

Best ribs I've ever had.This is the best restaurant I've been to San Diego even though I've only been there a handful of times. When we first arrived, we encountered a huge line. However, the wait ended up not being too bad. The line moved by quite quickly. We even got free fries while waiting in line! Definitely worth the wait. I ordered the rack of baby back ribs with fries and macaroni salad as the sides. The Ribs were amazing. The fries were also good. i sprinkled it with the creole seasoning which maed it even more delicious. The macaroni salad was decent but not to die for. Definitely recommend this place if you're ever in SD!

Yummmmmy. I'm not a big "BBQ" fan, but this was good. Go for the tri tip sandwich, they give you enough meat for 2 sandwichs. The onion rings are awesome. Get the sauce on the side, so you can control the amount that goes on your food. Delish!!

Visiting San Diego on vacation. Heard about Phil's so had to try it. We drove over and the line was so long, we decided to call and order to go. No wait at all as they had the food ready. It just needed to be packaged up. We drive back to our hotel and excitedly dig in. It was ok, good even. But I just don't get what the fuss is all about. It was good BBQ but not the most amazing thing ever like people said. Had the baby back ribs and onion rings. Meat was very tender. But I am so glad we didn't wait in that long line. It was just....ok BBQ.

Wow... AWESOME barbeque! Honestly I'm not even a huge bbq person but this was incredible. We ordered the BBQ Broham Sandwich (Pulled Pork) and this thing was HUGE and bursting with smokey flavors and a tangy bbq sauce. We also got the corn on the cob, onion rings and baked potato which were equally awesome. We had to wait in line for a good 20 minutes but trust me it was well worth it. The staff was incredibly kind and helpful and the food lived up to it's reputation. Enjoy! :)

I. LOVE. PHIL'S. Good job, San Diego. I'm surprised there are even other restaurants open within a 5 mile radius. If you don't have time to wait in that long line, you can always bypass it by ordering out and gorging at home. Although then you'll miss out on their fantastic, smiley service. And remember: Clear cups are for clear water. Is that clear?

I had never heard of Phil's before but just recently took a trip down to San Diego and ate here with my girlfriend and her dad. He lives in SD and recommended the place. I was really surprised by the line reaching around the building. Which hadn't gotten smaller even by the time we had finished eating and were walking out. Bottom line, its worth the wait. once and awhile they will have servers go down the line and give out free samples of onion rings which are amazing. Good idea because I was getting pretty hungry while waiting. I had a little bit of everything to eat. Can't say enough good things about it. Best BBQ I've ever had. Whenever I head down to SD I will for sure be coming here again. I only hope they will open a location closer to LA.

I'm giving it a 3.5, better than Ok, but not quite a fan. Why? Mostly because of the food. Line: Went in the beginner of October. Despite the announcement that says.. Summer is over, and the lines might be shorter: This is untrue. Had to wait approx an hour at 7:30pm on a Sunday night. Bright side: Once you get to the corner.. and it says.. only 22min however many seconds.. its quite accurate. From the corner, took us about 25 minutes to get to the cashier. Don't get initimated by the lines... its moves quite relatively fast. I also was entertained with the jumbo sign that welcomed Yelpers! That allowed me to put it as a 4 star, instead of a 3 star.. for my 3.5 star rating :P Don't be afraid to voice your concern, as they try to aim to please (I didn't really had anything to complain about). Not much service contact after your cashier. Make your order, get your buzzer, seat yourself. People might think its like herding cattle, but it was a fun experience :) Food: Going to eat BBQ? Get Baby back ribs on top of baby back ribs on  top of more baby back ribs. Yes they might be substationally smaller than the beef ribs, but they taste a lot better, and less more tendon filled. They are good BBQ baby back ribs do doubt, but My dad makes them better (might not be fair to compare, as I haven't found a place that does it better than my dad). The downside was that.. (i forget if u get 8-10 or 10-12 ribs when you order the combo for ~$20) but its always the smaller number of ribs that you get :P Was kinda disappointed, because my ribs were in the smaller size so it didn't make up for the portion. Side of fries was not hot or fresh. I really enjoyed the sweet beans tho :) Chicken: dark meat was yummy, white meat not so much. But thats preference. All in all: Whatever type meat.. the sauce is the same.. so go for the best.. and get yourself the baby back, baby back ribs! Want the bib experience? They still provide plastic bibs if you'd like. All in all.. I've had better experiences in other baby back rib dives. And better deals with All-You-Can-Eat prices. But yea, I wouldn't mind going back to Phils. Tip: Don't want to wait in line? There is no line after 9PM. Oh.. and they have a newer location in Carlsbad too! Less of a line up, for the same flavor and experience (minus waiting in line experience).

I wish I could leave 6 or even 7 stars for this place because it is just THAT good!! I'm simply in love with the El Toro (bbq tri tip) sandwich! I get it every time and it is still just as tasty as the first time. However I've also tried almost everything else such as the ribs, chicken, onion rings...and it's all phenomenal! There's usually a line out the door and even around the building a lot of the time, but it moves reasonably quick and the food is totally worth the wait. I've recommended Phil's to numerous friends and family and no one ever leaves dissatisfied. The proportions are huge, so come hungry and leave happy! Enjoy!

OMG, I find it REALLY hard to believe this place was voted best BBQ in San Diego Magazine as well as has as high of a rating as it does.  My husband and I being new to the area went to Phil's it was near the hotel we were staying at.  This BBQ is a Joke.  And has nothing on Southern BBQ real BBQ the meat was flavorless and the sauce bland. If you've had real southern bbq most likely this place will be a huge disappointment.   And the lines wow it's like when Oprah or some celebrity says a pair of the ugliest shoes are so cute and thousands of  people go out to buy them , just the day before they would have passed right by.  People see a big line at Phil's and say it must be good ...umm no, that's part of the strategy. Long lines mean good food??? not necessarily. Very disappointed in Phil's. BTW My husband and I have had BBQ in San Diego twice (different places) and have been disappointed both times.

Substantially adequate. I'm a little mixed on this place.  I happened to have a friend visiting from out of town and decided to stop in here to see what all the fuss was about as I am a new San Diego resident myself and haven't been yet.  We tried to go for dinner one night but the line was tooo long and I'm not waiting two hours, so we decides before hitting the beach tomorrow to come for lunch. I would suggest doing the latter as we were secod in line at 10:30 and after that the infamous line at Phils began.  Now I'm going to say you don't come to a BBQ joint foe the ambience or service you go for the food!!!! I ordered the pork rib platter with fries, and onion rings ad everyone said it was great.  The ribs were not fall off the none tender as everyone here says so.  They were okay but lacked the seasoning I was hoping for.  The fries were okay and the onion rings extra greasy, now I'm all for greasy onion rings but these were a little much.

4.5 stars. Damn....this place is crazy packed all the time! Pretty much you're gonna find yourself waiting in a longgg line no matter what time you get here. And when I say line, I mean an actual line cuz you're lining up to order your food at the cashier. You seat yourself after ordering. Me and the bf decided to stop by before heading to the Dodgers v. Padres game. We got there at around 3pm, only to find a 45 minute wait ahead of us. Would I wait again? Most definitely, especially since I don't head down to SD that often. Awesome BBQ! It was our first time there and I was pleasantly surprised at how reasonable the prices were. Given how many reviews there are for this place, I'll keep it short and sweet. We got the baby back ribs tickler ($6.45) and the bbq broham sandwich ($6.45). I think the tickler is perfect and definitely worth it. I wanted to try their onion rings but knew we couldn't finish a whole order so the 2 that came with the tickler was enough to satisfy my curiosity. Sooo good! The broham sandwich was pretty good as well. I felt it could use a little more cole slaw because there was too much bbq sauce, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I'll probably ask for the bbq sauce on the side next time. I think I read on the menu that you can do that. Overall, a great experience. The line was even longer after we left so bottom line....be prepared to wait!!

Went here for the 86th time or so this Saturday. Pretty awesome experience as usual. Now they have beers in the waiting line, which is good because a dad can bomb 2 beers before you get through the line and into the family area (where I dont think beer is allowed, if it is, then let me know.) Food was good, and the waiter was real nice, he actually brought me some silverware, and I thought this was a self server kind of place. Overall, its always a pleasure to eat at Phils. I would come here more often, but I am fat, and I need to lose weight, sorry Phils.

Everytime I goto San Diego I must come to phil's barbeque. I tell my friend each time we return who has the same name.

I tried Phil's when it was in Mission Hills and thought "eh, it's alright."  I can be a little finicky so I gave it another shot. "Eh, it was alright again." I prefer a different bbq joint in SD over Phils BUT they truly shine at atmosphere and customer service.  The ladies is the "greeting line" were nothing short of amazing, they were very warm and welcoming.  The restaurant was clean, the staff was very friendly and attentive.  They have hit the mark on an atmosphere that is inviting and ready for good times.

The ribs and chicken are juicy and scrumpdiliocious. The meat on the ribs fall off the bone ever so lightly. Mmmmmmmm~ The fries are highly recommended as well as the macaroni salad. To avoid wasting your life by waiting in line, I suggest ordering to-go. That way, you can proceed to the front of the line, pick up your food, and stuff yourself with MEAT as soon as possible.

Stopped here on a trip down to SD to pick up a car. The line was super long, but that's always the sign of a good place.  It was most definitely worth it though! Probably my the best BBQ I've ever had. The sauce is pretty sweet, but I personally like that. The ribs fell off the bone but still had some texture to them. The people working were very friendly and even fed us little snacks as we waited in line.  Can't think of anything to complain about. It was pretty much a perfect BBQ meal.

Finally came to Phil's BBQ on a Sunday afternoon (~3:30PM) and waited in line for a little over an hour. I've heard so much about this place and did it disappoint? Not at all! My favorite was the baby back rib but the beef ribs were also very good and the meat just fell off the bone. We also got the potato salad side, french fries, and corn. All were good delicious except the fries were just regular fries, nothing special. I deducted one star for the long wait - I know it's not really their fault bc it's just so darn good and popular, but I don't think I'd wait an hour for their food again. Instead, I'll probably phone-in my order and eat elsewhere next time. Definitely a must-try though!

DELISH!  Very tasty and lean pulled pork sandwhiches.  The BBQ sauce is just perfect.  The lines are a little long, but for good reason.  You know you are going to have good food at a place that has long lines!  Go there and enjoy it.  It's fantastic!

Best in San Diego and easily on par with Memphis' finest BBQs! BBQ chicken is outstanding! Thick juicy onion rings that are beer battered! Take home a sauce and rub. Sauce is the boss!

When you come to Phil's you are automatically greeted with a long line wrapping around the building, no matter what time of the day you come. It is not a fast moving line. Actually very slow. You can expect to wait in line for an hour or even longer. There are many places where you can decide what you would like to get before hand, which is great because you definitely have enough time to decide for those who are indecisive like me. We choose the baby back rib dinner with fries and beans. When I went to order the girl was extremely friendly and helpful. All of the staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make it a good experience. Pretty soon after we ordered our food was ready. The ribs had a lot of sauce on them and there was a large portion of fries served as well. One thing I did not like it that the ribs had many spots that were charred or blackened. Those pieces ruined it for me. Also the sauce was not very appetizing either. I don't want to sound rude but I have had better BBQ ribs at Chili's. All of the people I was with also agreed. I honestly don't think the hour wait is worth it. I guess maybe so you can have the experience and really know what the ribs are like. I most definitely won't be going back there again. It's almost like going skydiving, you do it once so you can have the experience but you most likely won't do it again, that is how I feel about Phil's. I would rather have Chili's than the ribs here. I don't think they are horrible but did not appeal to me or the group I was with. It was a little disappointing especially after waiting in a line for more than an hour.

The best bbq I've had.  Living in Los Angeles there just aren't any good bbq joints in so cal and Phil's was certainly the first.  The ribs are soft, moist and juicy that easily come off the bone.  Bbq sauce was great too.  Definite revisit just wish they had one in Los Angeles.

Phil's, oh Phil's... where do I begin?  You are a fantastic treat and almost always worth the wait.  I usually order the Broham with coleslaw on the side and a few french fries (usually pilfered from other plates around me).      This meal is absolutely delicious! To avoid the wait, call your order in, pick it up and go enjoy it at a local park.  You don't need to sit in the restaurant to have an incredible BBQ meal!

This has been the second time I have ever been to Phil's BBQ. The first time I came here was approximately two years ago from now, and my most current experience, I must say, was the better one. I used to groan at the mention of Phils BBQ, but now I actually really enjoy this place. Besides the horrendous line that encircles the restaurant, Phils BBQ is a great place. What I order: 1. Beefy Rib & Chick-less Dinner ($12.45) [2 Bones with chunks of white breast meat chicken seasoned & BBQ'd] -Sides: Coleslaw + Fries -If you want nothing but meat meat meat, definitely get the Beefy Rib. The Beefy Rib is much larger than the baby back ribs. I personally prefer the Beefy Rib over the baby back ribs because there is just so much more meat! Dont be discouraged at the sight of "2" bones, trust me two is more than plentyyyyy. And definitely get the chick-less chicken. It is way better and more flavorful than the chicken with the bone. The boneless chicken is much more tender and juicy than the boned chicken. The meat falls right off the Beefy Rib and honestly, the amount of meat from two beefy rib equals more than the amount of meat on half rack of baby back ribs. If you get a full Beef Rib dinner, which I have seen other people get before, you get sick of the dish after 2 bones anyway. So why not change your taste buds a little and get the best of both worlds! Chicken and Ribs! This is definitely the best combination at Phils and from now on I will always get it this way and nothing else! I really like their coleslaw. Better than a lot of other places to be honest. The fries tasted average, nothing spectacular about the fries. Overall this is a great bbq joint. My advice is to come earlyyyyyy. Especially when you have a large party, definitely come early. For dinner, you want to get here around 5pm because after 5pm, the line gets HUMUNGUSSSSSSS!!! (:

Best BBQ I've had east of the Mississippi, Phil's is legit.  Went with a group and was able to try a few things - Baby Back Ribs - 5/5 - melt off the bone tender and not in a "overcooked next day" kind of way.  Super moist and tender in a "they know how to bbq a rib" way.  They pre-cut the ribs so you don't have to rip them apart with your hands, just pick up a rib and take a bite.  They use a tangy Memphis-style sauce that works. El Toro Tri Tip Sandwich - 5/5 - soft bread, GREAT tri tip.  It's not like a brisket where the meat is in chunks, it's sliced super thin almost like deli cut ham, and tossed in bbq sauce so the meat is coated.  I could eat one of these with a side of onion rings every day. Onion Rings - 5/5 - the best onion rings i've ever had.  They're HUGE and come battered and super crispy.  They come with a ranch dip but I like them in old fashioned Heinz ketchup.  These onion rings would be great with anything made out of meat. Coleslaw - 5/5 compared to other coleslaws, 4/5 as a side because I'm not a big fan of coleslaw in general.  I grew up on KFC coleslaw which as you know is super sweet and crunchy.  Other coleslaws to me are not as crisp and taste like cabbage coated in mayonnaise and black pepper.  Phil's coleslaw has the KFC crunch, and a slight sweetness to it that was familiar to me. Macaroni Salad - 3/5 - a little too mayonnaisey for my tastes.  Looking back on the meal the macaroni salad didn't stand out as anything memorable or special. Corn On The Cob - N/A - a full whole ear of corn.  Didn't bother taking a bite because that would take up stomach space for ribs. If you live in LA this place is arguably worth the drive along.  Note that I went on a weekday at 11:15pm and the line was already out the door to the parking lot so get there early.  Line goes pretty fast but remember you also have to wait for the food so it could be almost an hour from the time you get there to the time you start eating.

No question, this is our favorite bbq in San Diego and anywhere.  Everything is melt-in-your-mouth good. Of course, I miss the atmosphere of the North Park location, but don't miss the long wait there (even after you'd ordered your food), and the food at the "new" (though not so new anymore) Midway location is just as good. We love it, the kids love it, enough said.

Imagine great ribs, GREAT sauce, great sides. Lives up to the hype. Amazing Ribs, Great Food and Help (not that much is needed anyways) Usually a bit busy but for GOOD reason and definitely WORTH THE WAIT. Will be returning time and time again ps- also has a few veggie dishes as well

bomb dot com. i had ribs once and i hated it. i ate a rib here and the bone was CLEAN. the chicken dinner was delicious. juicy, and slathered in their BBQ sauce which has a hint of spicyness. the baked potato is OMG worthy. cheese that ooey gooey and melty inside with butter and sour cream? its a heart attack thats waiting to happen and so worth having. the onion rings are delicious. no stringy onion pieces that come out of the batter when you take a bite. you get a good amount of onion in every mouthful and its deeeelicious. they have onion rings that are bigger than some of the bracelets i own! french fries are hot, crispy, and like crack when sprinkled and tossed with the seasoning thats at every table. i didnt even use ketchup!!! come here when you're starving, or with other starving people.

One of the places I wanted to go to the most in San Diego was Phil's BBQ and it certainly didn't disappoint.  I went on a weekend and we made it in the line just outside the sign that says it'll take 20 minutes.  I'm happy to report that it was worth the wait.  I ended up ordering the beefy rib dinner that consisted of 3 beefy ribs and 2 sides.  The beefy rib was slathered in delicious tangy barbeque sauce.  The meat was soft enough to use a fork to detach from the bone.  It was awesome and the portions are large.  I had cole slaw and potato salad as the sides.  They were both tasty and the potato salad had chunky potatoes in it.  I also had a piece of the baby back ribs and it was delicious too.  They have rolls of paper towels on each table and they give you a wet napkin at the end of your meal, so don't worry about getting some saucy goodness on your fingers.

Why has it taken me so long to eat at this place. This place is on point with everything from the sides to the baby back ribs and beef ribs. I am very picky with my BBQ and this place has it all from the sauce to the smokey flavor even if you do not add sauce to the ribs itself. The meat, no kidding you, falls right off the bone and the BBQ Pull Pork sandwhich is really good. To the other reviews who said the smokey flavor was not there must like Lucille's which in my opinion is the bottom dweller of all BBQ. Over 3000 people cannot be wrong for this place. The wait is worth it!!!

Decent BBQ, the sauce isn't the best but the meat was perfect. I like my sauce a little peppery, and their sauce is really sweet. Their onion rings are amazing and HUGE! I've had the the broham and the tri-tip sandwiches, and I really enjoyed the tri-tip. Their buns are super tasty as well. Go when they first open for lunch at 11 on weekdays and there is barely any wait. Overall though, good BBQ and service. I wouldn't recommend going when there is a line that stretches all the way around the building, the food isn't that special. It's good, but not worth waiting in line for. Definitely a place to get good BBQ though.

Took my girlfriend, visiting from Seattle, to San Diego and we both decided to go hit up Phil's BBQ, since we've heard about them from numerous friends and family as well as seeing them on TV. Got there and the line was extremely long, and we were about 35-45 minutes away from the front of the line......was worth the wait though! The food was delicious, and made sure that I had some to bring back home too. Don't be intimidated by the long line, like they say "good things come to those that wait", in this case good BBQ!

These ribs are fantastic! but you don't need me to tell you that. Just read the thousand other reviews on them. Their macaroni salad is awesome, so is their coleslaw. I live a couple hours from San Diego, and I visit every month or so, and next time I visit, I'll be looking forward to coming here. We had to wait about 20 minutes in line, but since we were only a party of 2, we got to go ahead of the 15 other people in front of us and sit at the bar. Friendly service, SUPERB food. What more do you want?

THE BEST BBQ IN SAN DIEGO!!!! Yes their is always a line but its so worth the wait. If theirs a line from when they open till when they close.... then you know its got to be good. The sauce is outstanding.... and not a thick bbq sauce. No matter what you get, the meat is always tender. All the sides are great also. The onion rings are even better. Onion rings are beer batterd and the best i ever had. Plus... they have sweet tea. Never had a problem with service. You do pick up your food at the front but I always leave a tip. P.s. The line does move quickly, the most I ever waited was 30 min

Heard about this place from triple d so we decided to give it a try and would definately call this place a keeper.  We were going to do a take out order and phoned it in to them.  That turned out to be the best thing to do with this place because when I showed up there was a line not only out the door but around the building.  They had a seperate line for phone orders so I was in and out in 20 minutes.   The prices are on par with any other BBQ joint with me and the wife getting out for $30.  She had a full rack of baby back ribs and I had a half all white meat chicken, and we shared onion rings.   The onion rings came with a thick and crunchy batter that was just to die for.  The ribs were soft and fell off the bone when I at them.  They were also so flavorful that we could have eaten them without sauce if we wanted.  The chicken was moist for white meat and again could have been eaten without sauce. Now because we the meat was good enough to be eaten without sauce doesn't mean that we ate them without sauce.  The sauce was a perfect balance of flavors, it was  sweet tangy and a little spicy.

I waited for an hour and a half for this meal, which was quite unfortunate since it was rainy and cold outside. However, the food made up for it.  The sauce is what makes this barbeque really special.  I normally don't care for beef ribs since most places make them dry, but I enjoyed the beef ribs here.  I also liked the mashed potatoes, onion rings, and baby backs.  I do not recommend the chicken here though.

Phil's Barbeque in San Marcos is the absolute BEST place for ribs. Would never go anywhere else.  From past experience, I know that I would be disappointed, comparing there's to Phil's Baby Back Ribs. The line moves fast, the employees are extremely nice and helpful and the food is really really good.  Definitely order the baby back ribs.  The Cole Slaw is great.  We often call ahead for take-out pick-up.   We love Phil's Barbeque in San Marcos.

Thanks to my fellow yelpers.. I've decided to phone-in my order because I wasn't going to wait in the rain. The gal over the phone told me it will take approximately 10-15 minutes and they won't bag my order until I get there. It was my first time there and I found the phone-in order line hard to find. There was people everywhere! Some gave me dirty looks as I passed them. I wasn't cutting, but I felt like I was. I was in and out of there in less than 10 minutes! *My full baby back rack was not melting in my mouth. They were a bit dry. *I ordered the dinner, which came with 2 small sides or 1 large side. I chose cole slaw and potato salad. Not the best. *Small order of onion rings was enough for two people. They were huge and so good! The best I ever had...

I love BBQ and this place is really good.  Not the best I have ever had but still pretty good.  The reason I gave 4 stars is because of the variety of food they served.  The really good BBQ places also have sausage and brisket (and more), not only ribs and chicken... We had the baby back ribs and sampled a beef rib.  Both were really good.  We also had the fries, beans and onion rings.  The fries were so good that my gf barely ate any ribs because she loved the fries so much!  Beans and onion were good but not memorable. Yes we did have to wait in line but it only took about 10 mins to order.  We went on a Sunday around noon and we just beat the Church rush by 30 mins.   Keep that in mind if you head there on Sunday. However, it's the best BBQ place that I have been to in So Cal!!  Texas BBQ ftw!

Solid.  That's the first word that comes to mind. Having lived in the South and spent a lot of time in North Carolina, I've had my fair share of good BBQ.  While I do prefer the North Carolina style of vinegar based BBQ sauces, I do enjoy a good slab of ribs from time to time. I ventured here tonight and noticed the long line of people as I entered the place.  Usually I might have left, as I just wanted a quick bite.  I decided to try my luck ordering at the bar, which they allow you to do if you sit AT the bar. I had the half rack of ribs with small sides of the baked beans and the potato salad.  The ribs did fall right off the bone and were very tender.  When it comes to BBQ, though, everyone knows it's mostly about the sauce.  The sauce was definitely solid, but I can't say spectacular.  I did think the beans had a great flavor.  However, my biggest complaint about the beans was that they were mostly sauce with a few tiny beans.  I generally expect the beans in baked beans to be a bit larger.  If you're going to use small beans, at least feature more of them.  I'm fairly picky when it comes to potato salad and would say this one was about average.   I can definitely see why this place gets such high reviews in San Diego.  I feel like it's mostly because San Diego doesn't have a lot of comparable places.  For fans of vinegar based BBQ NC style, this is not the place for you.  For those who want a solid slab of ribs, give it a try. Is it worth waiting an hour or more for? Probably not. However, if you're able to find a seat at the bar on a busy night , it's a solid bet.

Upon first arriving around 7:30pm on a Friday evening, the line circled around the side of the building. We returned around 9pm and waited only five minutes! So go super early or late to avoid the crazy wait. Overall, it was reasonably priced and a fun environment to dine in. Baby Back Ribs- Good El Toro sandwich- Good Onion Rings- Great Sauce- Too Tangy Interesting points about Phil's: A. After waiting in line, you walk up to the register and order like @ fast food places. B. After you order, you have to find a table- which can be difficult when it's super crowded. So have someone go stake a table while you order. C. You receive a pager that alerts you when the food is ready. It gets really chaotic at the pick-up counter because it's small and it seems like everyone orders the same things so verify that you are actually picking up what you ordered! Only one major problem- the wait for the food! Someone "accidentally" picked up our order and they still made us wait a while to pick our order. The manager was totally unapologetic about the mix-up. So we ended up waiting over 25 minutes for our food when people who ordered after us were served first.

I live in the South Bay and it's definitely worth the drive to this place. Like: Beef ribs. End of story. Dislike: The long wait, but that's what happens with popularity, right? Personal note: I've waited in line for a table and although the food is great, sometimes you're so hungry that the long wait can just wear on you -- almost to the point of outright leaving. I highly recommend calling it in and eating the awesome BBQ someplace where you can just get messy with it.

I've eaten at Phil's numerous times but it was a first for me at the Sports Arena location. Drove up on a Sunday around 12:45 pm and the line was crazy long. None the less my friend and I knew the wait would be well worth it. Surprisingly, the line moved quickly and were at the register placing our order shortly after arriving. Until today I had always ordered dinner but it was lunch time and this was a good excuse to try something different. I went with the chik tickler which has chunks of white meat smothered in bbq sauce, a generous bed of french fries, scoop of coleslaw and 2 onion rings. This is more than enough food for lunch. Drinks are self serve with the usual soft drinks you'd see at other restaurants. However, they have a machine that serves sweet black or green tea. I went with the black tea which was a little sweet for my taste but once the ice melted a bit it tasted great. From ordering to finding a table the service was on point. We were seated by the time our drinks were filled. We sat in Kenny's section -   he asked us how our meal was, quickly cleared our table of used up plates, napkins and gave us a few toothpicks and wet-naps so we could clean up. Kenny added that extra touch that takes a restaurant from 4 to 5 stars even if the food is amazing. All in all the new location didn't disappoint but somehow I knew it wouldn't....

They really drown their ribs with the sauce. I'm from Texas so I'm a bit disappointed that they don't have brisket and the bbq is definitely different but I'm not gonna disrespect a place just because it's not like  home. I just don't get that because when in Rome you do as the Romans do. Geez. Lines are long so if you don't like waiting avoid the irritation and phone in an order and do take out. It's San Diego, I'd rather eat by the beach! FYI, the ribless dinner does have more meat. It's still flavorful but not as moist as the pork ribs. The meat is not the same. I'd rather get the pork ribs next time and just get my hands dirty. The onion rings are excellent. The corn tastes awesome when you slather it with butter and barbecue sauce. It's good stuff.

This place was very good, is pretty cheap as far as bbq restaurants go, and I enjoyed how you order first and serve yourself. The babyback ribs were very tender, falling off the bone.  They were not the pork best ribs I've ever had, but they were damned good.  (I don't think they were smoked, since the meat wasn't pink and smokey-sweet, but they might just be the best non-smoked pork ribs I've had.) The beef ribs, however, were the best beef ribs I've ever had.  No questions about it.

The food at Phil's isn't just good, it's "OH MY GOD THIS IS DELICIOUS" good!  Run, don't walk to Phils and have some GREAT BBQ.   Pros: Friendly people, new location MUCH better than old one, super delicious yummy BBQ Cons: Often crowded with a long line, closed Sundays, Mondays and for part of December and January.

Was down in San Diego and a friend suggested that we go to this place for BBQ. He had discovered it the day before and he liked it very much. Now, I'm a big fan of BBQ, but I don't know about waiting 20 or 30 minutes! Luckily on the day that I went the line wasn't that bad. It was about a 5 minute wait but they tried to throws us to the bar. We walk up to the bar and their is no place to sit! The young woman was nice enough to recognize her mistake and let us go ahead infront of the line. We ordered our food and found a place to sit. Won't complain about the food because it was delicisous. Very tasty Pulled Pork Sandwich. Can't say it was the best I've ever had but I rank it towards the top. If you're hungry ... pack a snack for the wait.

Phil's is the best.  I've been going to them since they were up at their old location in Mission Hills.  Yes, there is often a line, but they are pretty darn effiicent with it and get you through it as quickly as possible.  Food this good is worth the wait! My faves: Onion rings that can make your knees buckle The Broham -- pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw.  Brilliant! Baby back ribs -- kind of pricey, but simply delicious. Phil's is not great for groups.  It's just too busy and hard to get a table for a large gathering.  I wouldn't recommend it for any group of more than 6, especially if you're ordering separately. The restaurant itself is very kid-friendly, doesn't mind a mess and is so noisy that no one cares (or notices) if your kids make a minor racket.  BUT the line and wait can sometimes be long, so I guess your own personal enjoyment depeneds on how patient your kids can be :-) Overall, two thumbs way, way, WAY up.

Best BBQ in San Diego... well, best baby back ribs at least. Though I haven't tried much else, and why would you after tasting them, the baby back ribs are delicious.  Tender, lean, and smothered in BBQ sauce. This place is always busy (line out the door), and seating is a self-serve free for all, but the hassle is definitely worth it. I recommend going either very early, or very late on a weekday.  Get the baby back ribs.  Don't wast your time on the chicken or turkey burger (they are dry and take an exorbitant amount of time to prepare... punishment I suppose for deviating from their specialty). One more thing... skip lunch on a Phil's night... you will want the extra room... trust me!

Clearly everyone loves this place, so I won't rave about how amazing they are. I'll just tell you a secret that no one seems to realize... THEY HAVE A BAR! and you can order food there. The line is always ridiculously long but I usually just walk straight to the bar and the bartender lets us order dinner as well. baby back ribs, chickless dinner, AMAZING onion rings (which means a lot for someone who HATES onions) and beer, what more can you ask for!? Sadly, this place is becoming a weekly ritual for me... yummmmm!

Don't know what the fuss is about!  The food is good, but to have lnes out the door is not reaity!  I ordered the rib tickler, with 3 pork ribs , slaw, fries and 2 onion rings.  None of the ribs were more than 3 inches long and barely had any meat on it.  I thik they just throw the ends for this item.  My BF ordered the el toro, which had quite a bit of beef on it and had good taste.  We also tried the beef rib sample and it was good in flavor, but quite tough.  Beef ribs should still fall off the bone and be cooked til tender.  Will probably try this place again and order something else. I now give Phil's 4 stars.  The owner has emailed me back twice to ensure that my next visit will be more satisfactory.  That is a rare occurrence nowadays as everyone is out to make a buck, so his gesture is greatly appreciated that he took the time to improve my experience.  I'm sure he doesn't need my business, but still wants to and takes the time to satisfy each and every customer!   Hats off to Fred the owner!  I now have a better idea of why this place is so popular and worth the wait!

I realize I'm like the 1,100th review, but this place is just the bomb.  Just finished a 3 month stint in San Diego, and tried to make it over once a week... I love BBQ, and this was possibly the best I've ever had.  Great sauce.  Good sized portions.  Relatively cheap.  Awesome, friendly service.  This will be the first place I hit when I'm back in San Diego.

I have lived lots of places that are known for their BBQ from Texas to Tennessee but Phil's puts them all to shame. There is not a lot that I can say that hasn't already been said by others but I recommend this place to anyone who has never had it. The baby back ribs are as tender as they get and the sauce is perfect. To be perfectly honest I have never had anything else on the menu because it would be a waste of a meal to not have at least a half rack. For those that appreciate diversity though, they do have meal options with both chicken and ribs. Get their early to find parking and avoid a long wait (though it is worth it if you are not so lucky).

I go to Phil's so much I'm pretty sure before long they'll change the name to Phil's BBQ at G's Place.  My girlfriend jokes about including Phil's BBQ at our wedding.  I've got so close to Phil I think I might ask him to officiate the ceremony. I was introduced to Phil several years ago by a few of my brothers, Vin and Logan, and will forever be in debted to them for this.   I am particularly partial to to the bbq chicken and macaroni salad at this place.  However, the Arrogant Bastard served at the bar pairs rather well with the Beefy Ribs.  They might have the best onion rings west of the Mississippi.  Phils gets crowded in the evenings, especially on Friday's and Saturday's.  Don't let the line crack you, because you'll be glad you waited. Excellent service paired with phenomenal bbq makes for a recession proof restaurant.

Really good BBQ place! Nothing compares to Phil's! The sauce is different than what I'm used to back home in SCV and I mean that in a good way! I go the full rack dinner meal (kinda pricey) but was so worth it! A lot of food too...ate it 3 times (dinner, lunch, dinner)... CONS: I advise you to get it for take out because the wait is always long! There's literally a line that forms out the door and wraps around one side of the restaurant!

Just got back from here and wish I could find word to describe it. All I can say that the whole experience and food was amazing!!! Can I give it 6 stars? Maybe 10? Anyone who has not been needs to go. I got the baby back ribs and fries. They say 6 ribs yet I got 9 so even better. The meat and sauce was as good as you can get. The pork was falling off the rib and the sauce was to die for. There may be better BBQ out there in the world but in San Diego you cannot get any better, The crew that works makes the experience even better as well, they are truly there for you and it shows. I cannot wait to get back there again and again.

HOLY MOLY! This place is great... I travel miles and miles for this mouthwatering feast... even the sweet tea in the machine is great!!! Long lines, but in a way, I like it that way... I get to stare at everyone else's food and "hunger myself". Then, when I'm about to jump the wall because my mind and belly is going crazy... They're ready for my order. Oh, and to SOUND RACIST... the people there aren't as intimidating as, let's say... Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. Please view my Roscoe's Review, because I love them too. :) What was ordered: Beef Ribs, Baby Back Ribs, BBQ Chicken, side of Onion Rings, Potato Salad, Macaroni Salad, Baked Beans, Cole Slaw, Fries, Sweet Tea... and yes, I am a fat ass. Out of that list: Must order: Everything; however, beef ribs over the baby racks for me if you're debating on one or the other... so-so on the fries and chicken So-so order: Fries are good to have, but I'd rather order another set of Beef Ribs, and the chicken is ok (but I'm not a restaurant chicken order-er person-a-ma-jig). NO order: Nada.

Is Phil's good? Yes. Is it great??? NOOOOOO. The bbq isn't "real" bbq (be it texan, north carolinian, or st louis style) but it's still good enough to go there (though I've never waited more than 5 min here. I don't think I'd wait more than 10 minutes for this food). It's basically meat flavorless meat covered with tasty sauce, which is fine but let's not kid ourselves here... I've had the pulled pork sandwhich a number of times, and it's decent. I'd rather get the ribs though. The sides are also ok (good, but not great). I do think the fries are above average though. Overall, Phil's can fix your craving for bbq, but it is by no means a knockout restaurant on the SD dining scene and in my eyes does not deserve the insane amount of 5-star reviews found here.

I had to wait in line for about 30 minutes but it seems lesser than that because how fast the line shortens. The ribs I had was awesome, and huge portion of fries. Parking was not a problem, and it's not the best BBQ i eaten but its pretty good to me because I got a free meal! lol ;p

Food wise, I love this place, I've been a few times and the ribs are super amazing. I got the full rack, my boyfriend got the chicken, and his brother got the pulled beef sandwich. We got onion rings (which are also some of the best onion rings ever) and we split and it was a good amount, not like exploding or too much. But service wise- kinda creepy how the servers literally perch near you to ask you if you want water, napkins, ranch, etc etc. And when I went with my boyfriend, this girl HIT ON MY BOYFRIEND! Rude! If you can wait the 1hr+ wait, then do it! Good food, creepy service.

The only way I figured to celebrate the end of the school year is to be here at Phil's BBQ. I ordered the half baby back ribs and 1/4 chicken dinner with fries and sweet baked beans. I think I fell in love with the baby back ribs! They were tender and literally fall off the bone. And usually I don't like saucy things but the sauce was absolutely delightful! The chicken had a good smoky flavor that I liked. The fries took half my plate and they were the small order! Also I had ordered a small order of their Onion rings and boy, are they big! They are breaded nicely where over time they don't turn soggy as your meal goes by rather they were nice and crispy. I've never tasted onion rings so crisp! Phil's, makes my list of good BBQ and it is a real gem in SD! Plus when you park outside the air smells of BBQ; so awesome!

May I recommend phoning your orders in to avoid lines on busy nights, otherwise, plan on waiting 20-40 minutes to get in at peak hours. Ribs here are fantastic, plenty of meat that slides right off the bone and the sauce is the best I've tasted. I recommend the beefy ribs myself, and ordering a batch of battered onion rings the size of your face is almost a necessity every time. If you choose to eat in, the staff are as friendly as they get and the drink selection is the largest I've seen at a family joint.

This BBQ spot never fails! The occassion was for my job promotion, so we went on Friday around 6pm. Oh my, The line was long! It was my parents first time here so they were getting second thoughts. I told them the wait is worth it. Me and my little bro waited in line while the others chilled in the car. It took us 1.5 hours to reach the front of the line and we waited around 10-15min for our food. From baby back ribs, beefy ribs to their sloppy joes. The portion of each entree was phenemonal. The prices were affordable too. My little brother got that 7 dollar tickler and that already was too much for him. Expecting their small sides to be skimpy, it was not! It seemed like their small sides were large and their large was jumbo. The family & I were satisfied and recommend this spot to all.  A+++ for this joint.

A San Diego landmark for sure. I tried the baby back ribs, BBQ chicken, and the beef ribs. Both the baby back and beef ribs are very good, cooked to perfection, and falling off the bone. The sauce is awesome. The BBQ chicken was good, but I don't the chicken absorbs the bbq sauce as well as the slow cooked pork and beef ribs. There was a huge line, but it is well worth the wait. Must try if you're down in San Diego.

People in California wouldn't know good BBQ if it slapped 'em in the face. I don't see why people rave so much about this place. I mean, it's okay, but it's not that great. Everything is slathered in too much sauce & although it's not terribly expensive, I'd rather just go to a buffet for mediocre food.

Locals will cheer, BBQ snobs will find it reasonably decent. (15+ visits) One of our favorites - the food is great (well, for California), portions are generous without being too big, and the prices are ... well, a little high for a place without waiters, but if you check the omnipresent line at front door you can't say they're priced above what the market will bear. Out the door, you're looking at about $17 per person. Expect to wait 30 minutes on a weeknight, and we've not been so brave and / or desperate to test a weekend. Take-out is always an option - call ahead, eat it at home, and avoid the line (or at least most of it). And yes, they're using real wood smoke to flavor their meat - you can smell it (in a very good way)  from half a mile away. I don't see how people living nearby avoid going slowly insane from this. The meat tends to be leaner-than-average for BBQ; they rely more on the smoke and the sauce for flavor. I actually prefer this - it reduces the impact on the waistline by a few notches. The "Ribless Meal" has become our favorite has - large chunks of very lean meat with sauce. BBQ affectionados (especially from out-of-state) will find plenty to quibble about - the sauce relies too heavily on sugar (actually, high-fructose corn syrup - even worse) and isn't terribly complex, etc. But you don't visit or live in Cali for the BBQ. And as local variants go, this is the best we've found so far.

Voted Americas best BBQ for the last 100 years or so. Phil is a genius. Anyone that ever said that their mom was a better cook is a liar. If you are thinking about opening a BBQ in San Diego, forget about it. People would drive by your crusty shack on the way to Phil's. I've seen Ninjas eating their, real ninjas! Vegetarians become carnivorous after only a few short moments in Phil's. If you wanted to meet God all you would have to do is go to Phil's and wait, it would just be a matter of time before he/she showed up again. The BBQ sauce cures cancer (hey it's worth a try). If we sent one plate of food from Phil's BBQ to Afghanistan the terrorists would give up and the war would be over. I get the beef ribs and corn on the cob. That is what you should get too. After one bite you immediately regret ever having eaten at another BBQ place. The meat falls off the bone and has no fat at all. The corn is made with special magic and never gets stuck in between your teeth. "I go to Phil's BBQ all the time" is the best pick up line ever. Women love Phil's BBQ and would rather eat their then go shopping or hang out with their family. If you are having trouble with your wife just take her to Phil's and she will forgive you for what ever you want. If you want BBQ go to Phil's or just starve.

I am a semi-vegetarian and I don't eat meat (I eat seafood) but I really enjoyed my visit here. I had the caesar salad with the homemade dressing... very tasty. I also had the baked potato which was very well baked but it came with butter in a small container, I was expecting some whipped butter. The best part was the service, when I picked up my food a server offered to help me to my table, and the "bussing" waitress was very friendly. Finding a table is a tricky task, be prepared!

What can I say?!!! Phil's has cornered the market!! I remember years ago about watching a news piece on the problems neighbors were having with the first Phil's location and the bbq smoke. Yeah, they were complaining on how good it was?!!! Good indeed!! Though I've never been to that location, the Point Loma one is my bbq choice! I've been to numerous bbq places and yes each are different with their own preparation styles and food, but there is just something about Phils that keeps me coming back? When I really, really, really figure it out, I'll let you know. Place is just great. Food is great and the staff must have been to customer service academy because someone is always striking a conversation and checking to see how everything is. Top notch!! Though the wait to be seated may seem like a lifetime, I guess all good things come to those who wait! I love the fact that you can now go their website and check the bbq cam! That camera is positioned right by the front door and you can usually see how long that line is and even if it's wrapped around the building. Funny, they even have a marker outside stating, "From this point will take you X amount of minutes." Hahahaha! Just like a Disneyland ride! Well, bring it on and let's ride the bbq roller coaster!!

DISCLAIMER:  I love BBQ sauce, especially the good kind. I say this because I see a lot of criticism here for too much sauce, so you will not hear that from me.  I also am a fan of bold BBQ sauce (as opposed to sweet or overly spicy), and this is what you get here.  A good comparison would be Famous Dave's original. I've been meaning to check this out for a long time, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The El Toro was a great value, overflowing with meat for only $6.95.  Very tasty.  I would also put the pork and beef ribs up with the best in Southern California (though the competition is admittedly not that stiff here). My only complaint was that the beef ribs were a bit pricey in relation to the pork ribs, especially when the beef ribs are typically much cheaper than pork ribs at the grocery store.  It's as if they charge based on meat volume as opposed to market price.  But, they were very meaty.

Best restaurant ribs, ever. The baby back ribs were as good as the ones I smoke at home. I don't care for beef ribs, but these were meaty and delicious. The chicken was tender and delicious. The colossal onion rings were crispy and delicious. The baked beans were excellent. When we first arrived there, we actually left because of the insane line allllll the way out the door and around the corner and down the side of the building. We ended up going back an hour or so later, and the line had depleted (probably due to it being almost 9pm), so we decided why not? Soooo happy we did. It was fantastic, and we were very, very happy.

OK.. for the record, I hate pork, i'm super sensitive to the smell, i hardly ever eat it.. and I hate ribs, the ones i've had in the past are tough and chewy/rubbery.. so my first time a Phil's i shared with my bf and we got the best of both (baby back and chickless) i mostly ate the chicken then he made me try the ribs because he said they were awesome.. reluctantly I took a bite.. and WOW OMG.. it was love at first bite! the meat was soooooo delicious, no pork smell, no toughness.. it just fell off the bone.. the sauce is awesome! Definitely the BEST ribs EVER.. it's the only place i would ever eat ribs! :) We come back here all the time.. definitely worth the long wait in line!

Hubby suggested we eat here since he read good reviews on this place and he said he saw this on the Travel Channel.  As we pulled into the parking lot I was shocked to see the line wrap around the restaurant.  Just seeing that made think maybe we shouldn't eat here.  Hubster was adamant on eating there so he decided to wait in line while me & the kids stay in the car.  He called me again once he was near the front of the restaurant.  So the kids & I walked over and waiting in line with him.   We ordered: The Full Rib dinner w/ 2 small sides (fries & coleslaw) Half Chicken dinner w/2 small sides(macaroni & potato salad) Colossal onion rings It was simply delish!  Loved the way the meat just falls off the bone and the BBQ sauce is excellent!  I wasn't much of a fan of the chicken.  The onion rings were great especially dipping them in the BBQ sauce!  The sides were not a disappointment either!   Just to make it short & to the point it was good!  Planning to go there again.

Most of my friends who are out of town always want to eat at Phil's BBQ whenever they come down to San Diego but I have always avoided the place because it's known for ribs and pulled pork, things I do not eat.  Fortunately they did have a chicken portion to their menu and I particularly enjoyed the fact that the Chick-less Dinner, which is what I ordered, was made of boneless, skinless chicken breast, my favorite meat.  Portion sizes are huge, which prompted the running joke from my large group of friends to call the ribs dinosaur bones.  The BBQ sauce on my chicken was delicious but I enjoyed it better with some hot sauce mixed in it.  It was a perfect condiment to dip my fries in yum!  I ordered potato salad as my other side and found it delicious as well. I am giving Phil's 4 stars not just because of the long lines always associated with this popular San Diego establishment but because of the inconsistencies we encountered during our visit.  We had about 15 people in our party and they were very accommodating to us, however, one of my friends had uncooked pieces of french fries in her plate, and another friend (who had her 4 year old son with her) had her order completely left out.  She and her son ended up having to take her food to go because by the time one of the employees had realized her order was left out she and her son had eaten off of my cousin's plate and the rest of our party were almost done eating.

Phil's, oh Phil's.  I really don't understand some of the ridiculous hype surrounding the place.  I read somewhere that people would take trips down from Los Angeles to come down here and eat?  That's a bit far, but I suppose everyone needs something to believe in. It's very, very solid barbecue.  The one redeeming thing about being saddled with teams as unsavory as the Padres and the Chargers is that you can take food like this to-go to watch your sorry San Diego-based sports franchises get pummeled mercilessly.   The baby back ribs-- excellent.  I mean, pink, charred, vulnerable to the fork, melting at the bite with delicious smoky-pork flavor, and smothered in that delicious, almost-spicy barbecue sauce.  This is Lucille's on steroids. The french fries are a thicker cut of In-N-Out fries, and no, they don't taste good in their barbecue sauce, but if you dine in, they have bottles of Malt Vinegar on hand-- you know, for those of us of a cockney'd persuasion.  Count me in. Onion rings-- my goodness.  Delicately balanced onion flavor with considerable heft.  Giant, olympic-sized hoops of deep-fried glory served with an equally delicate ranch.  If I weren't with the family, I might have gotten myself a Heineken to wash it all down.  But I was.   Lots of college students; it's loud, obnoxious, and thoroughly delicious.  Phil gets four stars but a full recommendation to at least try once. As for driving down from the Holiest of Holies just to have it?  I love Phil's, but I've had better, too.

Yes. I know that almost all the reviews say that the line is long. And it is true, BUT the line goes by pretty fast. They have an employee designated to just going through the line to make sure that everything runs smoothly, even for large parties. I went with 8 of my girlfriends on a Thruday night around 7pm. I was expecting it to be a disaster in finding a table for us amongst the rush hour, but since the employee knew we were a big party, by the time we ordered our food, they already had a cleared table that fit all of us. They even had an employee inside that was designated to the larger parties. He kept clearing our plates as we were done and brought us ranch, extra plates, etc. Service was absolutely great despite how busy they were. Vegetarians: They have items on the menu for you too! They have vegetarian burgers with their bbq sauce as well. So you still get to try what everyone raves about. Their sauce is simply the best. You will never find anything else out there like it. It is sweet, tangy, and just simply delicious!!!! MUST TRY!!!

With well over 2,000 positive reviews I was saying the same thing you are thinking: "How the Hell can it be that good? It has to be all hype". Yes, I heard about this place on the Food Network (which can sometimes lead you wrong), but I just had to try this place for myself. Even if it meant waiting in line for 20 minutes to order. The bottom line is this: Phil's BBQ makes WITHOUT A DOUBT the best f-ing tri-tip sandwich I have ever had in my life!!! I seriously do not have the time to describe in detail how flavorful this thing is. It is called the "El Toro" and ya kinda have to try it! As an added bonus, the onion rings just so happened to kick ass too! This place is worth all the hype.

We've been a fan of Phil's since they were up in Hillcrest at that little tiny converted house- we actually miss that location since it was not as crowded before the masses discovered it. The new location is huge and many nights it is operating at  capacity. Unfortunately, Phil has decided to become politically active, having thrown fundraisers for the likes of Carl DeMaio- unfortunately that does not work for me- such a shame. I like my restaurants like I like my musicians- do you job and keep your mouth shut about politics- we won't be going back.

Best BBQ Ever! These are by far the best ribs I've ever had.  No ribs can compete after you've eaten here.  You gotta get the baby back ribs, some onion rings, and a good beer (preferrably an Arrogant Bastard by Stone Brewery).   This place can get really busy, so it's best to go in the middle of the day around 3pm.  Otherwise, you might be waiting by the side of the building for atleast 45 minutes.  One you're in, the service is very fast and friendly.   If you want to skip the whole line, you can call ahead for some take out and just pick it up and go. If you're in San Diego and have not eaten here, then you MUST!

I always take my out of town friends here... It's not the best bbq i've ever had (the best is in Alabama)...but undeniably the best in San Diego. There is a long wait, but if you avoid going during prime lunch time and after work...the wait is not long at all. I like to either order: 1. Pork rib tickler (no substitutes on the sides though) 2. Beef rib tickler (I normally don't like eating beef ribs, but the meat just falls right off the bone!) 3. Side of onion rings (they give a bunch, so its definitely share-able) 4. The Toro 5. The Broham My husband likes to order the ribs dry so he asks for the sauce on the side. Me, I'm super saucy ;) so I ask for extra when I pick up the order along with a side of ranch! I know quite a few people who likes to order the chicken tickler, but I'm not that big of a fan of dry white meat. But if you are...I heard its pretty good!

We only ordered take-out since every time I've gone there, there is a huge line outside the place! We called and the wait time was around 30min-1hr wait on a Sunday night. So we decided to place a phone order instead. It was definitely faster -15-20mins wait. But there is a wait line for take out. For phone orders, you order your food and go inside to pay first so they can get you your order. The 15min wait is because there is a line for phone orders! but once you pay, they pack your food and it's quick. The baby back ribs are to die for and their bbq sauce has just the right amount of spicy. The meat just peels right off the bones! This place is definitely worth the wait!

It was raining, and about 5:00. I had read reviews about Phil's and decided to order out instead of taking my 91 year old mom out into the rain. I called my order in, and I am so glad I did. There was already a big line at 5 in the evening. The onion rings were awesome. I made the mistake of ordering the large order, and giving myself a bellyache because I ate so many. If I would have ordered the smaller order of onion rings, it would have been enough. I don't like to eat too much sugar, so I was able to get the BBQ sauce on the side for the ribs. That way, I didn't have to eat the sauce and my mom could add as much as she wanted. The ribs were great! The sides were good, too. For barbecue, and feeding the masses Phil's the way to go. The only potential problem I can see is being crowded, and having to wait in line. If you are starving, you may want to call your order in, and eat it in your car...

1. Get there early for dinner. We arrived at 5PM on Friday night and were in a short line, but 15 minutes later the line to get in was Looong. I mean like the Space Mtn. line on a Labor Day weekend, Long. 2. If you have young kids, you won't find much on the menu specifically for them. 3. The best BBQ I've had this side of Mississippi. The Beef ribs were Huge. Lots of meat. Sauce is dark red and has a great kick to it without burning your lips off. And I loves me some well made coleslaw with my ribs. Phil's coleslaw is the best I've eaten. 4. The place is noisy, crowded and it's order-and pick-up-at-the-counter style. So, if you are looking for a lightly populated, sit down place where it's calm and quiet, may I suggest your nearest Denny's at about 7PM on a Tuesday night. I would have rated a 5 Star except for the fact that there is nothing close to a kids menu. Come on Phil, you know we all live for our kids. Show some love to the munchkins.

Overrated! But good. This place is good to go to every once in awhile, but if the wait is too long I'd say it's not worth it.  I've been here 4 times, and I'm usually pretty satisfied when I leave.  I've had: Their baby back ribs are delicious, sweet tangy sauce and fall-off-the-bone tender.  Only complaint is that it doesn't seem that HOT when you get it. Chicken is alllright.  Tastes just like the ribs, but in chicken form. Onion rings are decent, but with all that batter it can get gross after awhile. Corn on the cob was a regular corn on the cob, and coleslaw, despite the rave reviews I thought was just alright.  Baked potato was decent as well. All in all, it's a good place for ribs (especially for the price), but if the line's more than half an hour I wouldn't recommend it.

Five Baby Back Rib dinners for our party and each and every one a winner.  So tender and falling off the bone.  The beans are great! The french fries seemed even better than usual.  We went for the large serving of onion rings this time and it was a good thing, there wasn't a one left.  We love the tangy BBQ sauce that is Phil's alone, in fact I usually buy a bottle when we are there and have even ordered it on line and have had it sent to relatives in Illinois!  I have to brag and say that we have been going to Phil's since they had a very small 'house' in Mission Hills, The great thing is the yummyness and friendliness has stayed the same, only the games to keep you busy while waiting are gone... Ok, I'm a people person.  Who waits on me and how, matters, so if you're like me there's another reason to love Phil's.  I don't know how they do it, but they have a staff of warm caring people who are so willing to do whatever it takes to make your dinner special.  We love it!

Generous, delicious portions and a lot of food for your dollar makes Phil's a mandatory stop for any meat eating American who passes through San Diego.

If you haven't tried Phil's BBQ then you are missing out. Their ribs and chicken are so tender and juicy, the taste buds explodes in your mouth once you take the first bite. I believe this place is known for their BBQ sauce which is its own. You can buy a bottle at the front desk and make your own Phil's BBQ at home. This place can get quite pack and waiting time is maybe around 10-25 mins. The best part about Phils is the price. Good price with good food equals a must try. Try it out! You wont be dissapointed.

Stopped by to see what all the fuss was about. Saturday, 1:00 pm = late lunch. There is a huge line (probably 80-100 people) itching to get in. Admittedly, I entered the premises as a skeptic. I've eaten at some great restaurants and there are only a handful of which I'd wait more then 30 minutes to eat. So here it goes... Setting: Situated in a VERY SMALL shopping center. What does that mean and why am I placing emphasis on "very small?" Parking. If you can't park, you can't eat. There are not enough spaces to accommodate all potential eaters. People were sitting in cars waiting to park. A truck cut off a slew of cars and ended up doing what looked like a 25 point turn trying to park in a spot that was too small. With the long lines, sometimes extending into the parking lot, people had a difficult time backing out of their parking spot, perpetuating the problem. Once you find yourself in line, it's all about patience. There is a small bar near the door that can serve drinks (alcoholic and sodas) to help lessen the pain of waiting in line. Once inside, you notice one thing. IT's LOUD!!! There are a lot of people moving around (both employees and customers) which makes it very easy to spill or have an accident. People are all screaming to be heard over the next table. Televisions are on. Tables were situated a little too close together - every time someone would walk behind me, they'd bump my chair. I'm just lucky I didn't drop any food onto my clothes. Definitely a lively place. Individual grade: 3.5 stars. Waiters/Waitresses: The waitress that brought us to our table relatively quickly. This portion of the review is to primarily grade the waitress who tended to our table. There were others (lady directing customers to the cashier to order, cashier lady, lady calling out numbers, lady bringing food to table). All were efficient, which serves a place with a high customer turnover rate well. However, it limits the friendliness of the service that customers are generally accustomed to when eating at restaurants. The waitress at our table cleaned everything up very quickly and greeted us with somewhat of a half-effort smile. The table to our right had Alfredo. Two words: Shameless flirting. It was painful watching him giggle with his target. In the span of 30 minutes, he made 7 trips to that table. At times, another customer would ask for his help and he would just scream his response while refusing to budge from his position which allowed for maximal flirting exposure. Individual grade: 3 stars Food: Ordered the BBQ baby back ribs, complete rack with small side orders of macaroni salad, cole slaw, and onion rings. Individual grade: 4.5 stars RIbs: WOW!!! The meat literally falls off the bone! The sauce has a hint of honey and a kick. Simultaneously, that's like having an _____ (looks similar to the word "organism") in your mouth. The only drawback is that I wish we could have had more. The complete rack definitely came from one of the smaller animals selected for harvest. Try adding some of the hot sauce (on the table). Macaroni salad - Very tasty. The perfect complement to the texture and flavor of the ribs. The small pieces of pasta were all cut in half. The perfect mixture of mayonnaise and spices. Cole slaw - light and refreshing. Also complemented the ribs well. Simultaneously sweet and sour. Onion rings - HUGE! Still, some of the rings had a little too much breading on it. The onions were fresh. Each bite gave you the crunchiness of the fried breading with the moist juicy expulsion of juices from the actual onion. Served with ranch dressing. Drinks: Water. Sorry. Individual grade: Incomplete. Recommendation: EAT! At least once. I'm not sure I'd ever crave Phil's bbq. However, I wouldn't be averse to eating there if someone recommended it.

the big sis brought back one of the pulled pork sandwiches from Phil's after visiting the lil sis in SD. after a couple of hours in a car ride, one would think it would not, could not, tastes as good as if it was served fresh. to hub's delight, this was not the case -- it still tastes so darned good!

I honestly didn't think this place was too good when I first tried it last year. I really didn't understand what the hype was about this place either. However, I did continue to eat here every time I go to SD though, and now I'm hooked! (Or, getting there..) Either I wasn't hungry enough the first time or Phil's BBQ just takes time to appreciate. The ribs are absolutely tender and juicy! *DROOLS* I love the way the meat just slips off the bone.. I didn't enjoy the macaroni too much though. ): I felt that it was a bit fatty. So I didn't feel good eating that along with the ribs. Kinda pricey, but it's waaay better than chilies! Plus they do a great job at marinating. 1-2 ribs can go a long way also. So try it!

What can I say that hasn't already been said about Phil's?  I agree with what everyone says, it's just the best I've ever had, and I've even had BBQ in Kansas City that wasn't this good.  We also used Phil's Special Event Center for a reunion with about 80 people, and everyone loved it.  The special event staff acommodated our every request.  The only down side is that Phil's is so popular, there is usually a long line-but we were there the other night and two servers came out and served their fantastic onion rings to all of us waiting in line.  It was a nice gesture and made the 40 minute wait more bearable :)

WOW. From the 45mins+ wait outside you KNOW this place is going to be delicious. However after reading a Quick Tip about seating yourself in the bar, we opted for that and skipped the wait and sat down right away. We were greeted and given menus right away (aka: placemats) by super friendly waiter who you could tell loved his job. I asked if I could get a ribless (meat pulled off the bone for you)  and chickless (chucks of breast meat)  combo with slaw n fries, he said "not on the menu but OF COURSE" , thats what I like to hear!!! Food came out quickly. It was beyond words. This is REAL BBQ. Perfect sauce, perfect meat. I cannot name one downside at all. This alone made me want to move to SD.

The food at Phil's is actually delicious stick to your ribs comfort food, but getting to the food will be the difficulty. When Phil's moved from their old store in Mission Hills, nearby fans of the place figured that the new bigger Sports Arena location, while not as convenient, would accommodate their crowds better. Nicely, it turns out, that the new place gets WAY too much customers plus the lines are worse. In case you do not like a lengthy wait, you much better not attempt Phils on a Sat or Sun, as there's a line from late morning to late evening. In case you can manage the wait, Phil's comfort food will make you incredibly happy.

After watching the San Diego episode of Man v. Food, I decided to give this place a third and final try. I guess third time's a charm. This is one of those places where you really need to know the right thing to get. I opted for Adam Richman's choice of the "El Toro" sandwich, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The thinly sliced  tri-tip (hard to find anywhere other than in California)  was cooked to perfection. I also learned a way to bypass that huge line, but I'm not giving away any secrets in this review :) Now that I know what to order I will definitely be back.

5 Stars!  Came to Phil's based on the awesome yelp reviews and was glad I did.  Arrived at 5:30 pm on Wednesday evening, and the line was out the door, wrapped around the building.   So...switched to Plan B...take out!  Found the take out register (no line) and withint 5 minutes, had my order in hand, ready to walk out.   I later learned that long lines are typical and the best time to avoid the line is to arrive between 2pm and 5 pm...a little hint for you folks.   Visiting from LA and this being a first time visit, I was amazed at the high energy and the apparently "happy" employees.  So while I was waiting for my order, I chatted with one of the employees.  As a long time employee, she  spoke highly of the owner, Phil,...it was obvious that he's good to his employees which was such a blessing to know this one successful entrepeneur has chosen to take care of his employees as well as serving great consistent food to his customers.  I interacted with three employees and all three were polite and enthusiastic and efficient. Now  on to the ribs....the meat was fresh, fresh, fresh.   So, to sum it up....food was great and better yet, I was happy to patronize an eatery that is successful in taking care of its customers and good to its employees as well.

Who can say it enough? The Baby Back Ribs are a must; it doesn't even bother me that the wait is so long. This is my go-to place for a meal in San Diego. I can't get enough of the stuff! I live in L.A. and the last time I was here was probably about a year ago so I was definitely craving the stuff when I finally got to SD. They even added a photo station in the line since the last time I came so you can capture the memories of your anticipation of digging your teeth into those succulent bones. A friend got the Beefy Ribs and said that they were really juicy and meaty so I'll have to try that next time.

If you love ribs, I highly recommend going to Phil's.  Amazing baby back ribs (especially if love BBQ sauce drizzled on top), potato salad, baked beans, fries, and coleslaw!!! Always love coming here. Lunch time is a better time to go to avoid the very long dinner lines.  Bring cash, sometimes debit/cc machine doesn't work.

Never heard about this joint, But decided to go since my girlfriend friends are in town.  The line is worst than ever.  I think a lot of SD's people  go here because it is the only restaurant serving ribs in there town.  Don't believe in the hype in this place.  YOu wait at least for 1 hr plus for the same taste as claim jumper or black angus, or even Lucilles.  Go wait and you will find out.

Went there about a month ago with friends who haven't seen in a while and understand why they have great rating on yelp. Great place added a little tikey bar outside at which a certain point you can drink while waiting to order your food and be seated. They do accommodate huge parties by asking a head of time how many people and get table ready. Great service when ordered and when to get food. Had a beer in hand when food was ready so gentlemen carried my two items all the way back to our table. Don't like that you have to walk all the way to bar for a drink which is crowded so not so fast service. The patio is quite narrow so to pass by is not easy and we were seated last table on patio. Also, that everyone in line can look right at you and that the line never ceased while we were eating. Little awkward for my taste. Overall GREAT experience, great food (onion rings a must!)and will be back. They also take to-go orders.

Coming from the southeast US, the way to tell if a barbecue restaurant is worth it's salt is how good the pork ribs are. Now a really good pork rib has a rub on it, and is smoked over wood (preferably hickory) so one can taste the smoke. Phil's tries to cover up the fact the these ribs have never even been anywhere near smoke by slathering the ribs up with a sauce. One can do the same thing in a gas oven and get similar results. It tastes good, but it's not barbecue. The sides were tasty, and well prepared.

At first glance of the line, i wasnt sure if i wanted to wait. Sure you can take out with a short line and a 15-20 minute wait, however i wanted to sit down. about a little over an hour we ordered, found some seats and right away had service from the most bad ass server in the store. This guy was wity and funny. The wait was worth every moment! you gotta taste the food yourself, there are no words but go and wait for an awesome moment of rich service and food!

Forget wanting Chili's baby back ribs (I want my baby back baby back baby back baby back...), get Phil's baby back ribs!  They are fall off the bone tender, with a slight char crust from bbq cooking, and coated in a tangy bbq sauce.  There always seems to be a long line here, but it moves fairly quickly, and once you get to place your order, the food itself arrives quickly as well.  As for sides, the beans are decent, nothing to write home about, but the red potato salad is pretty good.  It has a hint of dill in it and it's not overly creamy like how other potato salads can get.

I LOVE BBQ.  At Phil's, you get the fall of the bone, tender baby back ribs that are so delicious, it will knock your socks off.  You order first and then get seated, not your typical sit down place.  But hey this works and your get your food pretty quickly.  Attentive service too.  They got some food beans too. I will definitely be returning to this establishment again.

After hearing about how amazing this place is, I walked in a skeptic. But, the hype was well deserved. The only downside to the entire experience was the wait. Around 90 minutes in line. It was windy and raining, and standing outside was miserable. Once inside, the line moved a bit faster. Cost was about average - maybe even slightly less than I had expected. The food was done in a few minutes, and it was definitely worth the wait. The tri-tip sandwich was awesome, and the pulled pork was amazing. But, the ribs were hands down the best I've ever had. As far as the service: Zack was our server, and he was incredibly attentive and diligent. Even though he was constantly busy he made sure to stop by numerous times and ask if we needed anything. He was what you would want a server to be. Overall, the line was the only negative thing. If they had more seating, or at least a more comfortable area to wait, this place would be second to none. In my book, still worth 5 stars. The portions are huge - expect to take some home.

There's nothing per say wrong with Phil's BBQ - I just really don't get the hype.  The servings are ample, not too long of a wait even with the line, and staff is friendly.  But most of the flavor and actual food comes off as plain, none of it made me want to stuff my face or say "wow" with a full mouth - an in San Diego every third place you eat at has that effect.  Phil's BBQ for me falls under the other two out of three.

Always a long wait but well worth it!  We tried the baby back rib and the large ribs and both were delicious.  The meat just tears off the bone and the BBQ sauce is not too sweet.  The portions are huge.  You can probably eat the meat and take all the sides home for another meal.  Service was friendly and they got plenty of seats.  If you're ever near by San Diego, definitely stop by Phil's.

I don't know what I was thinking before, but Phil's BBQ (American BBQ for that matter) is the $h1t! I guess it was just a matter of time before I got over the eating with two fingers and making no mess deal... cause if you're gonna enjoy Phil's, its all about gettin' down and dirty with your food! The line may be a turn-off... but if you're willing to be patient, you won't regret it! Classic American BBQ... regardless of what meat you get, you'll enjoy every mouth-watering fall off the bone bite of it, and their tangy house bbq sauce too! Took my BF here for his first time and I had to give him a taste of everything Phil's got to offer... so we ordered their "Best of Both Worlds": 4 pork baby back ribs + 1/4 mesquite bbq chicken and a beefy rib sampler. Add a side of their amazing Colossal Onion Rings and we're set to go! We also had cole slaw, bbq baked beans, and corn on the cob as our sides... but none of which were too memorable. But Phil's is all about the BBQ... YUM! The beef ribs are considerably larger than the pork baby back ribs!, but that's why there's the price difference. I personally prefer the texture of the pork and how it falls off the bone a bit better, but the beef is also just as good, and comes with a lot more meat! You can try them both for yourself by getting a single rib sampler for $3-$4. The mesquite bbq chicken was also mouth watering - no dry chicken here! We finished up every last morsel, and you can imagine how down right and dirty we we're by the end.... thank goodness for their paper towel rolls, moist towelettes, and ample sinks by the exit! No need to fear getting messy here! If you haven't given Phil's a try... GO NOW! Just the thought of Phil's makes my mouth water... nyommmmm.

awesome ribs.. kinda tangy sauce. the sides were nothing special. i got the fries and they were soggy. We called in our order and there is even a line to pick up food but def much better than waiting on the line to eat there which would have been at least an hour. 4 stars for the ribs though.

BEst of both chickless with baby back ribs ...mmmmmm Best bbq in my opinion in san diego because of sauce. They have gotten my order wrong a few times but have always done a great job of making it up to me. They also have a cam outside that you can have your friends log on and see you.Im a fan! oh also a bar there and line can be long if you are ordering to go you usually can just skip the line.

Phil's BBQ is a mandatory visit for me whenever I come down to San Diego. Don't let the line out the door put you off, it is definitely worth the wait. The line actually moves quite fast and the workers are very efficient and friendly. The prices are quite affordable for a BBQ joint. But the food is the best thing about Phil's. I always get the tickler with baby back ribs which is a steal at about $7. The ribs are juicy, flavorful, fall off the bone, and have the perfect barbeque sauce. The tickler also comes with yummy fries, cole slaw, and onion rings. My bf usually gets the best of both worlds with chicken and your choice of baby back or beef ribs. The sides are delicious also and he loves the baked beans. If you're anywhere in the SD area make sure to stop by Phil's!

Let me start off by saying that I am not a big meat eater, much less an eater of meat that is still on the bone (weirds me out with all the fat and tendons stuck on it). Anyway, the line was longer than I had patience for, but how can thousands of people lead me astray? They're smart to have menus everywhere so the process is more expedited when you finally reach the register. I personally ordered the half rack of baby back ribs with macaroni salad and baked beans for my sides. The sauce is pretty good and I could taste the spices, but it was a bit too tangy for me. Sides were ok, beans were a little on the mushy side but well seasoned. Onion rings were well battered and fried. I tried a few bites of my boyfriend's beef rib and found that I liked it better than the baby back. We both stuffed ourselves silly from the sheer amount of food, but I have no desire to eat that much meat in one sitting ever again!

What can I say that over 1000+ plus reviews hasn't already mentioned? Their BBQ is out of this world and truly worth the wait. BUUUUUT...if you live in SD and can avoid it, do it! Just make that quick phone call, and do a to-go order. The only reason to ever wait in that line is if you are from out of town, are taking guests there from out of town, OR are testing your patience. As a testimate to how good they are, my husband and I had our rehearsal dinner for our wedding catered by Phil's BBQ. It really never gets old and the cravings never stop.

The smell of this place alone will suck you in off the street. It is the best BBQ joint in all of San Diego. Everything on the menu is delicious. I usually order by phone because there is always a line out the door and around the building. If you call in your order you  can be in and out in no time. They don't plate your food until you arrive so it's hot when you get home. If you are from out of town and you have a chance to go here, take it! It will definitely be one of the best meals you eat while you're here.

Phil's is a superior location for no-frills (plastic baskets lined with paper), awesome eats, BBQ. There are actually no reservations and you order at the counter and they call you when your food is ready. Good for family members dining, it has a substantial, open dining region which can get noisy. Food is quicker than when they had been on Goldfinch. Beware of Sports Arena events which seriously makes it busy and the waits long.

Mmmmmm...BBQ Heaven!  After hearing about Phil's from several locals, I finally ventured out on a Friday night and braved the line wrapping around the building.  The wait was approximately 45 minutes and well worth it!  I had the tri-tip sandwich and the boyfriend had an order of the the pork ribs.  Now I'm not usually a rib fan since I don't like eating meat off the bone, but these were cooked to perfection and the meat was so tender it was easy to just slide the meat off the bone and enjoy the BBQ goodness.  The tri-tip sandwich was also fabulous, although much larger than I was expecting.  Phil's sauce is perfectly seasoned...not too sweet, just the right amount of spice.  I'm sure I will be returning to satisfy my BBQ cravings in the future.

Since my last review, Ive probably been here 10 times and figured it was a good time to write an updated review.   Went here today and ordered a wide sample of everything.  An el toro sandwich, a cheeseburger, a rib tickler and some onion rings. The el toro is always pretty good and was fine.  The ticklers are easily the best value there and give you a little taste of everything.  Phils ribs are always tasty and are probably my favorite thing there.  The fries are usually good, as long as they arent undercooked,  and for whatever reason, I hate mayonnaise except in a lobster roll or in Phils cole slaw.  Its the only cole slaw that I have ever liked and its damn delicious.  The onion rings are usually awesome but the last 3 times there, they have been meh.... They either cut the onions too thick, or put way too much breading on them.  If they dont improve the next time I order them, I doubt I will keep getting them.  Totally disappointed in them lately.  Lastly the cheeseburger....disappointed in that too.  It was a plain jane basic burger with a too thick onion ring, small piece of cheese, and some bbq sauce.  It was the second time I ordered it and it will be the last. 4 stars overall for the ribs, sauce, fries, cole slaw and the el toro. I love how they have a big old hand washing sink too. The service is always great at Phils and if you go on off hours, the line is never too long.  If I had to wait in line for over an hour I might suggest something else.  This is easily my favorite bbq in SD still though and Ive never had a bad meal there so that has to count for something ;-).

I heard about Phil's on the Travel channel show, Man vs. Food.  Was in town and decided to check out the Point Loma location for dinner.   The line was insane to get in the door!  I mean it was a 1.5 hour wait at dinnertime.  Bottom line, do not go to Phil's if you're in a hurry or real hungry.  Someone below said to call in your take out order to beat the line, not a bad idea but then you miss out on the ambience of the place.  Someone also said that Phil doesn't actually BBQ the meat but cooks it on a grill/stove.  That's disappointing to hear but after tasting the food I have to say that I don't really mind much.  Phil's BBQ sauce is the stuff of legends.  Starts out sweet and tasty and slowly heats up.  Perfect! I had the beef tri-tip sandwich with a small side of fries.  The sandwich was huge and delicious, price $6.  The fries were also delish but it was the biggest 'small' side I've ever seen, covering a whole plate for $1.50.   Service was awesome once I got a seat.  It's really loud in there when it's crowded but after a couple draft beers I didn't care.   I plan on going back and buying one of their t-shirts when I get the chance.

I'm usually very easy to please, and everything was really good.  They cooked everything perfectly, but I just couldn't get over the sauce.  It was really ketchup-y... maybe that's good for a lot of people but I have to rate honestly.  Next time I will try it without sauce.  Otherwise really really good.

I finally ate at this place last Thursday. I have to admit it was pretty good. When you need to splurge on some bad for your heart yet tasty food. The kind of place you would want to go in and get some hardy good eating without the wait. The amazing thing about this place is it's quickness. The line was out the door when I arrived and I was like "Oh dear god no. Time for forever." Yet, they were super fast. They had 6 registers and people were in and out fast as can be. I had the 4 baby back ribs and 1/4 chicken. It wasn't an explosive taste. The sauce needs more work. Too basic. But above average when you just want meat with a little bit of love. The only thing that I would say is a negative about this place is the fast paced busboys. They kind of hound you a little, "You done?" or they just take your plate and your like whoa bro. Also the bar area is nice. They have stellar LCD screens there. And the bar is cozy and not too crowded. Other than that, you'll be full with BBQ taste. You'll surpass your percent daily value of calories. But leave satisfied.

For BBQ in San Diego, this is about as good as it gets for its style.  It's also a lot easier to get to and eat at than the old location.  I usually get the ribs or the "ribless."   It's not the best BBQ I've ever had, but when pork must be had it gets the job done, and I don't wish I'd gone somewhere else midway through a slab of ribs.  SD is a better place for having Phil's.

So much hype for this place, so I had to try it out for myself. Their baby back ribs were alright.  My expectations might have been too high. However, their beef ribs were very good.  It's a "fall right off the bone" kinda deal and the ribs were pretty large. Great atmosphere and good prices for delicious food. Can't say it lived up to the hype, but it was still worth it.

Go early!  My girlfriend and I already had to line up outside 30 mins before it opened on a Sunday morning. Every positive review I've read here is true. The pork ribs was the best! I'm not even sure if this is a con but be prepared to leave smelling like smoked BBQ. :)

Believe the hype, but be smart about it!   Yes, everyone says this place is amazing and it's the best around...blah blah blah...and they're right (as far as San Diego goes anyway).  The food is amazing (get the Bro-ham or the pork ribs) and the sides are great too.  The atmosphere can be a little crazy, but you have to be smart about the way you approach your dining experience here.  Allow me to explain: This is arguably the best BBQ joint in a 200 mile or so radius, with about 5 Million people (or so) living in that area.  Logic would tell you that if you go around dinner time or at prime time on the weekends, you're going to have to wait.  And yes...the line can be HUGE, wrapped around the block.  So, if you MUST go there and sit down to eat (the atmosphere is OK, but nothing to go out of your way to experience) then go at an off time.  The food will be just as delicious and you'll walk right in with a wait of fewer than 5 minutes (most likely).   If you're like me and you have to get your fix from time to time, just call ahead and get your order to go.  Phil's is conveniently located just off the 5 and the 8 and you can scoop your delicious ribs (or whatever) and be out of there in less than 5 minutes. So when you read reviews about how people hate the line, be smarter than they were.  The food is amazing, my preference being the pork ribs or the Bro-Ham sandwich (pulled pork BBQ).  The chicken is good too but not such a fan of Beef Ribs in general (from anywhere).  Try it and you will not be disappointed.

I used to frequent Phil's B.B.Q when it was in Mission Hills.  When it moved to Point Loma and we decided to go, I was shocked at the line that wrapped around the building.  It looked like a line for a ride at Disneyland.  I jumped out and asked people waiting in the line how long that had been waiting.  I was so surprised when they said only ten or fifteen minutes.  We decided to wait.  So glad that we did. The B.B.Q. ribs are so good!!! You wait in this long line to order at the front desk and then you pick up your food.  It is not the type of place that they seat you and take your order. I have always loved B.B.Q. and this is one of my favorite places for ribs.

One of the best BBQ places in SoCal. Been here many times and I have yet had a bad experience. I usually order the 1/2lb Cheeseburger, can never go wrong with a burger. It has cheese, an onion ring, and topped off with their special BBQ sauce. Now if you want to up it up, then try their baby back ribs. You can get it just ribs or if hungry, you can oder the dinner which comes with sides. I also would have to recommend their onion rings. Get a small if you're by yourself or just 2, because those rings are HUGE! Try not to get there at peak times, because like in the picture there will most likely be a line out the door and around the corner. If you get there and there is a line, don't let that line discourage you.... the line moves fast and the food is well worth the wait.

OK, so I figured I would jump on the hype wagon and check this place out. After reading the reviews and driving by this place a few times, I knew what to expect...CHAOS! I ordered my food to go on the phone beforehand to save some time, and I am glad I did. I went on Sunday around 2 o clock and the line was wrapped around the building, nothing new there. Took about 15 min to get our food after waiting in the "to go" line and I got the hell outta there before I was trampled. I ordered the beef ribs dinner with fries ($21.50 after tax) and my friend ordered the pork baby back rib dinner ($21.50), that way we could try both and compare. I have to say that I liked both, but would order the baby back ribs next time. Both were fall off the bone ( even though true bbq'ers know that pork should not just fall of the bone), but not the greatest I have ever had. The sauce was...well....OK. I was just not a big fan of it as it was too overpowering to the meat. I would never buy a bottle of it and put it on my meat at home, it just wasn't my kind of bbq sauce. The fries were good but they put the ribs on top of them, which I didn't like. I want my fries with salt, and sometimes ketchup, not bbq sauce! The staff was nice and friendly as could be in a crazy environment, lots of smiles and such. I do know that I would NEVER wait in that line for and hour or more to sit and eat the food. IMO, it just wasn't worth the hype.

I have to say, this is probably one my most favorite restaurants in San Diego; definitely in my top 5! There are so many reviews for this place, and every opinion does matter. For me, I don't eat BBQ as often as other people, maybe once every couple months. When I do, I think of Phil's BBQ. This place is so popular and so SO good. Service: This place has some of the nicest workers ever. Everyone from the cashiers to the cooks to the waiters, all are so generous and considerate. When I was eating with my girlfriend, there was always a person there to see if we needed anything else, such as more choices of sauces or more utensils, etc. I'd figure the large number of people would tick off some workers, but not at all, I think it's the exact opposite; the more people there are, the happier the workers! When there is a line, and usually there is, it may seem like it'll take forever, especially if it's wrapped around the building. However, the line goes by so fast somehow, and even if you wait for a hour or so, it's worth it for this food, DEFINITELY worth it. Food: One word - WOW. The food is amazing as can be. I usually get the Beefy Ribs and Baked Beans. I am in LOVE with the beans, don't know why but they are so GOOD! I'm not a big fan of their chicken or chickless whatever because it's usually really dry and doesn't have too much taste. I don't really like the potatoes, cole slaw, or macaroni (all sides) too much, so I usually stick with the beans and fries. All their sauces are BOMB! Use them well! Everything is great here: the environment, food, people, TVs placed everywhere, everything! The price is great for BBQ like these. I recommend this place to EVERYONE I know, and I have not heard anything bad at all, ever. It took me 18 years of living in San Diego to hear about this place and finally eat here; I really wish I knew about it a long time ago! So what do you do after this read this review? Go to Phil's BBQ and start eating your hearts out!

The food here is just wonderful, my only complaint is that it can tend to get a lil pricey and the long lines, but other than that the service, and the ribs are out of this world. I always get the baby back rib full rack dinner with the cole slaw and fries. I just like to put the malt vinegar all over my food and dig in~

This place has THE BEST BBQ I have ever tasted.  Having tried most of the fast casual BBQ joints around Orange County, Phil's definitely ranks #1 on my list. My wife, 17-month old and I arrived at Phil's around 5:30 and the place was already packed with a line out the door on a Thursday night.  After reading many of the reviews on Yelp, we were expecting a wait so it wasn't a big deal.   My wife ordered the 1/2 rack of baby back ribs and I had the small order of beef ribs.  Wow, you get a heck of a lot of food for the money.  Great value and amazing food for sure. Overall, we had a great experience at Phil's BBQ.  The staff was friendly and organized.  A couple of the managers kept coming by our table to check in with us and talk to our daughter.  It's a little loud on the inside, but that's to be expected with it being so crowded.  Also, being in a wheelchair wasn't a problem with the crowd.  The place is designed well and there was a table open right near the front that worked out perfectly for us. I feel like driving down to San Diego again, just to get some BBQ for dinner. Yummmmmmmmmm

I love Phils!  The baby back ribs are beyond amazing.  Im moving out of San Diego soon and my boyfriend and I are already planning to drive 2 hours just to get Phils.  Im also glad that they sell the Phils BBQ sauce so i can put it on everything. The trick to skipping the line is too call ahead, look up the menu online and place your order. The to-go line is pretty short and fast. The only downfall is you have to drool over the food all the way home... Did i mention the beer battered onion rings are some of the best ever?!

The food is great, there is no better BBQ in San Diego, possibly southern California. When my family/friends come to town, this is the spot they want to hit. WARNING: Do not wait until you are starving to go to Phil's, chances are that there will be a line wrapped around the building. Get there early, there may still be a line but at least you wont be starving and waiting in line. The new place is way bigger than the first place, it still gets packed. So many people cant be wrong. Get your butt there and taste their food now.

I'm going to keep it simple. Delicious, tender, mouth-watering baby back ribs at an affordable price? I'M SOLD. I've been here three times and it has yet to disappoint. The quality is consistent (Phil's does BBQ well) and the prices are very reasonable. I like the baby back rib tickler because it comes with 2 onion rings, fries, and coleslaw (which isn't too spectacular, but then again... it's just coleslaw), but it's only $6.45. Yummm. I'd give it five stars but the line/wait/crowd is ridiculous on most days (~60 minute+ waits on the weekends), and that's just too long for any meal-- especially when the thick aroma fills the air as you're stuck in line. Maybe that'll change once the new location is open for business.

AMAZING!  The food is consistently delicious, the service is quick and friendly, and the vibe is fun and energetic.  I don't live in San Diego anymore, but I always make a point to eat at Phil's when I'm back to visit.   I love the chick tickler/chickless dinner... the chicken is high quality (never any icky fatty bites), and the sauce is a perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  Corn on the cob is my favorite side, and the onion rings are a MUST.  Make sure and get buttermilk ranch for those rings, too!  The veggie burger is pretty delicious too, if you're not into the whole meat thing.  YUM!

The most delicious thing bbq you will ever eat. I got both ribs sets the pork and beef. The beef are huge, however they are both delicous. You would be a fool to not try them both in your lifetime. They are worth the wait  even if over and hour. The meat is tender, falls of the bone and magically passes your teeth and gums as they venture into your tummy for total satisfaction! Love this place!

Since appearing on Man vs. Food this place is packed all the time, everyday...but for good reason! The BBQ is of course fantastic, the ribs, the chicken, the sides, everything is pretty fantastic. Yet I was inspired to write a review to say how wonderful their service is. The no-nonsense order at the front of the line and grab your own table deal speeds things along as much as possible, but I found the staff roaming the seating area to all be so friendly and helpful too. Everything from clearing a table quickly so you can snag it, correcting any mishaps on your order or supplying handwipes and toothpicks when your meal is finished. Phil must be paying these guys well..and rightly so. Just be prepared to wait in line...it's worthwhile!

This is by far the best BBQ I have ever eaten. I usually go for the baby back ribs with corn on the cob, but their fries are good too. Their onion rings are huge and to die for, and are a must with every visit. The only negative thing about Phil's BBQ is that it's so popular that you usually have to wait around 45 minutes outside the restaurant before you're let inside to order. But the food is ready by the time you sit down, so total wait before getting the food isn't that bad.

I am being generous with my review. The sauce is okay but nothing extraordinary. The meats lack the bark and smoke rings you expect with really well done smoked meats. It is mostly cooked meats that are sauced afterwards. I have had Phils 3 times now and it is always the same. Try SlowCalBBQ truck for the  REAL DEAL!!

Phil's BBQ is BY FAR the most delicious location for BBQ! Yes the line is ridiculous and tiresome, but it is entirely worth the wait (which genuinely is not that bad). This location is amazing the line is worth the wait I repeat once more, due to the fact it they make the food taste even much better when you are feening for it. My mouth melts for the tri tip burger, so delicious! The service is fast and casual, the paper towels are plentiful, as well as the BBQ is mouthwatering and scrumptious. Each time I go down to point loma, I go back to Phil's!!

I am really picky about my BBQ and I find Phil's is definitely one of the top in San Diego.  I have been going here since they were in North Park and now they are closer at Sports Arena.  The ribs are fall off the bone tender and delicious.  Most of the time I will go off hours and no wait but, if you go at prime eating times it is a wait.  Everyone here is always friendly.

Came here with the family and high expectations. Having lived in the Midwest we have had our share of very good BBQ. The sandwiches were recommended as the best on the menu, so my wife and I got one each, my kids (9 &7) were smarter than us and split a rack of ribs. We also ordered fries, beans, slaw's and onion rings. The great: Nothing The good: ribs The bad: onion rings (worst I've had), fries The just ok:everything else If I do ever come back, it would be just for the ribs. Overall, just average at best.

the bbq beefy ribs are great to sink your teeth into and pull the meat off from the bone. the baby backs get charred/burned everytime i go, which leaves not that much meat that's edible. I also think the side dishes are wayy over priced and i dont like much of the choices. just go for the beefy ribs. i'd phone in an order and eat in the car if i can't wait to get home.

I have been here twice and both times left disappointed. Mabie I was expecting too much but ether way this is definitely not my top place for BBQ. They got there first strike against them when I noticed they did not have Mac and Cheese which in my book is the best side dish with anything with BBQ sauce. It is something about the sauce and the cheese that just tastes right together.   So I ordered my fav Beef ribs and when I got then they were over cooked by my standards. I like my ribs to be tender and to be just hanging on the bone where I have to pull it off myself.  These ribs I got the meat was already off the bone lying flat on the plate.  The sauce was ok but my wife couldn't stand it. The best part was the red velvet whoopee pie now that was good.  Check my other review's if you want to see my favorite pick for BBQ.

Outstanding!  Best Baby Back Ribs we have ever had!  Have had BBQ from east to west coast, and this is truly the best (even if my favorite is still Carolina BBQ style).  Can't quite figure out what the "regional" flavor is closest too, but it is just simply great, no matter what your preference is. Line can be long, but it wasn't too bad on a weekday just before 5pm.  Don't know if I would wait in the line on a weekend -- probably opt to phone in an order, and then jump into the much shorter "take out" line instead.  Line moves at a good pace for "sit down" dining, but it is a very popular spot, so the line can be dauntingly long on the weekend. Any visit to San Diego will now include a stop in at Phil's.  We stopped on way down, and then had to stop again, for a repeat, on the way back.

I could take this restaurant or leave it. The line was out the door. Our food was pretty good, and the coleslaw was the best I've ever had. But, when you come to eat ribs, and the big standout is coleslaw, there may be a problem. Overall I had a decent experience, but decent won't tempt me to spend another 45 minutes waiting in line.

Mouth watering BBQ... the camera for the line is helpful too. I'm glad I went after summer when it started to die down. But the stuff here is good.

So my party of 3 arrived @ 1241, and we waited in the overcast weather. Under the awning is nice you have shelter from the burning UV rays, the closer you get to the entrance,  u have a nice breeze. It's so popular that people line up before the doors open @ 1100. To help pass the time, they have employees standing outside to greet, get the numbers of persons in your party, make small talk and presumable keep the line in order, lest the tempers and patience of hungry patrons are short, which is worsened by the tantalizing smells of the BBQ just out of reach, and begin fighting (due to the packed line); If little things like people constantly bumping you and your purse doesn't bother you, you're good). They thoughtfully provide benches for people to sit on while they wait. For thirsty folk, they have a cart with suds for purchase, as well as free H20. Seated @ 1330, after waiting for another 5 mins for an available table, we waited another 15 mins to pick up our order. An employee was kind enough to assist the Spouse in bringing the 3 large platters to the table. The Colossal Onion Rings were very hot and fresh, and about 3 of the rings were very burnt as well. Hubby had the BBQ Broham with a side order of potato salad; he demolished everything and had a few rings to boot.  Daughter had the El Toro; because of the very generous portion, she could not finish it, and we packed it for home. I had the BBQ Garden Veggie Burger, which is made to order, and was quite tasty, thanks to them slathering it in BBQ sauce -- definitely not a Boca or Morningstar Patty! Though not quite as satisfying as a full order of the BBQ Beefy Ribs, at least my conscience is clear. 5 stars for the generous portions, quality of food, the  vegetarian (unrealistic to expect vegan fare @ a BBQ place) items, a separate hand washing station outside the restrooms -- which is great, as the women's restroom only has 2 stalls, and a line forms very quickly; the benches & free dixie cups of H20 while waiting is thoughtful.  4 stars because as busy as the place gets, the limited seating is ridiculous, the wait time is a bummer, and the hungry crowd does not make for a fun wait in the heat, or if you don't appreciate being jostled in the crowd. Come early, like when they open, or be patient and prepared to wait at least 45mins to order, and have an eagle eye to spot a table. If I'm not there when the doors open, then I'm not going. Its good, but not THAT good.

I got the best of both worlds with the chicken and baby back ribs. It was good, but they only offer one type of sauce and it's kind of spicy for the kiddos. I wish that they had different types of sauce flavors. It's kind of a cattle call. You have to wait in line to order, and then you have to wait for your food. They give you a beeper that lights up when your order is ready, and then you have to go and pick up your order. We had a party of 11 and were actually seated pretty quickly and one of the staff was really great and picked up our orders for us and brought us out plates. He was awesome. I also had beans and potato salad with my order. It was all very delicious.

Really???? 2000+ reviews; 4.5 stars; 45 minute wait?!!!!!! I couldn't even imagine how these ribs could be THAT amazing...and I was right. After a long wait, I expected these ribs to be RIDICULOUSLY amazing. I was wrong...they were tasty, but not amazing. The sauce was fine and the meat was tender...but isn't that what all ribs are like? With the crazy lines I knew these ribs weren't' going to be drive. the sides were average (got the cole slaw and macaroni salad). Prices were above average. I will not be back again unless the line was super super short, but with this hype and all these reviews, I highly doubt that! ahha

I'm from LA area so I don't really come to SD that often (maybe twice a year). But when I do I have to come to Phil's BBQ. No fail with baby back ribs and onion rings!! soooo gooooooood. I have to say, I got the smoked  brisket sandwich one time and that was not a favorite. My Bf loved it, but it was a bit too smokey for me! and too much sauce! but other than that food is really good! and don't let the lines fool you, it looks long and crazy but it goes by pretty fast. Or you can just order it for pick up and avoid the line completely. the staff is quick on orders and friendly.

I saw this place on Man vs Food when I was back in the UK and I put it on the bucket list from then on... I went there for a special leaving treat a couple of days before I got back on the plane headed home - yes fellow yelpers of PB, I'm now back in gloomy London :-( Let me say this about my first experience. We waited in line for about 15-20 mins which was just enough time to decided what we wanted to eat from the billboard menus: one full rack of baby back rib dinner with side of fries and sweet beans, and one pulled pork sandwich for the two of us... it was too much! but there was no way a single one of those sweet succulent ribs was going to waste. The waiter came by at the end and told me "you're not driving are you, food coma is like a DUI  around here" which my girlfriend and I thought was hilarious. The whole experience here is great, with cute touches like the extra handwash stations and paper towel right on your table. This is how people need to eat bbq - no frills, no b*s, simple as that. Biggest compliment I can pay this place is this... my one last meal, became two last meals as we stopped here on my way to the airport to have yet another full rack of baby back ribs... oh... and a jar of Phil's bbq sauce to take with me on the plane and introduce the UK to Phil's - LOVE IT!

One of my favorite places to eat when I'm in San Diego. The lines are long. But well worth the wait. Once you get seated & give your order. You won't be waiting too long. Great people & service. You got to try the cornbread "BOMB"!! I love their baby back ribs & beans. The ribs are so soft & tender. That the meat just falls right off. I also love their beef ribs!! Tender & juicy!! A must if you love beef ribs. If your ever in the San Diego area & looking for good BBQ. You at least gotta give Phil's a try!!

I ordered a pulled pork sandwich.  I got unseasoned dried out crumbling pig with a squirt bottle spray of BBQ sauce on top.  The sandwich was thrown together with Phil's BBQ patent pending messiness.  I'll grant some artistic license to the place for correlating messy as hell with "homestyle."  But when there's literally no way to handle the sandwich, it gets silly and touristy.  The meat is apparently smoked.  The taste is very strong.  Liquid smoke perhaps?  I haven't seen anyone try to use that in years.  Anyway, it was a nice clean smoke flavor, just over done. I lived in Atlanta until I was 25.  Dunno if that earns me a BBQ Badge or anything.  But this place seemed a bit fake.  Don't take it personally though.  Atlanta screws everything up besides BBQ.

one of the better BBQ's I've had! * beef ribs- super BIG! and very saucy...falls right off the bone * baby back ribs- smaller version of the beef ribs....better for neat freaks....less mess since they're small lol * bbq chicken- moist and juicy! NOT dry at all! * corn on the cob- yummmy and sweeeeett corn * fried- it was soggy since it was sitting with the BBQ chicken but I like soggy fries so it was yummy!! over all, my stomach was satisfied with everything. Be sure to get there early or you will be waiting in line for about 2 hours (this is worst than boiling crab! lol ) we got there before the restaurant even opened and the line was already wrapped around the corner. So, we got to go and went back to our hotel room to eat.

Phil's is decent BBQ for San Diego, but it's too crowded these days. The bf enjoyed the full rack o beefy ribs and I ordered the half baby-back. While the meat was fall off the bone tender, the meat itself wasn't saturated with flavor. The meat and sauce seemed like separate components, although the sauce had a nice smoky taste. The charred-flavor and crunch are probably what you're paying for... Phil's apparently got fined up the wazoo for complaints of smoke by its previous  Mission Hills neighbors. Overall, good BBQ by SD standards, friendly staff and sports-friendly. I'd come back again.

Got the el toro and it was flawless. Put some ranch and extra bbq sauce on it. Couldn't ask for more. Wasnt like other bbq's I have had but it is amazing in its own right. You have to try Phils when you go to San Diego, ignore the huge line wrapping around the building. Great ambience as well.

One of the best places for BBQ in Southern California. Although, after trying a bunch of stuff on their menu, I was only a big fan of the baby back ribs. I found the chicken dry, but they deserve 5 stars due to the fact that their slightly tangy ribs were nothing short of delicious. The ribs were moist and tender. I don't know what else you could ask for.

I visited Phil's for the very first time several months ago and...oh....my mouth is salivating already just dreaming about it... Get the ribs. Why wouldn't you get the ribs? What type of fool goes into a location like this and does not get the ribs? You know what, if you are going to go here and not get ribs, just give me your $20 instead so I can do it justice. Simply because the ribs are very good. The fries are...ok to fairly very good. My brother can't get enough and raves about them continuously, but they had been just a little much less crisp than I prefer.

Approximate Wait Time From This Point 21 Minutes 14 Seconds (Phil's really has a sign that says this) When I see a sign like this, with a line of about forty people in front of it, there better be one of two things waiting for me at the end of it. The first would be an awesome ride like Space Mountain or Big Thunder Mountain The second would be delicious food Well, at Phil's BBQ, I'm pleased to say that when we reached the front of the line, we found the latter. Phil's BBQ is a local legend in San Diego. I have wanted to try this place for many years but every time my girl and I drove by the line was wrapped around the building. This time around we decided to go in the early evening on a Thursday night to see if we could avoid a crowd. Well, our little scheme didn't work so well. Even though we got to Phil's at 5pm on a Thursday evening, we still had to wait in a line with about 40 other hungry carnivores. Phil's is a giant sports bar/restaurant. Their dining room is huge. It contains lots of booths and tables and the walls are covered with HD TVs. They also have a decent sized bar area and an outdoor patio. Once you've conquered the line you arrive at a counter where you place your order, get a buzzer that tells you when your food is ready and then you have to find an open table. That is one of the only things I did not like about Phil's. It took us almost 10 minutes to find an empty table. I could only imagine how hard it would be to find one on a weekend. We were only seated about 3 minutes before our food buzzer rang. This is what we ordered. Me- Baby back ribs and chicken dinner combo with a side of macaroni salad, corn on the cob and a small order of beer battered onion rings GF- Beef rib dinner with a baked potato My baby backs were pretty good but they were not the best I have ever had. They had a nice flavor but they were not the meatiest baby backs I have ever had. My BBQ chicken was great. The chicken was super juicy and really tender. The corn on the cob and the macaroni salad were both pretty good. Their beer battered onion rings were amazing. At first I thought the small order was not going to be enough but there were at least 8 or 9 rings in my basket. These O rings were huge and were super crispy. I could have eaten at least two orders of these. My girls beef ribs were phenomenal. These may have been the best beef ribs I have ever had. They were super meaty, had a nice Smokey flavor and the meat literally fell of the bone. Luckily for me she was not able to finish all of her ribs so I got to help her finish off her meal. Her baked potato was just OK. It was supposed to be packed full of cheese and sour cream but there was hardly any of either of them. I almost forgot to mention their BBQ Sauce, which has a Smokey and somewhat spicy flavor and is extremely yummy. For dessert we bought one of their homemade Whoppie pies to go. Their Whoppie pie was big super soft and super sweet. It tasted like a big, soft Oreo cookie (sadly, since we got it to go, I forgot to take a picture of it). The service and prices here were both pretty good. Even though the line to get in was long, it moved quickly. Since you pick up your own food and have to find your own table there are no waiters/waitresses but there are bus boys walking around that will bring you extra BBQ sauce, napkins, bibs, silverware or anything else you may need. The prices here are good too. All that food we got came to about $40 or so, which we thought was great. If you live in SD or are planning on visiting the area and feel like some great BBQ, then you have to check out Phil's. Two quick tips for you if you do go are 1. Be prepared to wait in line 2. Make sure you don't wear a light colored shirt because you may end up with a few BBQ stains at the end of the evening because their food is drenched with BBQ sauce. If you do wear light colors, make sure and wear a bib. I made the rookie mistake of not putting one on right away and I had to walk around the rest of the evening with a big, fat BBQ stain on the front of my light silver shirt.

I havent been back to Phils yet, but I decided to update with a 3-star rating due to the fact that the owner messaged me with an apology. And I feel that deserves a tremendous amount of respect. I will be returning to give this place another try just because of the hospitality that has been shown.

my bf's dad has him drive for an hour each way to deliver the ribs whenever he gets a craving...so i had to check it out if they really are that good.   we encountered a 15 min wait at 7pm on a humpday.   not too bad since you can drool over the choices on the menus posted outside.  once inside, you can view the dishes on the tv screen. i got the rib tickler with 2 onion rings, 3 small ribs, a load of fries, and a scoop of slaw. the rings were slick from being deep fried - i recommend eating this first while it's hot and you won't have time to regret it. as for the ribs: they were shorter than the ones in the regular order + 1 had barely any meat (end piece?), the other 2 were good and juicy. the fries were addictive and the slaw was tasty. i washed it down with some sangria - it was tasty but on the weak side so i'll ask for light on the ice next time.   you can also get unlimited refills on sodas or chug it down with some beer instead. my bf had the ribs with chicken and corn on the cob.  i traded most of my fries for the corn and slathered it with butter.   yum! we were both pretty full by the end and packed the chicken in a box before hitting the theatres. and the verdict?  yes, they really are that good! tip: *if you can't stand the lines, get it to go or head into the bar area and order the food from the bartender.

don't see why the line needs to go around the block - it's alright, it's just bbq. the three stars doesn't mean it's bad, it's fine. i'm not sure if the line is so long because they can't serve the food fast enough or there just aren't enough open seats cause you pay and get food before you sit down

Dear Phil, You are a bastard. You know I have ZERO control when it comes to good food. Why, oh why, does the meat on your beef ribs just fall off the bone? I understand that some people, like The Woman That I'm Currently Married To, prefer the porn, I mean, pork ribs. As for me, it's your beef ribs that give me a serious boner. Your beef ribs are so tender that I'm salivating at the thought of them as I type this from my jail cell (man, dial-up sucks). Your fries are wonderful. Your chicken is a waste of time when there are ribs to be consumed. Your turkey burger should be renamed "Turd Burger" not because it tastes bad, but because it doesn't matter what you call it - THERE ARE RIBS TO EAT (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). Your corn on the cob is the real deal - not some little rinky-dink thing that you would get at KFC (which sucks, by the way). Your onion rings are supposedly really good according to my so-called "friends." I don't have time for your onion rings because THERE ARE RIBS TO EAT. Your mac and cheese - pass. Baked beans - get 'em out of here. Ribs and fries (plus corn on the cob) - this is the combination that makes me fall in line. Just like the rest of the people in that line that stretches out your door and sometimes around the corner. Oh yeah, I'll see you soon and give you my money because I admit it: I'm an addict. In return, you'll give me something that will remind me exactly why I have no self control. Even when I'm done and stuffed, I'll still be reminded of those ribs because I won't be able to get the aroma of that sauce completely off my fingers. I'm sorry Phil, you're not a bastard. I just have a tendency of getting a little cranky when I'm hungry. No bad feelings? Psst..hey, uh, soooooo, can you hook me up with 3 bone beef dinner?

my stomach went into phils bbq with 2 pepto bismol pills and was completely disagreeing with me until i stuffed down a baby back rib and my upset stomach became completely agreeable.   i've never sing high praises for bbq ribs because i'm not a big fan of ribs but phils is life changing.  the ribs are juicy, tender, and succulent.  and the bbq sauce drenching the ribs had me fantasizing about piggies swimming in bbq sauce.   deliciously and generously affordable.  phil, i think you are the new love of my life!

I liked the macaroni salad better than potato salad, but both were great. Took 2 friends there and they loved it also. Price is good for the amount of food you get; we all had left overs.

The El Toro is one of the best BBQ anythings I've had in life, really. It was nearly obscene how tender this tri-tip sandwich is.

You know that scene in Soylent Green (http://en.wikipedia.org/…) where Charlton Heston follows Edward G. Robinson to the "Home"--the place where people go to die, and he sees a film of what the world used to look like with a deer leaping over a clean bubbling stream and beautiful unpolluted sunsets, fields of grain and unsmogged skies, and he gets tears in his eyes and says, "How could I know?   How could I...?   How could I ever imagine?" Well, that was kinda how I felt when I finally got to Phil's BBQ, being in the area Tuesday evening.  Yeah, I know, I've been hearing about Phil's ever since I joined Yelp, but geez guys, all the ranting and raving really didn't prepare me for how good the whole experience was.  I thought it would be expensive for starters, maybe $12-20 a plate so I just figured, I'll stop in and just get and appetizer, maybe something barbequed if they have it, for about $8 and then I at least have tried it and been here.  Instead, I got a huge plate of food ("The Tickler")including three pork ribs, a pile of wonderful cole slaw, two  humongous onion  rings that were among the best I've ever tasted, a gigantic pile of homemade French fries, and all for $6.50 before tax and tip??  Good golly!  I ate a little over half and brought the rest home where it was all still good the next day as leftovers.  And the servers (though they don't really serve, but they do help out a lot) were all so friendly and helpful--I can't wait to go back!

After driving by so many times, but failing to stop because of the lines, I finally tried it.  In my opinion the smell from the restaurant was the best thing about it.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries, and it was simply not good.  The pork was dry, the BBQ is way to sweet, almost tasted like some kind of sugary candy.  And it didn't help that the fries were soggy.  I went with a big group of people from work, and no one seemed too happy about the food.

Long story short: Pretty killer BBQ.  Definitely worth the wait in line. Long story long: When I went to San Diego for a mini vacation on one of my days off from work, I was looking for a place to go to lunch when I got there, and it wasn't long before I came across this listing on Yelp.  I had heard about it and heard it was pretty dang good BBQ.  I love BBQ and I'm sure nearly 1900 people can't be wrong. When I pulled up at the peak lunch hour that was 12:30, I noticed a line coming out the door and going along the front of the building.  Not one who likes waiting a long time for food, I initially was considering going somewhere else, but my problem was I was not familiar with the area and knew I would end up just wasting time trying to find a place that I wasn't originally planning on having, so I just decided to park and brave the line.  I got in line and I was hearing that from where I was, it was about 20 minutes to just get inside, and being by myself, it wasn't like I could get out of line to see how long the line was inside. While waiting in line, I was starting to think back to my marketing class in college.  The reason being is they had a couple of employees floating around the line, informing people how long the wait is as well as chit-chatting with them.  That's a type of marketing.  I will be making several references to that throughout this review, I warn you.  Oh, they had a large menu board hanging, so you could decide what to get before you even got inside I eventually got to the door and got a look inside.  The remainder of the line from that point was only about 15-20 people deep.  At that point I had been waiting for about 15-20 minutes, so I figured it would only be a few more minutes.  Inside, there is the bar area to the left, the kitchen straight ahead, and a large, casual dining room to the right.  There is a little bit of outdoor seating on either side.  And just when you get inside, along the line, a TV which cycles essentially an informercial highlighting the restaurant's background as well as the banquet and catering services.  Again, I thought back to my marketing class. I definitely wanted to get some of their ribs, but I for whatever reason also wanted to try the bbq chicken, so I decided to get one of their combinations, which they label "The Best of Both".  As for their ribs, they offer either baby back or beef ribs.  All of their combinations come with either 2 small sides or 1 large side.  I decided to get the fries (I love french fries) and the bbq baked beans.  I mean, when having BBQ, what better side than BBQ baked beans?  They're like pea and carrots.  Once I ordered, the cashier (who was nice) gave me one of those buzzer do-hickeys, to which I noticed on one side had the restaurant's logo... or I think it did.  I can't quite remember.  But if it did... marketing class.... just sayin' After a few minutes, the buzzer went off and I went to go retrieve my food.  It looked and smelled really good.  I grabbed a bunch of napkins, some water, and headed outside to one of the covered patios. I sat down and dug in.  I tried the sides and they were both good.  The baked beans weren't watery and pretty flavorful, but the fries were average at best.  I got most of those out of the way before I got to the ribs.  Now, I'm no BBQ expert or pitmaster, but I still love my BBQ and these ribs were probably one of the better ribs I've had.  It was quite tender and very flavorful.  I kind of wish I had order just the ribs.  I tried the chicken and while it was still good, I determined I would just stick with the ribs.  The sauce was pretty nice too.  Thick, not too vinegary or heavy on one flavor.  When I finished, I was satisfied, yet not stuffed.  While I was waiting for the buzzer to go off, one of their employees had come around and was passing around business cards that had a number to text and he said if we win, they would cater a party for up to 25 people.  Or something like that.  I've since thrown the card away. Would I come back?  Unless I was in a rush or had to be somewhere, I would definitely come back again.

HOT DAMMMMMN!!!  Talk about drop dead, awesome, kick-ass, barbeque!  I would willingly gnaw on my arm if they would baste it with their secret bbq sauce :P  I know people argue about what makes good ribs.  It's not just the sauce (I'm sure Phil perfected his because I've never tasted anything like it.  His sauce is not so sweet and not so tangy.  It's just PERFECT w/ the right amount of spices!).  I seriously think it's in the preparation of the meat as well.  I heard it thru the grapevine that they brine their meat, so that they become "fall off the bones" tender.  And don't get it twisted...THEY DO!  The RIBS are tender and flavorful, they make you go "um...um...um!".  This is not the only tongue-tickler on the menu.  The PULLED PORK (BROUGHAM) SANDWICH is off the chain (tender shredded pork w/ Phil's barbecue potion, on an onion bun, topped with creamy coleslaw), as well as their BEEF RIBS, cripsy BEER BATTERED ONION RINGS, COLESLAW (I'm not usually big on slaw, but Phil's is fo'shnizzle good!), and of course their BAKED BEANS (rockin'!).   I'm not so near this joint, but I tend to make an excuse to visit my friend down S.D. so I can eat at Phil's!  Hah!  Btw, order ahead before you get there 'cuz the line is OUT DA DOOR!

This place is good.. but I don't know that it is the BEST... I am not from San Diego but I was in town and a friend had heard so many good things so we waited in line around 45-60mins on a Sunday afternoon. We ordered a few assortments of things for the table to try (there were 10 of us) the food was good.. but the ribs didn't fall off the bone as I was expecting for all of the hype. Needless to say I don't think I would wait in line again for this but if it wasn't so crowded I'd give it another shot.

Ok, so it's been years since I went to the location in Hillcrest. I was delighted with the food then and I am still delighted now. BBQ is great, although the wait... well unless you're going to be dining in I would suggest to phone in your order. I waited in line for close to 3 hours on a Saturday afternoon. Good thing I had some lunch or I probably would have passed out. The wait for phone in orders can be about 10-15mins as well so don't expect fast food service. They don't pack your order until you pay for your phone in order so it'll be hot when they pack it. Can't wait to come back to San Diego to visit one of the Phil's BBQ locations.

This is the place to be if you're craving some BBQ. The portions here are huge! I usually order the baby back ribs or beefy ribs if i'm craving a lot of meat. The meat is tender and falls right off the bone. The sauce is tangy and had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. Theres always a line here, but it usually moves quickly.

It's okay.. the lines are pretty long but time flies. So far, everything I've tried just wasn't poppin'. The sauce was pretty tasteful but it didn't make much of an impression on me. The ribs I had were pretty dry. Their burgers as well. Yes, the portion is plentiful but it did not satisfy my taste buds. You can refill soft drinks which I like. Oh yeah, even the onion rings were OKAY. They were really greasy and I got sick of it after 1. Good thing I shared it with people. But man.. I rather have the BBQ Ribs my parents make. Sorry Phil's BBQ, I tried but it's not working between us :(

So the 45 min wait in line on mother's day to get into this place to see what the hype was all about was definitely worth it. We shared a beefy rib & chicken dinner platter with a side of macaroni salad and onion rings was off the chain! It was also pretty cheap for the amount of food we got. we shared the entree, and couldn't even finish it (2 ribs, 1/4th chicken, with a large side of macaroni salad, and small onion rings). It was enough to feed 3 people all for $17. The meat was so tender and juicy, and definitely hit the spot. We LOVED the mac salad...not sure what seasoning they use to make is sooo flavorful, but a definite must try. service was actually pretty speedy...so don't feel intimidated by the long lines..they actually move pretty quick. if you happen to be in the SD area....definitely go check it out!

Well, I posted a review a little over a month ago, but after thinking it over, I realized it just wasn't fair; at least not fair to BBQ fanatics that eat BBQ from shacks behind houses, where the meat has substantial smoke flavor, and doesn't rely on any sauces. BBQ, like "best burgers" and "best pizza", is all about personal taste preferences. And your personal taste will always be the final judge for BBQ. And Phil's "ain't in no shack", and unlike a backyard operation, it really is easy-access, off of a major boulevard and behind the SD Sports Arena. And, there's ample parking. Don't get me wrong on this review, I still think Phil's is one of the best BBQ houses in San Diego, and quite possibly for you, your favorite. But it would be unfair to compare it, across the board, to say, Everett & Jones in Oakland, a Southern style BBQ icon in the Bay Area, or Burrell's BBQ in Santa Ana, which is a little house in a residential area that has quite a history. (my ex-biz partner swears by Burrell's.) Phil's is a well honed big operation, where you walk up to the long stainless steel counter, meet your BBQ order-taking specialist, make your decisions, pay, and take your vibrator/pager to where ever you decide you want to sit. And then you wait for the vibrating pager to signal when you can pick up your order and start pigging out. And to pay praise where it's certainly due, Phil's is a great example of a food business that understands how to marry great product, an efficient and comfortable facility, and high-level customer service. I found all three to be, remarkably, well integrated and at the top of the scale. If you enjoy substantial BBQ flavors and the availability of thick sweet and/or spicy sauces, then you should definitely try 'em out. I doubt anyone would say they absolutely didn't care for Phil's, because it is tastey. If you're like me, and travel around the country and try every nook and cranny BBQ place, then you may not be so hasty in doleing out the 5-star reviews, which actually makes my 3-star rating extremely solid. But if you do hand out 5's, you might want to indicate what you think makes great BBQ. I like American, sweet BBQ sauces, and meats that have a deep smoke flavor and clearly defined smoke rings. And if you try the TRI-TIP SANDWICH, you'll get alot of smoke flavor, and then you can hit it with as little or as much sauce as you care. For our lunch, we ordered the tri tip sandwich, short ribs and chicken, and also the chicken nuggets, in their own heavy sauce. (those are my San Diego client's favorite thing.) I loved the Tri-tip sandwich, and would recommend it. The nuggets may be off the charts for a traditionalist, but great if you think you'd enjoy fried chicken nuggets, generously covered in a sweet and tasty BBQ sauce. Again, this is all subjective. Their short ribs, for me, were drier than I prefer. But overall, I highly recommend Phil's if you're hankerin' for BBQ. You will not be disappointed. (Order a side of their onion rings with whatever you get!)

there's usually a line.  and it's long. but that's ok.  i don't eat here every week.  or even every month.   yes.  i think it's worth the wait.  really.  it's not that long of a wait.  you'd probably wait in line longer at a club in downtown.  minus the satisfaction you would get from the meal you just had. the service.  is nothing to complain about.  it's good. the food.  i like.  a lot. is it worth 5 stars.  maybe.  i'm not sure.  and if i'm not sure.  it's not getting a 5.  so i'm rounding down.  sorry phil's. the beef ribs. are huge.  a litte fatty.  tender. but not too tender.  yes. the baby back ribs. not so huge.  not as tender.  but just as good as the beef.  yes. their sauce is tangy.  a litte too tangy.  but still good.  they sure use a lot of sauce.  i for one.  don't think it needs. that much.  still.  i like it. just not in such high quantities. my first time was like this.  i tried beef.  then the pork.  i thought i liked the beef better. went after the beef again.  then the pork.  and was like.  i'm not sure now.  i think i like the pork better.  it's like dating sisters.  which one do i like more. the onion rings.  were a yes. and one more yes just in case. in three words.  beer battered deliciosness.  without the genenric taste that usually comes along with most onion rings. the coleslaw and fries. were simply.  no.  i think i'd like it better at kfc.  but that's ok. didn't come here for that. usually i feel dirty.  after indulging myself with such a rich meal.  i didn't feel that way.  it was like.  i got to have both sisters.  and they were ok with it.

Phil's is definitely my favorite BBQ spot! It's simply irrrrresistable. I recommend trying whatever sounds yummy on the menu cuz you really CAN'T go wrong. All entrees are big enough to share between two people and the service is fast and friendly. Like all of my favorite places, the wait may seem reee-dic, but it's DEFINITELY worth the wait. Everyone in SD loves Phil's, and if you're not from SD... this place will make you wanna move ;)

So i had to try this place after all the hype i've been hearing.  What is wrong with  you people??!!  that's not real BBQ.  i had the beef ribs....they are not even smoked, they are braised in the oven and finished off on the grill and covered in disgusting malt vinegar BBQ sauce.  How do i know they are braised????  there is not hint of a smoke ring.  The only thing that saved this place was the fresh cut fries and onion rings.  Other than those two things.....i have NO idea why there's a line around the building.

What can I say about Phil's Bbq but if I could give them more than 5 stars I would!!!  I have being going to Phil's since they 1st opened in Hillcrest years ago and had to wait hours in the small place.  And when they opened the bigger location, I was little scared there food quality was going to go down but they sure and thankfully dissapointed me.  It got even better than the original and at 1st I thought how are they going to fill such a huge place compared to the original, and wow I was surprised!!!  Service all I can say is that all restaurants should learn from Phil's bbq's service.  You do have to wait sometimes up to an hor and a half, but  the moment you walk in into the restaurant, everybody smiles at you as if you were in Disneyland and once you sit down after ordering your food, you only wait about 15 minutes more before they have it ready for you.  Amazing system!!!  Now about the food, all I can say is that you have to go down there and just try it.  My order for me and my girlfriend is always one single Beef Rib (which I believe everybody has to try) and a full dinner of the baby backs with fries and do not leave without getting there famous Onion Rings!!!  If you do not feel like waiting on line, just do pick up at take it home 8-)  Thank you Phil for never letting me down and knowing what Excellent Food and Service really is!!!

Ok, so I'm not a big carnivore, but my bf is and he wanted to take me to this fabulous place his roommates introduced him to when he first moved to PB.  Not feeling too excited about it, I obliged because I was starving and seeing he was so excited to take me to it.  When I walked into Phil's I realized it wasn't like your conventional restaurant where a host/hostess seats you and gives you menus and drinks and works it for a tip.  Instead I jumped into a line just in time before it began to filter out the door and found myself holding onto my bf's arm for dear life.  All the meat seemed to make everyone go crazy =P Anyway we had originally intended on taking the food home with us, but we decided to just find a seat and eat there, which he recommended cuz he said it would get messy, to which I scoffed at because I'm not a messy eater.  We found a nice 2-person table with a roll of paper-towel on the wall (that gave it quite the romantic feel) and the buzzer which would let us know when our food was ready.  Once it went off my bf went and got our food.  It definitely got messy once I saw how good the food looked, not to mention tasted it!  We got the Ribs & Chickless, Beef Chickless, Onion Rings, and Baked Beans. YUM, YUM, YUM, and YUUUUUM!!  While we both agreed the Beef Chickless wasn't that great (because it was really fatty) the Ribs & Chickless was mouth-wateringly delicious!! The onion rings were to die for, and the baked beans were basically consumed by only me because I wouldn't share.  For a girl who prefers her vegetables and sushi over meat, I was definitely a carnivore for the night (I like to think he found it incredibly sexy)! It was so good that I suggested he take me there before my plan flight back to Boston so I could fatten up on meat before my long ride back. Phil's BBQ is definitely somewhere I'm gonna want to eat at again when I get back to PB!!

Them ribs! I love the beef ribs and I order them as a dinner with the chicken. I don't know how they make these ribs, but they are AWESOME. Tender, tasty, and just perfect. You have to, YOU HAVE to order by phone, cause the wait time is at least an hour on weekends. If you order by phone, they grab your name and number, so the next time you call, they address you by name and you can ask for the usual (if you have a usual). I wish I knew their secret! Maybe they soak them ribs in Vodka or something! If someone knows, please post it!!! Happy eating!

I like my meat products cleverly disguised.  I 'm supposed to be a vegetarian on the right occasion.  Its a Catholic upbringing thing.  So when I walk in, I'm like a sorority chick in a frat house kegger pretending I've had too much to drink and need to 'lie down somewhere'.  I won't order anything with ribs exposed or a slabs of meat bigger than my head.  But inside I'm rolling in the BBQ sauce and giving my number out to all the big, bad meat plates I run into on my way to my table with my veggie burger and delicious onion rings.

After a super tiring day at the SDZ Safari Park, we came here and ordered dinner to-go. It was the best BBQ I've ever had in a restaurant. Baby back ribs were delicious and fall-off-the-bone tender. Cole slaw was pretty good, fries and potato salad were nothing to rave about. The onion rings however were amazing, and I'm glad I decided to go with the small instead of the large at the last minute because it was a HUGE portion! I also ordered a pulled pork sandwich but I thought it was little dry. Ordering over the phone was a breeze and I got my order all ready to go within minutes after paying. I would definitely come back when I go to San Diego again.

My old childhood friend who I haven't seen for more than 25 years introduced me to the best BBQ place in San Diego.  It surely is a very popular place and the food was REALLY tasty.  The sauce was a little too heavy for me but you can ask them to go light on the sauce. The baby back ribs and the chicken were very good, but the best thing is that the leftovers taste great the day after.

Phil's seems to be the Applebee's of the bbq world.  The food seems pre cooked,  and the waiters have way to much energy.  The bbq sauce can easily be mistaken for sweet and sour sauce,  for christ sake it's red.  If all these people think that this is real bbq,  I suggest you come up to northern california.  Southern california bbq doesn't compare at all.

I had to try it since i was in Sd for some work related stuff I ordered the back rib dinner portion.  It had a fast food vibe I guess ordering from the counter and and waiting for your food was totally strange to me for a place of this caliber.  The food came out pretty fast, they had given us buzzers to let us know when the food comes out that's such  a great idea while we looked for tables.   I love their sides dishes. Rib was good not great maybe because I had better home made ribs before

Overrated, I know it's extremely popular but the bbq sauce just isn't my type.  It's more on the "sour"side, and I like my bbq sauce kind of sweet.  This is just my personal preference.  The baby back ribs were cooked well, the fries are the large cut kind so it's not as crispy as how I would like it.  BBQ chicken combo was good.  I think we had potato salad and mac salad on the side, mac salad was definately better.  The staff were really friendly and you pay in advance.  I left them a really good tip.  They sell their bbq sauce on the side.  I came here for a weekend lunch, line was long but fair enough.  I like how you can SMELL everything.  I don't like how I have to find my own spot.  After a long wait I still had to battle for seats :l  You'd have better luck with seats on the left side near the bar.

This place has awesome beef ribs and potato salad. I really like their mild but perfect blend of sauce. It's not Texas style so it's not as flavorful.

I'm not usually a rib guy, but I was in town with a friend who insisted on going here.  He drove, so basically I had no choice.  The line was around the corner to get in but we went to sit at the bar and they let us go right in and order.  The line was about 45 minutes long (there's a sign outside that said so like a ride at Disneyland). They have decent beers on tap, we got a pitcher of arrogant bastard.  I ordered  a half-rack of short ribs with potato salad, fries and split a small order of onion rings between the 3 in our group.  The half order of ribs was huge and delicious, probably the best I've ever had and I have been on a quest to find something just as good ever since.  The potato salad was not costco style Reeser's like at other places, I could have eaten a big bucket of that by itself.  And the small order of onion rings were enough to make the 3 of us happy. I don't think I could ever go back to San Diego without stopping by this place.  Best bbq joint I've ever been in.

Mmm. This place is pretty dang good. After living in San Diego for my entire life thus far, you'd think I'd have tried this place already! After buying about a million party snaps at the swap meet just down the block (and throwing them at unsuspecting folks), my brother, our friend, and I had worked up quite an appetite. We decided that meat, especially in large portions, would be the way to go. We waited in line for a good 20 minutes. What sucks about the entrance is that you have to wait to even get up to the counter, and there's no seating for people who are waiting. Other than that, it's not bad. There are televisions all around, and you can watch one of those while you wait. The counter is a lot like you'd find at Fuddruckers or any other place where you order and then pick up a pager. While waiting, I noticed that this place had the tone of a grouchy-ass aunt or something. A sign informed patrons that patience (and likely, they meant waiting) is a virtue, and that there was to be no pre-seating (grabbing a table before you placed an order). The guy at the door was asking if there was a party of 6 in line. A lady came up and said, "We have a party of 5...does that work?" His response: "No...that's why I said SIX." Granted, it annoys me when people try to bend the rules and do dumb crap while thinking they're being cute, but he could have been a little bit nicer. Later, I went to pick up some wet hand wipes from the condiment-and-cutlery station, and the packaging of the wet wipes said something to the effect of, "If you need more than one, go to our hand-washing station." Sheesh! I thought barbecue was about wild times and hicks, not being ordered about more than you would be in Communist China! Next, they'll be telling me that everything's better in Texas, and I'll be on a fast-moving death row for doing something wrong! The food was DELICIOUS, and the prices can't be beat. A "small" side of French fries would have been enough for 2 people to split, but we didn't know that, and everyone ordered their own. The small sides of beans are so damn good, but they're what you'd actually consider a small side. I ordered a cheeseburger, and they actually cooked it rare! I love when that happens; too many places will only go as far as medium before they start getting their communal panties in a bunch about food-borne illness, e-coli, the Black Plague, and who knows what else. My friend ordered the baby back ribs...oh, yes. Heaven. (I tried one.) The restrooms and the restaurant were clean. If you're a late bloomer by San Diego standards and haven't tried Phil's BBQ yet, definitely check it out!

This place lives up to the hype.  For having a line that wraps around the building they keep things moving.  Customer service was great.  The BBQ sauce is some of the best I have had, tangy, spicy, excellent.  We had a BBQ pulled pork sandwich, BBQ chicken and onion rings.

Simply the best BBQ in Southern California! They make the best ribs!!! The meat falls off the bone and they are covered in sauce (their BBQ sauce is delicious). The onion rings are large and similar to tempura rings. They also give you lots of fries, which are filling but could be crisper. They have combo meals that are really cheap, too. The only downside to Phil's is the very long line (could be upwards of 45 minutes at times), but this can be avoided by going at off hours or ordering on the phone and picking it up. I highly recommend Phil's for anyone looking for the best BBQ they've ever tasted.

THe Best BBQ I ever had! I was also really hungry and it was my first time there, but I just remember my first bite into those baby back ribs I was just like woww this is sooo deliciouss!! THe pork baby back ribs are sooo tasty and perfectly tender!! Every bite was tasty, even the parts not covered in bbq sauce, which shows that it's not just mediocre meat slathered in bbq sauce and the sauce is the only reason it's good. THe meat itself is really tasty, well marinated, and every piece was perfectly bbqed, moist, tasty, and not burnt. Between the two of us, we got a full rack of ribs dinner with fries, a half chicken, onion rings, and a side of macaroni salad. We were sooo full!! We couldn't finish it all. The baby back ribs were definitely my favorite part of the meal! I would come just for the ribs, and the rest of the stuff was just okay, just complements to the ribs. The onion rings (when hot) were really tasty, they have this unique intense onion taste that are much better than other onion rings i've had before. The rings are reallyyy big! BUt once they got cold, they weren't good, so i could've done without it cuz i was soo full already. The large fries that comes with the ribs dinner is pretty large, they were good. But fries are always good so not much to say there. THe macaroni salad was meh. I didn't like it much at all. It has this weird, pungent, bitterish flavor, I don't know what it is, But I don't like it at all. I like my mac salad to taste like the kind at hawaiian places. The chicken was good, but chicken is just not tasty like pork. I'm just not a chicken person, cuz chicken compared to the pork has no taste, i could only taste the bbq sauce. We also got beers. They had Fat Tire! We went on a Sunday around 8 pm, and there was a longggg line wrapped around the whole building!! The price is worth it for what you get. I will definitely come back, and usually I don't like hyped up restaurants, but this one is definitely worth all the hype!!!

I love BBQ... Just thinking of this place makes me want to go their right now and get something to eat.  The broham is the best BBQ sandwich I have ever had.  The rib less dinner has become my new favorite menu item because not only is it awesome but it's a ton of food as well.  The ticklers are also another good choice.  The sauce here is perfect, the service is friendly and quick, and even if you come here and have to wait in line it moves very quickly.  You gotta come here and try this place...

Waited a very long time for this...though my friend said an hour was considered good already! Everything was delicious...fries were a bit plain, but add in that seasoning and BAM! wow so yummy! The ribs could be more tender, but I understand with the amount of people coming in that cook-time can be a problem. Onion rings were greasy and too crunchy for me, but my friends liked it. The biggest WOW-factor came from the bbq sauce, which made the whole meal a party in my mouth :)

i thought this BBQ place was good.  The long line wasn't so bad waiting.  I think we waited for like about 20 mins.  You order your food inside and it's basically every table group for themselves.  You have to find your own table as the waiters don't reserve any.  I ordered the BBQ cheeseburger which was really delicious since I was starving.  We ate outside and thats all I can really say about this dining experience.

So many fakes out there and theres only one real deal. Phil's is the real deal when it comes to BBQ. It's really annoying to see so many other companies pop up after they made it a mainstream thing. It wouldn't be so annoying if they just served something half as decent. The only other BBQ spot I would recommend besides Phil's is Coop's. They have a new location that has less of a wait which is cool. I was getting tired of coming early in the morning to avoid the lines.

I didn't want to believe all the hype about how good this place actually was. I never really got into BBQ because it's more of a Southern/Texan thing. The closest thing to BBQ that I have enjoyed are those Costco BBQ ribs that are already cooked and only needs to be baked. So when I heard that this place was unbelievably good, I had high expectations. This place sure did live up to them. While the line was long and it took 20 minutes to get in to order, we were lucky to go on a Wednesday night rather than a weekend. The service is Fuddrucker's style where you order then they buzz you when your food is ready and you choose where to sit. I always want to try everything so I shared Baby Back Ribs and BBQ Chicken with Iris C. and she had some of my Beefy Ribs combo. That way, we both got to try all three BBQ meat items. The "Best of Both" combo costs $10.95 and comes with either 1 large side or 2 small sides. The best by far are the Baby Back Ribs. Nothing can compare to how tender and flavorful they are. The Beefy Ribs are also good, but the meat is tougher, but the rib itself is huge. You get two in the combo and when I saw them, they reminded me of the opening sequence to The Flinestones when Fred gets that giant rib on the side of his stone car and it's so heavy that it tips the car over. The boneless chicken was a little dry - maybe because it was from breast; I might want to try the bone-in chicken next time. The sauce was just ridiculously good. We also had a potato salad and corn-on-the-cob side. They were also good. The best part is that Phil's BBQ is relatively inexpensive and affordable. I am always looking for good value for the quality of food that I am getting. It doesn't necessarily have to be super cheap or expensive, but as long as I am getting what I am paying for. I will return for sure to try the rest of the items on the menu, including the sandwiches!

just some tips to add... 1) beef ribs better than baby back ones: meatier, bigger, fattier 2) get the potato salad. if you love potatoes and celery, you'll love this salad 3) good place if you want to watch a game: nice sony flat screen tv's everywhere 4) i don't appreciate the barbe-Queue cam : ( stop recording us please! 5) if you try to order over the phone to save time and then bring your to-go to sit down at the restaurant, you'll get yelled at, don't do it.

This place has a lot of hype around it. I that you can order, pick your own table, then wait for the buzzer to pick up your food. It seems to go off pretty quickly. That't the only ok thing about this place. I waited in line for an hour (Saturday afternoon). I ordered a chicken sandwich. When I got it I immediately thought it looked nasty. I was a burnt piece of grilled chicken with a huge blob of BBQ sauce on it. The sauce was all over the place even on top of the bun. I get that BBQ isn't tidy food but this went overboard.   On top of that, I took 2 bites of my sandwich and honestly couldn't finish it. It was disgusting. Worst BBQ flavor I've ever tasted. Oh and the french fries were nasty too. Horrible food. I'll never go again.

If you're used to midwestern/southern/awesome bbq, you'll be let down a little bit.  But its the closest thing I have found to delicious bbq since i've been here.  Their bbq sauce is more tangy than spicy and has a good warm taste to it.  The broham sandwich as well as the beef sandwich whatever that one is called and the platters are great too.  chickless are delicious.  apparently thats just chicken that doesn't have bones and its little bits of them, but really they're big bits.  and the ribs are bomb.  still not exactly what you get from home, but you definitely can't blame them for trying and i'm definitely not complaining.

Great place for some BBQ!  I've been here once before, but didn't remember too much besides that I had a good time w/ good company.  Last weekend, when I got there with some friends, the line was ridiculous!!  It was out the door and around the corner.  It was LONG.  LUCKILY our friends already were in and had a table!  I got the half rack of baby back ribs and the chicken (1/4?  I think?) with the cole slaw and macaroni salad.  YUUUMM.  I'm drooling as I'm writing and thinking about it!  So good!  The portions are large as many have said and the food itself is very tasty.  The meat is tender, juicy, and has just the right amount of sauce.  SO good.  No wonder there's such a commotion for this place!  Good prices, good food, and good times to be had by all!!

so i don't know if everyone on here that love's phil's has just never had good bbq or they love sweet sauce. if it's the latter, i understand, every palate is different. i do find it hard to believe this many people prefer a sweet sauce with no heat or smoke though. i moved out here three years ago and everyone was raving about phil's, so i bought into the hype and had to try it. very disappointing. i like a smoky bbq sauce that doesn't resemble ketchup, but that's exactly what phil's tastes like to me. i'd rather go to baby back jack's in hillcrest, honestly. my buddy agrees that phil's isn't all that, so i know i'm not crazy. I'm going to try the BBQ Pit and BBQ House next, hopefully they're better than Phil's... i find phil's way overrated. they may be one of the best bbq places in SD, but that's not saying much. my wife's friend used to own a place in temecula and all her workers were family from the south with home recipes. now that's real bbq! that place showed me what real bbq is and probably ruined most places for me. thing is, bbq ain't hard, i outcook phil's all summer on my bbq! i'd rather make my own bbq than eat this stuff. phil's is to bbq what L&L is to Hawaiian food, run of the mill.

My friends and I decided to come here for a birthday with good word from a friend's boss. This place has gotten rewards for their ribs, and this being said, definitely a place to try out. We went on a Thursday night around 8:00 p.m. and the line was already out the door, which is okay because it is said that the line wraps around the building's corner on a weekend.  We waited about 30 minutes and the line moves pretty fast.   The ordering style is order from the cashiers and take a buzzer and find a table.  The staff is extremely helpful and very enthusiastic about the food.  I shared the 5 beefy ribs combo with my boyfriend, and my friends got a BBQ burger, 2 baby ribs and chicken combos, and a side of onion rings.  The portions are pretty big and freaking delicious.  Me and my boyfriend can usually eat a lot, but we could only manage to each eat 2 beefy bones.  Their sauce is so delicious and tangy and the meat slides off the bones.  Even though I ate it with a fork and knife on account of my morning dentist appt, it was easy to eat and very, very good.  The sides are pretty awesome: the onion rings are HUGE and the french fries are fresh cut.   They have a wash station by the to go counter and it comes in handy ;) Definitely go for a big dinner and share with friends.  The prices are reasonable for the quality of food. They won awards for a reason! My boyfriend and I spent about $23 for a drink, and a 5 Beefy ribs plate.  Totally worth it, and I dare anyone to go there for a first date!

BBQ is usually not my #1 selection when it comes to picking a place to eat, but having a bf that loves BBQ, I've tried every local hole in the wall and family owned restaurant. I still do have a local favorite since I'm 8 hours away at Hi Life in Downtown, SJ - Phil's deserves a crown and the throne! Service was quick with 5 cashiers taking your order and food came out in a decent time. After a long day at Legoland - my stomach was deserving of a good meal.  Pork ribs were HUGE and succulent and baby backs were tender. I'm glad they had steamed veggies for the sides so I didn't feel too guilty.

First time coming to this restaurant. EPIC FAIL. Okay we didn't have the Ribs but we came in expecting some really good Bar-B-Que...dont have brisket on the menu, so i ordered a chicken breast sandwich and the husband ordered a pulled pork, fries and bean to share. We sat down  and waited for our food buzzer to let us know our food was ready..waiting, waiting..and more waiting and others that had sat down after us had got their food and were already eating. the "walk around waitress" grabbed our buzzer and went to the kitchen to check on it. we waited another 10 or so minutes for the food. my sandwich was dry and had what looked like barbque sauce on it but really was hot sauce when i ate it...it was gross. my husbands pork  sandwich was very dry and the taste was just okay..nothing to write home about. it was a heaping of meat on a bun. the fries were discusting and we didn't touch the beans because they had a film on the top of them. i was very disappointed with this place. most barbque places have beef brisket and sausage and corn bread and sweet tea...they dont. i guess they are only known for their ribs. i will not come back. i say go down to OB and go to the restaurant out there for barbque..

The best pulled prok sandwiches ever!  The sauce is so good!  We eat here every time we go to San Diego.  We've never waited to eat there-the line is super long-but get it to go.  The prices are so good-you can easily eat your leftover the next day for lunch, so $6 for a sandwich that lasts you 2 meals is wonderful.  You can buy the sauce at Costco in San Diego (or there at Phil's) as well.

Great, mouthwatering, fall off the bone barbeque!!! It was my first time at Phil's and honestly, I felt like I was waiting in an ultra super long line at Disneyland. Their line gives you a check point, from this point it is a 30 minute wait. Thank goodness for people to make you forget how long you are waiting and just chatting it up for a good one hour and a half. It was just a really long line! Once we got through the door, it was not the end of waiting. We had to wait till we got to the podium. They first found our group of 9 a seat, then we just got to the front counter to order. We had the baby back ribs dinner, which comes with 1 large side or 2 small sides. We just got it with corn on the cob. My parents had the baby back ribs dinner with large fresh cut fries. Also, a small side of the potato salad and LARGE COLOSSAL ONION RINGS! The ribs dinner was perfect when I shared with my sister. It was a great amount for 2 people, unless you are really famished, then definitely be the beast. Let's talk about the ribs. A lot of meat on the bone, and it just came right off. You didn't need to struggle by nibbling on the bone, it just all came off. It was so flavorful, moist, and tender. I loved their BBQ sauce, it was just a good amount of tangy and not so overpowering. Oh my goodness, it was orgasmic. I loved it so much. (This could be because I hadn't eaten all day and I was extremely huuuunngry!) OR it could be THAT good. The fries were typical fries, it had some skin, I liked the seasoning that you can put on yourself, I forgot what it was. The Large colossal onion rings were extremely HUGE! COLOSSAL! They were extremely crunchy, might I add OILY!. For me, I could only have one of these because it is so oily just too much for me to handle. I normally eat one whole onion ring and the rest I just rip the batter off and just eat the onion. I know... I am strange. They are pretty good and love that CRUNCH, especially with ranch. YUM! The potato salad was also satisfying. The flavors were amazing, you can definitely taste the dill and it was a little lemony (if i remember correctly). I personally would have gotten this as our side because I liked it better than the fries. It did not have too much mayonnaise and the potatoes were not mashed but soft enough to enjoy easily. Corn on the cob was just regular cooked corn with nothing on it. You can definitely just get the simple sweet flavors of the corn. All in all, the food was AMAZING! I can't wait to come again. It was soo good. Lucille's got nothing on Phil's! - Give it a try! MUST TRY! P.S: One thing they are pretty stingy on sauces, I think they give only 1 bbq sauce and 1 ranch. The lady was being really sassy with me. I did not appreciate that. There were nine orders, you expect us to share like 2 or 3 sauces? Come on! anyways, Good luck on the wait but don't be discouraged because it was worth it for me!

i've been here twice and every time i leave more than satisfied. so you know how people in california hype everything? i was skeptical about trying this place because sooo many people hyped it up.. but honestly dude.. it's so worth the hype. i absolutely absolutely enjoy every bite! it's A LOT of food though.. i get the half rack (~6-7 pieces) baby back ribs with macaroni salad and french fries. (~$15) it is difficult to finish but you can always take it home. the leftovers are good too. :)) although.. it's really saucy. i am definitely a sauce person so i don't mind-- i actually LOVE it. but if you don't like sauce too much.. well i dunno. you should still try it. it is still worth it. HEHEHE. dude.. the meat just slides off the bone. very easily. i don't like eating with my fingers-- i use fork and knife for everything; pizzas, hamburgers, hot dogs, anything. but phil's is an exception. because the meat just slides off my hands don't even get that dirty. wheee. :)) TRY IT IF YOU ARE IN SAN DIEGO!

This place is so delicious I suggest you go with a group of friends and do family style! But otherwise, their combos are pretty satisfying, too. I love their sides: baked beans, coleslaw, and onion rings. Their chicken ticklers are alright .. I'd suggest you get the ribs or something else unless you've already tried everything else on the menu. The wait was ridiculous on a Saturday night (over an hour or two) ... but if there's that many people already waiting there, you know it's worth it. I'd probably be a regular if I lived in San Diego.

One of our friends looked this up and wanted to try it out one night. We had about 2 other cars following us and when we arrived around 8ish...The line was ridiculous so decided to go elsewhere. We did go the next few days since we were there because of Comic Con 2011. I don't know if there is such a thing as coming in early to line up but we lined up at 5:30pm and the line was still long. After about 1 hour of waiting. It was time for us to order. The staff was very helpful because we had a large group of about 12 and they managed to look for seating for us while we ordered our food. Now to the food! I decided to get the rack of baby back ribs. Man...the ribs are very flavor full and i suggest you get a good side order to combat the taste. The rack is alot and probably was already getting full by half of the way. ONION RINGS!!!! Woot! That was really good...if you have to choose another side. Get the onion rings.

as an atheist, Phil made me believe in a god.  and his name is phil... their BBQ broham and tickler baby back ribs are to die for.  even satan would trade in his evil ways to get his hands on the special sauce that coat everything at Phil's. i'm pretty 100% sure that phil bqq does not know the meaning of paltry when it comes to their brohams.  the mound of pulled pork was a mouth ful.  it felt like it was never ending.  it was beautiful.  the cole slaw on the bottom added a nice touch.  i don't know if phil bbq was trying to trick me into eating my veggies, but bravo.  mission accomplished.   the tickler was also a beast.  baby back ribs, fries, onion rings... seriously, you can't ask for any more.  I'd trade in my first born for a Phil's BBQ buffet...  for realz. usually i bitch about waiting in line and taking forever... etc.  but the line flew by like seconds because i was starving and sinking my lips into the food at phils made me forget about any problems in the world.   if you have not been.  just go.  i promise you'll like it, or its a money back guarantee.

I absolutely love Phils BBQ! I ordered the Chicken w/the ribs & a large side of fries! Totally didn't finish my dinner so I had to get a To Go box. Normally there's a long wait outside the building that can wrap around to the exit door (the other patio door) lucky me I barely waited 10minutes and then it was time to order. There's also a bar inside I think it closes at 930pm because my friends and I got in around that time and were looking forward to getting a nice alcoholic beverage but that didn't happend which was ok.

BBQ, BAR-B-QUE, etc. However you say it, it's all the same thing. I have been going to Phil's since if was located at a shack and still coming back. You can sometimes catch Phil hanging out once in a while and even talking to his customers. When I went here the small restaurant it originally was at could not handle the amount of people it does not in a week! The menu is not that long but that's because it doesn't need to be. Everything I've tried there has been delicious. My favorite thing there is the baby back ribs; a lot of people say fall off the bone good but Phil's is fall off the bone plus just tears away with your fingers! The ribs are just plain tender, juicy, and did I say DELICIOUS? No matter larger or small the fries are served to feed a family. A little tip is ask for a little extra sauce when picking up your food to dip your fries in to make it that much more good. My second favorite dish is the pulled pork sandwich. All because it is a sandwich don't think it is any more cleaner. It is loaded with meat and sauce just as much as a fat kid would like. If I had to die, I'd eat phils beforehand.

ok, i wont lie... ive been a fan since their other location in mission hills - when i would wait in the car (no parking) as my fiance ran inside and grabbed me a broham sammich to go. so i was very impressed when they went BIG - and opened up this joint in point loma. i am able to park all the time now, but be fore warned, as the wait is still there. i dont mind the wait as much, as now there is plenty of seating to go around - and the service is always awesome by the cashiers and the kids busting tables. the bbq is the best of san diego in my opinion - i LOVE the RIB-less Dinner and rib ticklers - but the traditional baby back rib slab is pretty damn good too. do yourself a favor and get the onion rings with em - and if you want a sandwich treat - do the BBQ Broham. yum. they still do take out, price is good, the new joint is very well designed and trendy, plenty of parking - an impressive UPGRADE from the last location. 5 star bbq in san diego.

it suuuuure is dee-rishus. (i ate all of my baby back and chicken combo, tender and scrumptious. i like that they have the option for a dual protein and steamed vegetables on the side too!) it suuuuuuure is satisfying. (it's a lot of food. i think i was full until 1pm the following day.) and it suuuuure made me thirsty the next day! (water - i need water! meats are so saucy and so salty.) but you know what?  it just wasn't *WOW* for me. (my pinnacle standard is Rudy's BBQ in Texas) to supplement all of the other yelps, the wait at Phil's BBQ is super long, so don't go hungry! it's a wait to ORDER food, not a wait to get seated. it's kind of like a fancy mcdonald's, in that way.  go find your seat later. we did learn a neat trick from a local though - they serve the full menu at the bar! so if you can snag a seat or two at the bar, you can order drinks AND dinner from the bartender. we opted for the take-out counter, which clocked in our dinner wait at only 10 minutes! we scarfed down our appetizers by the door and then took dinner to-go. if you are craving some bbq and have a soft side for ribs (like me!), then you should definitely go!

Phil's BBQ is an institution and a household name in San Diego.  It takes me a couple of days to stop thinking about the food after eating here.  There are long lines and it is difficult to get a table.  But all of that will be forgotten once you start eating.  As w g. said, "the food is worth the wait."  It is also worth the price or even a drive from the ether regions of the county.

This is as good as it's gonna get when it comes to ribs in San Diego as far as I know. This is the ONLY place where I'll eat ribs. I've always been turned off by how fatty ribs can be, or how much effort it takes to get the little meat off the bone, the mess... just give me a hot dog, please. But when it comes to Phil's... it's like they were made of the shimmeriness off of a unicorn's horn and cooked by elves. Yeah, something like that. But really, this is the only place where I actually like the ribs. The fries were good, the barbecue sauce was good... I don't know what's not to like. I had some chicken from here too (chickless I think) but I didn't like it nearly as much as the ribs. Chicken was too dry for my taste but still yummy. I'd go here again and I hope you guys give it a try. They do have a long line but hey, that's when you just call in your order. Woo hoo!

Two words:  MUST EXPERIENCE. Phil's cannot be described in words. There needs to be an adjective in the English dictionary that accurately defines delicious-epic-fingerlickin' good-life fulfilling-want to come back again and again good. There can be long lines FYI but hey, for the nation's best baby back ribs, i think it's worth it. Plus, it builds anticipation and good character. You get a bib to wear. That right there should tell you that you are in for a TREAT.

Finally got to try this place!! It is sooo good!! We got the ribs, chicken and El Toro. I LOVED the ribs!! Just thinking about it making me hungry. The only negative I have to say is the line is long!!! I'm glad we ordered to go. This is one of the best BBQ I've had. And their coleslaw is good too, I'm very picky when it comes to coleslaw, so it a plus!! We will DEFINITELY be back, but order to go!

I've been here many times and there is always a long line, but it moves pretty fast. My usual is from the best of both worlds menu which includes ribs and chicken and two sides. I love the baby back ribs, boneless chicken, and coleslaw. The fries are ok, but I need carbs with my meal. The only thing they are missing is some bread. The meal is pretty large for an average person. I like to share :)

Terrific BBQ food at very reasonable costs, with quite significant portions too! The baby back ribs fall off the bone; chicken nicely accomplished but jucy; cole slaw fresh and tasty; BBQ sauce tangy. The lengthy lines move quickly. They've got their systems nicely tuned, order at a counter, and a electronic device tells you when to pick up your food (fresh and rapidly). Attentive staff gives utensils and checks back at tables to see in the event you want some thing else. Could not believe the amount of food that we had for a party of four at $60 all included. No wonder it really is so highly rated!

Having been to many BBQ restaurants is my life I've come to be a self proclaimed expert. Phils is definitely on the top of their game when serving up the baby back ribs. Just get in line with the rest of the herd and try not to piss off the teen taking your order by taking to long looking at the menu behind her. I don't eat here as often as I would like but if I did I wouldn't be able to hold my pants up on my big ***. Take a ride over to Phils and get you some ribs. Eat up.

First time didnt like it(cows they used probably were from mexico). Second time I understand why people like this place. I orderd the half rib plate with two sides $15-20, they dont serve mashed potato's(over healthy female cashier looked disgusted at me when I asked for some, like I was a piece of vegetable she didnt wanna eat). All you can drink fountain sodas.  Still dont know who Phil is? But they got this big blacc woman chillin near the door saying thank you for coming, one time she wasnt there, it was a skinny blacc lady(maybe she lost weight or that was her maid). Next time I gotta try the ribs with no sauce(looked like a plate from the flinstones).

I must pay my respect to my favorite BBQ place in town! Tried other spots which were good, but I have to say Phil's is head and shoulders above the rest of the competition. The only downside about this place is the line when there busy. But lines are a clear indicator that they must be doing something right and it moves pretty swiftly. I still gotta give them 5 stars for helping me on my quest to get as much meet stuck in my teeth as possible. Who got a toothpick?

This place gets 5 stars because they make it a point to do everything right.  Is is the BEST bbq?  I don't know, but it sure is damn tasty and a fun place to go.  I would come here again for sure.   Didn't see my bud Jaron's review beforehand, but  I just happened to have seen this on my SD yelp list and wanted to give it a try.   Lamely attempting  to beat the dinner rush, DH, son and I got there at 5:30 pm thinking this was ample time.  However, there was already a line, but it moved quickly.  This is a place to get your grub on and move on.  No lingering.   Soon, looking behind me, I saw an even longer line snaking all the way around.   This restaurant is very yelp conscious with the yelp mention in the outdoor menu.  Cameras (smile!) are on you while you're in line.  Question, who's watching us? There's a guy host who helps keep the line going by asking if anyone wants to be seated at the bar.   Hey, and there's a pleasant but don't put up with nonsense hostess who controls the line at the front.  Smart, cuz we know with that intoxicating smoky bbq aroma causing salivating patrons to be indecent enuff to cut in line.   I ordered the tickler menu for son, the pulled pork sandwich for myself and the full rack of baby back ribs for DH.  Sides ordered:  bbq baked beans and mac salad. We had it all covered except for the potato salad which I'll try next time. The cashiers were friendly.  They were trained well in customer service.   I was given a pager the size of a candy bar cell phone from the 90s, much larger than the ones at the Cheesecake factory which threw me off.  I couldn't tell when the light went off since there was a intermittent flash.  Duh on me but I'll soon be a regular. Anyway, when I picked up our food, we definitely needed to don bibs for the ribs.  The bbq sauce has a strong tangy flavor which is quickly addicting and can make a grown man almost cry, it's that good!  I crave it right now as I type this review.   The tickler plate did just that.  Tickled me pink like the pigs that we consumed that day.   It was absolutely huge!  I thought what a great value and it's probably a kids' meal size.  Boy, was I wrong!   Other patrons positively gasped when I placed this plate in front of my 4 year old.   No worries though, i helped him polish this off. Another plus, the tickler plate also gives you a taste of the huge onion rings, 2 of them in fact.  This is an awesome value! The mac salad and cole slaw are both delish, a nice milder complement to the bbq and not overloaded with mayo.   The mac salad also had a good amount of celery for flavor, the way I like it. The bbq baked beans were really tasty too.  I would definitely order that next time I'm here.   Fries were typical fare.   Next trip out to SD and we'll be back for sure!

Phil's BBQ is derrrrrrissshus.  The lines get supppppppper long but they go by fairly quickly.  You basically order your food as you would at a fast food place, find a seat and wait for your little buzzer thing to light up when your food is ready to be picked up.  To avoid lines, go during happy hour and go directly to the bar or call in your order and take it to go.  You can't order on the phone and eat it there, it's rude and well... not allowed.  It's also in the same complex as Red Lobster and The Mens Wherehouse.... So if you're craving ribs and need a suit you're in luck

The wait for us wasn't as long as people said, we waited about 20 minutes and got a seat at the bar. My boyfriend and I shared the babyback ribs and pulled pork sandwich with onion rings and a side of macaroni salad. The ribs were fall off the bone delicious however the pulled pork sandwich wasn't really to my liking. I guess it's because I'm not a big eater of pork but my boyfriend seemed to enjoy it. We were very full and satisfied. I would come here again, and again, and again.

While sitting in the car contemplating what to write on yelp I noticed a bit of remnant BBQ sauce left in a cuticle. Even though I was full about 7 degrees beyond comfortable, I found myself sucking that last bit of sauce and thinking that moist towelettes aren't required here.  The place is definitely is "suck it out of your cuticles good."

What can I say other than it's Phil's BBQ, the best BBQ in San Diego.  I love the ribs here.  The meat is juicy and tender and you get all the fall off the bone goodness.  I always order the chicken and ribs.  They give you a insane amount of fries.  And I love their fries.  Very simple but great crisp and seasoning.  Why try other places?  Just go to Phil's.  You wont regret it.

LOVE this place!  I liked it so much the first time that i went back two more times that week!  The lady at the hostess stand embodies the true meaning of customer service with her friendly greetings and warm smile and Phil is even better.  He personally walks around greeting his customers which is not done very often by restaurant managers ever.  And the icing on the cake is the food which it to die for.  It's always packed and there's a reason. My personal favorite is the Bro Ham, I don't know what's in that sauce but whoever created the recipe is a freakin' genious.  This place is a must for all bbq lovers and those visiting the San Diego area.

There isn't much you can say about phil's bbq that hasn't been said by the yelp community. The bbq is top notch and runs circles around the competition around san diego. This location is the original one, expect to wait in a long line. They also have a new location for those who can't stand waiting for food.

A second return and I'm still sticking to my vegetarian guns, my will power must be made of steel. Of course, got the Garden Veggie burger, but with a side of coleslaw this time. Man, this coleslaw was good too! The 'slaw was crispy and tossed with the right amount of 'slaw sauce. My friends fully enjoyed their turkey burger and I even got a free drink. I was told the sangria was satisfactory and the colossal onion rings were indeed colossal. The onion rings were good, a bit too much fried-ness for my liking, but then again, I'm not a huge onion ring person. But it still had a good flavor. Waited a tad longer than I did last time, but had good company in form of hot foreign guy, so the time went by fast. Hah. Will definitely come back despite self-inflicted vegetarianism.

Overhyped. I've been here a handful of times, and I still don't understand why everyone thinks this place is amazing. Lucille's BBQ has better food and they're a chain restaurant. Prices were average. The kid's meals are a pretty good portion/price if you want to get that. It will fill you up. I wasn't really a fan of the sauce they use. It was a weird spicy & sweet combination that just threw me off.

Well, I just had to come check out the new location near the Sport's Arena.  This venue is definitely much more spacious and commercial than the original location that is closed now.  Personally, I liked the small intimate feel of the original location.   You have GOT to be kidding me, this place had a line out the door at 4:30pm in the afternoon.  Despite the long line we were able to reach the front in about 10 minutes to order, so not too bad.  I ordered the best of both worlds with baby bbq ribs and 1/4 chicken.  Remembering the portions were huge at the old location I thought I would need to share this dish.  Yeah, not so much.  I could have had two of those plates to myself, I must have ordered the wrong thing?  There was no way I wanted to get back in the even longer line just to order more food.  The 1/4 chicken was actually a small chicken thigh and we got 2 scoops of coleslaw and pasta salad for our sides(limited selection on sides).  The ribs were somewhat disappointing compared to how I remembered them and the meat was not nearly as tender as I remembered.  There was no falling off the bone action going on here....  I was left bummed and hungry.  Maybe my BBQ standard has gone up after eating at other places?  Hence, the minus 1 star.

Most places that get a high rating will raise my expectations, and I'm usually a little disappointed afterwards.  Not so with Phil's.  We were lucky to beat the crowd, so we walked straight up to the counter.  The woman behind the register was EXTREMELY helpful and friendly to us noobs.  She explained everything and made a lot of recommendations. The chicken and ribs were very good.  Tender, juicy, flavorful.  The sauce had a great smoky flavor without being overpowering.  Not sure why other reviewers are complaining about the sides, as I thought they were pretty good too - although I was enjoying the ribs and chicken a lot more than the fries and corn.  Restaurant was clean, as were the bathrooms.  Prices were a little on the high side in my opinion, but I will pay money for good food every time vs. saving some money to eat mediocre food.

4 1/2 STARS. things i will wait in line an hour or more for: 1. the midnight showing of Twilight 2. the space mountain ride at disneyland 3. justin bieber's autograph 4. a collector's limited edition bobblehead of the dalai lama 5. phil's BBQ dont forget to bring a book, a boardgame, or a 1000+ piece jigsaw puzzle when you dine here because you WILL wait in line AT LEAST 45 minutes.  but don't fret because while you're waiting, your appetite will slowly grow & your dining experience will mean so much more. you could probably close your eyes & point to any item on the menu & not be disappointed.  whether you choose to go with the ribs, chicken, or both, either way, your taste buds will build a shrine for you.  each piece of meat is slowly cooked which creates the most tender morsels you can get from a BBQ restaurant.  the meat literally falls off the bones even with a slight touch from your silverware.  their super secret barbecue sauce's tangy, sweet & spicy mixture both confuses & commands your taste buds to have more.  add on a full order or two half orders of sides & i guarantee you think twice about getting in your car, driving home & risk getting into an accident because you fell asleep at the wheel from being so full.  the macaroni salad is a winner & you will be sick of fries after eating a bucket full of the half order! this restaurant is not only a local favorite, but mainly a tourist attraction, so the long line & wait will be a given.  its a family friendly environment, you get a ton of food for the price you pay, parking is plentiful, &service is always good. i guess what im trying to say is, i kinda like this place.

This review is overdue. I came down to San Diego over the 4th of July weekend to see my grandparents and extended family visiting from New York, and the 9 of us ended up coming here for lunch one of the days. SERVICE: They're smart. They found the most efficient way to serve all the anxious people waiting in a 1+ hour line. You wait in a line. Order your food. Seat yourself. And wait for your order to be called. Simple. There's a whole lot of counters with workers taking orders and you can see them working as fast as they can. Dude, they probably get fired if they don't work very fast. So we came here around 11:30 and ended up waiting about 15 minutes. However, when we left around 1, the line wrapped around the restaurant and the wait was probably an hour. FOOD: We ordered a whole bunch of different things off the menu, probably all of the side dishes, caesar, a little chicken, and lots and lots of baby back ribs, but this is what sticks out  from my memory: 1) THE BBQ SAUCE is to DIE for. There's just the right amount of sweetness and spiciness. It isn't overly sweet like most barbecue sauces. 2) The pork falls cleanly of the rib and melts in your mouth. There's none of that rubbery fat on most ribs. You don't have to work to eat your ribs. You can even knife and fork your ribs. First time in my life I didn't have to get my fingers too gross eating ribs. AMAZINGGG. 3) Mango Iced Tea is strangely delicious. They say that the drinks are self-serve, but a busgirl asked us what we would like and brought over our drinks. 4) I don't know why but the order of fries as a side dish is SIGNIFICANTLY larger than everything else (cole slaw, baked beans, etc.) 5) Free pens!! BEST BABY BACK RIBS EVER. I'll definitely be back the next time I visit SD.

Mmm, Phil's sauce is the boss!  There's not much to say - the BBQ is excellent.  Oddly enough, the giant new location is harder to get into than the smaller old one - your best bet is to call ahead for takeout or go with a group so you can tag team the line for food and tables.  The open seating arrangement is cool - you often have to share a table with strangers but I've always ended up meeting really nice people.  Minus one star for 3 reasons:  first, they refuse to sell me a giant tray of pulled pork (seriously, I don't want to mess around with like 10 broham sandwiches just to have good BBQ while we're watching the Chargers game); second, their sides are kinda blah (especially compared to how phenomenal the ribs and pulled pork are); and third, some of their employees have major ATTITUDE.  Settle down, mister!  You're selling BBQ, not haute couture.

Full tummy=Happy Baby. This review is being typed on a full/happy tummy...I just had the rib tickler...my 2nd favorite thing next to the ribs are the onion rings....Yes...paired with their ranch...Oweee. You can't beat the tickler deal for only 7.01!  When I'm not craving anything uptown...this is the place I'll call. Call in Your orders to avoid the out the door, around the corner ridiculous line. Now only if they had sweet potato fries...

Damn good baby back ribs. The sauce was perfect, just spicy enough. The baked beans were sweet and a little spicy. If you are in the area for a show at the San Diego Sports Arena or visiting nearby Sea World, stop in and get a plate!

It gets two because it's marginally better than the BBQ all over SD.  This city doesn't know BBQ if the bland California-style BBQ is what has San Diegan's asking for more.   Head out to Texas or Oklahoma and there in little tin shacks off highways you'll find meats sold by the quarter lbs.  Flavorful meats.  With hot sauces and Dr. Pepper and it'll run you less than $10 for a feast that's dripping with flavor. Phil's you'll drop $10 for a tiny hunk of meat that tastes like something endorsed by Martha Stewart - it'll look pretty but it'll be basic and low impact.  There's nothing possibly aggressive about it..  Everybody around you will giggle about how it's the best BBQ they've ever had as they tighten the Polo sweater around their necks or walk out to their Range Rovers.  Apparently, Phil laces his BBQ sauce with Soma.   If you want real BBQ, leave California.  This stuff isn't it.  It's just a reminder that some foods really don't exist in SD at top levels (French, Cuban, etc).

I went here for the first time a few weeks and I felt I was in heaven!! I couldn't stop eating!! The baby back ribs, regular slab ribs, onion rings, corn on the kob all very delightfully GOOD! Highly recommended, best BBQ I've ever had, to include southern Georgia and Tennessee BBQ

Suuuuper long wait, but the staff are friendly. Is it worth the wait? Ehhh, I called in for the to-go menu. The ribs were charred on one side, and that kinda annoys me, but the rest was soooo good, I'm willing to forgive them. All in all, I was verrrry satisfied at the end of my meal.

I was firm believer that nothing beats homade bbq. Umm...I has to go 500 miles away from home in Sacramento to be proven wrong. The baby back ribs and onion rings were straight up the best I've ever had. TO FRICKEN DIE FOR! I am sooooo sad there is not one of these back home, I would be eating there on the REG. I would actually like to propose marriage to Phil, so that our newfound union may never be broken. Fairwell, my sweet sweet Phil, till we meet again my love...

Really? 5 stars? I cant agree with the reviews. I had the baby back ribs and 1/4 chicken dinner and 1 beef rib, my wife had the pulled pork sandwich, my daughter had the chick tickler and we ordered a small onion ring. Everything was so/so, definitely not 5 stars. For sides I had the beans and potato salad, took two bites from beans and 2-3 from tater salad, meh.The only thing we could think of was that there are no other BBQ places in San Diego, I mean Famous Daves is better than this place. Also, where is the brisket? and the only way you can get pulled pork is on a sandwich? I was hoping for a combo platter but figured with what we ordered we tried the "top" choices. My daughters chick ticklers were dry.Once is enough for me. Every night the line would be out the door at this place, cant understand it. We were in San Diego for a week and this was one of the bottom places we ate. Claim Jumpers was great, Mahi, country fried steak and chicken fingers all were excellent, including the sides. Even Souplantation, which is down the road from Phil's, was better than this place, in our opinion.

Here's what I do when I arrive in San Diego.  Get off plane, go to rental car place, and drive to Phil's.  Then call friends and tell them I'm in.  I can't be bothered with conversation when I'm busy trying to catch the meat falling of the ribs and swabbing my fries around the sauce.  This place is an institution...

The boyfriend and I travelled 140 miles to come back to Phil's. Yes, we drove for almost 3 hrs because the food is just that good. This time we came at 2PM on a Friday and it was only a 10 min wait. What a relief! We got the ribs again but this time we got the full rack. Who knows when we're coming back here?! The ribs were very, very tender and succulent. Nicely seasoned and drizzled with their special bbq sauce. I absolutely loved the tangy, spicy kick to it. I loved it so much I bought a bottle to take home!! As for sides, we got fries, coleslaw, corn on the cob, and onion rings. The fries were super fresh. You can tell they cut and fry them right then and there. It's like in-n-out fries but thicker. Absolutely delicious with ranch, or with the leftover bbq sauce from the ribs. The coleslaw and corn were both very standard but also necessary sides, especially with all the meat and bbq sauce you're devouring. Now the onion rings was the absolute best. They're HUGE rings and the batter is just perfectly done. Not too thick but not too thin. And when you dip it in the ranch, it is just melt-in-your-mouth-goodness. No other way to put it. Be sure to get a small order because these portions are huge! I am a bit relieved that this place isn't closer to me because if it was, I would definitely contribute to the obesity epidemic!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed Phil's yet!  By far the best BBQ I've ever had... and I've had a lot of BBQ.  I've been going to Phil's for years and I always get the pork broham sandwich.  It is to die for!  If you like BBQ, go to Phil's... now.  Both locations are great but the Sports Arena location definitely has more room.

I am incredibly hard to please when it comes to bbq, and I feel I should mention this: I HATE onions. I will not eat them. I CRAVE Phil's onion rings, they are simply amazing. In short, amazing food and really reasonable prices for large portions.

My FIRST TRIP TO SAN DIEGO! whooo hoooo!! my boyfriend went to UCSD  a few years ago and raved about this place! so i was opened minded to give it a shot, The line was not that long, wait maybe 15 mins and we ordered finding a seat was fairly easy, no complaints there, The Food is sorta overrated but what you pay for it you cant really complain, 12 bucks for 2 different items and 2 sides! and 6 bucks for a really really good pulled pork! soda refills are unlimited and they also provide bibs and wet naps. Service was so-so, the workers loves talking to customers but i think they should so less talking and work a little harder, minus one star! overall kinnda a big hype. if they line was any longer or if i had to wait 40 mins i would pass.

This is one of those hard to write reviews.  Unfortunately, San Diegans know little to nothing about BBQ.  So, this is a very popular place and probably represents one of the best BBQ places in SD, but in the large universe of BBQ, this is but a small, not very bright single star.  The place has an aura, but only because we are sooo surrounded by chains and franchises.  Most annoying thing at this place is the sugary syrup they call sauce.  I want my BBQ sauce smoky and hot, not like melted candy.  Try it--if you have never had any real BBQ you might like it.  I prefer my FLA BBQ.    Best BBQ--Tom's in Boca Raton, FL.  Absolutely outstanding.

I was in San Diego last week for a friend's bachelor party and wanted to hit up this place after watching Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America.  My friends and I heard this place gets really crowded so we wanted to get there before it open.  There was already line out the door when we got there.  The weateher was hot and it took about 35-40 minutes to get in the door and order.  My friends and I ordered two full rib dinners with fresh cut fries and potato salad.  Rib was nice and tender and the BBQ sauce was not to overwhelmingly sweet.  Fries and potato salad taste really good.  We also ordered BBQ Broham and El Toro sandwich.  The Broham was ok but I highly recommend the El Toro sandwich.  It is Char-grilled deli sliced tri-tip topped with BBQ sauce.  I would definitely come back here when I come back to San Diego.

Love the food. I usually choose between a half rack of ribs, the chick tickler, or a broham depending on how I'm feeling. Everything is usually great about this place, though the old location was more homey. The only thing I absolutely hate is one employee in particular who occasionally accosts you when it's super busy. "Hey are you guys almost done? We have some more people waiting." Well guess what, I don't give a fuck, I'm going to sit there as long as I please. This has happened to my party twice and I've seen it happen to a couple other tables as well. Maybe she just doesn't like the looks of us though, I don't know. -1 star for that employee

I hate to oversell this place, but man this was the best bbq restaurant I have ever had. We actually didn't eat at the restaurant because I heard about how crowded it can get, so we ordered out. It seemed to be a great idea because on a Saturday Morning, I saw the line, it reminded me of Disneyland with the twisting lines that gave you an indication of how long it would take from this point. We ordered the beef ribs, pork ribs and chicken - all were amazing. The rub they used for the bbq was so good, that on our way home to LA we bought the rub and the sauce to replicate the flavor. But beyond just the flavor of the meat, they cooked it to perfection. The pork was so soft and tender that it slid off the bone. The beef had just the right amount of char and bbq too give that wonderful smoky taste. And the chicken was tender and juicy all the way through. When we tried cooking with the sauce and rub at home, it was good, probably better than any bbq sauce we tried, but we didn't quite have the skill to cook it in the perfect way that they do.

I really didn't think of submitting a review for Phil's BBQ because this place really does not need reviews.  It is absolutely the best BBQ I have ever had (and I've been to KC and other cities to try the so-called "real" BBQ).  I can't say enough good things about this place,  the food, the small bar they have of local micro brews, the staff and Phil himself.  The wait is sometimes long but worth the wait.  If you are visiting San Diego this is a MUST.

Went on a bad day or something?  That will be the last time I show up there with 10 other Texans just to disappoint them.  No one like it.  I mean, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either.  i ordered beef ribs along with 3 others.  My ribs were really dry and tough.  They really seemed to lack flavor without the sauce. Others had pork ribs, baby backs and other combos. Someone else had a burger and said they liked it.--but that's coming from someone who orders a burger at a BBQ joint.   Everyone nearly finished there meals but those that didn't did not take the leftovers.  I didn't mind standing in line, but now I don't get the hype.  Where have I seen this before?

So my last visit to Phil's I had to order to go. The line was long to sit down as usual. I ordered the Broham which is a pulled barbecue pork sandwich topped with coleslaw  and a baby back rib tickler which consisted of 3 baby back ribs, 2 onion rings and a handful of fries for take out. My Broham was dry, (maybe that's why the cashier asked if I wanted extra bbq sauce on the side) but the ribs on the other hand were delicious. San Diego has a lot of great places to eat.

This is good bbq and I'm from the south so I'm a total snob. The food is great the entrees, the sides, all of it. The portions are very plentiful putting it mildly. It's definitely worth it for the price. My only complaint is the line...as soon as the place opens there's a line around the side of the building that moves at a snail's pace. And there are these little signs are 10 feet or so telling you how much longer your wait is...I feel like I'm waiting to get on a ride at Disneyland. Could you guy's stop being so popular already.

I'm sure I will be crucified but I found myself not raving about Phils BBQ - it  was just okay. Everyone's taste is subjective and for me, their ribs are sugary but extremely spicy. Sauces are good. But the wait time? Its a typical 45min wait to get a seat in. Servers are great and accommodating, they even have some chatting up people in line, as well as ushers already getting tables ready for the parties in queue. The food takes just a wee bit after you order, almost similar to the speed of ordering at a McDonald's (so I'm assuming they are churning out food as fast as they can to eliminate the wait). But when we got our ribs, it went cold fast. Still very tasty and we still finished them all. The first time I ate at Phils it was in December and we were in line for 20-30mins.  It wasn't as busy then so I think I was able to appreciate the food more. But because I recently came from other BBQ places, I was able to compare Phils with another BBQ resto; while the sauces are different and both are delicious, my taste buds were hoping for something a bit less sweet than the ribs at Phils. There is parking a-plenty! but seriously, if you are planning a Phils BBQ outing, come before you get hungry!

The long line is worth the wait! I remember going here before they opened up at this new place. It was this small place that was converted into a restaurant before they moved Phil's to this location. Phil's is always packed and you'll understand why when you try their ribs. I also love the onion rings! A must try great for friends or family dinner.

Seriously one of the best BBQ i've EVER had. The baby back ribs are the best! I've had the beef ribs and it wasn't as tender. Haven't tried the chicken yet so i can't say if that's good. But if it's your first time at Phil's, get the baby back. I normally get the full rack because I don't mind having leftovers for a snack later on or even the next day. Long line!!!! So bring some entertainments. They do phone orders, so you can avoid the line and pick up to go :)

I really like Phils. I have been going for a few years now even before the sports arena location. Although the line has a tendency to be long if you dont mind taking it to go, call ahead. Don't try to cheat and order when standing in line, to go orders are to go only. The macaroni and potato salad arent the best but the BBQ makes up for it. I have to admit they serve the only coleslaw that I eat in a restaurant. The portions are good sized and they have soda on tap never seen in other places.

Came to San Diego for my Spring Break vacay. A friend of mine suggested this place and I was shocked to see over 3,000 yelp reviews! Therefore, I had to come to this place. There is a decent size parking lot. The place is pretty big and you walk in the front and there is a line. When I went the line wasn't too long (so thank god!) You look at the menu and you order first and then you pick up the food.. they give you a buzzer to let you know to pick up your food. There menu is not overly complicated, my bf and I got there full rib dinner ($19.95) with 2 small sides or 1 large sides. We got two small sides which were the cole slaw and macaroni salad. It looked mighty delicious. The ribs were slathered with bbq sauce. It is really really good! The meat falls of the ribs and the sauce is so addicting!~ I was really surprised that there sides were really good too!! I've tried other bbq places, it seems they only focus on the meats instead of there sides and they shouldn't do that. Phil's BBQ knows what's up! I totally recommend this place to everyone that is down in San Diego. It is a must have and must try place!~ I definitely will come back to try there other menu items.

The BEST barbeque restaurant I have ever tried. No one measures,up to Phils. The barbeque sauce is unique and mouth watering. I also recommend trying the onion rings and fries with their house ranch mixed with Phils barbeque sauce. That is delicious! The portions are great, and the price is even greater! At times you have to wait in line, but it is definetly worth it. The lines go by rather quick, and their friendly staff always offers a smile and will talk amongst customers.

I would have expected to be amazed by the food by the number of people that are in line. I don't know how it got so popular. Oh, and parking is really bad because it is so crowded.

When you see a restaurant with a line out the door at 3:30 pm on a Sunday, you know it's gotta be good. Next time we will call in our order and pickup. Fortunately, the line was less than 15 minutes until we were able to order. I got a half chicken (white meat) dinner w/ baked beans and fries and Mike got the BBQ burger. The self serve set up reminds me of Fuddruckers- they even have moist towelettes and disposable bibs-lol! Everything is huge here! Good thing I got my long run in this morning. It seemed like every seat was taken so we ate at the bar. Next time we'll try thje ribs and the pulled ppork sandwich.

This place is very good but I don't think it's best in the world as some people may claim.  The line can be ridiculously long but fortunately I have found a way to avoid all the mess.  What I would do is call 30 minutes ahead and order the food you want.  Once you get to the restaurant, you can bypass the long line and pick up the food and sit yourself anywhere.  The best thing about this place is seeing all the hungry eyes looking at you in envy as you are walking out of the place stuffed with delicious BBQ!

Not enough meat, sad excuse for bbq sauce. (Can you say ketchup?) Service is decent. I gave this place 3 tries and all they came up with was a strike out.

Someone slap me along side of my head. . .I've lived in San Diego county for 12 years and this was my first time going to lunch at Phil's. I am a bit jaded as I have been to Southern barbeques where Bubba has been outback slathering sauce on various meat items for at least six hours. Yes, the meat does fall off while you suck on ungodly sized animal bones. Also, the butcher paper on the picnic tables and loaves of white fluffy bread in the middle create a sorta communal Texas feeding frenzy that is hard to beat. Phil's does a good job at smoking the meat and not having the sauce too sickening sweet. I ordered the pulled pork sammich which had ample meat. . .minus one star for some of the pork strands being a bit dried out. Maybe this meat was on the outside when being prepared? I want all the meat soft and tender, lordy help us if I actually have to chew! For a little tasting test, my dining partner and I ordered the cole slaw, macaroni salad, and potato salad. My favorite I guess would be the slaw. The potato salad is of the red potato variety, the potatoes were cooked just right. The macaroni salad has a bit of a garlic taste which was interesting. The cole slaw had bigger than average pieces of cabbage that was yummy with my pulled pork sandwich (the sandwich is called "The Broham" and was $6.45). I can't be too objective about our side salad tasting as after awhile we got tired of the mayonnaise taste. The corn on the cob looked interesting as the husk is left on. I'll probably get the corn yet time. Yes, I'm already plotting a return trip; Baby back ribs, cole slaw, corn. . .and I'll call it in beforehand so that I can go to the left hand side line! Kudos to; Friendly gal at the front station directing people to order-taking cashiers Sign-up for their email club, while standing in line there's a clip board on the wall. . .maybe I'll get something free from Phil's. Friendly atmosphere, the booths are especially soft and cushy For how long the line was to order, it moves along pretty good and once you order your food comes fast. The big sink behind the beverage bar provides you with a good place to wash your hands as you will slop sauce all over yourself. Cheap pricing; Phil's Ticklers with 2 onion rings (tempura breaded rings that are on the greasy side), a Baby Back Rib Tickler (3 bones) OR a Beef Rib Tickler (1 bone) OR a Chick Tickler (chucks of white meat that has Cajun seasoning) are $6.45 each. Cheap! Phil's does have the best BBQ in San Diego county - Jes go and be the carnivore!

I pondered writing a review since there was already almost 2000 but this review is for my friends to view on my profile and decide if they want to try it from there. And once again my "any restaurant featured on tv" theory is spot on. Of course they are going to give the host of the show the best representation of their food that they possibly can. In my case i got your standard every day Phil's bbq sandwiches. Tried both the pork and beef sandwiches, both were dry even though they were slathered in sauce. Looked nothing like the sandwich on Man Vs Food, not even close. The beans and coleslaw were good and the pork and beef ribs were also delicious and fall off the bone. That is the only thing I would recommend  besides the refreshing cola from the fountain. The staff was nice too so that was a plus and we fed 3 of us for under $40! Great deal for BBQ but i would not wait an hour to eat here again and I don't think I will be going back unless there is no line and it is the only place close by that is not fast food. Nothing will top Joey's BBQ, that is my conclusion and I should just stop looking and just go back to Joey's. Lucille's being a close second.

I've been here for the second time and it's some good food.  I had the El Toro sandwich and the thing is huge.  Portion sizes are unbelievable.  I shared a "small" fry order with a friend and it was ginormous!  Great food for the price and portion by far.. Next time I may order the bbq sauce on the side though for my sandwich.. You will leave FULL!!  Helpful tip: Get there a little before 11 because it fills up fast for lunch...

okay, Phil's bbq was GOOOOD....it was our first time eating here and so we didnt know what to get.  my bf and i decided to get both the bbq baby back pork ribs and 3 beef ribs... (3 beef ribs sounds like just a tastebud teaser, but let me tell you...they were large ribs..thats a decent meal on its own...)  anyways... so my bf passes me a beef rib, but we had to basically catch the meat bc it was falling off the bone...yes...we had to literally catch it from falling on the table... i like the very casualness of the place where you go up order, and go back and pick up your order..it really saves you $$ on tips....  i only gave it 4 stars bc i tend to like my bbq sauce spicy.. im  a bit particular...but other than that..it was GREAT....they have other things on the menu like pulled bbq sandwiches...those look good too for people who dont want to get down and dirty (dont worry they have bibs)...but i like my meat off the bone...i did see that they do have a veggie burger to appeal to those vegetarians out there...but....yea...i dont know who would go there..and smell all the other great food and see everyone chowing down and then ask for a veggie burger.  My bf wants to move to SD for Phils... to people who think you shouldnt eat bbq ribs on the first date...pish posh...just get it over with....this place is great for large groups, or just a pair...i definately recommend... **EDIT 4/22/2009** soo...i came back and the ribs had a bit more kick... maybe i got a good side with ample dry rub spices massaged into the meat.... my meat was peppery, tangy, sweet, oh so tender and smokey.... We went for my birthday and they were able to get seated and get our food rather quickly even tho we were a party of 9.  Despite the massive line, they are quite efficient in getting you seated..... even tho it was MY birthday...i picked this place for the BF....but i still loved it anyways... YUMMMMssss *** EDIT 8/8/2012*** YELP, give me the option to give them MORE stars!!!  since i was last there, i have been on a massive bbq hunt.  small hole in the walls, popular picks from others... nothing has left me has satisfied as Phil's.  their beef rib cannot be touched.  so meaty and tender and delicous.  i've tried the oh so popular Dr. Hogly Wogly's in the valley. PLEASE, give me  McRib anyday!!!!   oh and also, the BF is now my husband and i do think we fell in love at Phil's.  Phil's broke the ice for us when i had to unbutton the top button of my pants on that date i mentioned above in my first review.

OK, I have to confess that I'd visited the old location and left with a mediocre impression.  I'd been invited to meet some friends a few weeks ago and they shared their huge order of ribs and onion rings with me.  It was delicious and the staff was very pleasant and accommodating.   I guess I've got to take the huz and get his opinion now.  Methinks he'll approve!

I'm gonna preface this by saying that I am assuming that you like BBQ. So for all the haters out there that don't like BBQ and then do nothing but complain about Phil's, keep it to yourself. If on the other hand, you appreciate the work that goes into the ambrosia known as BBQ, you'll understand where I'm coming from. I shouldn't have to say anything since the line around the building almost every business day silences most critics. Once you round the corner and get inside, you'll see why this place might as well have its own mint. To your left is a bar with about 20 flat screens playing all the days games, ahead of you is a line to your left for phone ahead carry out orders and to the right the rest of the line for dine-in, and to your right is a sea of more flat screens over tables with families and friends gorging themselves. Covering all the classic park/backyard BBQ food, Phil's BBQ is the best home style ribs and food that I have come across in SD. Possibly ever. I can't explain properly how tender the Baby Back Ribs are and how additively sweet and spicy the BBQ sauce is. With the perfect amount of char on the ribs and a generous dosing of the sauce on every plate, you end up gorging yourself rather than taking anything home. If you laugh at the idea of having paper towels at your table, you'll quickly change your mind when you are covered head to toe in sauce. I love the trough sink by the exit you can use to shower off when your done. The Baked Beans and French Fries sides are a perfect match for the ribs. The beans are the sweet and savory and are great for dipping the fries in. You won't go wrong with the Onion Rings or the Corn on the Cob either. They have the only rings I've ever had that don't pull out of the ring when you take the first bite. The Potato Salad has large chunks of potato if you like that kind and the Macaroni Salad is some of the better that I've had. The Chicken is largely very good and juicy, but occasionally comes out dry. Bonus points for having a order out line that you can call ahead for. On the bad side are problems which are largely out of their control and problems which most businesses would kill for. Even in a recessionary economy the place manages to have a line around the building and no tables available for sitting every time I show up with a pretty pricey luxury product. I'm sure that once this economy picks up they will open up another location and it will be the same way. You are also going to put back enough food for about 2 days in one meal and you might fall asleep at the wheel on the way home when that itis hits ya. Bottom line, Phil's BBQ wins. Period.

I rarely give out 5 stars but Phil's deserves it!! The black hostess that works in the front is so funny and easy to talk to! The service is quick and the food is scrumptious. Mm Mm MMmmmm!! The ribs are finger-licking good. They seriously fall right off the bone!! Get the Baby Back Ribs because the Beef Ribs can be tough sometimes. You might have to wait in line to order but trust me, it's worth it. Best BBQ I've ever had. Hands down.

So I might be in the minority when I say this, but this is better bbq than we've had all over Texas.  We've traveled to Memphis, several places  in TX, SC and KC to find good bbq, only to be disappointed, and little did we know, it's right down the street from us!  I wish we discovered this place sooner!!

Love their baby back ribs!    If only they would get sweet potato fries...  it's my only big "complaint" with the place - it seems like many of the newer bbq places have them...  but then with lines already going out the door, I guess they see no reason for change?   My suggestion - get those dang sweet potato fries on the menu, and open up a 2nd Phil's (next door, down the street, across the street - somewhere!) to handle the resultant surge in demand!   I'd be coming much more often, and think many others would too..

Best BBQ in San Diego. Phil's is great. I used to go to the location in Mission Hills, I'm glad they moved to the new location. So much more room, not as long of a wait. I really like that they have a separate bar area, the draft beer is really good and cold. The food is excellent, I always get the Broham sandwich, pulled pork and coleslaw, I didn't think I would like the combination, but it is so good. All the sides and ribs are great too. The baked beans and potato salad go great with your sandwich. One thing I would say to avoid is the Chick-less, I was very disappointed in this item, I think it was chicken strips, but I remember them being bad, I ordered them years ago on my first visit and haven't since, so I don't remember exactly what it was. Another thing is that the food is grilled, not smoked, I don't care, the food is great, but a BBQ aficionado will say it's not the real deal. I wish I lived closer, I would be a regular.

We had Phil's BBQ cater our wedding, it was a HUGE hit!  The catering was done very well and we were extrememly impressed with the servers, the set-up, the take down, and they gave us all the left overs!  We had them bring the smokers and had them cook onsight, again a huge hit!  Very professional caterers.  We had gone to the restaurant before hiring them, and that too was delicious.  I think we hit right as the line was not even out the door!  I've heard that is very rare.

The crowd is awful. They either need another location or need a better method for getting people in and out of the restaurant. The food was mediocre.

The BBQ is some of the best I have eaten on the West Coast, still doesn't stack up to the places I have gone to in Kansas City, KS and Charleston, SC though but it is good.  I have eaten lunch at this location a few times and have found the portions to be very large and the quality to be good.  Customer service is excellent.  The wait time is long but worth it.  If you really want to beat the wait though, just get it to go and you are in and out in about 15 minutes tops.

Went to phil's last week with my wife and 90 year old mother.  Decided to go into the bar and order there rather than wait in the long line outside.  All I can say is Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic!.  Ribs were tender, juicy with a great sauce and very cheap.  We ordered beer as well and liked the extensive variety to choose from.  I would go back anytime but would always make sure I order in the bar instead of waiting in line.

When you go to a place where the line sticks out from the front door, that's a very good sign. The line moves pretty fast. The order and receival time was about 10 minutes tops.

The people here are really nice and the food was slathered in this gooey, vinegary, BBQ-y sauce and it was oh-so-mouthwatering!

The chunks were HUGE and juicy and the sauce was tangy and delicious. We ordered a side of the colossal onion rings which they are not lying about when they say they are colossal and DELICIOUS.

So im not exactly what it is about this place but it never disappoints. Well maybe it does on one point and that's why its missing the 5th star. The dine in line is always NUTS! It never fails, always out the door with a approx. wait time of 30 min. That's not including the wait time for the food. I always order takeout. The have my food in no BS like 5 minutes. While I wait I am always greeted by someone and offered some water while I wait. The staff has always bee en courteous. If you order one of the Sandwiches beware there is tons of meat in there. You can literally make two sandwiches with all that meat. Keep up the good work!!

I have always been a BBQ lover and my first experience of Phil's BBQ in San Diego was nothing short of AMAZING!  When I first tasted those baby backs it was almost unbelievable how perfect it was. They were out of this world tender and tasty. My first ever order, and continued standard, is a half rack of baby backs with macaroni salad and beans, although I have tried several other menu items as well. The Phil's BBQ sauce and Phil's rub both provide the perfect combination of sweetness and spice. I'm not sure what form of cooking they use but the ribs nearly melt in your mouth. The restaurant is near sports arena in San Diego and its ALWAYS busy, but worth the wait. At phils you stand in line until you get up front to order but once you order the food is ready very quickly. The place has a great atmosphere with a good bar and tons of nice flat screens throughout the restaurant and bar.  The line can, and will be long but moves fairly quickly. The food is comes in the perfect size portions and you will not leave Phil's hungry. Also the price is very reasonable.  I strongly encourage you try the baby backs but the rest of their food is great too. The onion rings, fries, and chicken are also excellent.  I have never found a resultant that is this great ALL the time; the consistency is key in food and they sure know what they're doing at Phil's! Hope you can make it to Phil's if you love BBQ and are near San Diego!

My visit to San Diego included dinner at Phil's BBQ. This is a small place with a line out the door. I'm not a big BBQ fan, but the pork ribs were finger-licking good, along with the coleslaw. Nothing fancy here, just straight up, good BBQ. I'd definitely recommend Phil's.

Phil's is good BBQ. I miss the Goldfinch location. For some reason, I thought the food tasted better there. The new location on Sports Arena feels a little like a cafeteria. If there is a really long wait, the hubby and I will usually go somewhere else. Bonus tip: If you eat there later (after 9:30), there is not as long as a wait, and if you sit on the patio in the summer, you can catch the Seaworld fireworks at 9:50.

The service is fast and friendly!! I don' t even know how many times my boyfriend and I were greeted. Even the customers standing in line with us were really friendly and happy to be there. Everyone had a huge smile on their face. Got to our table and in less than 5 minutes our little buzzer went off to get our food. Ordered the Baby Back Ribs and Chickless with a side of baked beans and cole slaw. The cole slaw was a little toooo peppery for my liking. I really wanted to like it because some people in line were raving about it. The baked beans were good. But my favorite on my plate was Baby Back Ribs!! The meat just fell off the bone! sooo good! The chicken/less was ok but i think i wasn't into it because I was infatuated with the ribs hahaha I guess everytime I visit San Diego, I have to visit Phil's .. I have no problem with that. I knew we made a good decision on dinner because people were talking about it at Seaworld the next day.

Phil's is the best bbq in San Diego, but that is not saying much. Come on guys grilled bbq? Where is the slow roasting "bbq pit"? To be able to cook "good" ribs it takes time and patience, not a 20 minute sear on the grill. If you have never had "pit" bbq then you probably do not know the difference, so keep giving the 4 & 5 stars. I want to "keep it real" and this is not "real" bbq. Just my 4 cents...........

this is by far the best bbq in san diego. i grew up in north carolina, and i thought i would never find southern style bbq till i found out about this place. there is ALWAYS a wait, rain or shine. 20 mins at the least, its that great.... i once asked this hostess "what is the great here?" and she responded " Everything, everytime you come here, order something else...it is all equally tasteful" and it really is , ive had most of the items on the menu. my top 3 choices are the: beefy rib dinner with Large frie and (creole seasoning salt) baby back rib dinner with potato salad and small frie(with creole seasoning salt) and of course the BBQ chicken is always flavorful. the onion rings are fabulous. i have converted people who HATE and will not eat onions, to love these onion rings. they have a great selection of coke products and liquor. its a first come first serve seating unless you have a large party(6+) then they will try to save you some seats. other then that, i have went there 3 times this week and a total of 7 times in a months time. thats GREAT. i highly recommend it. nothing but the greatest bbq in san diego. oh ps...dont listen to the sign by the entrance .

We came here on Memorial Day.  Luckily they were open because they normally are closed on Mondays.  We got here before the rush, our wait was only about five minutes.  They have signs in line letting you know how long the waits are, just like an amusement park.  And they also have a webcam so you can see how busy they are before you get there.  Ingenious!  We ordered the baby back ribs, the chicken, and beef ribs.  Oh Man! I can't say enough about this place.  The meat falls right off the bone, the BBQ sauce is just perfect.  It was a great experience!  Wish they had one in Seattle!

After lots of my friends saying "how amazing" this place is, it really didn't live up to my expectations. It's fine BBQ, but it's no true Memphis BBQ. Additionally, seating is a pain in the butt. When I have a choice of restaurants, I opt for others.

THE place for ribs.  Verrrry generous portions.  Great sides.  It's true that you can always tell how good a place is by how busy it is.  Phil's is almost always packed.  Which is why I prefer to phone in my order for pick-up.  Super-fast service that way.

Thanks for great friends with great recommendations and Adam Richman, for spotlighting such a gem. I thought I had good bbq until I came to Phil's. Good pulled pork sandwiches and bbq chicken. Even the sides are stand-alone good. Still haven't tried the ribs yet. Long lines are expected at a place like this but the staff is so over the top accommodating that it eases the pain of waiting.

This is by far, the best BBQ I've had, so far. Given, I've only been to 6 or 7 BBQ joints. But, once you've had Phil's, you won't want to have anything else. I've tried almost everything on the menu and all of it's good. If you go there, go for the Ribs and Chicken dinner. Go with a few people and add a large order of Onion Rings to share! Wow, my mouth is salivating already! =) The only downsides are that it can be hard to find parking and also that the line is usually pretty long (which is a sign of some good food!). Do yourself a favor and call in your food before you go. It's "a little" faster and you can get a general idea of how busy it is at that time.

Definitely stick to the baby back ribs. French fries were really good. The chicken was really tender and juicy. Long line as everyone notes. Went at 4:30pm and still waited at least 45 minutes.

Nothing quite hits the spot as Phil's does at times. I usually get a 3 beef rib dinner with a side of baked beans and potato salad. I eat one rib and I am done for the night and have leftovers for tomorrow. I personally like the beef ribs for their flavor but my hubby prefers the baby pork ribs. Either way, the meat is really tender and soft and saturated in sauce. The onion rings have a really yummy batter compared to most places. It is a different kind of bbq then what you would find in Texas, not the smokiest but definitely sweet and tangy. I usually call in my order, then start driving to the restaurant. When I get there, I wait for my order to be packaged and I am out the door. I bypass the entire line and I can eat messily in the comfort of my own home. The only times we ever eat in is when we are in the mood for a cold draft beer. Costco sells the bottled Phil's BBQ Sauce, but I swear it doesn't taste the same even after being baked. Any visitors to SD should make a trip to this restaurant just to try out the ribs. There isn't any other place in other cities I can think of to compare.

Love this place. I've been here 3 times and 3 times they've impressed. The ribs are delicious! The meat just falls off the bone, the bbq sauce is tasty and doesn't overpower the taste of the meat. The cole slaw was delicious too. But what I was most impressed about was the service. Our waiter was a guy named Corey and he was awesome! Super attentive, accommodating, and truly made our experience great. My girlfriend and I were seated by the door and she was getting cold because of the wind. We saw a seat open up and as we were about to switch tables, Corey notices it and comes right over and helps us move. He was more than happy to take pictures for us. 5 stars for this man. I definitely recommend Phil's. Yes, the line is long, but that just shows you how good the place is. The place is big, so it's not like the line is long because the place is small.

With over 1700 reviews and an average of 4.5+ stars, I was completely baffled by the fact that I didn't love this place.  I thought it was just okay...but definitely not worth waiting for a table.  My major problem was that I just didn't like their barbecue sauce (I ordered the pork sandwich).  I have another trip planned to SD next year, so maybe I'll go back and grab a take out order of chicken and see if I can upgrade my review.

Absolutely the best BBQ in San Diego.  It's no TX BBQ though.  I'm harsh when it comes to that.  In a previous review I said I was goin through BBQ withdrawls, well this is where I go to curb that.  My BBQ Methadone.  I would've given 4 stars but the experience was not cool.  I had dinner with friends there and towards the end of the meal we had buss boys  hovering over us asking whether we were done or not.   It was a busy night.  We still had food on our plates.   We didn't feel to welcome so we left.  As soon as we got up we had two families jump in our seats at the same time.  They had to duke it out for the table.  That was my only problem.  The new location is bigger than the Hillcrest one and I think they are going to reopen that, if it isn't already.  They added a bar, so that's a plus.  Just expect a crowd for the lunch and dinner hours.

HOLY MACARONI (yes! they do have macaroni salad too!) I just did a double-take on number of reviews this place got.   Before I get into the REAL review... There's no waiter service. You go in, order your food, and perch on the sidelines being vultures awaiting tables to open up.  The lines are long but it goes by pretty fast. If you're coming with a party, come during a time when its NOT busy, which is like... never. jk. Call ahead or something.This place is totally worth it. I promise you the moon that it is. Okay, to the more substantial review: Hands down the best BBQ spot my mouth has experienced in San Deezy.  I ALWAYS split the "Best of Both- Beefy Ribs and Chicken" with my mate; it's about $12 and the portions are quite big.  I don't get the "chick-less" (chicken minus the bone) anymore because I find that it just doesn't taste the same as the most awesomely awesome chicken with the bone. Onion rings are awesome. They're ceasar salad is awesome (i'm just saying that because all ceasar salads are awesome to me). Their bar is awesome. The line wrapping around the building is not too awesome. However, the "Official Twitter Area" outside is too awesome. The creole spice on the table is awesome (Sorry Phils, everytime I leave, you guys are one seasoning container short). The beefy rib the size of my head is awesome.  The bibs are awesome (although, BBQ somehow happens to find its way towards some part of my clothing).  My sticky BBQ-ey hands are ESPECIALLY awesome. Had enough of "awesome"? Nope. You haven't until you've eaten here!!

What place has the best ribs? There is no doubt that Phil's BBQ ranks the top on my list. I was referred to this place by friends and no doubt their ribs are unlike any other place I've been to. Be advised that the portions are pretty much huge. I ordered the Beefy Rib Dinner (3-rack) and later that week I ordered the (5-rack) because of the amazing serenade of the meat the first time around. I was certainly not disappointed. The potato salad won't be like the ones you order at the store, they use potatoes cut into wedges. The fries are to die for. The onion rings were the best, I didn't know the smallest order of the onion rings would be so huge on the plate! The line for Phil's BBQ can be long so it is advised to get there at least before 5pm. My friends and I arrived before 5pm and we were able to order and get seated particularly fast. Normally the wait is very long with lines going all the way around the store. This is no surprise because of their famous BBQ ribs. Verdict: Next time I make a pit stop in San Diego I will be back here again! They basically take all major credit cards including Discover (which I find rare)

Ask almost anyone you know where to get good BBQ and they will no doubt point you to Phil's BBQ. I've eaten here numerous times and it's average compared to other BBQ I've had across the country. The wait isn't worth it, nor is the price. There is better BBQ to be had in San Diego but it does make a decent lunch if you're in the area. I find the onion rings to be over-cooked and they charge you extra for ranch to dip them in. Your typical wait from getting in line to eating your food runs about 30-45 minutes. Lunch for two will cost no less than $20 so be prepared - it isn't cheap by any stretch of the imagination but then again, BBQ isn't cheap in San Diego.

Dude. I wanted to find something about this place that would warrant docking them a star, but there was really nothing I could find to complain about. The place was clean, the customer service is fast and polite, and the food is fucking great. I tasted the ribs, the chicken, the coleslaw, the onion rings, the fries, and the baked beans--and they were all fucking delicious. I want to add that, while this may not be "real" barbecue (who fucking cares?) it's still scrumptious. The haters need to go find something to do. This will be a mandatory stop from now on in my future travels to San Diego.

I was super excited to try this place out.  Several people had recommended it to me and I guess I had very high expectations.  I am from 'BBQ' country so I am not really the best person to be open minded about BBQ.  I stood in line for about 10 minutes to order and then found a seat outside, which was nice until everyone started taking other people's tables while they went to get their food.  I ordered the full baby back rib meal that came with a heap of fries and backed beans.  The ribs were truly 'baby' backs.  I cannot say that I have ever seen such tiny baby back ribs before.  The rub on the ribs was nice and the sauce was a bit spicy for my liking as I am more of a sweet sauce guy.  I have to say that the staff was VERY helpful and friendly.  I guess that I shouldn't have listened to all the hype.  I will say that San Diego is not really the BBQ capitol of the world so Phil's is a very good place to eat BBQ.  Overall, I did enjoy my food and dining experience, but still do not think it can live up to all the hype.

The food is always consistent and very tasty. The customer service is very good and always accommodating. We don't mind the price cause you get a lot for the money.

I was never big on ribs.  But this place got me hooked.  Sadly we live in Phoenix, but we find excuses to get and go whenever we can.  It's worth the drive (I mean c'mon, It's San Diego, right?), and worth the wait.  The people are friendly and helpful, and the food is big and meaty.  You are guaranteed NOT to go home hungry.  Try it if you haven't already.

The food is great, the service is great. The hostess is such a sweetheart. I love the pulled pork sammich. Plus they have crystal light. F yeah, that stuff is too expensive to buy for home, so when I go there I indulge. Their onion rings are to die for. You have to try those if you go. They're huge so a small order of them is enough for 2 people. Great prices too. Very affordable. If you love your woman and she's not afraid to eat real food, bring her here.

Everything here is soo good! The pork ribs fall off the bone, the beef ribs are nice and rich, the chicken is smoky, the beans are sweet, the coleslaw is cooling and is a great balance to the bbq, the fries are absouletly amazing, the onion rings are to die for, and the bbq sauce is tangy, smoky, sweet, and spicy. Best of both is a great choice if you're not sure what to order. Expect a line and a waiit of at least 30 minutes but its worth it. If you're in a rush, call in and order to go.

phil's is probably the most successful restaurant in san diego. a second location recently opened in san marcos. i usually bring my out of town guests here. one time we decided to estimate how many lbs of ribs get served each day. we figured about 4500 dine-in customers during busy days and 800 takeout. that's a lot of freakin meat, and money. i usually order the baby back ribs. i recommend getting fries and mac salad for the sides. sometimes the ribs are too saucy. i also found the chicken to be really dry. don't get the burger.

For the hype, length of wait and amount you pay for what you get, they're okay and would probably get three or three and a half stars.  I'll go for some bbq with friends b/c they want meat slathered in bbq sauce, large, oily onion rings and what not, but I would never come here on my own or for a "date" or highly recommend this place to anyone. The first time I came here, I probably waited about an hour and a half to order and only got a fountain drink and ribs.  The ribs are pretty good and decently sized, but nothing spectacular nor worth the hype or wait that I had to endure - maybe my expectations were too high for waiting as long as I did.  Maybe if there was no wait, I'd come here for their saucy ribs.  They also have sandwiches. I've only tried the pulled pork "broham" which is pretty good but a bit too saucy (too much sauce but not enough flavor with the meat which I felt the sauce was used to compensate) for me.   Given that I've only been here two to three times and only tried their ribs, cole slaw, onion rings and pulled pork sandwich (which are supposedly their best/most popular items), I may be willing to go back to try something else if I have friends that really, really want to try it out and I don't have to wait in line. Portion size is decent, though I was a tad disappointed with the ribs.  The place is nice and clean, set-up is great (serves the needs and purposes of a busy bbq restaurant) service is good and the staff is friendly - when I went to meet up with friends but was not able to make it before they ordered, my friends told the cashier and I was able to go straight to the cashier so I could order and receive my food not too long after my friends ordered. If you ask me, I'd say with the service and restaurant as a whole deserves four stars, but for the wait and food alone, probably just three to three and a half.

I think its sort of cheating that there's a sign that tells customers to contact the the "bbqrew" before you start yelping.  We went with 5 people. We hot there at 12 on Saturday, just in time before it hot busy. We stood in line for about 10 minutes. Then went to order our food and searched for our own table. We Ordered 2 full baby back ribs, and 2 big beef ribs and one-fourth chicken. Sides we got baked beans, potato salad, macaroni salad,cole slaw, corn on the cob, and large onion rings. Baby backs were delicious. Fall off the bone, melts in your mouth. Bbq sauce is good not sweet more of a tIangy sauce they put. Beef rib was huge and delicious. Chicken was ok was a little too dry.  The sides weren't impressive. Macaroni salad is well....macaroni salad.. baked beans kind of watery, potato salad had crisp red potato chunks, Cole slaw tasted like shredded cabbage not much flavor. Onion rings were awesome, nice batter and big juicy rings. Best I've ever had.. I give this place a 4 because didn't like having yo find our own seats.. we found a table and they told us we couldn't sit at the booth because it was for parties of 6 so we found a table outside. And sides weren't great.But if judging strictly on bbq it would be a 5.

I always thought the point of good bbq was to so slowly roast meat that it would be soft and tender to the touch. Good bbq falls clean off the bone and doesn't need to be massacred in sauce. Phil's is not quite there. Got there at about 5pm on a Tuesday and ordered their baby back rib and chickless dinner with steamed veggies. My order was done in 5 minutes, and it was just ok. The ribs were tender, but they were absolutely drenched in what tasted like a ketchup-based bbq sauce. The chicken was overdone and dry. At least the ribs had decent burnt ends, but that's about all I can commend about the place. I don't understand the hype.

I found this place through Yelp.   Once I got to the place, I read about the line but I was surprised to see the line wrapped around the store!   I looked to my DH and asked, "Do you want to wait?  We are well behind the "30 min" line."  We both HATE waiting.  Then I remembered the bar.  Both of us left the long line then headed to the bar.  THANK GOODNESS!!!   Once we got there, although it was very crowed, two people were waiting on their check to arrive and glad to give their seats for us.   We ordered, pulled pork sandwich, half rack baby back ribs in dinner with baked potato, small sides of baked beans and fries for two of us who were hungry... We enjoyed our meal and wished we could come here more often.  We have Lucille's BBQ but not Phil's... Good luck with their parking lot... I didn't get to see their parking space since I jumped out of the car to join the line as soon as we got there.  Once we got to the car, I couldn't believe how we were going to get out of the parking spot!  Thank goodness we had parking assistant to tell guide us how close we were to the other parked cars.  I saw many people assisting others with backing out of their space.

The world famous Phil's. Shared a full rack of baby back ribs, coleslaw, baked beans and onion rings with my boyfriend. The quality of the meat is the best I've ever had, but the sauce wasn't sweet enough for me. Maybe it's vinegar based or something, but just not my favorite choice in sauce. Baked beans were eh, skip them and get the fries instead. Coleslaw was so good! But the onions rings we SO GOOD...best onions rings I've ever had! Super crunchy batter and HUGE, a must get when you come here. The wait was about 45 minutes on a Saturday night and having to actually wait in line was a bit funny, but it's all part of the experience I suppose.

i love phil's. things first time diners need to know: 1. it's crowded by 11:30am. 2. don't worry about the wait, the food is ready fast. 3. onion rings are crispy and delicious.  the table will be happy if you ordered some for everyone. 4.  bbq sauce is delicious. 5.  if you are shy about wearing a bib, wear a brown shirt you don't care about. 6.  eating here may cause the meat-sweats.  or at least a food-induced coma.

I've actually never been to this specific Phil's BBQ, I always went to the one in Mission Hills area. I love the babyback ribs here. It's very informal, self serve type place. And I like that about this place...roll of paper towels on the table and your good to go. The only downside is that it looked like the prices were increasing...which sort of got pricey...but still decent for BBQ.

Who in their right minds doesn't love Phil's?  I think it's one of the best BBQ places in the country.  Their food is amazing, and there's hardly more to say.  Yes, the line is long, and it's completely worth the wait!

I never enjoyed bbq because the ribs would hit my chubby cheeks and get my face all greasy, but recently discovered shorter, more flavorful pork baby back ribs and the myriad and challenging tricks to make them tasty (boil with garlic).  So I don't have many places to which to compare Phil's, but as a meal goes, it was outstanding... First off, we stumbled upon it while we were waiting for alterations on suits from Men's Fashion Depot (an actual word-of-mouth recommendation), and I were delighted that we would get to try this "famous" bbq instead of going to Burger King (Hostage Gastronome's fall-back eating establishment).  The line was out the door, but the ordering set up and seating was the most effiecient I've ever seen - the hostesses were right on top of the vacating tables, but didn't pressure anyone out.  There were heaters outside, but we chose to sit inside and soak up the minimal ambiance.  I really wanted to see some fatties pigging out on slabs of ribs, but it was a family crowd (Sat. lunch), and no one seemed over-eager (like me on the inside at a good looking buffet).  The memory of the pungent vinegar bbq sauce smell is making my mouth water right now, but the sauce was a little on the too sweet side.  I tried the pork sandwich, ribs, chickless chicken chunks, and the breast - all great.  The breast wasn't dry, but the boneless chunks are the way to go.  I was expecting the sides to be mayo-laden 5 gallon drum type slop, but the cole slaw was perfect....wish I had ordered some potato salad too.  The beans were good and fries fine, but the most "5-ish" thing about Phil's is the onion rings.  The crunchy batter adhered to the huge ring, and the taste was sweet and savory. This beats Sonny Bryan's in Dallas, and was probably cheaper.  Definitely a bbq stand-out; I'm just not giving it a 5 star rating because it didn't have me plotting to somehow get back there for more.

hot damn. i had no idea what this place was all about til i got here. i pull up in the parking lot and its a huge line (it was a sunday, no wonder) the wait was about 30-40 minutes, which wasnt too bad since it wasn't cold that night. the way they do it is almost like a fast food resturant where you park, wait in line, order, and your order is up, then you sit and eat. except, they're more organized here about where you sit, especially if you're a large group of 8+ i believe. the service here is really good. the servers and cashiers are really nice. if you want a suggestion on what to get or you cant decide, they give your their honest opinions. RIBS - DELICIOUS. whether its the baby back ribs or the beefy, damn its good. i've never had ribs THAT good before, no joke. the sides, they're not bad, i'd comment more if i could but i was busy eating my ribs. CHICKEN - ehh. it was decent. if you eat this last, it'll be dry cuz the breast soaks up all the juices. i can't wait to come here again next time i'm down in San Diego. the perfect day would be going to P.Beach and then straight here!

The pork ribs were really awesome as was the house bbq sauce.  I can't believe how large the portions are here!  I have a big appetite and could not finish a half order of the ribs.  Great atmosphere inside in restaurant.  It is easy to see why this is such a cult hit.

I went to college in SD and discovered Phils many years ago. I've tried their chick tickler but what I really love is the ribs!  They are so flavorful, juicy and tender that it literally falls off the bone. The sauce is awesome and the choice of sides are to die for. I have since moved away from SD and whenever I visit, it is a must go to stop for me!

There aren't very many well known bbq joints in southern California, but when I am craving some good bbq I think of Phil's! The line may look long and will even go around the corner, but it actually goes by pretty fast. Huge portions that I usually take home for another meal or two. The baby back ribs here are awesome, and the beef ribs are HUGE! In my opinion, the beef ribs had too much fat on them so I prefer the baby backs. You have to get a side of onion rings--AMAZING! Especially when they're still piping hot and makes that "Crunch!" sound when you bite into it. I have yet to try the tri-tip that was featured on the Food Network but I will get that next time!

incredible! mmm. the line was wrapping around the building when we arrived, but it moved fairly quickly. i got the tickler... fries (extra, since i subbed the coleslaw for more fries), 2 onion rings, ribs... and it was just enough food for me!! i also ordered extra onion rings for my boyfriend and i like that they give you little pre-poured containers of ranch if you ask. i love onion rings and ranch. and fries and ranch!! MMMM. i can't remember what my bf got, but it had the boneless chicken, ribs, potato salad and macaroni salad. his food was good too. i love that the potato salad is made with big big chunks of potatoes. yum. and the sauce on the ribs is really good!!! what i really loved about this place is the workers. they are sooo friendly. the lady who spoke to us before we ordered explained what we do to find a seat and was constantly joking with us. she seemed like she was in such a good mood, and it was nice to see people working and actually happy. the lady who helped me at the register was named heidi i believe. she was SO KIND. my boyfriend happened to brush my arm to get my attention because i was ordering while he was finding a seat for our group, and she goes, "oh. he loves you. he really loves you". LOL wtf. i was like, "why do you say that?". and she said she could tell because he brushed my arm lightly, which is a huge sign of affection and care. i was like....you must be a communications major... and she said yes. HAHA. we had this long ass conversation before i even ordered. she was just super super easy to talk to and she was the one who suggested i sub the coleslaw for fries. i love when employees are helpful and give suggestions. it shows that they actually care and enjoy their job, and want to give the customer the best experience ever. more pros: -hand washing stations -clean bathroom -little hand wiping packet things to clean your hands with. i took some home hahah. they came in handy the next day when i ate mexican food seriously top notch restaurant. i'll be back for sure the next time i come down to sd!!

Sorry, I don't really understand the hype. The BBQ tasted good but it wasn't the most amazing BBQ I've ever had like everyone made it out to be. The ribs were pretty good and tender but the rest of the meal was mediocre.  To me, Lucille's Smokehouse in the LA area is wayyyy better than this.

Recommend the Pulled Pork Sandwich with a side of baked beans... I have never been so full in my life. Food coma occurred 3 seconds after my attempt to get 1/2 way through the sandwich. It is a wait to get in, but truly worth the wait. They have this little cart outside of the building that has water while you wait. Real rustic feel, tables indoors and outdoors that go around the perimeter of the restaurant. Good experience, and large amounts of food, always make my friends and I happy. and the rub/marinade/whatever it is that made the sandwich good is going to haunt me til another taste of it.

Phil's BBQ has enough solid ratings so I'll be brief. Both BBQ chicken and beef are really good. Fries and cole slaw could use some work. It's a great time to go after visiting the zoo or seaworld or out with the family.

We live in Tierrasanta and used to drive over to Phil's in  Mission Hills for take out. And later to his Sports Arena store.  That's about an hour and a half drive time. And well worth the time and gasoline. It was simply the best BBQ I had ever tasted Over time, and after the move to Sports Arena, his food went from fantastic to ordinary then got steadily worse. The chicken developed that warmed over flavor from being refrigerated.  The pork ribs were dry and trasteless. I would think he would notice when the lines grew shorter that something was going wrong.The slaw and fries were still great.   The sauce was still excellent. I will try Phil's in a few month's to see if they have improved. PS Stay away from "Joe's" in Santee. Almost $10.00 for a dry, cold , tough and flavorless pulled pork sandwich.  No drink or fries, just a small container of milky coleslaw.  Warmed over flavor. I understand that they may be under new ownership. Not going back.

I have yet to find a better BBQ place in either San Diego or San Francisco.  I've tried a few things on their menu, but all you really need to go there for is the ribs.  Juicy, tender, and full of flavor.  What more could you ask for?  Everytime I visit friends/family in San Diego, I make sure that Phil's is somewhere on the itinerary!  A meal will usually cost ~$10 unless you can really eat.

i first had phil's before the point loma location opened. it was amazing. but the line was ridiculous and the wait was long. BUT!!!!!! NOW....... this location has triple the seating capacity of the hillcrest location and 10x the efficiency. there is usually a line stretching out the door, but it moves quickly and you receive your meal within 10 minutes  or so of putting in your order. you seat yourself. the ribs..... OH... the ribs. i have dreams and day time fantasies about these ribs. unlike chili's or other casual dining sit downs, these ribs are VERY meaty, and VERY tender. they fall off the bone and melt on your tongue. the sauce is tangy and sweet but not overwhelming. if ripping meat carcass off a bone doesn't sound appetizing to you....the boneless chicken is also smothered in this sauce and just as delicious. they also have a few sandwiches to choose from, one of which has pulled bbq pork with coleslaw (IN THE SANDWICH) on a delicious soft bun.... for only $7? the fries are to die for, especially if you sprinkle some of the cajun seasoning (available on the table) and dip it in your left over bbq sauce from your entree. have i gushed enough?? are you convinced? stop reading and go eat phil's.

OMG I wish I could give this place a million stars! Best place EVER everything on the menu is so delicious and not expensive.  The workers are ALWAYS super friendly, which makes u feel better about waiting.  They hand out otter pops on hot days and quiz you with phils bbq trivia, super fun.  Yea the wait is long but who cares? Thats part of the experience and I've always had fun waiting.  They do have a cart outside for people waiting that gives water and sells beer.  Everytime my family comes into town we go.  Everytime I get any visitors I take them to phils.  Awesome environment, great affordable food.  If you want a nice delicate place to eat at where the mood is slow and relax, forget it, that's not what phils is about.  Besides the food, its fun at phils because of the craziness.  They don't fuck around, they want to give you you'r food as soon as possible (which is why they might seem like they rush you-for the person on yelp who complained about this).  And I'm not complaining I want my food fast too. There are really no words to really capture the magic of phils, you just have to try it!

found this place on yelp and told my native sd friend that i was coming here and he was jealous and told me that it was worth the wait. so i had some high expectations upon coming here. it took us over an hour to get through. thank you phil's for putting benches outside to sit on otherwise i would've been grumpy! the setup at phil's is a bit different. once you're inside, you order and pay for your food first and get a beeper. you then find a place to sit (luckily we only had 4 total and were able to find a place to sit rather quickly). when the beeper goes off, you pick up your food and proceed to chow down. we ordered the beef ribs, baby back ribs, onion rings, and potato salad. the beef ribs were humungous!! very tasty and perfectly fatty. however, i am a pork kinda girl so i enjoyed the baby back ribs more because it was more tender and just melted in my mouth. the onion rings were mediocre, but the potato salad was pretty tasty. we split those with 3 people and weren't able to finish the meal. all of that with a soda came to be around less than $20 per person. i will definitely be visiting this place again the next time i go to sd. i'm so glad i tried this place!!

Warning....be prepared to nap after eating here.  Phil's BBQ is as much an amazing marvel of efficiency and engineering, as it is a delicious barbecue joint.  The line is routinely 20-30 people long...but it moves fast, there's always a place to sit, and your food is ready minutes after ordering.  Okay, it's not the world's best...and you cannot get brisket with "burnt end on bun."  But this is San Diego, not Kansas City.  Come join the masses for delicious mounds of pulled pork, beef ribs, and onion rings.  Then prepare for a horizontal food coma...mmmmm.

First off, i'm not a fan of bbq sauce, so i'm trying to rate it as best as I can. The meat was DANG GOOD, falls right off, honestly didn't need to use my fingers, i ate it clean with a fork and knife :) Downfall, is the bbq sauce. So if i liked bbq sauce i'd probably give it 5 stars, but since i don't, 4 "yay! i'm a fan!" i think that's a decent rating. The beans were sweet and savory, but heavy for my taste. The place is packed and boasts about their yelp reviews haha. With that many ratings, I can see why :) I like how they try their best to efficiently seat, serve, and cater to people's needs. Pretty awesome restaurant, but alas, I HATE BBQ sauce. Why Phil's... why couldn't you change my mind and make me love it till i die?!

i'll give it 5 stars just cause my bf who's a total rib monster loved it, otherwise it would have received four cause it's not as good as the original location (which is currently closed).  anyway i brought the boy here for the first time a couple of nights ago and we ordered a full rack with fries and mac salad and a pulled pork sandwich.  i ate about half the sandwich and half of the fries and was disgustingly full.  my bf cleared his entire plate of ribs plus the remaining fries and mac salad, and then proceeded to finish my plate.  he wanted more claiming he wasn't full yet but i thought i should stop him. they have tv's here so we watched some basketball to digest before heading off to ice cream afterwards :D a couple of quotes from the bf on the way to ice cream: "do i really want ice cream?  i don't want to get rid of this rib taste in my mouth" and "i wish i could burp right now so i can smell the ribs again" fries here arent that great but the mac salad is an excellent complement to the bbq sauce.  their coleslaw is pretty damn good too.  i hate vegetables and i'd eat the coleslaw. like i said, this place isnt as good as the other location.  maybe cause theyre making more ribs at a time or something, i dont know, but i do know that when i ate the ribs at the other location the meat just slid off the freaking bone when i touched it with my fingers, and that did not happen here.  also, maybe im just a sauce fiend, but i think they totally could've given me more sauce on my pulled pork sandwich. how did this get so long?  IN SHORT...really good ribs but if you can, head to mission hills.  stick with the baby back ribs and mac salad.

Didn't want to give another 4-star review, but the fact that my classmates went to Phil's after many (many) pitchers of beer, on a whim, during high traffic time, AND we found seating fast, AND our food was ready just as fast...  Well, that's deserving of 4 stars.  I felt sorry for all the people who were waiting in line to place orders and find seats, because (I could see from my patio seat) that line was wrapping around the corner.  The last time I went to Phil's was over a year ago, when it was still at the old location.  I don't know why I hadn't been back since.  Shared a half rack of ribs, fries and onion rings (with ranch), and still had leftovers.  The BBQ sauce is so yummy and sticky, even with the napkins and wet-naps, you come away feeling like your mouth and fingers are coated with residual sauce.

Phil's probably doesn't need another review and I doubt many will choose my review to read but I'm a loyal yelper so here I go. The evening started out with a crazy long line but I'd been warned so this was no big deal. I'm not a complainer and the company of the bestie made it 100% bearable. We waited about 40-50 minutes in line. An employee offered us water all the while and then came the onion rings...yum. Free sample. Toward the front of the line you can also order beer to enjoy while waiting and there are also menus up top to gawk at and get your order ready. So we finally get to the front (pre ordering to go is probably the best idea if you don't feel like waiting.) We were extra fatties an ordered a full rib plate with fries, a BBQ chicken thing and a full order of onion ring. The ribs were just as promised, the meat fell right off the bone and deliciously flavored. I wasn't too fond of the chicken, I can just make it at home! And lastly, the onion rings...the big a$$ onion rings. Soo good! What was even better was the ranch, it's so creamy. It tastes like sour cream ranch. It's milky with a hint of ranch flavor. They have silly bibs to wear when you're eating and you can refill your soda at the soda station (they have cherry pepsi!). The portions were good, we took a lot home. When I reheated the onion rings they didn't taste very good so eat them while they're still hot. The fries tasted like in and outs fries which I love and at the table they have cajun spice that you can add to your fries and also rolls of napkins to keep wiping the BBQ away. There was someone walking around ready to clean your table when you needed it. In conclusion...good ribs, yummy ranch and onion rings, and long line. They have yelp posters posted all over and seem to be concerned with giving the customer good service which is appreciated. Hit them up, even if it's just a one time thing, phils has turned into a SD must go to place.

This is definitely the best BBQ place I've ever been to. The meat falls right off the bones when you bite in. My boyfriend and I each get the Best of Both Worlds: 1 with Chickless and baby back ribs, and the other with Chicken and ribs. Then we get to choose a few different sides (2 small or one large size per best of both worlds). My favorite dish is the regular ribs and chickless. The line may look long but it moves quickly.

900+ reviews. This place doesn't need another review, but what the heck, I'll write one anyway. My friend was dying to take me here for the longest time. It is indeed good. I got the 1/2 rib dinner, which comes with half slab of baby back ribs and two sides, which I got potato salad and coleslaw. The meat falls off the bone and the sauce is just perfect. The side dishes are very fresh as well, especially the coleslaw. Coleslaw, if not fresh, can taste very soggy. As for the wait, it was not too bad. About 15 minutes wait, but it can be longer depending on the time and day. However, nothing can beat the atrocious wait time of the Boiling Crab in garden grove.

When you first go here you see the long line...after the long line...you find out why there is a long line. Whenever i go to San Diego, I have to go to Phil's bbq at least once. The food is superb with many TVs to watch from. They have a bar if you're feeling thirsty for alcohol. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for BOMB BBQ.

It's a different kind and style of BBQ.  Their beefy ribs are huge.  I feel like I'm eating a cow's leg or something.  As for the sides, I usually just get fries and macaroni salad.  A meal can be split between two people.  Comes with a full rack, two sides, and some BBQ chicken. I understand how people may dislike this.  Their style is more on their tangy sauce than anything.  I can make a comparison about Lucille's and Baby Blue's in LA.  For Phil's, there's a lot of meat so you can't complain.  The line can get super long and the wait can get up to an hour or so. If you want your own plate, I'd suggest one of the ticklers.

OK look, this place is so worth it.  You get so much good food for your money.  We went for San Diego's restaurant week.  They had a set menu, that covered a big selection of their food.  I ordered the salad and baked potato for the first course.  Then for the second course, I had Wow, a big beef rib, 1/4 BBQ chicken and some baby back ribs.  While I was devouring my food I felt like I was eating like a caveman.  It's not pretty with all the BBQ sauce splashing all over the place.  If anyone came close to my food I probably would have growled and shown my teeth.   That's how good this place is, you will protect your food from other people.  It is like instinct!  Then to finish with some mint girl scout cookies.    We got to Phil's aroung 8:30pm on a Tues, there was no line.  I hear the line could wrap around the building sometimes.  I also hear that the line moves quick.  While I was there you could see they run a tight ship.    I really enjoyed this place, the staff was helpful and on it.

What's wrong with Phil's? It's too small, and there isn't enough parking. The food is why. I got take out because it would be quicker and ordered the "Half rib only, 6-7 bones" for $10.95. I got about 9 and they were great.  I think the ribs are grilled vs smoked but still killer. The ribs are tender, moist with a little char on the outside. The sauce is different from other BBQ sauces. It looks almost like Chinese sweet and sour sauce because it is clear and kind of reddish. It tastes sour, sweet, with a little delayed heat. I will definitely try this again, at maybe a little bit of an off hour instead of 12:30PM.

The best bbq in town hands down...except the long line.  Sort of like waiting in line for a ride at an amusement park.  There's even a sign that gives your approximate wait time at a certain point in line.

I have not eaten in during the last few years due to the wait, but you can call ahead and get your order quick and take it home. I recently had the El Toro (saw it on Man v Food) and it was delicious. I never had it because I always eat ribs when I am here which are also great. My wife likes beef ribs and I like pork and we can get both here which is awesome. One of the last places I eat when I am home before I deploy and one the first places I eat when I come back, Best Q for a southern boy like me.

Would you wait in a huge line just to eat BBQ? you would if you where going to be eating BBQ at Phil's. This is an order at the counter and wait for your number kind of place so i always think it's best to have someone order the food while another person finds a table. Now for the food the portions are generous here so my Man and I usually share. The Sweet Tea here goes perfectly with the BBQ and it's always a must when we come here.

I think Phil's BBQ is pretty good! It is not great but good! I don't think it is worth waiting in line for an hour for unless you are really craving BBQ. I have been there twice. They have really good customer service! I got the el toro last time I went. It was ok. There was way to much bbq sauce on it. I love there onion rings they are really good! they are beer battered and you can dip them in there buttermilk ranch. Really bad for you but tastes really good! But then again most things that are bad for you taste pretty good!! One thing I like about Phil's is they have a good drink selection! There prices are reasonable. I have just had better BBQ which is why I am not giving it a five star rating. If you are in San Diego I think this place is worth trying!! Just beware the line will be long. Try to get there before 5pm and the line will not be as long!

If you' are visiting San Diego and want something truely unique check this place out. I also ordered the onion rings that were  crisp, not greasy and were mildly sweet. Come hungry.

we decided to try phil's BBQ after seeing 2600+ reviews on yelp. first off, i've tried alot of BBQ in my life from all over the US. i'd like to think i've tried some of the best. phil's was average for me. definitely not worth the hype on yelp.  there was a HUGE line but i have to give them props for fast service b/c we only waited 30 mins. their menu is limited meaning they focus more on ribs (pork & beef) which is fine.  we ordered a full rack of ribs, potato salad, baked beans & small onion rings. their ribs were fall off the bone, however, i believe they were out for a while or was in the food heater too long b/c the meat was a bit dry. they doused their meat in tons of BBQ sauce to rehydrate the meat so it was difficult to taste the actual meat. the potato salad was not good at all. i know it's a BBQ joint so alot of you are probably saying i should only focus on the meat but i like the whole package when i go to a BBQ spot and the sides have to be up to par. overall, the establishment has fast, great service but the food was average. maybe i was more disappointed b/c of all the hype.

This is my favorite place to get ribs in SD, but I liked it better when it was at the hillcrest location. People complaining about getting seats at the Point Loma location have no idea how bad it was at the hillcrest location. When I used to go to the hillcrest Phil's there was always a lady who you talked to for a seat and I always contemplated bribing her. The point loma location is nice since there is a lot more seating and its near my work, but I hate sitting next to the window where the line forms because then people just stare at you with evil eyes as you eat your food. Ribs - The ribs here are great. The meat falls off the bone and the ribs are usually cooked well. I like my ribs well seared, but sometimes they overdo it and burn it. The sauce is good, but I find it a little bit too sweet. French Fries - The fries are better than the standard fare, but nothing really special imo; though they do give you a bit. I like to make a sauce for the fries with ketchup, franks, and some of the ribs bbq sauce. Onion Rings - These are so good, but you can feel your arties getting clogged as you eat them. The onions are nice, big, and meaty. The rings are greasy and crunchy as they should be. Corn on the cob - I like the corn here because they do it right. The corn is nice and hot, plus its great spraying corn juice all over the people you are eating with. Other - I have had the other sides like slaw, potato salad, and macaroni salad, and I am not a fan of any of these. I don't think they are bad just not my cup of tea.

YUM! the macaroni salad and the soda were the highlights of my phils bbq experience. im def coming back here! ps: do not order the chicken ceasars salad haha it tasted a bit weird to me n the sauce is not the typical ceasars sauce =[

It's pretty good. Best bbq I've ever eaten but I don't really like bbq haha. The meat is so juicy it falls off the bones though. The sauce just isn't to my taste (ask for sauce on the side if you don't want the ribs to be molested). The food is a lil expensive too. My boyfriend gives it a 3.5 out of 5. He thinks it's ok, but we don't really crave it, thus the 3 stars. Better than average but not good enough to want it over and over again.

I love Phil's! I always get the baby back ribs and fries. The only thing is that the line is sooo long! I think I have spent 2 hours waiting in line before! So don't come here if you are starving to death! Come before you get hungry and you will get hungry by the time you get your food! They did pass out fries for people waiting in the line once when I came. I feel that they do what they can to accommodate the 4,000 customers they have everyday. If possible phone in your order and pick it up to-go. I have done that a few times and it worked out great.

Best ribs ever! For roughly 10 bucks you can get the most amazing, mouth watering, meat-falling-off-the-bone, basket of goodness. Sure the lines can get up to a mile long (not really), but if you're in line with some friends, it can go by fairly quick. Phils needs to expand to a larger location with the amount of business they get. They have an extended menu consisting of other sandwiches and things, but i never think to get anything else but their baby back ribs. Yum!

Haven't found a better rib place yet.  I have been searching too.  IMO, better than Famous Dave's and Lucille's.  Meat is extremely tender and the bbq sauce is very tasty.  I prefer the pork ribs but the beef ribs are excellent too.  They also offer chicken if you prefer.  The sides are very good too.

I've been craving some BBQ, so I headed over to Phil's for lunch today.  I had been to the Hillcrest location a few years ago, and that visit left me disappointed, especially after all the hype.   I feel the same way after today's lunch - somewhat disappointed.  Good food, but nothing special and I don't understand the crazy hype this place gets. I work off Miramar Rd., and as many of you know there is another BBQ joint nearby.  This place tends to be hit-or-miss, but I ate there yesterday (beef sandwich) and it was pretty damn delicious.  I think they're a little overpriced and the quality is inconsistent, but I still think their BBQ is better than Phil's, even on an off day.   At Phil's, I ordered a plate of onions rings (thick and delicious), a pork rib plate (with fries and mac salad), and the El Toro (beef sandwich).  My wife was there to help me finish everything.     The fries and rings were excellent.  But you don't go to a BBQ joint for fries and rings, dammit.  The ribs were good, but not great.  My wife and I agreed that my own home-grilled pork ribs (purchased from Costco) are better than Phil's.  That's not a testament to my own cooking - it's more a slight on Phil's.  The tri-tip sandwich, which is what I was really craving, was below average, in my opinion.  The meat reminded me of some generic "beef in bbq sauce" that you might buy in a tub at the supermarket.  To be fair, I'm not a huge fan of Phil's sauce, and since everything was slathered in it (which would normally be a good thing), I think it turned me off.  Sauce aside, the beef itself wasn't anything special.  I think I prefer a thicker cut of meat, instead of the "deli-sliced" that they use in the sandwich.  I definitely prefer a spicier or smokier sauce, with less sweet tanginess.  The color and glaze of the sauce reminded me of some terrible Chinese sweet and sour.   The service was EXCELLENT.  We were greeted at the door, the girl taking my order was real nice (and asked if I'd like my sauce on the side), and a dude stopped by our table a couple of times to ask how we were doing.  The facilities are pretty cool, it sort of had an amusement park feel to it (like an old school Knott's Berry Farm) and the trough sinks are a nice touch.   I'm sure I'll go back at some point, but I won't be jumping on the Phil's bandwagon like the rest of these reviews you'll read.  When I get that urge for a tri-tip sandwich, I'll be sticking to Miramar.

This is basically a San Diego monument. This should be part of your San Diego routine. Go to the beach, cliffs, and end it all with PHILS! Phils BBQ has the best ribs I have ever eaten in my life. This place got a spotlight from the hit tv show on the travel channel "Man vs. Food." If it is on Man vs. Food you KNOW this place is LEGIT. Lets start off with the place. The restaurant is pretty spacious and cozy. But the fact that there are A LOT of people there makes the place kind of hectic but not too hectic to ruin your meal or interfere your conversation with your group. The staff is extremely friendly and animated. There is this certain busser he is super friendly and chill. He is this tall skinny man that you cannot miss. Make sure to strike a conversation with him because he has made me crack a laugh a couple of times. And also the service is pretty good. Once I got my order literally 2 seconds after ordering from the cashier. The food is nothing less than spectacular. I have tried the full baby back rib dinner and the beefy rib dinner. Nothing against the beefy ribs, but my personal preference is the baby rack dinner with fries and macaroni salad. Other notable sides that you should definitely try are the beans, the onion rings (I think the onion rings you have to order separately), and the corn on the cob. This is an actually legit corn on the cob not the ones where they rip you off and give you half of a cob. Overall this place is great. I have been to this place roughly 10 times and I cannot wait to go back again! Hooray for RIBS!

The food is delicious. The ribs are tender and the chicken isn't dry. You can get a little bit of both plus some sides for only $12. Fries are seasoned just right and the other sides compliment your meal well. The only problem is that this place is always packed. One way to get around it even though I am sure they frown upon it is to just order through the phone. This way you can just walk in and pick up your food then go grab any empty table you find and hope the servers don't notice. Phils BBQ is one of the best BBQ places I have been to. I highly recommend it.

Best BBQ I've ever had! I spent my whole life in SoCal so I haven't had regional exposure to BBQ, but I've heard that Phil's is pretty high up there as one of the nation's best BBQ joints. I've had almost every item on their menu and everything is delicious, very reasonably priced for it's quality, and largely portioned. All their BBQ meats are juicy, tender, smokey, and seasoned perfectly with their special sauces and spices. Their side dishes (fries, onion rings, potato/macaroni /garden salads, baked potato, corn on the cob, beans, etc.) compliment the rich flavors of the meat entrees perfectly. And the portions are HUGE; their plates are essentially trays! They also have a bar side of the restaurant where people hang out, eat some great BBQ, have a few beers, and watch whatever game is on. Oh and the service at Phil's is GREAT. All the servers are extremely laid back, friendly, and genuinely care about the customers, which makes the casual atmosphere of Phil's so lovable (: The only down side about going to Phil's is the wait; it's always around 30+ minute with an hour plus wait time during dinnertime and weekends, but trust me it's worth it! The combination of large portions, meaty delicious-ness,friendly/casual atmosphere, and cheap pricing makes Phil's a go to place for a hungry hungry student like myself Highly recommended and is a MUST for san diego visits!

Considering I am the 314th reviewer I doubt I will be saying anything new here but this place is awesome! We went here last Friday night at 7:30pm thinking we would just wait out the long line. Boy were we in for a pleasant surprise. The line appeared long but by the time we figured out what we wanted to order...we were at the front of the line. We liked: Chickless Tickler combo plate, baby back ribs, and the Sangria. The people are all really friendly too!! Big plus. We are adding Phil's to the rotation!

Let's face it, Southern California isn't exactly known for it's bbq, but while staying in San Diego recently the concierge recommended Phil's so we decided to give it a try.   Yum!  It reminded us of the type of bbq we would get when we lived in Austin, TX but with better sauce.  The girls split a rack of pork ribs with the sweet baked beans and cole slaw, hubby had the pulled pork sandwich and I had the corn on the cob.  We all split a small order of onion rings.  Top it off with a few drinks (soda fountain, self-serve, free refills) and our bill came up to just under $40. There was so much food that we struggled to get through it and still weren't able to finish.  I am usually skeptical of corn on the cob from restaurants but this was fresh and sweet.  The ribs could have used a little more flavor, but the pulled pork was nice and smoky.  I missed the pineapple bits in the cole slaw, but it was still tasty, and the beans were a perfect balance of sweet and zesty.   It is similar to places in the south where you walk up and place your order and pick up the food once your buzzer goes off - an upgrade from straining to hear your order number being called.  We had several people come by during our meal to make sure the food was good and to see if we needed anything or to clear plates.   We went around 4:30 pm on a Thursday and had no wait, but were warned that evenings and weekends were crazy busy.

I'm torn in writing this review. I LOOOOOVE Phil's as a restaurant, but I was super bummed about the prospect of having them as a wedding caterer! When my husband and I got engaged last year, one of the first details we thought we would be able to nail down would be the catering since we both loved Phil's and wanted the yummy and casual feel of bbq for our big day. I had also used their catering service when I was graduating from UCSD for a simple large pick-up order and they had been great to my mom. WRONG! I was very disappointed with their catering manager. Granted, it was at the start of my first ever wedding planning journey, so I had several questions, but we set up a phone appointment and she did not call me. Then we set up a second appointment a week or two later, and she flaked on that one again. Finally I had a day off from work and called to set up an in-person appointment. Her office was super messy, though it was in the middle of their holiday season and it seemed like she was the only person working in the catering department. During the 45 minutes I was there, she probably got about 10 phone calls and she answered 2 of them while I was there. By that point, I had already began researching costs for party rentals and had developed a pretty firm idea about our overall wedding budget. I explained that we wanted a simple, casual summer garden wedding. She was pretty pushy in trying to convince me to have them take care of the rentals "for a small extra fee" as well as trying to convince me that we needed to upgrade many of the rentals. She tried to convince me to add 3 layers of tablecloths, fancy chairs, real silverware and added that I should really rent some crazy port-a-potty trailer with lights and sinks that would "only be an extra $1,500". She said that she would put together a quote for me with all the possible bells and whistles and that we could take things off the quote from there. She promised to send it the next day, and actually sent it the next week. It was not itemized and was more than $2,500 more than I had already been quoted from the site's preferred vendor. Yikes! She also told me that because I was coming to meet with her 9 months before our wedding, that she really didn't want to deal with me until 2 months before our wedding! I really don't think I was a bridezilla, but I left feeling like someone was trying to boss me around and take advantage of me as a novice party planner. Their prices were decent compared to some of the other caterers out there and their food is super yummy, so I might use them if I had a company party or something, but they get a thumbs down for me for wedding planning. This was also back in the winter of 2008, not sure if they still have the same catering manager.

Getting good bbq is hit or miss these days.  I usually get pretty bad bbq at the chain restaurants.  However, at a little spot in SD near the Sports Arena you can get a super mouth orgasm.  The best ribs I ever had!  I've been goin to this place for years back when it was a dark hole in a wall place with the ghetto benches.  Nice apple smoked flavor to their bbq.  Onion rings are really good too.  It hits the gspot.  Seriously.

This restaurant is a must-go-to place. Every time someone visits me from another city, I always take them to Phil's. It's just.. the best! I hate finger foods and getting my hands dirty, but this place is worth it, I promise. The meat from the baby back ribs just slides off the bones and the sauce makes it oh-my-freaking-goodness good. I get a baby back tickler (3-4 ribs, fries, cole slaw, and 2 onion rings) and it's only $7.01. What a freaking deal! And oh yes, the fries. UGH. I want some right now. You dip that in the Phil's sauce and then some ranch and you get a taste of heaven. Freak, I'm getting hungry. Oh yeah, and I met Phil, too. He's this huge bald guy with a mustache, a low voice, and very little words. But he was nice enough to take a picture with me. :) Oh yeah (again), I catered from Phil's for my college graduation and they were so nice, congratulating me and conversing with me as I waited for the food. They're so patient and friendly. I seriously wonder how they are like that with all those customers in there.

Much better than I remember from last time. Service was very exceptional- a lot of employees asking us if everything was good. The sign outside that says there is a 21 minute and 14 second wait, is pretty much a lie, it's really about a 45 minute wait. The wait to get the food is about 5 minutes. This time I tried the El Toro, tri-tip sandwich in addition to the baby back rib tickler. The ribs weren't burnt this time and the onion rings were hot from the fryer. Not the best that I've had, but really good for california standards. The tri-tip in the sandwich was very flavorful and cut extremely thin which was very pleasant.

I live close by Phil's, and have heard the rave reviews. I finally had dinner there Tues 8/19. I ordered to go via the the telephone, which was fairly quick and painless.  My choice was the boneless pork with two sides, in this case baked beans and cole slaw. I thought that the meal was just OK.  The pork was good, but nothing special.  The beans were OK and nicely spicey.  The slaw...well, I'm glad I didn't get food poisoning- It was nearly room temperature. Maybe the ribs are better, but I didn't think it was anything to rave about and certainly the huge crowds are puzzling.

Overrated much?   My boyfriend and I waited an hour to get into Phil's last night so I was expecting ribs that would knock my socks off.  They didn't.  My ribs were not tough but they certainly didn't fall off the bone, they were a little burnt which left an unpleasant char taste in my mouth, and while the sauce was sweet and spicy in the beginning, after a few ribs it started to taste one note.  The fries were a little dried out and, while my boyfriend enjoyed his pulled pork sandwich, he wasn't blown away. I LOVE ribs and had hoped to find a great place in San Diego.  After our visit to Phil's, I'm still looking.  If it weren't for the wait, I'd probably go back here for decent but not amazing food, but as it is, the food is definitely not worth the wait or the hype.

I knew they had to be good when I drove by and saw a line around the building!!! After that I was for sure gonna see what all the buzz was about. I now frequent them a couple times a month (great for low carbers). They are not the BEST BBQ spot I've ever had, but they are the 2nd :) The baby back ribs are so good! Fall off the bone meat is the best since I don't like gnawing on bones. The sauce is spicy and yummy. I've only tried the BBR, the boneless chicken, potato and macroni salads and the AMAZING whoopie pies!!! I of course don't have the patience to wait in a line that wraps around the building, but the to-go option is awesome :) Definitely worth the wait if you can though.

I didn't really read the reviews in depth before I came, so I was expecting full service sit-down place. Once I ascertained what kind of place I was, and got my chicken and beef-rib combo I was impressed by the portions for the price. I didn't expect the ribs to be falling-off-the-bone, but they were reasonably close and the best I've had for that price. The sauce was really tangy and not overly sweet. I personally love vinegary stuff and the sauce sold me on this place. I should really go again sometime, or get something to go...

Went to San Diego to go to Comic-Con and was told this was the place to eat in all of San Diego.  Went Sunday afternoon at around 15:30.  Line was crazy long.  There's a sign outside that states the wait is about 21 mins from that point.  There were about 20-something more people after this point.  Wow, I was amazed.  Got in line with my friend and the woman in front of me (a native of San Diego) told me this was normal.  OK, so we waited a bit when a leaving customer told us the secret was to go through the side and sit at the bar.  Well, she's right.  We found two available seats right away and sat down.  My friend ordered the BBQ Broham-the pulled pork sandwich with the cole saw and I ordered the Baby Back Rib & Chicken Dinner.  We also got fries, potato salad and an order of onion rings to compliment all this.  Driving back to LA, we opted for the endless soda.  I did notice they had Arrogant Bastard beer on tap-a rarity.   Food came quick, we waited maybe 10m.  Portions weren't bad.  For lunch, filling.  For dinner, I would have ordered a little more.  My friend's Broham was excellent.  Some of the best pulled pork I've ever had.  And I recommend you eat it with the coleslaw.  Really adds a lot of dimensions of flavor to the pork.  My baby ribs were also excellent.  They're served wet.  Really soft and flavorful.  Not the best I've ever had, the meat still had to be chewed off the bone but it was good.  My chicken wasn't so much-very average.  So were the fries, also very average.  The potato salad was below average.  The cuts of potato were big so that there wasn't a good balance between the potato and the salad part.  You tasted more potatoes than anything else.  And the onion rings are quite possibly the biggest onion rings I've ever had.  Ridiculously huge.  But they also were just average.  So while we found the sides pretty average, the ribs and the pulled pork were excellent.  I'd come back here next Comic-Con.  And upon leaving, the woman that was in front of us in the line?  She was still standing there waiting for a table.  So maybe a 3 1/2 star?

been dying to try out this bbq joint ever since i saw it on man vs food!  also heard lots of high raves about it through some friends. My group of 10 friends came in at 1130 (30 mins after opening)  on a Friday and the line was already around the corner of the building.  it was still early, so there was plenty of seats.  the line moved relatively fast.  but, im sure if we came any later, the wait would be excruciating long!   we basically ordered everything off the menu and shared. honestly, there wasn't anything that i would say was "GROSS" the star winner of the meal was definitely the baby back ribs.  it fell right of the bones with intense flavor.   i didnt enjoy the beef ribs as much because it was kinda tough and dry, so i recommend just sticking to the pork. the tri trip and and the pulled pork sammich was great. i enjoyed their BBQ sauce.  its quite tasty.   the sides were cool....mac salad was cool...fries were like in n outs but just thicker in size. their onion rings were pretty good!  a small is pretty generous.  we ordered a small and it was just perfect for us 10.  they are hugeee, hot, and crunchy served with ranch sauce. prob one of the best bbq joints ive been to by far.  the raves and hype was lived up!  i was not disappointed. its finger lickin' good.  gooooo get your baby back ribs! =D

I had my first taste of Phil's when someone at work took orders and brought in take out for all of us.  I've been hooked ever since!  Phil's BBQ is rightly deserving of the "Best BBQ in San Diego" claims.  Their BBQ sauce is honestly the best I've ever tasted.  Whatever you normally like at a BBQ, order that at Phil's and you will be able to die happy.  I usually get the El Toro beef sandwich which is packed so full you can barely pick it up with two hands.  Even when you succeed, about half of it falls all over your plate/table/lap anyway!  But don't worry, they have a much needed hand-wash station in the back!

phil's...you did NOT disappoint. i have several friends that talk about this place nonstop. i was spending the day in san diego and told my bff that we needed to go to this bbq place...because apparently its the best. i'm not quite sure if its "the best" since i really don't eat bbq too often, but it definitely lived up to all the great reviews! we got there around 730 on a saturday... and to my surprise there was a line outside the door that was wrapped around the restaurant. it was kind of a bummer to have to wait in that line but i had a feeling it was probably going to be worth the wait because there were so many people. its a casual restaurant, they take your order at the front and buzz you when your food is ready. so the line went by pretty fast. we probably waited for around 25 minutes...not bad at all. i had a hard time deciding what to get because everything sounded SO good...but i finally settled with the quarter rib dinner w/ cole slaw and macaroni salad.   YUM!!!!!!! ribs were delicious. the sauce was a winner. i can't really describe it but its tangy, sweet and a bit spicy... it was delicious. sides were great as well. and we also shared an order of fries... reminded me of the fries they serve at islands. having kenny as our waiter was an added bonus! he was hilarious. made our experience at phil's really enjoyable! come here if you're ever in the area....this is definitely the bbq place to try!

The best BBQ in San Diego. Okay, so I've only tried three other places, but this place rocks! I haven't yet tried the larger Phil's in Point Loma, but the small place in Mission Hills is the place to be. Although small, can be overcrowded at times and you may have to wait, it is well worth it!

Is it weird to bite into a sandwich and hear music?  ... Cue the Stevie Wonder.  I mean seriously ... I don't know quite know how it happened, but a man has stolen my heart ... with BBQ sauce no less.  With moist, charred pulled pork to boot.  And if it wasn't so frowned upon, I'd go ahead and tell you how I really feel ... I love you ... I love you, you inanimate caricature ... mustached grill master ... hoister of blue-ribbon ribs known to others as Phil ... but to me as my GRUB-amore.  Before this thing between me and Phil gets creeper (wait, really ... too late?) take a journey with me down to SD ... a magical blend of surfer brahs, Shamu fanatics, and BBQ warlords.  My adventure started out on a Monday night ... pulling into Phil's parking lot only to come face to face with the most horrific site these eyes have ever seen ... a half dozen signs crushing my soul with a "Sorry ... we're closed Mondays."  So like any good GRUB-soldier, I picked out a choice spot up front, tilted my seat back ... cried for a little bit ... and camped out for 24 hours.  Okay, fine ... some of these facts may be slightly inaccurate ... I cried a lot a bit.  So with an extra day of anticipation under my belt, I headed back the following night and was met with the white-rhino of Phil's BBQ ... only a handful of people in line to place their order.  This might not at first sound impressive, but within 15 minutes of getting there, the line wrapped half way around the building, creeping up to the Disneyland-esque "approximate wait time from this point" sign (and like the rest of the top notch operation Phil is running ... he gives you that wait time down to the second).  As I approached the counter, my mind was pretty much already set.  I mean, can you really pass up a pulled pork sandwich called ... The Broham?  As with everything at Phil's, this is a monster of a sandwich ... a crispy, warm, mind-blowing-in-its-own-right bun cradles a bed of cool homemade coleslaw topped off with an un-Godly ... I take that back ... topped off with a Godly amount of never-ending pulled pork overflowing with BBQ sauce.  Now, in my mind, the pulled pork is pretty much unmatched by anyone ... unreal juiciness, but with a nice bit of smoky crunch to the edges ... it's pure magic.  But the kicker to this whole dance is the BBQ sauce.  Let's just say, I finally get what Champ from Anchorman was going on and on about.  It's straight crack.  And like all good crack ... it never stops flowing.  I was about to get a side order of BBQ sauce for our fries ... and damn was I glad I didn't ... because the amount they loaded onto the Broham was enough for my sandwich, my fries, my coleslaw ... my Mr. Pibb.  But lest you think I'm complaining about the amount of sauce ... it's just the opposite my GRUB-mate.  Phil's BBQ sauce is the answer to ... well, everything.  Put it on a rash, baptize a baby with it, use it as a mulch in your garden ... and I'm pretty sure if we thought hard enough about it ... it could solve world peace.  Matching up with all this mayhem was a "small order of fries"... which translates into ... "giant tray-o-fries"  and another side order of that perfect BBQ companion ... coleslaw.  I've had my fare number of trips down to San Diego to visit Phil, but this was the first I came face to face with his newest temptation ... giant whoopee pies.  Now, my little lady has been known to throw down some pretty mean whoopee pies ... and I'll still give her the edge ... but these giant morsels of two chewy oatmeal cookies encasing a center of sweet, pink frosting was the perfect way to top of this GRUB-fest.  I don't know how you do it Phil ... but damn am I glad you do.  So join me in my praise ... try it out for yourself ... and may I be damned if you don't start humming ... "I believe when I fall in love this time ... it will be forever!"

avoid the crowds... come here on a random tuesday or wednesday night. the bbq was finger licking good. i can't believe i was able to finish 1/2 a rack of baby back ribs and a small side of potato salad all by myself. i'm such a fat-ass. the beef rib... yummm... and the cole slaw had a hint of wasabi - different from others i've had in the past. i felt like the ribs were almost a little too saucy. not too saucy like it had attitude but too saucy like i needed to eat it with rice or something anyway, come here if you're hungry. come here with boys. well... just come here.

I love Phil's and I will always love Phil's. I don't care which one I go to. The original restaurant is always the busiest even if the one in San Marcos is smaller. The babyback ribs are the best. I like getting the coleslaw and potato salad. Those never fail and they are never too mayonaisey. What I've been getting lately is a large site of fries with extra sauce on the side and dipping my fries in the sauce. AMAZING!! Their broham sandwich is also a favorite of mine. Can't go wrong with pulled pork. I know I'll be coming to Phil's again soon!

OH YES!  Phil's BBQ is hands down the best place for some BBQ ribs.  The rib tickler always does the trick for me: ribs, fries, onions rings and coleslaw - a great combination.  This place gets crowded during peak hours so call ahead...that's what I do!  If you don't...the wait for your food and a table almost usually take over an hour!  Great to hear they are opening a new location in Point Loma...can't wait to visit that one.

The best BBQ place ever! everything on the menu is good from the ribs to the sandwiches and even the sides. One good tip before you go is to get a copy of the menu and order over the phone even if your eating there this can save you sometimes even up to an hour. The line to order is super busy all the time not to mention trying to find a table to sit and eat once you get your food. I suggest ordering a good 15 minutes before you arrive and just bypass the entire line of people still waiting to order!

After a day of sailing we ended up here before the "line".  All I can say is WOW!!  Everyone enjoyed it all.... great baby back ribs, the mac salad was simple and fresh, hugh delicious onion rings and a great selection of beers on tap.   With that said I do think the bartendress is probably one of the most unfriendly staff I've ever crossed paths with. Not sure I'd wait in a line to eat anywhere but early enough this is the best.

My experience at Phil's: - Show up right at 11am when they open, and the line will already be around the corner, but will move fast.  Show up 15 minutes prior and you'll be in the front of that line. - The only other way to avoid the lines is to sit at the bar or call ahead and get your order to go. - Their bulk-order catering is awesome, a good choice if you're throwing a party.  If you order their pulled pork and/or tri-tip sandwiches, everything comes separated and the meat and sauce come in styrofoam containers to keep the heat in (the containers are recyclable; just bring them back into the store when you're done).  They'll even give you plates, napkins, utensils, and wet-naps if you want them. - Lines are long, parking sucks - Barbecue is really good and arguably the best in San Diego (although that's not saying much).  Pulled pork (broham) sandwiches are the bomb, tri-tip (el toro) sandwiches are good but doesn't live up to the Man vs. Food hype.  They serve their barbecue with more sauce than most barbecue purists would deem as acceptable.  It's a good thing that I LOVE their delicious, tangy sauce.

Went to Phils to watch the end of the Lakers game and get a Broham to go. Well the Lakers weren't that good but Phil's has gotten much better. Now you can literally walk in order and get  your food without the long line or the 1/2 hour wait. I went to the Bar and ordered a brew and before I even got my beer the food was done. The fries were good and the Broham beef sandwich rules!!!

My favorite place to eat in San Diego. No question and no other restaraunt is even a close second. The employees are always super friendly and "Phil" is the nicest guy you'll ever meet. He actually told me the secret to his ribs. He sprinkles a little crack in the sauce. Makes you keep coming back for more!

I love going through reviews on Yelp and I've been a member for.. not so long but I'm not sure why I never felt the urge to write reviews for other restaurants or places I've been to.  After Phil's BBQ and seeing the Yelp sticker on their window, I knew I had to write my first review on them!  Phil's was quite simply, very delicious and worth the wait!  I took my friend who was visiting SD for the day to Phil's on Saturday night.  If you're super hungry or looking for a quick bite to eat, DON'T GO ON A SATURDAY NIGHT!  The line was wrapped around the restaurant!  But like I said, it was worth the wait.   The environment is nice with bright lights, clean, and spacious.  The staff was extremely courteous, funny, and helpful.  We ordered a quarter rack of baby back ribs (comes with one large side or two small sides), the pulled pork sandwich, and a small order of the onion rings.  They have the biggest, greasiest, yummiest onion rings I've ever had in my life!  The pulled pork sandwich was tender and drenched in bbq sauce.  The baby back ribs... mmm... my favorite item of the night!  I will definitely come back again!  Oh yeah, my bill was the grand total of $21 and something cents!  My friend and I both got to bring home doggie bags that night.  Happy campers =)

No need to rave about the back ribs, beef ribs, mac/beans mixed together, onion rings, fries, etc. as everyone knows how exceptional the food is. But I do want to highlight how awesome it is that almost every time I've been here the last several years (both the new and old location), Phil himself is right in the mix making sure everyone and everything behind the counter is like clockwork (which it is) and everyone who's in BBQ heaven is indeed blissful. Which is just awesome and really sets the stage for an overall 5-star experience in taste and service. I love Phil's.

Come a couple of times and been disappointed both.  It's pretty standard southern CA BBQ in my opinion.  I've had the Broham pulled pork sandwich and the beef ribs.  The pulled pork was mediocre, not very flavorful and the texture was just okay (perfect in some areas, mealy in others) and thus the sandwich was forgettable.  The beef ribs were disappointing as well, as the flavor wasn't that good and they weren't very tender.  The first time I came I sluffed it off as being an aberration based on all the awesome review, but twice in a row and I'm pretty sure this really just isn't that great.  You can drive around a couple of places in San Diego, let alone Southern CA (Smokin' Mos in Huntington Beach comes to mind) and get better BBQ.

The best place for BBQ in San Diego! so far, I've only had the Beefy Rib Dinner & the Baby Back Ribs with Macaroni Salad. It is good. Only downfall is that this is the only location they got here, they should have at least 2-3 locations because the line outside goes around the entire restaurant about 1 mile long, I would recommend coming in early, right when they open to avoid the crowd. On our way out from dinner, I've seen people standing in line outside in the cold & the rain eating a bar of Kit Kat to hold them up until they get to the front of the line. Usually a 45 min-1 hour wait.

i lived in kansas city for 4 years.  kansas city knows bbq and it's nothing like the typical trash you find on the west coast.  phil's does an admirable job of emulating the feel of a real midwest bbq place.  the atmosphere feels right.  the menu looks right. as to the food, it's pretty good.  if all i'd ever eaten is garbage coastal bbq, it'd probably find it orgasmic.  but having eaten midwest bbq, i find it decent.  it gets bonus points since it's the best you can get around here. be prepared to wait a long time if you plan on eating at the restaurant on a weekend for dinner.  if you want to carry out, call it in.

The wait is totally not worth it. I was not willing to wait 2 hours and a half just for some bbq. Me and my friends decided to order it to go which breaks the time to a 10 min wait and eat it back home. But yo, the ribs are super super delicious. I ordered half a rack and i wished I ordered a full rack. One of my friends told me that eating at Phils BBQ, you have to experience the whole thing and the wait is part of the whole experience so maybe I should have waited, but regardless, the baby back ribs was awesome! next time ill bring my ipod or some cards to pass the time in line. =)

best saucey BBQ pork ribs in SD!  love the tangy sweet flavor of the BBQ saucy and the juicy tender meat off the rib.  the macaroni salad is delicious too.  the chick-less dinner packs some good chicken too. if you have a party of 4 or less you could probably do the small onion rings because the large is freaking huge. it is a long line on the weekends, so unless you plan on waiting a while just get take out.

Finally came back to Phil's for some BBQ. We had tried a couple of weeks ago but the line was just too long and we were starving so we left! We came here again on a Friday night around 9:30, and it was still about a 35-40 minute wait. The hostess asked us for our party number and when she heard it was 6, she helped us find a table right away! What great customer service -- I thought we had to find our own table which could have been a few more minutes of waiting. Anyway, I ordered the Baby Back Ribs Tickler for 7 bucks and this definitely was not a tickler, it was a full meal! It came with a few pieces of ribs, two onions rings, cole slaw and fries. There was so much fries that I barely finished half of it and I was full already. The BBQ sauce was just as good as I remembered it -- juicy and flavorful. The cole slaw was a little on the dry side but it was good nonetheless. The two onion rings that came with my meal were okay, I thought they were a little burnt but the BF seemed to enjoy it. He ordered a BBQ sandwich; he said his meat tasted bland but it was nothing their table seasonings couldn't fix. Our bill came out to be 20 dollars, including tip. There are a lot of waiters/waitresses walking around which I thought was convenient since there was just so many customers. P.S. I overheard a customer and hostess talking and she mentioned that Phil is at the restaurant every day. That shows a lot of heart and dedication!

Great BBQ in San Diego? This review is way past due, as this is one of my favorite spots in San Diego. My usual order consists of either a best of both, a Broham sandwich, or an El Toro sandwich. I have never had a bad meal here so I don't think you can go wrong with whatever you choose. The meat is juicy, falls of the bone, and their sandwiches are packed with tons of meat! So much meat I just put the excess on top of my fries. Another thing, the service here is top notch. Everyone is polite and it seems like they always have smiles on their faces. A definite recommendation to locals and anyone thinking of a place to bring visiting guests.

I was NOT happy about waiting in line for this place, but later realized it's not that bad...reason being once you get your order in and seated, you get your food VERY fast. The food is definitely very good, but nothing you can't get at any other good BBQ joint...many without the line. If your in the area, this is a great choice for dinner.

I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I ordered the boneless ribs with macaroni salad and baked beans. Really great. The ribs were very tender and tasty, some, however, were a little dry but most of what was on my plate was great.  The onion rings were soft and buttery with just the right amount of crunch. We waited in a line that moved surprisingly fast and the food was done in 10 minutes. It was our first time there and the staff was very welcoming and helpful. If I was ever in san diego again I would go back.

I can't believe no one mentioned the Broham sandwich!!! I remember the first time, I tried it -- bbq pork and cole slaw? You're kidding right? Nope. Best thing I ever did was to try it. Now,   MC may be right and maybe we don't know real bbq. But since I'm not from St Louis or Tennessee or North Carolina, my taste buds only knows what it knows and it knows that Phil's is the best I've had in San Diego.

I feel like I should write just a brief review, because if you don't know that Phil's is the best BBQ in San Diego, you haven't been listening.  Nor have you even driven through Phil's neighborhood and smelled that heavenly sweet scent.   Not only is Phil's dine-in and take-out fabulous, their catering is equally wonderful.  I have had them cater several business lunches for my firm, and more times than not, Phil himself delivered the food.  They are generous with their portions, prompt, and professional.   My only complaint about Phil's is that they are not going to reopen the original Mission Hills location.  I live in MH, and this was a huge disappointment.  Alas, I now have to brave the Point Loma location with everybody else.

HOLY SMOKES!  This place really cranks it out!  I kind of like the operation.  You wait in a long line (good sign, but it moves pretty good) and order at the counter then  receive a pager.  One of you goes and scouts out a table while the other(s) fill the drinks.  By the time everyone is seated, the pager goes off and you go up to fetch your meat.  The beef bones are HUGE and BEEFY (even though personally, I'm a baby back fan).  The q really is pretty tasty and my only complaint is that the meat is drenched in the sauce.  The sauce is decent with a sweet peppery vinegary kick, but seems a little on the commercial side.  If I were to go back, I would order my meat dry so I could sauce it myself.  All in all, pretty decent place with energetic positive vibe.

Line was long for our Saturday visit. Despite the fact we were there at 10:45 am. The food and service were average at best. 5 in our group had Beef ribs, baby back ribs, burger, tri tip sandwich and pulled pork sandwich. We also had fries, onion rings, potato salad and BBQ beans. The best item were the onion rings but they were way to greasy to finish. The beef ribs were boiled in water without a doubt. Tender but the only flavor was the charred BBQ sauce. $85 is a fair price for a family of five. We will not return for another visit.

you want good BBQ, than Phil's is the place to be! My god, some of the best BBQ I have ever tasted and i know my way around a grill to say so. before i get into the greatness that is Phil's, let me say the negatives first (tho there are not many to be seen). the first thing that sticks out is the wait. more often than not, you will be waiting in line just to make your order. the line is always out the door and will round one of the corners. they do have signs saying how long you will need to wait at the point in the line you are at but that just makes me feel let down when it takes longer then posted.  by the time i order, i am so hungry; the waiting is excruciating. also, on really busy days, it can be hard to find seating; so there could be even more waiting. maybe this just really sticks out to me because i am a pretty impatient person. but there are so many saving graces to Phil's that make me give it 5 stars! now the good stuff. first and is merely a fun novelty but their is a webcam out of the front door that faces the line so a friend can log onto Phil's website and laugh at your ass waiting in line. fun for the person watching i guess. now onto the food and drinks. i usually have a pulled pork sandwich slathered with BBQ with a side of potato salad and french fries and this is the feast of champions. the BBQ sauce is truly the highest of high for phil's. i could drink this stuff, its so good! the pork is cooked just right, so its nice and sweet and tender. they grill the bun a bit to give it that crispy touch. the fries are cooked where they are crispy on the outside but warm and tender in the inside; with a little ketchup and i am set. the potato salad has big pieces of potato and the perfect amount of mayo to give it a rich taste. I always have a cup of sweetened raspberry tea and a large stack of napkins by my side, so by this point i am set for life! i could truly go on for days about the excellence that is phil's, but you really need to check this place out to believe. you should just stop reading this review now and get into your car and drive there. bring a book tho or a friend, because you will be waiting, but good things happen to those who wait!

Definitely good food.  It would be splitting hairs to say that this may not be 'true BBQ' because BBQ is a regional phenomenon and it varies depending where you are. Most true BBQ is cooked low and slow with plenty of smoke. Some places hit you hard with sauce and some places don't. Phil's food is very light on the smoke and heavy on the of sauce.  If you are a true BBQ fan from the Midwest or the south, your experience of BBQ may be very different. I like their food. Is it 'true BBQ'? Maybe not, but that doesn't mean it's bad. I can like Panda Express even though it's not 'true Chinese' and I can like Chipotle even though it's not 'true Mexican'. It is what it is and Phil's has good food no matter what you call it. Just temper your expectations. If you want true southern BBQ, don't expect it here.

The sauce at this joint is AMAZING. This slightly spicy, peppery and sweet mixture takes ribs and chicken to a whole new level! I had some sauce on my thumb and almost gnawed the short stubby digit off! Oh, and the onion rings are perfectly golden and crunchy. This place is a winner!

this is my first time visiting the place i heard from many of my friends that this place was THE place to go for some realll good bbq, ,definitely had to check it out the place outside looks like some chilis or something, didn't expect too much at first, but then i noticed the long line theres going to be a long line, but don't fear.. its kind of like a food court set up where you're in line to buy the food, and then you sit anywhere pretty much the prices are pretty reasonable, line seemed long but waited about 15-20 mins - food was very tasty, i recommend the baby back ribs, meat was very good but they don't give enough bbq sauce - the sweet baked beans its alright, i got the large size but they didn't really give me that much, its nothing too amazing just pretty ok - the fries are pretty good, you can cover them in tabasco, malt vinegar, and ketchup overall the place is good, great atmosphere, and prepare to get a little messy, they give you bibs to help you keep clean :) o yeah since its not a restaurant you dont have to tip~

I am usually not a big fan of bbq but man this place rocks! The wait was long on a Saturday night, about 45 minutes, but a game of categories can make that wait seem much shorter. The whole system of getting your own table does make it a little chaotic but this place is a cozy, elbows on the table type of place. The sides are good most of which contain mayo, but the one that stood out the most were the baked beans, so delish! The pulled bbq sandwich was amazing, so tender and just the right amount of bbq sauce (I recommend getting the cole slaw on the side). The baby back ribs were amazing, yes they were finger lickin good. We got amazing customer service and everyone just seemed friendly all around. Now I don't claim to be an expert on bbq, but it was good FOOD and I don't even like bbq all that much.

I don't know what people from Texas would think about this, but for a Californian eating at a California BBQ joint, this is incredible! The first thing you'll encounter when you walk up to the restaurant is the line. We came for dinner, and ended up waiting in line for about 40 minutes, but being a Disneyland annual passholder, it didn't feel all that long. The staff was very friendly; they would come out from time to time to greet us and thank us for coming. There's a reason the lines are so long--their food is just delicious! My wife and I shared an El Toro tri-tip sandwich, a baby back ribs and chicken combo, and a small order of onion rings. We ordered the macaroni salad and the baked beans as our combo sides. The El Toro is basically a mountain of tri-tip between a sandwich roll. The meat is so tender and juicy, and slathered in their delicious, tangy BBQ sauce. However, I didn't particularly like the roll, which ended up being kind of flat and chewy; I think a denser roll might hold up better, even though it might mean a heavier sandwich. I ended up just eating the tri-tip with a fork, and leaving the roll on the side. I don't order sandwiches for the bread, though; it's all about the meat for me! The baby-back ribs and chicken combo was amazing! The chicken was perfectly cooked--still moist and tender. The ribs were also fantastic! I bake my ribs at home, so I have pretty high expectations for ribs that "fall off the bone"; these ribs passed with flying colors! I also really liked their baked beans, which were sweet and tangy, and had a wonderful consistency--not watery or thin at all! I'm not big on macaroni salad in general, so I can't really judge this one, but my wife loved it; she was sad that she was too full to finish it. The onion rings were amazing! They use some huge onions for this, and the batter is delicious! Plus, you can always dip the rings in the BBQ sauce, which may be a little weird for those who prefer ranch or ketchup. I'm looking forward to coming back the next time I'm in San Diego!

I usually avoid getting ribs because I feel like it's a messy burnt fiasco with little meat to the bone and just all sauce.  But Phil's was a nice place to really change my outlook on ribs!  The sides are pretty good especially the beans onion rings fries!  Please go try it and you'll be a fan of ribs for life!

No question. If you are in San Diego and you love nice, meaty, tender ribs, then Phil's is THE place to go. My fiancee and I visit SD every few months and we always make it a point to visit Phil's. Without fail, and no matter what day of the week we go, there is always a line to order for dine-in. Always. My friends, it is worth the wait. If we are in a hurry, we order to go and eat in the parking lot, it is that good. I always order extra and take the rest home for a later snack. It is not normal for me to run across a bbq place that I feel compelled to rave about but this is definitely one of those (very few) places.

If you don't mind waiting for an hour and listening in on the loud, inane, conversations of sorority girls ("Like OMG that dress totally makes you look like a slut"), then Phil's is the way to go. I ended up getting the "best of both" rib and chicken dinner, which was tasty enough. But take heed! The heavy aroma/flavoring will slightly burn your eyes and your nose if you get too close to it (sue me, I like smelling my food).  I'm sure I could have gone with the half dinner and still have went away satisfied instead of ridiculously stuffed.  So yeah to sum it all up: it was a bit  overrated, but delicious enough.... nothing to rave about though. Oh... and leave your jackets at home if you don't want to smell like BBQ for a whole week.

This place is amazing. 100% worth the wait. The food is excellent, and I'm not just taking about the protein portion of the menu. The sides are excellent too. Which is often something that places can neglect, since the star is usually the meat. The ribs are excellent and their signature sauce is absolutely amazing....and you can even buy some to take home with you if you want! Everyone needs to experience Phil's BBQ when they come to San Diego. Hands down best BBQ I've ever come had

Eveyone says Phil's is great so I've been wanting to come here for awhile.  I was disappointed.  I was smart and called an order in to go.  When I got there the place was CRAZY!  The line did seem to move quite quickly for dine-in though.   I brought my food home and it was only ok especially for the price.  It was over $40 for only 3 meals.

Love it! Can't say anything more. The best ribs in SD. Now I can make ribs that fall off the bone better than these, but the sauce makes these worth going back again and again. Not only are the ribs good, but the chicken is also delicious. It is moist and succulent, I am getting hungry just thinking about it. Don't think just go. Sometimes there are long lines also. The trick is to phone in your order and eat there. No wait times, great.

Phil's doesn't bother with anything besides the food, which is perfect. You walk in, order at the counter, grab a seat and pick it up when it's ready and chow down. Haven't had a bad experience yet, just good BBQ and that's all I want.

These guys are awesome.  Disclaimer: I'm from CA and am told by many Texans etc. that I don't know good bbq.  Anyway, been here several times and loved it.  There is always a long line so I learned to call the order in and pick it up (then I go eat at the beach).  Last time I went I had to wait 20 minutes even though I phoned the order in early, and the manager noticed me waiting and had my order hurried, gave me a free order of HUGE onion rings, AND gave me a $20 gift card for my next visit.  I was so blown away by this professional, courteous service I think I'm hooked for life.  I always order the baby back rib dinner, love it love it love it.

The food was about 3 stars, probably not worth all of the hype [But then again, I moved to San Diego from Texas, so I'm used to some pretty badass BBQ]. Worth the 1hr+ wait? Not really ... But the service was excellent :] All the staff members were friendly, well-trained, well-behaved, and efficient. While waiting in the viciously long line, a staff member made sure there was a table available for us when we got inside. Sweet :] And when I sat down, even though the place is a pay-at-the-counter-and-pick-up kind of place, they had employees going around asking how everything was, providing us with napkins, utensils, offering drink refills, etc. Amazing customer service :] That goes well beyond the job-description of any fast food-casual place I've ever heard of. Love you guys! Oh, and the side portions are HUGE. Always get the 2 small sides instead of the 1 large side. The "small" sides are anything but small.

Phil's BBQ is amazing.  The best BBQ I have ever had.  Phil's has a very friendly, helpful, and courteous staff.  They have a nice menu selection and reasonable prices.  The place was designed very well and has a great atmosphere.  The only down side with Phil's is the wait, but it is worth it.  Hopefully they will build more locations soon!

I love the baby back ribs. Tender and juicy with the spectacular sauce. Fries are crispy and tasteful. Overall food taste was pleasant in my experience. The people there were very friendly with me, and even took the time to make small talk with me. Overall set up is a tad bit interesting. Bar separated from the actual dinning area. You have to find your own seat. The line wraps around the corner, with about a 20 minute wait on a Friday night. However, right before I left, the line died down and was barely out the door.

It is so very hard to find good BBQ, and I've looked. I've lived all around California and the only two places that I would classify as having "great" BBQ (well, technically grilled, but don't split hairs here) are Firestone's in SLO and Phil's. I seriously look forward to trips to Phil's like little kids look forward to trips to Disneyland. My friends and I plan them out and mark them on our calendar and count down the days. Nothing beats an extra big order of beef ribs, fries/onion rings/corn-on-the-cob, and a nice pitcher of Fat Tire or Red Trolley. It's the kind of meal you wake up in the middle of the night craving. When I'm out of town for any extended amount of time, it's the thing that brings me home, like some kind of meaty, grilled lighthouse. I don't know what kind of facts I can add that others haven't already mentioned. The line looks long but moves fast, but the bar is a good way to shortcut it -- you can grab any open seat without waiting in line, and order from the full menu. The line attendant is always great, though, and has the kind of personality that makes her seem like an old friend, even if it's the first time you've ever met her. The bussers are all friendly and attentive. Really, the worst part about going to Phil's is trying to decide what to order. Every time I tell myself I'm going to try something new, but inevitably I'm drawn back to those ribs because, really, how can anything possibly surpass them? Why mess with that?

We arrived at 5 pm thinking we would beat the dinner crowd. Almost. The sign outside that reads something to the effect "20 minutes and 49 seconds wait from this point" is about as true as it gets. Always crowded. I'm no BBQ aficionado, but I know what I like and I like Phil's chickless dinner, the ribs, and pulled pork sandwich, in addition to the sides and most importantly the bar. Yup, the watering hole has a killer selection of craft brews. The meat isn't as tender as places back in Birmingham or Atlanta, but it shines here on the left coast.

love the food here :) their potato salad is definitely my favorite side order! It goes well with their bbq, because it mellows out the tangy bbq flavor in your mouth with the creamy flavor. I just wish their bbq sauce was a bit more on the sweet side, instead of the VERY tangy bbq sauce, but i guess thats a preference issue. I always bring some leftovers home and sprinkle on some brown sugar on top...mmm then its absolute perfection. if you're planning to go on a weekend be willing to wait!! there will probably be a looong line wrapped around 3/4 of their building, but don't worry too much, even a line that long goes down in less than an hour. although it's mostly self serve here, the staff is very attentive and helpful.

Get ready for a long line and longer wait. But if you want BBQ, this is the place. I usually call ahead and order p/u. The staff is so nice and friendly and helpful that it throws one off.

If you are particular about your BBQ and you must insist that it's AWESOME, then head on over to Phil's BBQ because you will love it! There's a reason why it's always busy. The prices are appropriate for the portions and the staff are the coolest. Once you've had Phil's, you'll want to dine there again and again. Very addicting!

Wow, 1900 reviews, how could you go wrong?? Let me just preface this review by saying that hubby and I are by NO means granola eating folks. After 32 minute wait, we ordered the baby back and beef combos. Yummy!  However,  we were chugging gallons of water afterward. Which means they use msg or an INORDINATE amount of salt (no wonder it tastes so good!)   I would've given less stars, but staff was wonderful, environment enjoyable & prices reasonable (18 bucks for bb meal) I guess if you're in the area & can spare some time, it's worth a visit. But I would much rather go to Tulsa Rib Co in Orange. Delectable and not as much salt. Oh, and tulsa potatoes-yum. ps. If you don't want to wait the queue, you can go to the bar and see if they have enough stools for your party.  :) Enjoy!

Good eats at decent prices.  I do think that this restaurant is a bit over-hyped for what it really offers.  It can get busy and the long lines can be a headache if one isn't prepared for it.  Some of the staff can be overextended and uneasy with the stress associated with a hectic work environment such as Phil's BBQ but MOST of the staff are quite nice and helpful.  An OK place to go to if you want meaty foods...not a place to go to for salads (as I've experienced first hand lol).

I devoured the beefy ribs they were like to die for! OMG best thing ever. Explosion of great flavors in your mouth *yummmm I can't wait to come back here to order it again.

Phil's is the only restaurant where I would ever subject myself to the torture of an hour and half wait at peak dinner time just to get some food. The hype is real and the baby back ribs are hands down the best you'll get in San Diego. The ribs are fall-off-the-bone good and the bbq sauce is a mix of sweet/tangy/spicy. Don't bother getting anything else besides the baby backs. I've had the broham sandwich, the el toro, and the beef ribs and those were just okay. If you don't want to endure the long waits, try going on a weekday around 12:30pm-1:00pm or on a weeknight (not Friday) around 8:00-8:30pm. It's usually not crowded during those times. Saturday nights seem to be the craziest.

Each time I go to Phil's I can never stop the "hhhhhmmmmm"'s and the "yuuuuuummmm"s!! I usually order the baby back ribs. I love soaking it with malt vinegar and sprinkle with Cajun seasoning!!! Yum!! I can practically taste it now!!!  By itself, it is also very tasty and flavorful!! So tender, falls off the bone! Either way, with or without vinegar, Phil's baby back ribs is simply the best!!! Move over Lucille's, you are no where close!!!

My wife and I have been eating at Phil's BBQ since they first opened in Mission Hills and were still going to the new location. In fact we were there twice over the Fourth of July weekend. Their food is jammin the meat on the ribs pretty much fall off the bones. The sauce Phil's use is the best I have had in Sand Diego as a matter of fact the best BBQ in San Diego of all the places I have tried. There service is great even though their is waiting lines going out the door if you want to sit and eat there, but it can be worth it as many people will tell you. We like to call in for a take out so we don't have to wait. Enjoy

There may be better BBQ on the planet, but I don't know where it is. A few important things to know about Phil's 1) They are closed on Mondays, period. 2) They are closed in January so their employees can take a nice vacation (how cool is that for the employees?) 3) Weekends and evenings and any time there is some major event happening in San Diego like baseball or football games, and the place is packed. For that reason I recommend getting there early on a week night. Or, do what I do which is I phone in my order, pick it up and enjoy my Phil's in the comfort of my home. Note, if you phone the order in, you MUST take it out. They do not let phone orders eat in any longer. But eating in is worth it too. It is a great place to get together with a few friends and enjoy some good food. They have a bar too if you like alcohol with your BBQ. My personal favorite order is the full rack of baby-back pork ribs, fries and beans. Mmmmmmm-mmmmmm. Give it a try, you can't go wrong.

I went here on Memorial Day and the wait wasn't too long. I think we waited about 10-15 minutes to order. It was my first time going here so I was a bit surprised because it wasn't like the normal restaurant where you get seated and then order. Here you wait in line to order and then find your own seats. I love ribs so I got a whole stack and a "large" side dish. My "large" side dish was corn on the cob because they did not have mash potatoes. I took off a star because of the lack of mash potatoes. The corn was a little under-cooked too. The ribs here are delicious. They take reservations only if there's a lot of people. I heard the line is pretty long on the weekends.

The old place in mission hills had a cozy feel, while the new place has all the charm of an Olive Garden :( But...the food is the same, and that's what really counts.  Love the ribs and the pulled pork sammitch!   Fries are ok, macaroni salad and coleslaw are good.  Sauce is kinda sweet, but I think that's a good thing.  Plus, call in your order and wave as you breeze by all the suckers, er, people waiting in line.

OMG I can't wait to come back here for more! I'm not a big fan of ribs because most places don't know how to make it right. But Phil's know how to do it right. The baby back ribs are so tender and juicy just like how it should be! Plus their fantastic BBQ sauce is just off the hook. I tried some beefy ribs off my bf but I still like the pork one better. Their onion rings are such great compliments. They are homemade and oh-so good!! I love Phil's BBQ!!!

The time: Sunday Night The location: Phils BBQ in San Diego! The line: only about 30 minutes! It was Sunday night, after spending the previous days at Comic-Con, I was exhausted. My friends wanted to get Phils BBQ, I was in San Diego hanging out with my cousin, but i was tired.....sooooo tired. But he said it's probably the best place in San Diego, and after a quick glance a yelp, I decided to try it out bracing myself for the 45 minute wait time that would undoubtedly be waiting for me. So I wash my face, and head out. When we were there, the line was wrapped around the restaurant a little past the "from this point, the wait time is only 21 minutes and 14second" and i laughed  and breathed, "yeah right" to my cousin. But after meeting up with my two friends who were waiting in line already (score! but i think they just got there too, since we were nearly at the end of the line) and filling them in on what happened at the Con, it seemed like time was flying. [A side note: good friends, good conversations make time go by that much quicker] As we got in, I was surprised. It was a Carl's Jr-esque ordering system where you order, get a little beeper thing, have a seat, and wait for them to beep you to get your food. I don't know if this is a good thing or bad thing, I was just surprised. I was expecting to be waited on and such, ask what they recommended, etc etc.  However, the Carl's Jr ordering system worked to my favor. I was starving and tired - being waited on would have been much, much more time consuming. We ordered, sat down, and after a quick stop for some sweet tea at the soda machine, we were ready to go.. My cousin got the 3 bone beef rib meal, and I got the 7-8 bone baby back rib so we can share. As for sides, we got the french fries [GOOD], Sweet baked beans [I didn't enjoy this as much], and Corn on the Cob. I was disappointed with the corn, I was expecting a smoked/grilled corn, as It was a BBQ. It seemed like it was boiled, and quite mundane. But onto the meat - They used the same BBQ sauce for pork and beef, and I'm used to BBQ sauces that have some major HEAT to them, but it was mild, sweet, and tangy. They had a variety of hot sauces on the side at the table, but i generally don't like the flavor. I prefer it to be embedded in the BBQ sauce, either with crushed red pepper, chopped up habanero chili's, or something to spice it up - anything but hot sauce! For both pork and beef, the meat was tender and it was the "fall off the bone" you look for when you're doing ribs. As far as that goes, I have no complaints. It was delicious - 4 stars only because of the sides. I loveeee corn, and was looking forward to it and was sorely disappointed. Disappointment sucks. But my friend, Vicki V., said that the slaw side was AMAZING. I should have tried some, damn it. I don't eat  BBQ at a restaurant  that often, most of my BBQ excursions are through family BBQ's and vicariously through various food network shows. But I enjoyed the meats

Friendly staff while waiting in line who helped explain the process. The process is similar to a fast food restaurant you order then fill your drink and find a seat. We did not like that we found a seat and then were rudely asked to move because the table was meant for larger parties. The no saving tables policy in thrown out the window for larger groups, which makes it tough for a couple. The food was good.

My husband and I came here after seeing Phils showcased on Food Network's Triple D's.  Long line wrapped around the building...but moved smoothly.  It took about 30 minutes, then another 10 to wait for our food once we ordered.  The people working are SUPER nice.  We even got a free oatmeal cream pie just for moving to a different table when they wanted to combine two tables for a larger group.  The bus boys/staff were really helpful and attentive.  Only downfall was that we had too much food.  Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.  Luckily, we had a fridge and a microwave  in our hotel room and we were able to have ribs and chicken for breakfast the next morning.   Beef ribs were awesome... Chicken pieces were tender... Macaroni salad and Cole slaw were good... Onion rings were really good....and I don't even like onions. Will definitely return when I return to San diego.

Ok so I finally went to Phil's.  Co-workers, locals, and friends (not from SD) all have hyped this place up, so I figured I had to try it.  Of course it was very crowded so we phoned in our order and picked up.  Man these guys have their system down to a science.  The ordering, wait-line setup, and organization of this place is impeccable!  They even have a line-cam on their website to check out the wait before you get there.  So yah on to the food ... WoW!  So this is what BBQ is suppose to taste like.  I mean i'm no BBQ connoisseur but this had to be the best ribs I've had in my life.  When you have that inkling for ribs and you get some from those chain-joints, ok yah it tastes great and you go home happy to satisfy your craving, but man these are like, OMG what was I thinking before.  If you think you know ribs, BBQ, etc, then check this place out and see for yourself.  I'm sold and going back again and again.

Wow! A line around the building on a Wednesday at 5:30pm is a good sign.  With 3000+ reviews, there are only 2 additional things I think should be noted: The entire staff was so fantastic and very helpful in what might be considered organized chaos. Two Words: Woopie Pie!  Make sure you don't overlook this sweet treat among the ribs and slaw. Thanks Phils, our dinner was sublime!

I was visiting San Diego this past weekend for my birthday. The only reason I knew about Phil's was because it was literally right across the street from the hotel I was staying in. My bf, who is a huge BBQ fan, convinced me to have dinner there before we left. We knew it had to be good seeing the LONG line of people there every day! The line did take awhile but, once we were seated and ordered, the food came really quick. We got the beef ribs, baby back ribs, and chicken. WOW! There was so much food and it tasted as good as it looked!! The meat was so tender. Bf was in heaven. LOL. He says its some of the best BBQ he's had. The sides were good too. We had plenty of leftovers and left extremely satisfied. Staff was also very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be coming back if we are ever in SD again!

Good food at good prices... the only drawback its the 1+ hr wait! The babyback ribs were very good but the sauce was too strong, which takes away from the flavor of the meat. Overall a good place for BBQ, its just as fun and messy to eat (make sure you have plenty of napkins or paper towels) like the BBQ's at home without all the hassle and cleanup!

OK, I am from SD, not Texas or the deep south...so granted, I might NOT know what REAL BBQ is.  I will give you that.  Some of the reviewers are adamant that, based on some technicality of cooking techniques, Phil's is not real BBQ.  That is fine, I will give you that, if you really know your BBQ facts.  Whatever.  Never the less, it is still DAMN good!!  I think of any meat with BBQ sauce on it as "BBQ."  Sorry, but I think most San Diegans do, too.  I LOVE Phil's sauce - I have ordered it for purposes of get-togethers where we make our own meat at home and use their sauce for marinade, grilling, and dipping.   It is amazing and could make tree bark taste wonderful.   If you like meat and sauce (whatever kind it may technically be) - TRY it one night!  But - DO order by phone.  They are closed Mondays.

Phil's BBQ is by far one of the best! I give it 5-stars meaning, "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" This place is outstanding! They offer a ton of food, good beer selection, and amazing ribs! I always get a full rack with fries, and tend to order another half rack! It is definitely a place to eat when you feel like gorging! Be sure to wear stretchy waist pants here! Last time I was in, I spoke with Phil himself, and they are slowly looking at expanding. They had another restaurant, but decided to close it down for a possible remodel, when they opened this one up! They need to open one up in south OC! Great Ribs!!!!

What was I thinking ordering the chicken tickler my first time here? I should have ordered their ribs, but I wasn't that hungry and wanted something small and easy/quick to eat. The BBQ sauce that smothers the chicken is the perfect combo of sweet and tangy. I love how the french fries are both fat AND crispy! Usually, you'll get one or the other (fat and soggy or thin and crispy), but Phil's BBQ fries are the best of both worlds. Next time I'll try the ribs and be able to give a more comprehensive review!

What everyone always says you HAVE to try when you go to San Diego. Personally, I am NOT a fan of BBQ. So I went in with little to no expectations. And Phil's BBQ did not disappoint the expectations I did not have. I've been there twice now. The first time I got the Best of Both: Beefy Rib and Chicken Dinner. Second time I got the Best of Both: Baby Back Rib and Chicken Dinner. I will say, the chicken is great! A+ in my book for a BBQ chicken, the amazing Phil's BBQ sauce soaked into the skin and gave chicken great flavor. But for the Ribs, you are better off getting the sauce on the side (which you can order!) since they just bomb your huge plate with sauce. Portions are large and you'll more than likely end up taking some back home, if you order the dinner like me. They give you a lot of french fries if you get that on your plate. The sweet baked beans are great, since I love those (yum yum). Macaroni salad is also good. That's all the sides I've tried though. When I went the second time, I did get some onion rings. They were great with the BBQ sauce, but other than that, I think I prefer fast food onion rings. Unless you're getting a sandwich, or a smaller dinner, don't bother with the onion rings. And finally, here's a tip for all the yelpers. CALL IN YOUR ORDER! It will save you SO MUCH TIME! You can go for the experience of eating at Phil's but I hated the hour long wait I had to go through just to eat. If you don't call in [which you state the time you'll be coming to pick up], and you stand in line, make sure you're not hungry. Though there is a staff offering some french fries to the people in line. I guess that's a plus. Phils is a place you just have to go when you're in San Diego. But once is good enough. It's not a place I would personally eat at all the time.

Some of the best BBQ in SD!! try and go before you arte hungry though because the line wraps around the building!! This is a new location (about a year now) and is much bigger than the old location. The food is still good but for some reason tastes a little different now. I liked them better when they were in Mission Hills! Will be coming here over and over : )

I really don't know what the big deal is about this place. The ribs are good, but not great. I shared half a rack for 10 bucks and it was disappointingly small. 5 really small pieces for 10 bucks... and really weak sides. Got the potato salad and something else I forgot, but they were both bland and unappealing. The ribs are good, they fall off well, but I felt they should be a lot more tender for 20 bucks a rack. It I wasn't already stuffed from a tractor room lunch I would have left hungry, and I probably would have left hungry still with a full rack. The sides are just not worth getting, unless you get fries cuz they load that on like a mofo. Good bbq at steep prices to get yourself full.

Baby back ribs, my favorite. I come here with my mom and dad and all they ever give me are the bones. I'm sure the meat must be great because they have a line to get in all the time. I have gotten a taste of the onion rings, best in the west. Service is great , people are friendly, and you can get a table in the bar if it's real busy.

I don't think there's much more I can say about Phil's BBQ than what has already been said.  This place is THE go to for BBQ in San Diego.  Purists may contend that this place isn't "real" or "traditional" BBQ but I say if it tastes good to me, it's good.  I have to say, however, that the sauce is what makes the BBQ here so addictively delicious.  That's not to say that the meat is not cooked well.  I still get a good meat and smoke flavor from their BBQ.  But the sauce is where it's AT!  I took my gf here back when she was on the verge of being full on vegetarian.  This place ensured that will never happen again =)

It's no secret that this place has some of the best BBQ ribs that you will ever have no madder were you're from. I used to go here at least once a month during collage. Because everyone knows or has heard about how good this place it always takes too long to get food, get a seat. or a parking spot. I recommend ordering over the phone and getting it to go.

Accidentally got here 30 minutes before the place opened on a Sunday morning and I was sure glad we did.  By 11am when they opened, the line went out back into the parking lot.  Even though we were like the 5th group in line and didn't even wait all that much, the long line raised my expectations for this place.  I must say that although the baby back ribs were pretty good, I've had much better elsewhere.  Heck, I know some people that can Q up their own ribs better than Phil's.  Maybe it's just that I like eating ribs standing in someone's backyard with a cold beer in the other hand, but Phil's was just okay for me.  There's nothing unique about the food or worth spending more than 30 minutes to be seated.

Came here again for my friends birthday. They were pretty busy, so we decided to take it to go. When we got back to the house, we realized the birthday guy's dinner was not in the bag. I drove all the way back, explained the situation, but the manager told me it was never on the receipt so too bad. He could have used the opportunity to make up for missing the item in the big order the first time around, but he didn't.

Yelped this place weeks before a family trip to SoCal. My 3 sons are big BBQ fans. We had a fantastic meal. Wait outside was an hour but we were not in a rush and this was a must stop for us after we also saw it on  man vs food. Baby backs, pork shoulder sandwiches, everything smothered in Phil's signature sweet and vinegary sauce. Great stuff. And I got some good local beers from the bar which were perfect with this cuisine. Big sign in front read "more than 1,000 5 star yelp ratings". That's not bragging when the place is this good.

I'm sorry, before I talk about the BBQ...They have Fresca and Crystal Light fountain drinks (which taste better than regular Crystal Light IMO)!  To me that is just unheard of.  LOVE IT. The prices and portions are fair, I tend to get one of the 'smaller' plates.  I've had every meat they offer here...And yeah, they all taste the same to me.  But my favorite are the beef ribs. The sauce is more on the tangy side, than your traditional sweet, American BBQ.  I prefer this.  Their fries are good, and their side dishes are decent.

Driving from LA to San Diego, I kept thinking what would be a great BBQ place to eat at, to mark the end of summer? Luckily, I don't have to look further: across the street from our hotel was the famous (and packed) Phil's BBQ. How lucky we came right before dinner rush, and even then the line was long and getting ready to wrap around the corner. We ordered the Full Ribs (10-12 bones) and I thought they were too pricey at $18.99 (dinner price with 2 sides), but I have no regrets, it was so good! The ribs were so tender, once you sink your teeth on it everything just melts... The sauce is sweet and tangy with a little kick of heat, just perfect.  Too bad they have no brisket, but they have a full menu of sandwiches, chicken, and other extras. I have lived in Oklahoma and Texas, and let me tell you this place is it for BBQ. Can't wait to visit SD again soon!

yummy ribs. tender, slide right off that bone, moist. unfortunately they DROWN it in bbq sauce so maybe u should as for it on the side. ok so heres why it doesn't get the coveted 5 star.. so when u order a meal, u can get two small sides or one large side. i decided to get steam veggies, which only come as a large side. when i got it... dood there were so little!!! my friends all got coleslaw or fries or macaroni salad, and their plate was all full!! my veggies only accounted for the size of a small!!! i wasn't that happy, but i guess its ok cuz i wasn't that hungry. but i ended up eating all of it anyway. the prices are reasonable for the taste and portion. nice!

Ok, ok, so I'm not from the South or the Midwest. That being said, this is the best BBQ you will find anywhere within driving distance in San Diego. There are long lines if you walk up to order. The trick around this is to go to the bar and order from there. Usually no wait and they will serve you within 15 minutes after giving you a pitcher of tasty beer.

The prices are a little high i think for what you are getting, but its still worth it. I really like the sandwiches and the french fries.  Dont go here is you are on a diet or going to be counting calories and looking for healthy. this is some good old fashion bbq! Try to know what you want before getting up to the register too. Laste time i was there i wasnt ready and they werent very happy because the place was packed. Whoops!

It is a great place to go for watching sports with the guys, or to have a nice family dinner. But honestly, dont get me wrong i love all sorts of meat dishes, the wait here is a big turn off for this joint, and the ribs are sometimes overly burnt to mask the flavor of the meat. the food is good but not to the point of waiting 45 min to order, and then fighting to find a spot. But everyone else likes it so ... give it a try...

Negatives: 1. HUGE LINE = LONG LONG LONG WAIT. They have signs like at disneyland to tell you how long the wait is from that position. Sorry, no fastpasses. Positives: 1. Best BBQ I've ever tasted. This is some smoky, tangy, fall off the bone, finger licking goodness. I only tried the pork ribs, but they were AMAZING. 2. They give you a TON of food. You will leave with a bulging stomach and a doggie bag. 3. Huge amount of seating! If you got a big party, they let one person reserve one of the bigger tables until you reach the front of the line. 4. Hospitality is fabulous! Everyone is very friendly, they ask you if you need anything and start up conversations. These guys deserve a big tip. 5. Food comes out fast! Once you've stood in that 45+ min line, youre hungry! But about 10-15mins after you order, you're set to dig in! 6. There's a handwashing station and bibs. Good ribs = BIG MESS. You're bound to get all sticky and messy, but don't worry; they provide everything you need to leave clean and satisfied. 7. Cheap for the quantity and quality. When I go to somewhere like Lucille's I get less ribs for a much higher price. I was surprised it was so cheap at Phil's and tasted better too!

Best BBQ in the world? Hmmm I dont know...but it sure is the best BBQ Ive ever had. Me and my S.O. and our 3 month old son were out in SD over Labor Day weekend and couldnt figure out what to have for dinner. He immediately suggested that we go on the Travel Channel website to see if there were any places around that we MUST try out. Soon enough we bumped into a recent tv segment of 'Must Eats: San Diego' and we were directed this way. Of course, being the loyal Yelper that i am i went on http://yelp.com and typed in the place, just to discover that it had tons of 5 star reviews...quickly we jumped in our car with baby and all and drove a few minutes (thank god our hotel was super close  **look for a homewood suites by Hilton review from me after this he he) Anyway, so here we are driving super amped to check out/find out what all the fuzz is about...we pull up and OH EM GEE! All of San Diego must have been there that night....it was ridiculously packed...the line must have gone around the restaurant like twice...they have these signs like at Disneyland that tells you what your expected wait time in line is. Anyway...super bummed we drive away from the place thinkin oh hell no, we cant wait to eat till midnight, we are starving, and just headed towards Red Lobster (ugh right?). As we were convincing ourselves to just eat at Red Lobster and make the best outta of it...i thought to myself 'hmm i wonder if they do carry out' BAM! i call and yup, they do carry out and its only a 15min wait!!!...God is great! i placed my order hung out in the parking lot for a few and then walked in to pick up what is now the best BBQ we have ever had. Tender, fall of the bone meat. Best Onion rings ever...the fried batter literally melts in your mouth. its a MUST TRY!

The food here is yummy, and the staff is super friendly.  For the entrees, we ordered the baby back ribs, beef ribs, bbq chicken, and El Toro.  All the meat items were smokey and delicious.  For the sides, we ordered the coleslaw, french fries, colossal onion rings, and veggies.  The coleslaw was one of the best I have had.  The colossal onion rings were possibly the best I've ever had...perfectly crispy and not over cooked.    The french fries were not as crispy as I would like.  Our only complaint is that the meats are over sauced.  I think that the flavor of the meats should speak for itself.  I will remember to ask for the sauce on the side next time.

Phil's is kind of played out. Yea its good, not great. The line is long, but usually moves quick. Service is friendly and runs with east coast efficiency but quality has slid a little each time I've returned. Still a huge fan of the paper towel roll at the tables. That is key. I'll be back, just with less enthusiasm this time.

if you think Phil's BBQ is the best, you really need to go out and try different BBQ spots. there are plenty in san diego. travel out to the OC and you'll find even more. the "hype" that this place has is ridiculous. i mean, food is alright. everything tastes the same. i'm not really a fan but i don't mind showing up if a few friends to grab some lunch.

Oh. My. God. This place has the BEST ribs ever! I don't even understand how it could be so good. Not only are the ribs big and meaty, but the are cooked and flavored to perfection. Even their onion rings were cooked perfectly It's a pet peeve of mine when the onion slides out after one bite, but these onion rings were awesome. Only downside is that there were too many onion rings and I couldn't finish! This place was definitely worth the wait. I hope to make it a habit to eat here whenever I'm in San Diego.

Phil's BBQ is a really nice place to eat at because they play just about every sports game that is going on during that time.  You have to try to find a table to sit at first.  The ribs are really moist and fall right off the bone and the bbq rings are really big!  I would recommend this place to anyone who loves bbq food!

An order here of ribs and sides is about $12-13 dollars, and their portions are HUGE. I actually finished all of my food, but would have been full with just eating about half of it. This place is crowded, the line almost wraps around one side of the restaurant, but it goes relatively quickly for how many people there are. You order and pay, and seat yourself (the staff seated us though). I would definitely come by again for my bbq fix or to show my friends from out of town around :)

I was born and raised in the South and Phils is still the best BBQ I've ever had.  This is not a restaurant experience so there are no servers, but even though the lines are ALWAYS long, you generally can get in within 20-30 minutes and have your food.  Its well worth the wait.  The rib meat falls off the bone its so soft and the sauce is impeccable.

on vaca in socal and making my way thru the town one meal at a time. This place got so may raves wit their whole web cam to check out the line and such that had to make it a stop on my list.The meat was tender and tasty. The service (i sat at the car) was good. For west coast, it was pretty decent bbq. The sauce could be sweeter and thicker. The beans more homemade. The macaroni salad was nice. Overall a good experience but i've had better. Oh yeah...good sangria!!!

Ok, we love us some Phil's. My last experience kind of put a damper on my opinion of the place, but here's why. For some reason, business has really been BOOMING for them--which is great. But I'm not really all up for standing in line for bbq for 45 minutes. My husband and I usually sit in the bar..the bar area has a big bar, and lots of seating around it. Now, when we went about a year ago, we found out via the bartender that if you sit AT the bar, you have to order your food from the bartender. Back in the day (like..2 years ago) you could only get drinks from the bartender, and still had to stand in the regular line for your food--the buzzer would go off, and you could bring your food back to the bar. So, we followed old procedure just to be scolded by the bartender. He said if you're sitting anywhere in the BAR AREA, you must now order your food from them. This was OK by us because this meant we by-passed the huge line, and got some tasty beer. Woohoo! Well, we chose Phil's (based on this new bar policy) to take our parents to for my "last meal" before having our baby boy (and I mean literally right BEFORE--the night before!). So, we secure a table in the bar area, get our order together and go to the bartender to place our order..only for him to tell us that we can't place our order with him unless we're sitting AT THE BAR. Really? Phil, make a rule and stick to it. So, my almost-10-month-pregnant self secured a seat at the bar. After I waited 10 minutes for the bartender to come over (another pity taking patron hollered at him for me) I placed an order for 5 people. The bartender actually had the nerve to ask me if I thought I was "above the rules" since I should be "standing in line" (this was after we'd been sitting at the table for 15 minutes.) I was INFURIATED. I just placed an order for $75 worth in food plus 4 beers..and he was asking me if I was above the rules? You know what, in this situation  YES because a) the "rules" of ordering in the bar are constantly changing (which I explained to him) and b) bartender, why the hell are you complaining? would you rather make a tip off of 4 beers, or 4 beers plus 5 meals? We haven't been back since, but since we're moving out of the area I assume the hubby will want to pay a visit. Also--the sauce they sell at costco--don't waste your money. Not as good as the sauce they put on their meals in the restaurant.

Never had BBQ like this before! Phil's is definitely the best of the best.  Although the line gets a bit too long and the wait line takes a min 45min to hour, it's well worth the wait.  My suggestion... call and order then pick up.

I am a long time fan of Phil's BBQ!  An incredible business and incredible food.  Phil's is derserving of five stars with one exception.  My office orders Phil's BBQ delivered through their catering office for company lunches at least once per month. The delivery is approximatly 9 miles and Mapquest indicates the commute as 12 minutes. The mimimum purchase order for delivery is $200.  Each time that we have Phil's deliverd there is a $35 delivery fee.  With the minimum of a $200 order and the frequency of orders from my office, I feel the delivery fee is excessive.

I'm not gonna lie, I like Phil's BBQ.  (BBQ broham w/ the slaw on the sandwich)  But you'd have to be a masochist to 'dine in' here.  The line is usually an hour long.  If I had to wait that long, I'd probably gnaw my arm off out of hunger.  Is it good?  Yes!  Is it wait 45 min good?  Well...shit maybe.  The point is, you can enjoy all the phil's goodness you want with a fraction of the wait.  Just order take out like I do.  I don't think I've ever waited more than 15 minutes for my order.

I wasn't a big fan of Phil's BBQ, I don't think it really lived up to the hype my friends and the yelp reviewers gave it. To begin with I didn't like that you  have to find your own seating, the place was super crowded & I had to stalk people who were almost done with there food just so I could steal their table. Next because its so crowded you feel guilty to spending any longer than you have to at your table so another party can finally find a seat. The BBQ was delicious but I think their sauce was lacking, you can't have good BBQ if your sauce if missing that key element. Sorry Phil's I don't think your BBQ is worth that long wait.

This place was so yummy! i ordered the quarter rack of ribs, a side of grilled corn and a grilled chicken salad. and it was all AWESOME!! the meat fell off of the ribs and it was still juicy and flavorful...not dried out like some places.  I thought the salad was going to be small but it was a generous portion as well and the chicken was cooked perfectly, nothing worse than a dried out piece of chicken *yuck*  We ate around 4pm so luckily we got there before the dinner rush.  Service was friendly and fast and we got our food without waiting too long.  Definitely need to come back here and try out the other stuff they have.

Wow this place was amazing. Reasonable prices, excellent food, plenty of seating, and an attentive and helpful staff. The ribs were really really really good. My entire experience here, from the time I walked in the door, placed my order, received my food (very very quickly) and took a seat, was just great. And they're open pretty late. I went maybe an hour or so before closing time, and all the employees were still cheerful and gave great recommendations. And the food...I always thought no one could compete with my mom's barbeque ribs, but Phil's is definitely in the running. Next time I'm in San Diego, I'll definitely be back.

The line is always ridiculous and the prices are semi-expensive. While their food is good, as well as their service, it isn't something to write home about or wait in that long line every single time I want BBQ. Also, they don't have brisket :( I thought that was a must have for BBQ places too...

Phil's BBQ is probably as good as it gets in San Diego. As everyone has already indicated, the wait time can extend to an hour and a half depending on the crowd. Their markers (e.g. "45 minutes from this sign") are fairly accurate and probably have something to do with their live cam feed online. It's no doubt that Phil's has done their homework. Onto the food! Phil's BBQ focuses more on the sauce-based BBQ marination process than the dry-rub. Their baby back ribs are quite tasty and their beef ribs are definitely worth the four bucks a rib price. I ended up grabbing the Baby Back Ribs & Chicken combination (4 bones and 1/4 chicken BBQ'd) since I couldn't decide which BBQ item to try out and ordered several beef ribs on the side. In my opinion, both the baby back and the beef ribs had a good amount of flavor and both were tender (meat falling of the bone effect). Beef ribs, for obvious thickness and size reasons, provide more filling than the baby back ribs. The carby sides are normal. The corn is rather tasty and the fried delights (fresh cut fries) are always pleasing. The sweet baked beans provide extra filling and the macaroni salad is on par. Service and Ordering. After ordering and paying for your food at the register, a waiter/waitress will direct you to an open table. There's no need to share tables at this location. There are actually two sections of the restaurant; one of which is the bar and the other being the restaurant. The bar side still has a couple booths for seating, so it's not a pure "bar" on the bar side. Service is pretty on par and exudes a bit of Southern hospitality, which probably depends on your service person. Brilliant Ideas. The one that stuck out was the placement of large sinks in the back area of the of the main restaurant commons. Plenty of soap, water, and paper towels to wipe off the BBQ goodness off of your hands and face. This allows the restaurant restroom doors and utilities to be a lot cleaner than say... Boiling Crab. Things I wish they had... Macaroni and Cheese, sweet potato fries, sweet tea, dry rub BBQ beef ribs. I've had my share Texas and Southern BBQ and have lived out there for years, so the taste buds have been exposed to too much BBQ goodness. Would I go back to Phil's? Of course I would. I would even go with a random group of strangers just to get my BBQ fix.

I know so many people love this place and are going to be irritated by this review, but this place is serving doggie chow with BBQ sauce on it.  For six dollars you can get a pulled pork sandwich that is so chewy it will last you til dinner time! And then, if you have nothing better to do for the rest of the day, that's ok too bc you will need the time to sit on the can and relieve the terrible stomach ache it gives you.  I must be a glutton for punishment bc I tried this dive twice.....it was worse the second time!

For CHRISTMAS my parents asked me to get them PHIL'S BBQ- and they live in ARIZONA! They wanted me to PICK IT UP and FREEZE IT and DRIVE IT 6 hours to them in Tucson! They even called up Phil's to get their holiday schedule. NO JOKE! The ribs are THAT GOOD!! The sides are delicious too- I recommend the macaroni salad and the onion donuts, I mean onion rings. I text my parents every time I go there- to make them jealous, maybe.. Or maybe just to let them know I'm getting some delicious BBQ! FYI- They are closed on Mondays and be ready to wait in a line... but besides that get your stretchy pants on and get ready to EAT!

So I was working and overheard some of my coworkers talking about Phils BBQ in San Diego. "it is a MUST try if you ever go into the area" The service is amazing! very nice people and a really good environment! We witness the long line at phils and the workers are kindly enough to go around the line with a tray of fresh french fries and their own bbq sauce! that was a awesome teaser treat!  As we got in the door, we were help by David who was a awesome cashier, we told him it was our first time and what was the best and favorite item they had. He told us about the baby back ribs, so we got that BEST ribs falls off the bone .  The bbq chicken(WHITE MEAT), that was juicy! BBQ broham which is a classic pulled pork with coleslaw on the side(veryyyy filling) and the amazing el toro!(these are tri-tip and they dont know when to stop with the meat! which is amaing! its enough to make 2 sandwiches!VERY SMOKEY flavor yumm  overall, it was a good experience, VERY good food, great service and the place is clean! THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT THIS PLACE IS ITS TOO FAR FROM US :(

Phil's BBQ is where I go on my birthday. That's what Phil's is to me. The night I can go anywhere and do whatever I want; all I really want is to go to Phils and get a 1/2 rack of the Beefy Ribs. And if it's your birthday you can cut the line as long as you are on their email list. They don't even really email me anything else except on my birthday. And they have so much to be proud of. I wouldn't mind if they emailed me other times. Since there are 2000+ reviews about Phil's already, all I'll say is that this is where I go on my birthday. Think about that on your birthday.

Portions are huge and the line is long but does that mean they serve good BBQ meat or just good BBQ sauce? This is the question I've pondered for awhile now. Don't get me wrong, I love their baby back ribs, and I have eaten here close to 30 times but I keep asking myself what brings me back? Is it the super cold beer or the tasty BBQ sauce? To me truly good BBQ needs no extra sauce added after the meat is done cooking, and sadly, Phil's fails this test. I find myself asking for extra sauce on the side to drown the meat in because frankly, without the sauce, their meat is tasteless. I love their sweet, tangy with a late kick of heat BBQ sauce. I know people will say that BBQ sauce makes the BBQ; that maybe true but good BBQ needs no extra sauce and should stand on its own. Call me saucy, but I could eat their sauce by itself. The fact that they are making it harder to get into the bar(bypassing the stupidly long line) to order is really starting to piss me off. If it wasn't for the extra cold beer I would just call my order in. ciao

All I have to say is El Toro, this delicious sandwich is a  char-grilled deli sliced tri-tip topped with their flavorful BBQ sauce. Make sure you grab extra napkins eating this thing, one of my favorite sandwiches but my only gripe is this place is always packed don't expect to get in and out quick even if you call ahead. I can't complain because once you check in they start to make your food so it's always hot, fresh and tasty. So far have not had a better real  BBQ joints in SD it's like BBQ crack, get ready to get your hands dirty eating here. How about open more locations Phil?

I went to Phil's BBQ on a Sunday night (8:00 pm) and waited about an hour and 30 mins. I have never waited that long before to get food. I wanted to know what the hype was all about...my friend has been talking about this place even a year before I moved to San Diego, so when she came to visit I just had to come here...when our group was finally seated (9:30 pm) there was no more line outside, so if you don't want to wait come late. Overall, it was worth the wait and I will come  back again when it's not so busy... so here is what I ordered: onion rings, half rack of baby back ribs with two small sides of macaroni salad and coleslaw. I also had a few bites of the bbq chicken, baked beans and potato salad. Colossal beer battered onion rings: they were soooo good...the best I have ever had ;D My favorite of all the dishes..crispy..my mouth is salivating as we speak..a must get!! Baby back ribs: This was good too..the meat was so tender that it fell off the bones, bbq sauce was good but not the best I have had. A little on the sweeter side and not enough spiciness for me Coleslaw: definitively not my favorite of all the dishes and if I come back I will not order it again. Baked beans: I was debating between this and mac salad. So I had the boyfriend order it hehe. I regret not ordering this though because it was sooo good!!! I will order this next time BBQ chicken: on the dry side Potato salad and macaroni salad were delicious!! But I prefer the potato salad, it was different and was super chunky *Small sides are huge and will be more than enough

The onion rings with ranch dressing are to die for! Baby back ribs are excellent. Had to knock off a star because the last 3 times I went there, they put way too much sauce on the ribs. If you don't like spicy food, the sauce might be too much. I personally like the new location in Vista better. Same food, nicer area, and shorter wait on the weekend than the Sports Arena location.

I would give 3 and a half stars if I could because this place isn't just A-OK place. It is better than that. BUT, I must say it isn't THAT good either. I tried this place with a friend of mine a couple of days ago just to see if all these ridiculously good reviews were right. The verdict is...........my friend and I both said.......... "it's good, but it's not THAT good". But this place definitely deserves more than 3 star so I give 3 and a half. Like mane reviewers say, "GET THERE EARLY" because you will end up waiting on line for sure. Oh, I almost forgot to add: their coleslaw is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YUCK.

This is the place to go. Inexpensive and the food is sooooo good- I could eat here every night! We live in Carlsbad, but drive down to Point Loma biweekly just to go to Phils. Try to go early because there is always a line wrapped around the building. The service is wonderful- the food is fast and you cannot beat their baby back ribs with macaroni salad, or their Broham (Pulled Pork) Sandwich which is amazing (and under $7). Their Onion rings are phenomenal. Okay... I am drooling now....

I phoned in the order and was told that there would be a 15-20 minute wait once I actually arrived and paid (WTF?). I arrived about 7:30pm on a Saturday. There must have been two hundred people in line!! After navigating through the crowd, I made it to the "phone order" line. Unfortunately, this is the "order to go" line also. Luckily, they have a guy walking through the line with a hand held electronic gizmo asking who has phone orders. He alerts the kitchen that you are there. After paying, the food was ready in under 5 minutes. Pretty slick service given the enormous crowd. The food was good, but suffered from "take home syndrome", fries soggy, not any extra BBQ sauce. I look forward to eating in and seeing how good it really is. Maybe someday when I have half a day to burn!

This is my third time at Phil's and I was hoping for better.  I gave them three chances, but I was woefully disappointed. Here goes---Heresy,  I really loathe what Phil's calls BBQ. I've had the BBQ chicken-  dry.  bone dry.  It tasted like chicken, but it was dry.  Dry as the Sahara... please give me water dry. I've had the chicken breast BBQ sandwich-also dry..It was better than the dinner, at least it wasn't dry, but that could be because I put the slaw on the sandwich. Not to mention the exorbitant cost for a dollop of food.  That being said, I can live with the cost, if I can get taste for my return. Now for the third data point,  I had the Turkey BBQ sandwich...drum roll please...my worst experience yet.   A table of 5 people.  Everybody else ordered the pork or beef rib dinner.  I ordered the turkey bbq sandwich.  I was third in line of our group.  Not only did I get served dead last, I got served when everybody else was about 75% done with their meal ( 5 more minutes and I was going to ask for a refund---that's how bad my wait was).  Talk about awkward.  And, the turkey tasted like cardboard, or for what passed as turkey anyway.   I told the guy who spearheaded the push for Phil's in our group, that I've not experienced a good dining experience there.  He couldn't fathom why.  He loves the joint.  After my wait and my making him taste my "sandwich", he now, begrudgingly, knows why. What sauce was on the meat was spotty at best.  I almost put my glasses on to find it.  The cheese was a square of Vons caliber prefab, rip the cellophane off, cheese.  My G-D, was that the turkey patty offensive.  Yes, offensive.  I couldn't believe I actually paid for that sh_t.  I'm sure the inmates at Donovan, tasted better.  Like I state earlier, I made the "leader" of our group taste my meal, so he can realize why I no longer want to eat there.  To his credit, he agreed with me and said he was sorry.  The other fowl eater in our group, also had the same issues, but I won't write his review. If you are a Buddhist monk looking for a fun time out while fasting, please feel free to eat the turkey bbq sandwich, it does NOT resemble meat, nor anything that was living for that matter. Phil,  I will never eat there again (the leader of our group will eat there again, so don't feel pinched). I gave you three chances.  Maybe you are a two trick pony-  beef and pork, and fowl is not in your wheelhouse, because what you laughingly call fowl, I call foul.   I miss Fat Ivors. My wife and I literally plan trips around Smokin' Mo's BBQ in Chico and Pismo Beach.  The cost of travel and the long wait between vacations is worth it to NOT EAT AT PHIL'S ever again. P.S.  just in case you think I'm BSing, Phil, my ticket was 345 around 1300 on 2010, Nov. 11.  Good riddance.

The wait was a bit long during both lunch and dinner time but this place is always super crowded so it is expected.    Has got to be the best BBQ place here in the SD area (and it has been echoed by a lot of people).   I always go for the BBQ chicken and the atmosphere is a nice homey kind of feeling.   Make sure to not wear super nice clothes unless you wanna chance getting sauce on it.

Vegetarians, please look away now. Phil's BBQ is arguably the best barbecue in San Diego.  The city's not known for its BBQ, and I've never been to a place like Kansas City where it might indeed surpass Phil's; but so far it's the best I've ever had. Getting there is like getting into a Disneyland ride.  As you walk in, you look up and there's a sign saying "21 minutes from this point on."  The sign is unchangeable, and there was no line, so big breath of relief. Inside, a lady sits in front of two lines (one a pick-up to go and the other eat-in), asks you how many, and points you to a register.  "Did I SAY you could cross the line?" she asks, pointing to the line in the cement floor.  "No.  Now go." I was grateful to her, as otherwise people would have been stuck in one spot, drooling, unaware of the open registers. I got the pulled pork with coleslaw and hubby got basically roast beef, forgot the name.  We each ordered a small fry, which is HUGE and filled up two plates.   At the next table, a man with his buddy got his ribs and they gleefully shouted, "Holy S&^!" like two teenagers, confronted with the mounds of meat.  Joy prevailed all over the restaurant as everyone stuffed their gullets. I loved my generous pulled pork slathered in tangy BBQ sauce with the crunch and cream of the coleslaw underneath; hubby loved his beef; we didn't even think to share or sample the others'. The buns were perfect.  Not greasy, not too filling (it would distract from the meat!)  I also got beans, which were piping hot and had a hint of smoke.Service was quick (we went at 1; there's a huge line earlier).  Paper towel rolls are at each table; wet naps provided.  Awesome.

He's a Keeper! There's a guy your parents would approve of. Anyone that can open up a BBQ joint, name it after themselves and have 4.5 stars rating on yelp has got to have some big huveos. Seriously, I would have never in a million years eating a BBQ joint called "Phil's BBQ" if it wasn't for my trusted food junkie Adam Richman from Man vs. Food. My fiancé and I have passed this place a couple times but the long lines always turned me away to other local eateries. But 2 weeks ago, I was the early bird. I got to the restaurant at about 11:20 AM to get my eat on. Less than 10 minute wait, which was tolerable for my fat face. I stocked up on food as if the Armageddon was coming tomorrow. The Beef Rib dinner + the El Toro sandwich. Yes, it was a big man's order, but it wasn't all for me. I ate half of the sandwich... a piece of the beef rib... some fries... all of the mac salad... and I was stuffed. I wrapped the remaining, with love, for my fiancé to try. Come to think of it, I spent 20 bucks on this meal... but I managed to squeeze 5 meals out of it. Not bad. I'm giving this place 4 stars, instead of 5, because of the ridiculous lines. A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures.

wooohooooo! i convinced my bf to come down here after disneyland to try the BBQ, and maybe go around san diego. we came around 1130am on a wednesday, and can already see a line forming out the door, luckily it wasn't as bad as we thought. parking was easy, and i didn't know the place was that big. we ordered the full rack of baby back ribs dinner with two sides- the ribs were SO GOOOOOOD, juicy, saucy, and even the "dry looking white areas" had flavor..if anyone understood that. my bf whose a bbq junky LOVED it. we got the potato salad and coleslaw, the potato salad was good, actual big chunks of potatoes with good flavor. the coleslaw was good, but im not a fan of horse radish, so it was a little hard for me to eat. still good though and the broham (pulled pork sandwich)- same coleslaw in it i believe, and the pulled pork was tender, soft ,and tasty. we bought the phil's bbq sauce bottles, 2 for 10.95 i think, also available at SD costco LOL. definitely great BBQ and we were quite content with how much we had. we would have ordered more to take to-go, but we thought it'd be better to leave it, too much of a good thing is not always good. haha (that just means we'll be coming back!) there's a sign that says you can't save seats while your party is still waiting in line, but no worries, i think people move around pretty quick, so you can get a table...but i did come at a "slower" time, lucky me!

Lawdy lawd!  Sorry, Everett and Jones and Lucille's, but you guys have been dethroned.  The beef ribs here are big and flavorful.  The meat just falls off the bone.  The bbq sauce has that homemade tang unlike a lot of other bbq joints that tweak a bottled sauce to make it their own.  The baked beans are pretty decent, too.  A must when you're in SD.  Leave the vegans at home.

AMAZING! I got here to meet up with family and the line was already out the door at 4:30. So you get in line with your party and order once you get to the front. See the thing about this place is you are bound to have a great time and want to come back for more within the next two weeks. We did not have to wait for a long time at all. It took about 10-15 minutes, if that. Everyone working there had such great attitudes. You can call in and get your order to be picked up so you don't have to wait in the long time since around 6-6:30 it's wrapped around the building and would take about 40+ minutes or something...never happened to me but I'm thinking it would take about that long. ( don't quote me on that) I'd suggest going here if you want to experience great BBQ and a lot of it. The prices are not bad, it shows in the amount of food you get, trust me on that. Go here and have a great time, just get there around 4 so there won't be a long line. Enjoy :)

4.5 Stars rounded down only because I tend to round down. I was happy after eating from here =D Our wait wasn't tediously long so no complaints here. I usually come when there's no line so this kind of surprised me. There are benches that wrap along the restaurant so some people in your group can sit while you wait in line. Our food came pretty quick and there people there were attentive to all of the people sitting in the patio (where we had a table). Generous portions! I got a baby back rib tickler and that "tickler" was enough to fill me up (all of it). I got four pieces versus the three I'm supposed to get so I was a happy camper. The baby back ribs were goooood except not every piece for me was tender off the bone (maybe that's why I got an extra piece). That wasn't that big of a hindrance for me--it was still delicious. The tangy-ness of the sauce is something I love. The sauce is more tangy than sweet. The onion rings were MASSIVE and crunchy (I rather have had them a little softer). Two of them were definitely more than enough. I'm a fan of coleslaw and liked their coleslaw. I'm not a fan of salty foods and the fries were perfect for me. I felt like it was a good balance of food. My friends rave about their macaroni so maybe I'll try that next time.

i think that it's genius to have a little spot just to wash your hands without having to step inside a restroom. as a germaphobe, i found it wonderfully terrific to see an automatic faucet and an automatic paper towel dispenser waiting for me to abuse it right before i attacked phil's ribs. i went here in august '05 and i've been craving for ribs ever since. i thought sizzler could help me satisfy my needs...what in the hell was i thinking to even consider sizzler? anyway, i wish that i never washed my hands after my meal so i could keep the smell of phil's ribs with me where ever i go.

this place is HELLA good. now that i'm back in the bay... i miss phil's. yes, it's worth the wait. even better... call in and wait the time at your place, then go in. i love their bbq chicken and pork riblet thingies. i think i would die of a heart attack if i ate this over and over... but it'd be worth it.  their sauce is sweet and spicy. mmmm. i'm drooling thinking about it. let's put it this way. my boyfriend had the worst day of his life at work. so i surprised him with phil's take out... and i am now (and will always be) the best girlfriend ever... and he forgot about all of his problems. phil's just does that. it's like a drug. another time i went i played dominoes with my friends. best thing about that? we had at least four double 6's in our set. the dominoes didn't match up and it made the game that much more fun. and messy. nothing like bbq sauce all over your pieces. sooo good. phil's is hella good. ps. i like my vegetables steamed well... so that they aren't super cruncy. their vegetables are crunchy. just a little disclaimer for people as picky as i am.

It's been said that you shouldn't take a date to eat barbeque ribs. For Phil's, I think I'd make an exception. A date is just another excuse to eat at Phil's and any reason to eat there is a good one. The ribs, both pork and beef, are better than any I've had. They're tender, juicy, savory, and just a bit spicy. The food is messy, for sure, so I can't help but feel just a bit barbaric tearing into them with my hands and teeth. Adding to the feeling is the fact that the full rack of beef ribs looks like it might have come straight from the opening of The Flintstones. As the wait can be upwards of an hour from the time you order on a busy night, my advice is to call in the order before you arrive.

It is so good, I'm not a big fan of ribs or bbq , it's just ok,but Phils BBQ rocks! I visited this place and it's pretty crowded, the place is nice too. I got this for 'to go' and had to go back to LA and had to wait for 2-3 hours to eat the Phils, but yet it still tastes yummy! It is so cheap , I bought it like for 5 persons , it costs only 46 bucks. The parking space is free. In some specific days you might need to get in the line though.Keep that in mind.

This place is amazing!!!!!! my co worker always talks about this place,but since I live in Los Angeles, its a long drive to go. three weeks ago we planned a trip to sd to watch the angels padres game and we finally had the chance to go!! the line was long, out the restaurant and around the corner, this place must be really good i thought. i think we waited for about 40 minutes. i ordered the "el toro" sandwhich which is tri tip, my wife ordered the baby back ribs. the taste was awesome, like nothing i had before. they put a little too much sauce on mine which was okay but i wanted to taste more of the tri tip then anything. i also felt that it needed some coleslaw just to add a different texture but all in all it was delicious!!! we also ordered the onions rings (amazing!) with their homemade ranch/buttermilk. we loved this place so MUCH we drove down there the following week  (this weekend)  just for the food!!!! lol and we even ordered some to go plus bought some of their famous bbq sauce!!!

I looooooooove the smell of bbq as you park your car and walk towards phil's.  I would have to say it's one of my favorite smells.  Definitely get the rib tickler....ribs, slaw (which I never ate until I tried it here), fries and onion rings.  I prefer the ribs because the chicken is a bit dry.  I love the way the meat just falls off the bone and I can't get enough of the sauce!  I've also tried the potato salad (red potatoes & dill) and the macaroni salad- both are pretty good, but I rarely get them.  I keep going back to the heart attack and a half tickler.  Go when it first opens or around 4pm and you won't get any crowd!

When you see a line that wraps around the building, then it's a good f'ing place. I love bbq...period. I search for the best in CA, though I haven't been fortunate enough to visit Texas or St. Louis yet. Memphis nearly made me nut in my pants because it was sooo good. Anyway back to Phil's, we ordered the baby backs, beef ribs, onion rings, 1/2 chicken, fries and the bbq broham - pulled pork on a bed of coleslaw topped with bbq sauce. Tender and smokey, they definitely pay homage to bbq. The sauce is sweet and tangy and you can order it on the side. The onions rings are beer battered and along with the fries, I suspect they're fried in peanut oil. What impressed me the most was the beef ribs. I usually order baby backs, but I got to say, it's gonna be hard to find a better beef rib. Meaty, tender, not overly smoked or sauced, it's one of the best I've had.

My husband' favorite place in San Diego!  I, being a vegetarian, also enjoyed going there, as their vegetarian burger is surprisingly good for being a BBQ place.  I also like their cole slaw, and always order a side of it along with the veg burger.  My husband ordered the dinner portion first, and he thought it was a little bit too much.  The following times, he ordered ticklers (usually the baby back ribs), and with a few sides, it was actually enough.  The wait is loooooong always, but it was also part of fun.  If you don't like waiting in line, go there and order by the phone, and line up at the pick-up line, which is much shorter than the dine-in line.

OH MY GOD. This place was REAL TASTY. I really liked their portions, it was more than enough to keep me full. I could not finish it, and had taken home some left overs to munch on. I ordered the half and half (half chicken, half ribs) along with macaroni salad, and french fries. ADD the green seasoning can on your fries, IT TASTES BOMBBBBB! the macaroni salad was good too, but the Red Hot sauce WAS GOOOD! my friend actually put that sauce into his to-go box (yes, he straight up ghetto-ed himself by stealing a $2.50 hot sauce from a bbq joint). but yes, memories were made here. If there was one in cerritos, I would definitely go at least twice a week, and get fat, and die from heart attack, along with death by satisfaction.

I'm not mad at Phil's.  I have to admit a fondness for the meat-sicles aka ribs that just fall off the bone.  Sauce is a lovely combination of sweet and tangy with a bit of a kick.  Chicken is good - my dad even preferred it over the ribs (go figure - he's a chicken guy).  Both Toro and Broham sandys are delish (I get the slaw on the side, but that's just me).  Love the onion rings, beans, even the corn on the cob is cooked so that it doesn't get stuck in your teeth.  If you can avoid the peak bone-suckin' hours, you'll find your wait not as long it has been made out to be.

having recently been to my baby brother's graduation ceremonies from UCSD, i have to say that the hardest part of the whole ordeal is the logistics. there is mom, dad, me (the sister), auntie, and grandma.  where do we sleep? where do we park? where do we sit? where do we find james (the brother and the grad)? and most importantly, WHERE DO WE EAT? phil's has got this logistics thing DOWN. step 1: you wait in line (could be a long time, prepare yourself) step 2: you order your foodz (baby back rib dinner please. with corn and fries. THANKS!) step 3: you find yourself a table (which is almost never a problem) step 3a: if there is a problem, there are wonder people who work at phil's that will help you look for a table! step 3b: if you know you have a large party (10+), you can send a representative up to the front of the line to tell the host/hostess because they will hook you up with a prepared table! step 4: put on a bib, roll up your sleeves, and get ready for some finger-lickin' good! they certainly know how to cook bbq and how to get this bbq to you in a timely and orderly manner. if you don't find this bbq delicious then YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU'RE TALKIN' TO ME.

Okay ! This is the most famous place in San Diego for sure ! There is always line everyday on weekdays and weekends. But the line move fast so the line is actually not that bad. The ribs here is good, no doubt about it! But it was not that special either. I think as this place is so famous and many people raving about it, everyone think that it is verrryy good. But, !! I think the ribs here is not that extraordinary. Don't get me wrong, it is good but it is not the best ribs I would say. I have been visiting here everytime I have friends coming to town and they all say it is good, but it was not that worthy of praise. I kinda agree that the food here is good but what makes it very good is because its popularity. But as for the taste of the food itself, it was not that extraodinary. But definitely try it as it still offers good ribs, the baby back though, the beef ribs is not that good. Tony Romas has better beef ribs! and the onion ringss ! It wassss goodd,,, :D

Went here based on popular recommendations by fellow yelpers and friends. The line is long, but it ultimately gives us the feel of why it's so popular. However, I still prefer the ribs in Houston or Tony Roma's. Phil's simply show me a taste of what San Diego-ans love. For onion rings, I preferred Tony Roma's/The Habit's comparing to this place's.

Always super busy, Over an hour wait on a weds night. It was very good though. This place is a San Diego legend and its a must go place. I mean over 3000 reviews? The numbers speak for themselves. I'd suggest the pork ribs, so tender they fall off the bone. I had the baked beans and potato salad, they were eh.

My favorite bbq place in all of san diego!I've tried everything they have to offer and it's all great. My usual order is a ribless(chunks of boneless pork smoked and sauced to perfection) fries and beans. But sometimes I like to mix it upand get an El Toro sandwich(tri tip smoked and sliced with sauce) with potatoe salad(sour cream based) and onion rings. I love this place so much I had my hometown reception here at their event center. Their staff was excellent. The venue was great and the food was just as amazing as it is in the restuarant.

After being at UCSD for 2.5 years, I finally went to Phil's BBQ. I had heard all about it and was skeptical that I wouldn't like it and it wouldn't be worth all the rave....boy was I proved wrong. This place is delicious!! My boyfriend and I split the pork ribs. We didn't want to eat too much - just the right amount. But I think that 1. I would definitely be back and 2. I'd try more things. We had the coleslaw which I had no complaints about. But the BBQ sauce....OMG

I don't really like barbecue food at all, but Phil's BBQ is alright. Their sauce is pretty good. I had their cheeseburger and shared a portion of baby back pork ribs. They serve large portions for a decent price. I might go back, but I still don't really like barbecue that much.

Went to Phil's yesterday for lunch, I usually get Th Broham (pulled pork sando with coleslaw) but I decided to get something else and chose the El Toro (tri tip sando)  The beef was smothered in BBQ sauce which had a little kick.  For 6.95 it was a HUGE sandwich and I was thoroughly impressed.  If you want faster service and skip the huge line, call in an order to pick up or eat in the bar.

The good: the ribs were amazing, bbq sauce was great, and service was fast and friendly. The bad: the fries were not good, oversalted, and the serving size was about three pounds.  The chicken was inedible. Tasted microwaved like tv dinner. Do yourself a favor. Buy a whole slab of ribs and no sides and this will be a five star dining experience.

Ok, so I generally do not like eating food with my fingers let alone BBQ. Hands down this place has got to be the best BBQ I have ever had. The line was ridiculously long. Off the top of my head I think I waited a little less than 2 hours. The cool thing about the restaurant is that you can drink in line. The two hours went by relatively quickly only because I was pretty drunk by the time I hit the front of the line. This place is awesome, the food is dirt cheap, big portioned and really good. I ordered their RIBS, FRIES, and ONION RINGS. With BBQ you can not go wrong there. If you go to SD this is a restaurant that you will want to try out. ENJOY!

I've been here twice and both times I went the line was extremely long. But oh my god was the food worth the wait. Once I sat down, the food was almost instantly ready for me to pick up, and boy was I happy. You get a generous amount of food from what you order. I ordered the El Toro which is a sandwich that just overflows with tri-tip and drenched in their addicting sweet and tangy sauce. You can't go wrong with any sides that you order, they're all delicious. It's also good to mention their humongous onion rings that literally fit around your wrist. All in all, if you are in San Diego and are craving some good barbecue, there's no doubt that Phil's is going to be your number one choice.

I was in CA visiting my mother and Phil's was one of the places we HAD to go to. The service was great but the food was better! There was a line leading to the door the entire time we were there, and after my first bite I knew why! The BBQ sauce was great and not just on the food but IN the food. One of the things I like to see are the faces of the employees. And every employee in the place had a smile, not just for the customer, but for each other! Go to Phil's! You'll be glad you did!

Who knew that Southern California had BBQ this good? The restaurant is a little funny to get to but it wasn't too hard to find. The line was long but the hostess and cashiers kept the line moving, and they have plenty of seating. Phil has his business working like a finely tuned machine! My friend and I went there twice while we were in San Diego (for about a week). I will have to disagree with man v. food and say that the pulled pork sandwich (BBQ Broham) is much better than the El Toro. The 'slaw was great and the baked beans had some smoke flavor and were good too. I also had the best of both (pork ribs and 1/4 chicken) which was really good. You can taste the char and smoke, its obvious that they slow cook everything. The fries are freshly cut and tasted good too. The staff was very nice and accomodating and their soda fountain had plenty of different ice teas and sodas to choose from. The moonpies are good for dessert although it is basically a devil's food cream sandwich. I will definitely visit them again when I am in the area.

This place is absolutely amazing. I was wanting BBQ very badly the other night and my boyfriend told me about his place and said he's been wanting to try it, but he's never been the wait in line for more than 10 minutes type. So we pulled up to see that the line was really long. But I guess that's this place all the time. Now I understand why. The wait for us was about an hour and 20 minutes which wasn't that bad. What I really like about this place to start was that they had menus posted up so that before you get to the front you can see what you're going to order. I was worried that I wasn't going to get full off of 4 baby back ribs and the 1/4 chicken, so i ended up with the 2 beefy ribs and the chicken and I still didn't finish a lot of the food. But the meat was very good came right off the bone the BBQ sauce was amazing as well. The pricing for the two of us was well worth it and honestly not as much as I expecting. I will be going back here, only next time I'll end up doing the take out and not so much waiting in that beautiful line. I highly recommend this place!

Despite of the looooooong waiting line and the stuffy environment, I still visit Phil's BBQ whenever I have a chance to go to San Diego. They have the BEST BBQ! The baby back ribs are so tender that you don't even need a knife. And you will be drooling so bad just smelling the smoky flavored chicken. Did I mention that the onion rings and the steamed veggies are good too?

ohhh my goodness i love me some baby back ribs and phil's offers only the best, and for very reasonable prices. of course, the biggest con is that there is alwaysssss a wait at this place. good luck coming here on friday nights or weekends. expect to wait at least an hour if you do. the way they operate is you order + pay first and then they give you a buzzer that goes off when your order is ready. you just go and find a table and get your drinks while your food is being prepared. the food comes quickly though so that sorta makes up for the original wait to get inside. i always get the half rib dinner (6-7 bones) with a large side of macaroni salad (or you can get 2 small sides) for $13 and i devour it. the meat is super tender and juicy and falls right off the bone. the amount of bbq sauce on it is just right. they're also generous with their sides. it's smart that they put a roll of paper towels on each table because it sure gets messy. i've tried a sample of their bbq chicken and beef ribs before too but it's just not as good as the pork ribs. the ticklers are a steal though - 3 bones w/ 2 HUGE onion rings, cole slaw, AND fries for only $6.50!!! it's a good option for those who claim they don't like ribs but want to try them. give the tickler a chance and you might just change your mind. :) i just wish they would open up a location in norcal!

Phil's is definitely the best place I have had BBQ in my entire life. The meat on the ribs fall of the bone and the BBQ sauce is the best I've ever tasted (I usually don't like BBQ sauce at all). Phil's has a wonderful atmosphere and is usually filled with hungry people. Stop by, any day except Mondays, tie on a bib, and enjoy some grub. I'd recommend calling in your order and then going to try and find a seat. Don't forget a bib (located near the handwash station) because you'll definitely need one. Their fries, baked beans, and whoopie pies are great too. Next to the main dining area is a sports bar type of area if you want a beer or other drink. Whenever I hear that a friend is visiting San Diego, I direct them to Phil's. It's just that good.

I had the "best of both" item: beefy ribs and 1/4 chicken. It was delicious food, however if it's really packed then I wouldn't recommend getting the beefy ribs unless you want to wait a bit longer for your food. The food was definitely worth it and I was very satisfied with the portions. If you're looking for good ol' BBQ where you can just indulge then, this is the place for you. They even have bibs!

I dont come here often, but whenever I do, I always have a good time.  The food is delicious!  The staff there is very friendly and helpful.  I remember one time a lady who was directing the line was dancing and rapped a little song with my boyfriend while we were waiting to order. Ive always come in a large group and theyve always been able to accommodate us.  Even if they sat us outside on the patio, weve always had a worker come ask us if we needed anything, if everything was good, or if we needed extra bbq sauce or togo boxes.  I never felt like they forgot about us out there. I do get a bit frustrated when I walk up to the building and theres a hugeee line, but honestly, I cant complain.  The food is good, and at a good price; so its understandable that they would have a large amount of customers. I love the ribs here and I love the people, so I never turn down an invitation to go here.

I heard this place was amazing and therefore when I was in San Diego I made sure to go here with my wife.  The line at 7:30pm on a Friday night was out the door and around the corner.  2 Hours later we were finally inside.  Not sure which to choose I went with the chicken and ribs combo with fries.  The sauce they use on the chicken and ribs is amazing, spicy and sweet.  However, the chicken was nothing to write home about and neither were the fries, kind of bland.  The thing to go here for is the ribs.  They were some of the best ribs I've ever eaten, comes right off the bone and were perfectly cooked.  Next time we're in the area, if the line isn't long we'll stop in again for some ribs, but with all the hype I expected a bit more.

Maybe it was because everyone had hyped it up to be the best BBQ ever that I didn't think it was as good as it was.  Don't get me wrong, it was tasty (hence the four stars) just not as good as I expected.  Very crowded, you'll be lucky if you get a table.  Oh, and you gotta love a place with a sink in the middle of the room.  Don't forget the napkins!

My low star rating is based solely on my experience as a vegetarian.  Why would a vegetarian go to a BBQ place?  Because, sometimes we are dragged there with meat-eating friends.  Vegetarian choices are limited to a salad or the BBQ veggie burger.  From the two, go with the veggie burger - but they will charge you extra if you want lettuce & tomato!  And it is way over-priced for a bun with a veggie patty and bbq sauce (seriously, that is all you get).  I'll admit, the bbq sauce is good, and the onion rings were awesome too.  But, for a vegetarian, the long lines are not at all worth it - I suggest you eat before you go!

3.5 stars I'm being generous today. Really, I think Khann and I freaked out about the line for nothing. I don't know what time I got in line but I know it was around noon and I was sitting down with my order within 15 minutes. Granted, going to a barbeque joint on a Sunday afternoon isn't gonna bring out much of a crowd, but I expected the worst. I was surprised. The line moved fast. I got a chance to check out some of the NFL scores on the various televisions throughout the restaurant. It was 38-0 New England over Arizona in what looked like a white field in Foxborough. As I moved further into the line, I saw that the Chargers were playing Tampa Bay. Weird, given the fact that I remembered the DirecTV menu listed the game as the Sunday night game. Must have been flexed, I thought. So I placed my order and tried to find a place to sit down and watch the game on the televisions around the eating area. I gotta say this: I don't like the cafeteria-style seating arrangement, where you have to look for seating. For a guy like me who's going into the place alone, I wouldn't be able to find a place to sit down. It was crowded. I guess the caveat I'd tell people about this place is to bring a minimum of two people. When I came in, the Buccaneers had just scored on a big pass play to Antonio Bryant to make it 24-20 in the third quarter. The defense made big play after big play after that deflating play. Allowed the offense to get the team back into the game on the road. Philip Rivers threw a touchdown to Antonio Gates and the place exploded. 27-24. At least the place is in tune with the game. After the TD, a PA announcement of "Touchdown" came out over the loudspeakers. I found a table in the back of the restaurant that was empty. I would find out later that it was part of two tables that the employees use during their lunch break. Now, here's my question: No sign anywhere said that the tables were off-limits. If those were employee tables, why not completely seal that area off and make another exit to the tables outside the restaurant (which I never considered because I wanted to watch the game)? It's friggin' stupid. I ordered a Chick-less dinner, fries, and potato salad. Small stuff. To be truthful, the place doesn't have much in terms of variety in their menu. It's not a place to drag a vegan to either. Fries weren't oversalted, which is good. Potato salad is tasty, but nothing too spectacular. The chick-less dinner was bathed in the sauce, which I didn't like. Good portions given the price. So then they drive down for another big touchdown off a screen pass to Darren Sproles after yet another outstanding defensive stand. They sealed it with a pickoff of Jeff Garcia, tipping a pass to Antoine Cason for a sealing TD. So I finish my meal and go to toss the plate when an employee tells me that the area I sat in was for employees. Well. Thanks for telling me! Honestly, that soured a pretty good experience with the crowd (and some of the employees) being really into the Chargers game. And to top things off, I went on the day before they close for the holidays and don't re-open until January. Safe to say I won't go there for a while, at least making sure that I have another person coming with me to eat there.

Fresh off a 6 hour flight from NY, this was our first stop on our trip to SD.  It was late in the afternoon so there wasn't much of a line.  I went for the El Toro and the DW had the Broham.  We both crave meat and this place hit the spot.  The sauce is plenitful and sweet, I'm hoping to hit this place up again before we head back to NY.  After peering at other peoples grub, I'll probably go for the ribs next time.  Yum!

There must be something about a place when there is a line wrapped around the building just to get in.  The wait actually wasn't bad and we were in good company.  This is not a sit down restaurant, you go up and order and the staff will help you to find a table.  Most tables sit only 4 people.  The beef ribs were huge and I loved the taste of the bbq on it with the smokiness.  The best part was the clossal onion rings.  Honestly the best onion rings I ever had.  The onion was sweet and the batter was amazing.  A little greasy but it's a small price to pay.  Their coleslaw was good as well.  Their baked beans however lacked in flavor and quality and did not complement the bbq and their pork shoulder was dry and very disappointing.  Overall though it was a good experience, good food and excellent service.

Recommended by a friend from San Diego to try this place out. On its website, it says it's closed at 10pm, but I placed an order for to-go around 9:30. The pickup time was minutes before the restaurant closed, so I expected that there would be less people. Instead, the restaurant was full of people. Picked up the to-go order and it was still hot and fresh when I drove back to the hotel which was about 5-10 minutes away. The ribs were flavorful, comparing to other ribs that I have tried before where it's dry. My brother loves it so much he had ribs from Phil's BBQ twice in a row and he wanted more the following day.

SO GOOD. There was a lot of hype prior to my visit, but I can gladly report that it met my expectations. Prices weren't bad either. I enjoyed the baby back rib tickler that came with 3 bones, 2 HUGE onion rings, a mountain of fries and slaw for $6.45. The meat melted off the bones and the sauce was delicious. I wish I was more hungry so I could have ordered a half rack instead. Came on a Saturday night, and the line is deceivingly intimidating, but they have a helpful sign that tells you how long the wait is from where you are standing. I would make sure to prepare for a good 20-30 minute wait. I also like the order at the counter system. Makes it easier for huge groups so you don't have to haggle with splitting the bill. I will definitely come back!

This place is insane - insanely busy. We came in the early evening on a weekend and the line went around the corner that has that made up (?) sign that says from this point it's 21 min and 42 sec till you get to order. Anyways I think the line almost made it to the other corner. Anyways we decided to just call in our order and wait 15 minutes instead of in that long line. 15 minutes later, we still had to wait in a little bit of a line to pay and then it took like 10 minutes to bag the order. They say they don't place and pack your food till after you pay so that it's more "fresh." They even gave us one of those pagers to let you know after you've paid that you can pick up your food at the counter. And there's a sign that you can't eat take-out at the restaurant but I'm sure tons of people still do it. If you do eat there, the deal is you order and I think they give number so that you food can be delivered. Then you go find a table. There's a no saving tables policy so I really hope they enforce that. But from the reviews, I don't think people have too much trouble finding seats after they order. Before we left, we picked up plastic bibs, utensils, napkins, and condiments. It's a nice spread. So we got the chicken and ribs combo. It came with your choice of beef or baby back ribs, a quarter of a chicken or chickless, which are like grilled chicken nuggets, and 2 small sides or a large side. Since there were 2 of us, we got try one of everything. For the sides we opted for french fries, macaroni salad, and potato salad. I think I liked the baby back ribs over the beef. You get a larger portion of beef ribs but the baby backs absorb the sauce better and is more tender and smokier in flavor. Either way, it still works out to a quarter of a slab. The chicken is chicken. The nuggets are a little dry. But in terms of quantity, it's about the same. Both the macaroni and potato salads were a bit plain. And when they say small sides, it's like a shallow plate the size of your palm. The french fries were gross. A word of advice, don't get them to go because they will become soggy and inedible by the time you get home. I was disappointed because my friend had said they were fantastic when she had them at the restaurant before. Each combo set us back like 12 bucks but that's a good deal for all that food. Not the best BBQ restaurant ever but still pretty decent. Now if only they could get rid of the ridiculous line, I would be more of a regular customer.

You know whats one of the things that suck when you make ribs yourself or order it at a sit down restaurant: the wait. Well at Phil's, all you have to do is wait in line, order, and the food comes out in about 5 minutes. The baby back ribs are juicy, fall of the bone tender, and covered in BBQ sauce and have a great pork flavor throughout, but it's not charred, which I like my bbq to be like. The prices are average. I think the sides are great also. You get fresh corn if your order corn. Other sides, I've had are the onion rings, potato salad, and baked potato. I heard the line can wrap around the building, but I've never had to wait that long. No alcohol in the general restaurant, just in the small bar area.

3.5 stars Not a hater of Phil's.. I know it's like, one of those places you HAVE to bring your visiting friends or any other tourists, but I think it's only aiiitee. Prices are pretty reasonable for what you get, considering it is all meat. The thing is that the prices have dropped within the past year or so since they've changed the quality of the meat (it's no longer as slide-off-the-bone as before). I love that they slather sauce all over it... as some people may not be fans of that, but I am. But one thing I think they do amazingly well is the smokiness of the beefy ribs and pulled pork sandwich. My complaints about the place are the insane lines on weekends, but they recently put a webcam on their website so you can check how long the line is before you leave... or you also have the option of placing a phone order before you get there so you don't have to wait in line. Also, last time we came in a group of 15 for the boy's going away party. They were pretty good at accommodating such a large party, but the thing that sucked is that the food trickled out. The pagers for two of us never went off, even while everyone else got their food. We probably waited about 15 min (assuming that they were busy and were just working on cranking it out), but then when we finally went to ask about it, my friend's had been ready for nearly 20 min, but the pager was broken. As for mine, my order wasn't even showing up in the computer, and they asked to see my receipt. After all that trouble and long wait for us, the only thing that they said was "Sorry, here you go". I was a little disappointed, as it would've been nice if they'd even thrown in a side as a sorry, but I guess they don't roll that way here, which is fine too. Their good food makes up for it. Other than that, if you're into consistently good barbeque, this is the place to go. Just make sure you're ready to wait!

The best BBQ I've had! The ribs were tender and the sauce was perfect (just the right amount of sweetness, spicyness, and tang). I ordered the 'tickler' thinking it was going to be small, but the portions are very large. Their sides selection isn't very big, and they don't even have mashed potatoes or mac and cheese, but trust me, you won't miss it because the ribs are so good and it goes perfectly with the fries and coleslaw. Service is excellent. Don't be intimidated by the huge line....it goes surprisingly fast. Highly recommended. Great for groups/casual dining.

I like how Phil's has its menu posted several places outside the building, like it's expected that you'll be waiting in line for their food. But I have to admit, them baby back ribs were tender, flavorful, falling off the bone and barbequed perfectly. It was worth the wait.

Went here for the first time yesterday as my visit was much overdue. The line wasn't too bad. Didn't realize you have to order at a counter, find your own seating and then pick up your food. The whole place feels very authentic and fun inside. I ordered the "Chick-less Chicken" which is just pieces of white meat chicken off of the bone, covered in BBQ sauce. So good! It comes with either 2 small sides, or 1 large side. I got the steamed vegetables, in attempt to be somewhat healthy, and an extra side of the potato salad. The veggies needed more flavor (or any at all - they're literally just plain steamed veggies!) but their potato salad was really good. The chicken was moist and covered in their delicious sweet, tangy sauce. Their onion rings are so killer. Definitely order those. And definitely wear a Bib if you're eating ribs so your company can laugh at you and take pictures of you devouring meat with BBQ sauce all over your face and a Bib around your neck. It's awesome. Everything is pretty affordable, too. Dinner portions are huge and enough to fill you up. My chicken dinner, extra side and drink came to $15 and change, which you can't really beat at all, and I couldn't even finish!

First time here, not a big BBQ person, but I had to give it a try after everyone raved about it. Line was very long, but well worth it! El toro sandwich was delicious but next  time I would try something different. Overall people were friendly and atmosphere was fun. BBQ sauce was pretty good....but I've had better i.e. Kinders. If you're a big BBQ person, then I would definitely give it a go!

Some friends took me to this place and i have to say it's very different from what i'm used to. It's like a Mcdonalds, but at the same time a restaurant such as chili's. The food was great, i ordered some baby back ribs with fries and coleslaw. The place was quite active with a lot of people. The workers/busboys were polite they would ask if everything was alright. I would definitely come back to this place when i get the chance to. Check it out if your ever in SD.

While i don't agree with Troy M. about food being better than sex TWICE, Phil's is Banana's GOOD when it comes to BBQ. One draw back are the lines, but the food is well worth the wait. Lots of seating is always nice. They have a takeout line that moves pretty quick but dine-in is always best. You know a place is good when you can smell from about 3 blocks away on a good day.

i LOVE this place! This is the place I take my friends who visit and the place my friends want to go when they come back! There is not much that I can say that is bad about this place: the food is DELICIOUS (I recommend a "tickler" or a "best of both world's" platter for any first- timers), the location is not hard to find, and the staff is amazingly nice. The only negative I can think of is the long wait, but it is so worth it! I actually went last night with a couple of girlfriends and had a very nice customer service experience. So, I went with four of my girlfriends and four of us had ordered the meat platters while one had ordered a sandwhich which took a little longer to make I guess. We all had our food expcept my friend with the sandwich. I guess the Assistant Manager saw that one of us did not have food and offered my friend a plate of anything she wanted while she waits and "all your friends eat without you" HAHA. He was very nice and even hand- delivered the sandwich when it was done! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED as a place to eat with a group of friends or any night that you just feel like STUFFING YOUR FACE!

i went here again and i liked it even more the 2nd time around!! the wait was about an hour on a sunday (3-4pm). i had previously wanted to come here but the line traveling back 3 hours made me leave the parking lot in 2 seconds. i got the rib and chick-less combo. ribs were equally as yummy as the first time. the chicken was boneless and mesquite grilled. delish. the thing i liked the most was the ONION RINGS! last time i went it was SOGGY :( so i was so happy when i bit into these babies and it was crisp and delish!! LOVED it! i had leftovers for THREE days. equally as tasty each day i ate it. word of advice, if you don't like a lot of sauce (and you like to taste your meat), ask for the sauce on the side!

Still good, but the beef ribs are not great. I ordered a tickler for beef ribs and was disappointed. BABY BACK RIBS FOR THE WIN WIN WIN. Oh, for the beef rib tickler, they give you a lot of fries and a couple of onion rings oh and one beef rib. Pretty good deal, fries would get you full. But those beef ribs are not my thang. Next time I will try the chocolate moon cake...I will remember not to fill my tummy to the top of my esophagus.

Went here the other day. The wait is always long and while waiting in line, we learned that phils serves something ridiculous like 2500 people on weekdays and like 5000 people on weekend up to like 5600 on sunday (these numbers are approximates from the ridiculousness that i vaguely remember hearing) BUT THAT'S INCREDIBLE. The reason they serve so many hungry san diegans is that their ribs are really the best. They're meaty and juicy and tender! Their macaroni salad is the best side dish and their pulled pork sandwich is good too! To bypass the line, call in and take your yummy ribs home! They have large tables for groups but you might have to wait for them.

They are super tender (fall off the bones), strong smoky flavor, and good mac salad too!

im not a big BBQ person, but if i was, i would definitely love this place. it's really affordable and even though there can be long lines, its a big restaurant with a lot of seating. the beef ribs and bbq chicken are super tender and slathered with tons of tangy bbq sauce. i really like the potato salad and macaroni salad sides. its very refreshing to eat after all that meat! i also had the pulled pork shoulder sandwich that came with a tonnnn of meat. i thought i had read that it came with coleslaw in it, but when i was asked if i wanted any sides i said no, so my sandwich was just bun and meat. unless you like a ton of meat and sauce, i recommend you make sure you get coleslaw with it. i really liked the onion rings as well. they are HUGE! and crunchy and when you bite into it, you dont end up dragging the whole onion ring out, leaving you with just a hollow fried shell. if you love BBQ, this is the place to go!

Had time to kill near the airport so I took two out-of-country folk here because I've been wanting to try it and they had mentioned it as a yelp finding earlier in the week. Came here on a Wednesday night last week and couldn't believe the line! I didn't understand at first how it worked - I presumed it was people waiting to get a table, not order....still though, pretty crazy for a freaking Wednesday. Luckily the end of the line was under the "21 minues 14 seconds" sign and although I forgot to actually time it my guess is that was pretty darn close to accurate. Two of us ordered the rib sampler and the third ordered a burger. We struggled for a few minutes to find a table but luckily a table of four got up to leave and I hovered over the table as it was being cleaned. Everyone who works there that we encountered were super friendly and helpful. I'm not sure it was as OMG as I'd hoped it would be from the reviews, but it was pretty darn good and definitely a wallet friendly deal. My only complaint - on a side note - is that the parking lot is very squishy and just...odd. Other than that it was a great experience!

ok my review is going to be totally biased because i didnt eat the ribs. not a huge fan of them because its messy and dont care for bbq sauce. but my friends wanted to go, and id heard all the hype so went along. it was extremely packed, but the line moved at a good pace (to order). i ordered a cheeseburger (hold the bbq sauce) and a side of macaroni salad. was bummed they didnt have mac and cheese! i thought maybe there would be? the cheeseburger and macaroni salad were just decent. everyone's ribs looked really good and the portions were HUGE. everyone left extremely satisfied, so next time i will try the ribs, wear the bib, and use a fork and knife to see what all this madness is really about! will review again after i try the famous ribs or the ribless meat.

Beefy ribs are the best I've ever had! Before Phil's, I would always choose baby back ribs over beef ribs, but now that I've tasted what perfect beefy ribs are supposed to taste like, I don't think I can have ribs anywhere else! Here are the reasons I did not give Phil's 5 stars: Ribs without mac n cheese? Somehow I don't feel complete without my mac n cheese. Also, the torture of waiting for Phil's and watching people eat through the windows always makes me order more than I can eat. Leftover Phil's is never as good. I'm split on the service. While the servers going around the tables are great, the lady at the front telling people to go to a register is horrible. We were next in line, and a register was open. The lady, of course not doing her job, was chatting with someone, and the server behind the register was gesturing us to go to her register and order. After we finished ordering, the lady finally stopped chatting and yelled at us rudely to get back in line because we went to the register for Phone Orders. These were her exact words, "This is for Phone Orders. Did you phone order? No, you did not." After waiting for an hour just to be treated like this, my boyfriend and I were not happy and retorted a few remarks in which she just sat there and did not have the slightest idea on customer service. On the other hand, after eating, I needed boxes for my sides to take home. The server that was helping our table brought me two completely new sides already packed instead of empty boxes. I had well over half of my baked beans left over, but she kindly gave me a new batch for me to bring home. Hallelujah, there is a reason, besides the beefy ribs, to come back to this place. If it weren't for this last act of kindness and their amazingly cooked beefy ribs, I would never come back. All in all, order the beefy ribs and sign up for their newsletter online so you can cut the line on/around your birthday!!! Update! Within 10 hours of my review, the owner contacted me to apologize for any negative experience and offer to cut the line next visit. I'm not adding any stars because it still happened to me, but I do want to acknowledge the prompt and professional response in addressing the issue. I will, however, say that I'm going to utilize this offer very soon and update my review after the visit.

What can I say about Phil's that hasn't already been said? It's wonderful- definitely the best place to get ribs in San Diego, and it has officially ruined eating them anywhere else for me.

Best bang for your buck BBQ for sure!!  Many argue this place is better than Lucelle's I'm not sure of that... what you get for what you pay for though, definitely!!  This place is always packed though, so don't go there starving, expect to wait 1+hrs, more on a weekend.  Try finding a seat in the bar, its usually faster.

You wait a minimum of Atleast 45minutes or more but its totally worth it. The sauce is so smoky and full of flavor. Everything I've had so far is DELISH!!! The beef ribs are huge juicy moist and full of meat that practically falls off the bone. The onion rings are homemade and awesome fries,baked beans,macaroni salad I love it macaroni doesn't taste like it has vinegar or preservatives has good homemade taste all the sides are good. Today we also ordered the pulled pork because of all the rave on yelp :( well despite what everyone says I expected the meat to have more flavor than it did the only flavor was the BBQ Sauce over it I thought it was going to be simmered in the sauce that's what I would've done different. I won't say I'll never order again cuss I will.  I'll just order a side of BBQ Sauce and top it off at my table :) But I would have to be craving it until then pass me the ribs... LOL P.S.  Have a snack handy you'll be in line for a while.         And shout because its loud as a mudda fukka!!! Haha but yea really.

I don't know if Phil Pace reads these reviews or not, but I would like to think that he will see this. I have been a long time customer from since you opened on Goldfinch. I used to come in and everyone knew me and Phil would always come out and say hi. I loved the food and the atmosphere. Since you opened the new Point Loma location your quality has suffered to the point that I am not sure I am going back. The consistency is so hit or miss--some days the food is excellent and some days horrible. I was in on Sunday and my food was mediocre at best, luke warn and thrown together. This is a far cry from what it used to be. I know that you are busy but does that justify lousy food? Phil I look up to you and admire what you have done. You have taken your small restaurant and turned it into an amazing concept; not an easy feat. I have always been excited to hear from you on how things have been and what your future plans are. I wish that your quality control was the same as it used to be. My experiences have turned me into a once a month visitor from a 3 times a week. I know how difficult it is to keep things under control. I have worked in the industry for years, heck I even have a degree in culinary arts. Once things slip they can become the norm and that will make you loose long time customers like myself. I hope that you can find your way back to your roots and put up the same quality from the time you open your doors to when you close. Good luck to you Phil, Concerned Customer

Past by this place the first time when the family went to Sea World. The line was out the door so we didn't try it. Second time we were in San Diego, decided to call in our order. This is the best way to go. Came straight there after touring the USS Midway and the line was wrap around the building. I went straight inside and within minutes pickup my order.

Everything here is good but one must try the colossal onion rings they are very good. May be different from KC and Memphis ribs but this place is really good. Sometimes the lines can be a little deceiving because if it seems long the most it can take you is an hour and your food is ready in no time. Also, if for whatever reason you cannot wait that long you can head to the bar and wait to see if a spot opens up and that sometimes is quicker than standing in line.

I used to live in Texas, and I have experienced some of the best BBQ there is... With that said, Phil's BBQ is not a true BBQ place, maybe for city folks who have never experienced a true BBQ. This place is like your McDonalds of fast BBQ. The service is awesome. Very nice people working there. This place is casual, so expect to eat with your hands, otherwise you will not enjoy it.  I ate some type of chocolate pie that looked like an oversized Oreo. It was dry and didn't have flavor, so avoid wasting $6. Line was long, and I guess Yelpers hyped this place for my wife and I, so at the end I was disappointed.

Made a trip down to San Diego pretty much just to eat here again.  This place is consistent all the time with the quality and friendly service.  The only downfall is that there is a very long wait even at random times like 3pm, but you can't really blame them since this place really is just that good!  The beef ribs here are on point and the sauce is perfect, plus they are the size of dinosaur bones.  You will definitely not leave here hungry or disappointed will definitely come back soon.  Warning, not a good place to go if you are on a diet... :)

If you like food as much as me, this would be a dangerous place for us to meet. We would probably end up fighting tooth and nail for every bit of deliciousness. After which only one of us will be the victor, the loser limping away hungry and shamed. No. Really. If i met you here I'd probably eat your sandwich, or ribs, or chicken, or whatever you have.

BBQ chicken wasnt that good but the ribs were delicious. If i go back next time, i would definitely ordered the ribs alone. Pricing and service is great.

This place is awesome, the bbq portions are huge and taste amazing.  we went there when our family took a trip to san diego.  really easy going setting and the prices were really decent.  we went there during the week off hours and were seated immediately, but around dinner time the line was out the door.  Great BBQ!

Oh man the best bbq i have ever had in my life. The pulled pork sandwich was good but i got tired of it pretty fast. On the other hand the baby back ribs were really good. I kept stuffing myself even if i was full i didn't want to stop the delicious flavors that were going through my mouth. Really and just the first bite of the ribs you get this nice garlic flavor to it and the sweet sauce on the ribs follows it. They really give you a lot of food as well. The fries and onion rings man BOMB! The onion rings were so good . Really every time I'm in San Diego this has to definitely be one of my favorite places to eat. If Jesus was alive he'd be eating here. THIS PLACE IS THE TRUTH!

I really love Phil's BBQ- the one on Goldfinch but this one on Sports Arena is much bigger. We showed up and the line was already out the door and around the corner of the building and the parking lot was packed! We waited for 23-25 minutes in the line before being seated and we were a HUGE party- a dirty dozen - twelve to be exact. We got seated outside on the porch/patio area which was nice because it meant less noise than inside but the place was just super loud. The lady who took out order must have been new because she didn't understand we were ordering racks to share instead of just individual dinners... although we ordered those as well. It was nice because my cousins didn't have to behave like at a super nice place - you know the ones with pristine white table clothes and a waiter with a crumb brush who comes and "sweeps" your table clean of crumbs. The food was quickly served they have that handy dandy "buzzer" thing so you know to make your way up to get your grub and don't end up hungry even if you are having a great conversation. I got the beef rib dinner and it was AWESOME.. Juicy, tender and a bit spicy- California BBQ is sweeter than MidWest or Carolina BBQ which tends to be a bit more sour.. but I am an equal oppurtunity BBQ eater. Hand me a rib and I will clean it! The only reason Phils didn't earn 5 stars was the noise level and the fact they have no benchs except inside for the elderly - like my Grandfather- the pregnant, differently abled or just plain lazy like me!

Get the rib-less dinner its the best value and you get the same amount of meat you would on the half rib dinner. Might also want to think about getting the sauce on the side.

Not a fan. Waited 1 hour and 50 minutes for a table. The ribs, while tender seem to be sloppily dressed with sauce. Seemed like sauce is what makes the meal. Onions rings were good though. The dining experience itself was only 20 minutes. but had a good service from Kenny in terms of getting extra dipping sauce and clean up...however not worth it overall for such an absurd wait. It would've been best to get my stuff to go and eat it in the comfort of my own home. Should've made the establishment more a "fast food" place. Would've spared me from the leg aches and pains.

I have eaten BBQ all over the east coast, but this was my first exposure to west coast BBQ and I was pleasantly surprised how different but enjoyable it was. The portions are Flintstone-esq. My girlfriend and I ordered half servings of the pork ribs, and beef ribs and chicken and there was so much food it was borderline ridiculous. The mesquite wood smoke gave a tangy kind of sharp sweetness to the meat. This is completely different than the mostly hickory smoke BBQ back east but entirely delicious. The pork ribs were among the best I ever tasted but without a doubt, the meatiest I ever had. The meat was moist, thick and was just tender beyond all comprehension. The chicken was delicious. Take my same description of the pork rib and apply it to the chicken. This was the first time I had beef ribs. They just weren't for me. While i did enjoy eating them like a caveman, I felt there was too much fat, gristle and thin membrane along the bone. I didn't feel it was as tender as it could have been either. I scarfed down the meats so heartily, it looks as I had on clown make up made of BBQ sauce and I couldn't care less how I looked because I was happy! The sides were very good too. The mac salad had an interesting zip to it. No, not like Miracle Whip, but something very unique that I couldn't put my finger on. It was probably the best mac salad I have had. The beans tasted like BBQ smoke with a tasty meatiness to them. Just mouthwatering! The fries and potato salad were good but unfortunately, nothing to rave about. I would probably be a regular here if I didn't live in NY. LONG LIVE PHIL'S!

We decided to see what all the fuss was about this place because we are from out of town.  When we first got there, it smelt delicious already, but the line was extrordinary long!  We stayed in line for 30 minutes, than got to order our food.  I ordered half chickn (all white) and baby back ribs (6-7 bones).  It was probably the best ribs I ever had, but I wasn't 100% satisfied with the food, but I do highly recommened this place.

there's a reason you'll be told there is "a two hour wait for any food coming off the grill" on a sunday night.  phil's does it right.  in addition to running a very efficient and streamlined operation(take-out) the food is worth the wait. i've never dined in, mostly because i have a weird fetish that prevents me from watching other people eat with their hands.  however, don't let that stop you.  eat-in, take-out, whatever floats your boat.  know that you pretty much cannot go wrong with this BBQ.   they work wonders with the ribs, slow roasting for tenderness and then they throw them on the grill to finish out the dance.  this provides a gastronomical harmony wherein the ribs are tender and succulent but have a crispy outer coating.  trs bien. all the standard stuff is aces too - side of beans, potato salad, etc.

the best ribs i've ever had. my boyfriend cries a little when he thinks about them (he's up in the bay area now) we used to head out there, play some scrabble or connect 4 while we waited for those amazingly delicious ribs. you can call ahead, and itmakes the wait a lot shorter (it can get pretty crowded sometimes, esp. on weekends) words cannot describe how freaking good this food is. alakfjds. and when you have board games and coloring books and cards and dominoes and large bibs to wear while you wait for your food? i love phil's. love love love.

Never had better ribs than I have here. I used to come here all the time and my pudgy little teenager body showed it! Never get the boneless, it's convenient, but you sacrifice the taste. The onion rings are amaing, they are the perfect mix of batter and onion. Always use the cajun powder, it's worth the weird tongue after. Always call in your order!

Alright, I've got to up my rating, i visited Phil's again on Friday for lunch (no i did not go to the elite event the night before)  and enjoyed my ribs thoroughly. Maybe the first time I went I caught a bad batch of ribs or something because this time the ribs definitely delivered. I still prefer home-cooked to anything bought outside (who wouldn't) but Phil's is a worthy challenger to the title of 'Best Ribs in Diego'

Wow, at 5 pm, this place has a line out the door!  We sat at the bar, so we did not have to wait.  The bartender was cool and friendly and they were playing the Red Sox game so that was a plus.  I had the baby back ribs tickler which came with fries, onion rings, and coleslaw.  Pretty good deal for under seven bucks!  The ribs came right off the bone and the sauce had a slight kick to it.

i like quite far from SD (about a 2 hr drive) and well everytime i go to SD i make sure i come here! i always get the baby back ribs because they are super tender (definitely beats lucille's bbq) and it's super meaty - a half rack will help me hit a food coma for sure. i've tried the chicken (im not a huge bbq chicken fan but its really good - but baby back ribs ftw! (; ) and if you like hot sauce - they have REALLLY freaking good hot sauce that goes with the bbq - its like its made for it or something. i would recommend the macaroni salad over the potato salad. i am usually a fan of both. the french fries are quite good also: sprinkle your fries with the cajun seasoning (loves it). the baked potato with the cheese is delicious! but i think you're better off getting the 2 sides over the one large side (if you get the baked potato that is) i also sprinkled the cajun seasoning over my baked potato hehehe :D more flavorr! i love the staff they are super friendly and very outgoing. if you have any questions about the menu, they will give you recommendations. :D the only con is the line: the line usually goes around the building but even so - its like a 30 minute wait and trust me its worth it. Plus, by the time you get there you're SUPER hungry and then your food wont go to waste for sure :D (that's how it goes for meee) AND its too delicious to go to waste!

ok i dont know much about BBQ.  i just know what my taste buds like and what it doesnt. some BBQ sauce are too tangy and some are too sweet... some ribs fall off the bone too easily so it taste more like mush and the worst kind is when there's hardly any meat on the bones!!!!  phil's, i must say... got all the proportions right. when we pulled up there was an insane line out the door. the wait time was for sure over an hour. luckily we learned from our past mistake at splash cafe and immediately parked the car and phoned in an order.  wait time... 20 minutes. now was it good enough for me to want to wait in that hour long line.... truthfully no, but if it was only a 20 minute wait.. most DEFINITELY.

I went on a Monday afternoon at 2:20pm and the place was packed. I'm guessing the only reason was because of the most delicious barbeque sandwich ever created...... The El Toro, best barbeque sandwich I've had in life! The sauce and  the tri tip..... a match made in heaven. Best thing I've had in San Diego by far. However, the sauce  doesn't really taste so great on the chicken and  ribs but the tri tip is crazy. Put in your mouth, enjoy and repeat! I suggest calling in your order because they wait in line is ridiculous. Phil's BBQ......DO IT!

I don't shell out 5-star reviews willy-nilly, but this place has absolutely the best BBQ I've ever had in my entire life.  I ordered the baby back rib dinner, the BBQ chicken dinner, and a spring mix salad, and everything (including each of the sides) was a taste of heaven.  The vote was unanimous in my party, and we can't wait to go back for more.  Be prepared for long lines, even if you order take out.  However, they are quite efficient and very careful about getting your order just right.

Not only is Phil's BBQ the best place to eat ribs, they have excellent customer service. One night I did a phone order and after I received my pager, I waited for more then 30 min when I was told it should have only been 10-15 min. I went inside to see what was wrong and there was some sort of miscommunication and they did not have my pager number to notify me when my food was ready. I was given the food on the spot and the manager came out and refunded my money. These things do happen unfortunately, but they made it right. Despite what happened, I'm always going to come here.

I mean, place.  I won't be giving it two stars, it deserves better, just like me.  I'm guessing I wish they had a few more options on their menu.  Like more salad options (maybe an awesome bbq chicken salad) and some sweet potato fries as a side?  I have yet to try their ribs, so maybe I will change my mind and it will be the love of my life.

VERY crowded, but understandably so.  Their ribs are delicious.  But nothing about them stands out to me;  I lived in SLO for two years with Firestone's in downtown.   I'll admit, Phil's is comparable to Firestone's, but it's also pricier.  You kinda have to fight to get your own table though, which may be difficult at times.  We ended up having to sit outside.  They did have heaters just in case we got cold though, so sitting outside isn't that big of a deal.  It's just... I had to look inside through the window to watch TV, made me feel ostracized.... I'd totally go here again when I'm in San Diego though.  Excellent food, regardless of what I might have experienced elsewhere.

I love BBQ so we decided to try Phil's BBQ since so many has proclaimed it to be the best BBQ place in town. We got there right when it opened and the line was nearly wrapped around the building. We were lucky to be ordering take out so it wasn't  quite as long. We ordered the pork ribs and the  El Toro. I was a bit disappointed that the sides for the family meal was a choice of one large side or two small, so I decided to get one large side. To my surprise the large side was the size of a small side elsewhere. The pork ribs were drenched in sauce which was too salty for me. Perhaps I should have ordered the beef ribs. The service was great and will probably come back again to try the beef ribs.

My best friend is going to kill me, but I have to give 3 stars (she has a love affair with Phil's BBQ). First off, I hate lines. Second, I don't like food that makes me smelly! Third, I don't like the idea of fighting for tables. I admit that their ribs are especially delicious when I'm famished, but standing in line usually sucks the life out of me. Strangely, my favorite part of my meal are the french fries because they remind me of In N Out's fries. Other than that, I prefer having a BBQ in my backyard with my dad as the chef.

(That means a friend can not reserve a table while you order your food).  When we finally got a table for 8, we barefly had enough elbow room.  It was really uncomfortable and I felt like I was sinking.  The place is definitely not for large groups as it is hard enough to get table for 2.  I'll still eat here but damn - they need to expand or something...

YUM! There's not too much I can say that other people haven't said already, but this place is awesome! Prices are not dirt cheap but suitable for a casual lunch or dinner--I paid 13.95 for half a rack of baby back ribs and one large side. The ribs are some of the best I've ever had; the sauce is so flavorful and the meat practically falls right off the bone. If you got dragged here by some friends but don't like meat, the salads look pretty good too. The only downside is that the line is tremendously long; I went here on a Tuesday night and had to wait about 20 minutes to order. The food takes about 10 minutes to prepare, and you pick it up at the counter when your buzzer alerts you. Even though it's basically a self-serve place, the servers still check up on you once in a while. Also, there's a handwash station near the back. Pretty convenient.

This is the Best BBQ in ALL of San Diego! I've been going to Phil's even before their popularity exploded back when they were just a tiny hole in the wall joint over in Millsion Hills.  I have tried BBQ all over, and Phil's is by far my favorite place hands down! Prices are great, and if you dont want to spend more then $10 for a meal, I always get the Chick Tickler, or Rib Tickler.  You get lots of food for $6 and change. Great place to bring friends, family, or cater. If you see a line outside, dont let that scare you off.... Phil's is worth the wait!

Excellent service, Excellent Food!  I even love waiting in line.  They have THE best ribs and on top of that they are not shy in giving you extra sauce and wet naps.  Their onion rings are delicious!!!  Be sure that you eat all your food at the restaurant, if you take it home it will not be the same.

Went here for lunch on Monday.  Really good ribs.  Moist, tender, fallin' off the bone good.  Onion rings were nothing special, the french fries are the homemade version - taste kind of like In-n-Out burger.  Go for the ribs - you won't be dissapointed.

Would have given five stars except for the genius that walked us in the dining area and then ditched us.  The lovely warm taller and very funny black woman made it all right.  Our busser was also an incredible service oriented and very engaging individual.  It was a fun atmosphere and we were still eating left overs days later.  The food is incredible.

Try Phil's tickler- its about $7 comes with 4 bones of baby back ribs, 2 large onion rings, coleslaw AND fries.  Yum, hits the spot when you are craving some good ol' BBQ  ;-)  If you want to avoid a HUGE headache, make sure that you phone in your order, otherwise, you may be in for a hefty wait.  Tastes just as good at home.

came here on saturday night with my bf, cousin, and her husband. The wait was about 20-25 mins on a rainy day. we were tired and wet from sea world so we just wanted to sit down and get our grub on. Most of the employees are pretty nice but there was this one server who told us to move from our original table because there were customers who had food with them already. That kind of ticked us off because we were getting our food. We moved about 3 more times until we actually got to sit down. I ordered the beef ribs and chickless with fries n beans n the ribs were HUGE with lots of meat! the chicken was a bit dry. fries were yummy and the beans were whatever since im not really a fan. I packed a lot of leftovers to go. Overall I would have gave this place a 4.5 if it wasnt for that rude server but oh wells it was good to see my cousin again~

totally worth it. all of the food was sooooooo goood - my friend and i shared a rib platter when we were visiting my friend in SD, and we were pretty full afterward. if you've seen us eat, you'd say that's pretty impressive the ribs we got were covered in their delicious sauce, and we're the biggest I'd seen at any restaurant (that's what she said...). The onion rings were awesome too. i'd plan on making a stop here if you're in the area. the line was long, but it moved quickly. plus, you get to awkwardly stare at the people inside the restaurant who are making a mess of themselves.

This is the best BBQ in california! Trust me, I've been looking for 4 years ever since I moved to the west coast from NYC. The baby back ribs are to die for and the onion rings are crazy good. I'm not a huge beef ribs fan except for Phil's beef ribs. They are tender and delicious. I even like their set up. Wait in line (it's always long but moves pretty fast), place your order with the cashier, find a table, grab your food when it's ready, enjoy. Eat at Phil's!

Had to try Phil's after reading all the good reviews on Yelp.  I'm from Atlanta and found myself in San Diego craving barbecue, so off to Phil's we went.  We stood in line for awhile, and all got really hyped because it was so popular.  I really don't want to sound snobby, but sorry, we have better barbecue back home.  Now, it is not a bad choice if you are in the area.  It wasn't terrible, I just found myself yearning for my at home staples.  The onion rings were pretty good.  And service was friendly.  However, both my husband and I got sick following our meal here - like violently sick.  Ruined the following day of our trip.  Oh well.

Phil's BBQ is alright. Honestly, I just think this place is way too hyped up. The lines are ridiculously long and the food is just OK to me. I don't think it's really worth the time to wait out in line and get mediocre food. If you're craving some bomb BBQ, try Joey's Smokin' BBQ in Carmel Mtn. Never a long wait and the food is better and cheaper!!

TIP:  One meal is good for two people, share the ribs and get some extra sides.  Pork and beef ribs are amazing and the price is right.  Since you order at the counter, you save in tip money as well.  Best macaroni salad I have ever had, and don't get me started on those onion rings.  Ohhhh yeah!  Great spot worth waiting in line for.  Only bummer is you have to get your beer in a different section (bar) so if using a credit card, you use it twice.

So I came back again, of course and everything was better than the first, if that could happen :) The line was very fast and as soon as I got up there I ordered my favorite meal, the chickless dinner w/ two sides. onion rings and macaroni salad. Soooo good and of course the boyfriend got the big meaty ribs. I am actually salivating!! Once we sat a very nice gentlemen named Andy helped us out. He was part of our great experience, seriously..this guy is awesome :)) He said he just started but he seemed to know what he was doing w/ an amazing attitude. All in all, the experience was amazing and I will definitely be returning. Oh make sure you ask for Andy when you get there, he rocks!!!

One of the better BBQ joints I've been too, located in Point Loma near the Sports Arena. First thing I noticed was the long line out the door (so it must be good right?). You order up front like @ fast food places. So grab a menu while you are in line so you know what to order once you get up there. Baby back ribs, Tri-tip sandwich, chicken, fresh cut fries, sweet backed beans, and onion rings... great. Everything was simply amazing. And if you make a mess, there is a huge sink near to the exit to get cleaned up.

After eating at Phil's BBQ, no other BBQ place will taste the same. If you are looking for the flavorful BBQ that will have your mouth watering for more, then you will have to try Phil's BBQ!.

Well i have to say I really wanted to LOVE this place. My whole family loves it, but it just didn't do it for me. I was hoping for sparks to fly when i tried the food, but I really didn't like it. Ya, the BBQ wasn't bad, but nothing special. Too bad the BBQ sauce was terrible, would've made the BBQ fantastic if it was good. Baked bean's were not good. I was able to eat the mac salad. I don't think I've"ve ever gone out to eat at a place and liked the mac salad. in the end, I would have to say I would never go back there to eat again, unless my family was going there to get together and celebrate something.

I come here every single time that I have visited San Diego. Great barbecue food...ribs with juicy meat that literally slides off the bone...loaded with sauce and you can always ask for more! All the meat sits on top of some yummy fries which are just as good as the meat! You have to try the colossal onion rings...crunchy with a different type of batter. Finger licking good...don't bother grabbing forks and knives. Lots of options on the menu plus sides. Service has been great...someone always greets you at the beginning of the line and directs you to order so it's not hectic even when it gets busy. (There can be a long line! So decide to go early or call in your order to go...) might be hard to find a table if you are going during busy hours...especially with s big group, but so far no trouble for me!! YUM!

This place is probably one of the yummiest bbq i've ever eaten, but I minus one start because their bbq sauce was really salty. I'd the the meat is very well cooked and could really stand on its own without the BBQ sauce. The beef ribs was HUGE and AMAZING! I'd come back again but maybe ask the BBQ sauce on the side? :)

I drove all the way from SF to try this place out and everything else in San Diego.  It was worth it!  I didn't expect a full scale restaurant though.  In SF, if you go to a good barbecue joint, it's a mom n pops' hole in the wall.  I was watching game 2 of the SF/TX game and there were TV's everywhere, self-serve beverage machines, and plenty of seating for the whole family.  The food is seriously good.  I haven't had anything like this in SF yet.

I haven't had BBQ in a while but let me state that I was super excited to hit up this BBQ place.  I've heard nothing but a lot of good things about this place so I'm already coming into this place with really high expectations.  First thing that I noticed about this place was that their lines were out the door and around the first corner of the restaurant.  I was already ready to turn around but, let me tell you, don't let that line fool you.  There's a sign that says that at the corner outside of the restaurant it's only a 20 minute wait from there.  That's not bad if you ask me since most of the time I'm already waiting for 25 minutes or so for Chili's (and Chili's isn't even all that!).  I noticed that the service there, except for the person that was on my register, were really friendly.  There's a guy Louis there, gotta let him know that dude was real cool.  Anyway, I got a half order of Baby Back Ribs (which I heard were THE thing to get when it's your first time there), a side of potato salad and fresh cole slaw.  The misses got the same except a quarter order of baby back ribs, macaroni salad, corn and fries.  I got a side order of BBQ sauce cause' I love my sauces!!   The ribs were daaaaamn good.  They were mesquite cooked and you can really taste it.  It's not a hint of it, you can TASTE it.  I really liked that cause' I think it really made it that much better.  The meat just fell off the bone.  asldkjas83l  Excuse me, I had to wipe the saliva off of the keyboard real quick.  The BBQ sauce was thinner than I would've liked because I'm really into the thicker BBQ sauces.  However, it was tangy, a little sweet, and didn't overtake the mesquite flavor of the meat.  The potato salad was just alright, I wasn't a huge fan of it.  The cole slaw tasted fine so no complaints there.  The fries were okay just like any other fries that you'd have.  The sides didn't really stick out to me with the exception of the potato salad where it was below average.  The portions are pretty good.  I think on a hungry day I would only be able to handle the half baby back ribs anyway. If I could take some home after my trip, I would love to do that.  I wouldn't want to put them in my bags for under the plane and I doubt that they'd let those saucy things on the plane so I just might have to grub on some ribs as they x-ray my whole body.  Nom nom nom!

I was promised by my dear friend I will enjoy good food in SD.  Phil's bbq did just that for lunch.  We came to the restaurant at the right time before it got super busy.  I have been told line is always at the door and can go as long as around the block.  Luckily, we got a table right away.  I had chicken and baby back ribs with a side of baked potato with cheese inside.  Great flavor on bbq sauce, the meat falls right off the bone.  Service was quick and staff was attentive.  If you love BBQ, this place should be on your list to visit in SD.

Delicious and a great value.  Decided to stop by after seeing it on Man Vs Food, and ordered the Tickler and decided to split the Tri-Tip with the bf.  We certainly didn't need it - the Tickler was more than enough food - 2 large onion rings (which the breading stayed on it perfectly), 3 ribs (but had 4 huge pieces of meat on them), delicious cole slaw that may have been the best I've ever had, and fries! We brought the Tri-Tip home and it reheated perfectly (the fries, not so much).  Expect to be in a food coma after phil's and don't let the wait scare you - it's totally worth it.

Everything I'd say has been said before a thousand times over.  Awesome!  I love the pulled pork sandwich and they have great onion rings too.  The cole slaw is actually pretty good and I'm disgustingly picky about cole slaw.  Ribs will be on my plate next time, gotta try them out.  On my last trip I had the tri-tip sandwich and while it was okay it really wasn't my favorite.  That still won't stop me from giving Phil's what it deserves, 5 stars and a big thank you!

Definitely had left overs which tasted great later that night too. I will comeback to phils next time Im in the area. I just hope they can control the line better then.

The food we ordered was delicious and tasted like it was made with love. The lady greeting everyone was REALLY nice and asked if we had been there before, since we hadn't she gave us some instructions on how things worked.

i been eating here since they opened wayyy back then. and its always been consistent every single time. i used to order the full rib dinner then over the years i slowly get smaller and smaller portions of food. i guess the older you get the less you eat. now a days all i do get is just the beefy ribs and some onion rings to share. the onion rings here are amazing. i always get a small order everytime i highly recommend getting it. the wait times do get crazy, i use to be able to say its worth the wait but if you are a local you can go during the off peak hours and there wont be much of a wait. but if you are here from out of town or something or taking friends or family here for the first time. its always worth the wait haha. service is amazing here cant say that enough. the staff here are the nicest people you will meet.

There is staff that comes around and check if you need anything- all of them are really friendly. It is a very casual place but its a pretty exciting place to eat since everyone is so happy. On a side note, their bathrooms are pretty cool with those airport hand dryers and sanitary door handles (you kinda have to see it to understand).

phills frikin bbq. o em gee. For a good 2 weeks, I craved this stuff. My friends usually get the baby back, but i'm a beef ribs type of girl. The "best of both" is my usually dish with my choice consisting of half chicken and 2 beef bones + large side of beans (I like to fill me belly up with bomski meat, not the filler). The teaser is usually too small for me (meat portion wise). It gives either 3 baby back or 1 beef ribs with sides of cole slaw, fries, and 2 onion rings. But, like i said, I go to phills for the BBQ, not the eh sides. But, if you're the type of person who doesn't care what your belly gets filled with just as long it's food, get 2 teasers instead of the dinner meal options. You'll have a MASSIVE PILE of fries, cole sale, and 4 onion rings which would fill you up plenty. Dinner time the line gets FRIKIN LONG. So, I always try to go at the awkward times like 3-4:30. I love my phills, but i over 45 minutes of waiting is gg in my book no matter how good it might be.

Great place, great service, great food! Definitely a must try when your in the San Diego area. The lines are sometimes loop around the building, but it's worth it. I remember coming here once when it was raining and the line literally looped twice! My first time going here was great, but I couldn't stop going here because of their addicting secret BBQ sauce! Beefy ribs + fries = done.

I came here this past saturday, we were at SD for long weekend and my friend suggested that we have to try this place. We had to wait about 20-30 minutes in line; me and my friend ordered 16 babyback ribs... its prolly the most delicious ribs that i ever had in my life so far & im not a big fan of ribs to began with. I would give it a "4" star if the wait was shorter.

It doesn't need anymore reviews, but I'm going to give one anyways. Well, I went there around 8pm on a Saturday after my visit at Sea World.  I was honestly complaining about having to wait in a long line to get into the restaurant because I'm not the type of person who is willing to wait 2 hours for just food.  But surprisingly, the wait wasn't that long; I guess because the line only went around the store, and other days it goes further than that.   I ordered a full rack of ribs with two small sides.  The meat was tender, it was easy to eat.  The coleslaw is not my favorite, and the BBQ sauce isn't all that unless you like the taste of tang.  But still it's a place I would wait in line for. Just to let you know, it's not a place where someone is going to seat you, you order at the register and find a seat yourself unless you're a big party then the employees will find the seats for you.   To conclude, the price isn't all that bad either.  My boyfriend and I ordered for each of us the Baby Back Ribs, full orders that are 10 to 12 bones, with two side orders.  It cost us around $42.00.   It was enough for both of us to finish.

I know much has been written by many folks, most of it very positive.. and this review is no different.  I've been eating at Phil's since the hole-in-the-wall days, and even though they've grown and expanded, the line is STILL out the door and around the corner.  The best BBQ - hands down- I've had outside of Memphis. Every time friends or family come to down this is our first stop, and when they return it's the first place they want to eat.

Ok so all Yelpers that said get there early weren't lying!  Holy cow what a long line that wrapped around the adjoining buildings.  We didn't feel like waiting so we went into the takeout line where there was a very short wait.  We ordered,  grabbed a drink at the bar and then our food was ready in 10 minutes.  The wet ribs were SO good!  My fiance had the dry rub ribs and I wouldn't suggest those.  They serve local brews at the bar which I rathered liked.  All in all if you're in the area you got to stop by here.

Very long wait. Food was good but not worth the 1.5 hour wait.  The full rack of beef ribs seem smaller than normal. The sauce is spicier than expected.  If I were to ever go again, I would phone in the order for pick up and eat it in the parking lot watching the people wait 1.5 hours for BBQ.

I've been here a few times ~ once during the lunch hour, not much of a wait ~ and another time for the dinner rush. OKAY, let me just say that I didn't particularly enjoy that part ... but I did LOVE the food. The Onion Rings are scrumptious and the prices are pretty decent. Beware ~ they serve in large portions ... or you can have yummy leftovers! Either way TOO YUMMY!!

One of the best BBQ I ever had. I've came here several time, at first being introduced by my roommates and then later me introducing others to come. Its a little pricey, but boy is it worth it. However be warned, the line can get extremely long. I have seen it warp around the building and stretching all the way to the end of those other buildings on the same side of the sidewalk. There's a good selection of meals, ranging from burgers to plates of ribs. I would opt for the full dinner b/c I can sample everything. In my defense, I am a heavy meat eater so this place is like paradise. The atmosphere is very ambient. There's also a bar so its great to bring some friends to enjoy some games which would make a great outing. Despite how popular the place is, the waiters never try to rush you to finish eating and leave to make rooms for the customers who are waiting outside. Its just a matter of customer courtesy if you so choose to. I can't wait to go back with some friends if I'm down at SD again!

We came here for dinner after having visited SeaWorld. With 4.5 stars out of 2,400+ reviews, we figured hey why not. What can go wrong? Well, just a wait of about 1.5 to 2 hours long. I guess that's about normal for a 6:30 pm visit. Here's a good tip (which we learned -- after having to wait over an hour -- from a friend who lives around the SD area): if you have  a small party (less than 6), just go to the Bar area and wait for seats to become available and grab the first one you can get your ASS on. It will save you time. You can order the same food in the bar as you would if you were seated elsewhere in the restaurant. The plus side is you're closer to the beer.  Now as for the food, the BBQ Pork Spareribs are, without a doubt, one of the best. They are tender, and indeed, more tangy than sweet. The Beefy Ribs aren't as impressive but they were good. As for the sides, the fries and onion rings are okay but the coleslaw was pretty good. Overall, worth to try but expect to wait in line. Update 3/28/2011, an hour after the original review: I accidentally gave this the 3 stars when it deserves more so I updated it to 4. I would also like to mention that the customer service is exceptional; especially at the bar, the tenders were very attentive and catered to our needs. Our food was ready after 15 minutes and that's for a party of 12. Thanks, Phil.  You sure have earned my recommendation and a second visit.

My husband and I finally decided to try Phil's today, since it's a week day and the line wasn't wrapped around the building. I thought it was going to be a typical restaurant that seats you and gives you a menu....I didn't know you had to order at a counter "McDonald's style", then walk in circles trying to find a table....but finally we found a good one...the bar area had NO seats available :(. The food was very good and well worth the money, but when my husband brought our beers to the table I was not impressed with the temperature! I love an ice cold beer, and these Coronas weren't very cold! Also.....why in the world does this big - over hyped - constantly crowded restaurant only have a one-person restroom????

AMAZING!!!! My husband and I went to San Diego for our honeymoon and made it a point to eat at Phils BBQ.  We had seen it on tv on the popular show Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives.  We are both from Texas and know a thing our two about good BBQ.  We are very picky about our BBQ, and when we left, we were both very satisfied with our experience.  The service was great and so was the food.  The hostess talked to us about the different entrees that they offer and gave us a run down of the most popular dishes.  I got the El Toro and it was enough for me to eat and get full, plus bring home the extra for another good size sandwich that night.  My husband got The Broham and was more than pleased with it.  The small side of fries is enough for a small football team to share.  Great food! We have several times thought about going back, but our time is limited in San Diego, and we are trying to hit all the local hole in the wall joints.

The best BBQ I've ever eaten!! There is a reason why this place is always super packed. I've been eating here ever since they had their small location in Hillcrest. I'm so glad they expanded to their new location. I usually order their baby back ribs. The meat is super tender and flavorful. Then you add some of their bbq sauce and you'll be in heaven. Their sides are also delish. I love their onion rings with buttermilk ranch, fries and mac salad. Other than their ribs, I have enjoyed their El Toro sandwich and grill chicken. It's very flavorful and juicy. I have also met Phil a long time ago. He is really friendly and seems like a great guy. I am very thankful to him for opening his restaurant and sharing his oh so yummy bbq goodness.

I think Phils used to be better. Either that or the crowds just detract from the overall experience. I think the prices are fair and average and the food is average as well, but I definitely do not think that the lines and searching for a table are worth it in the long run. Weekdays during non-peak hours are worth it, but I would never stand in line for more than 15 minutes to eat here.

Best BBQ joint in San Diego IMO.  The baby back ribs are awesome along with their beef ribs.  Portions are huge and the meat isn't dry to the bone like a lot of other BBQ places I've been to.  If I had to rank my favorite BBQ places, I'd rank this up there with Lucille's and Memphis BBQ.  My only complaint, during busy nights it might be hard to find seating, but hey, it's busy and packed for a reason right? ;)

Was in town, and cousin took me here for the ribs.  Sat at the bar area to avoid the line. Had both the beefy ribs and the baby back ribs.. both fall off the bone delicious,  decent smoke, . a little too much sauce for my liking, I personally like it when they don't slather/bathe  the sauce on it, and i can add to it... didn't bother with the sides, but got the onion rings, nice crunchy, and not too oily.  Washed down with pitcher of Arrogant Bastard...was in Meat Heaven all afternoon.

I've written reviews of Phils before.  Always a good review.  Don't think I wrote about the last 2 times we went, both not so good.  Most recent was this past weekend.  My cousin, her bf and son were visting from LA.  Her bf chose to eat at Phils.  We had taken them here about 4 months ago and wanted again.  My husband and I hadn't eaten here in a few months so treated them to dinner.   OMG.  I know we've waited in a line there several times before.  Maybe 30 minutes was the longest, but this past visit we waited 1 hour 20 minutes!  We had driven from CV and didn't want to waste gas for nothing and when you crave BBQ, thats what you want.  I was about to tell them to lets just to to Red Lobster or something!  It was ridiculous.  Once inside, we realized, it was because of the Laker game.  Dang!  When people are done eating they need to leave and watch the game at home.  Lol.  There was a ton of people just waiting for a table.  A ton of people who were just standing to watch the game.  So finally got inside and ordered.  Spent $68 for 4 adults, 1 child and 1 baby.  Seems pricey, but the portions are big...well they usually are.  I always order the same thing...half rib baby back dinner with macaroni salad and french fries and I almost never finish it.  But this time...I had tiny ribs, 2 of them were burnt.  And hardly any macaroni salad and fries.  My daughter and I ate the whole thing.  If you order the same meal anywhere else, it would be twice as much though.  We had to wait for the game to end to get our table too.   Staff is super friendly.  Big black lady always at front seating us...super, duper nice.  My male cashier taking my order was super nice and funny and cute.  Ha.   What I dont understand is why Phil doesn't open up a larger restaurant.  Or maybe even another location...like say in the Southbay area?  Ha.  Seriously though.  A ton of people in SD love it and people drive miles to come here.  So why not?

I love Phil's! The sometimes 1-hour line is definitely worth it when you are in the mood for smoky meat with gobs of barbecue sauce. Here are some must-haves: - Onion rings: Beautifully fried sweet onions. Delicious with the ranch sauce. - Beef ribs: Fall off the bone tender and not fatty. - Baby back ribs: My personal favorite ... delicious! - Grilled corn: Never overcooked, always sweet. Especially good with butter, then sprinkled with the cajun seasoning provided at the table. All the other sides are pretty regular ... fries, potato salad, macaroni salad, etc. I'm also not too impressed with the chicken ... seems like regular chicken with BBQ sauce dumped on it. Here's a heads up. If you are planning to head over to Phil's, go online to their website to take a look at the length of the line so you can prepare yourself for the wait.

This place has a some delicious BBQ.  We went on a Sunday afternoon, despite the tips from other yelpers.  Surprisingly the wait was not bad a all.  We got in line and were ordering within 15 minutes.  We ordered a bunch of food since there was 7 in our party.  We got two orders of beefy, two orders of baby back, an order of chickless chicken and a side of fries, a side of onion rings, a side of mac salad, a side of potato salad and a corn on the cob.  It was a lot of food.  The food came out, or should I say out to the counter fairly quickly.  Despite the large order, I don't think we waited more than 15 minutes for our food.  Other BBQ places take upwards of 30 minutes for your food to be ready.  Four of us had to go to the counter to pick up all of our food.  Upon returning to our table in the patio the grubbing commenced.  The beefy rib was very moist and flavorful.  There where nice bits of chard meat mixed in with the moist and juicy beef.  They were not fall of the bone tender, but the beefy ribs were good.  The baby back rib was very tender but the flavor of the meat was a little more subtle.  It was also moist, but not as moist at the beefy.  But its not really fair to compare beef ribs and baby back pork ribs.  All I can say is, you should try both and pick your favorite.  I am partial to the beefy.  The sides were good.  I was very fond of the onion rings and the fries.  The onion rings were like home made, you know there is an onion in there and the batter was simple in a good way.  The best way to describe the fries is, there were like in-n-out fries but thicker.  They had that distinct fresh potato taste which is rare in many french fries nowadays.  The mac salad and the potato salad were ok, in my opinion.  But other in my party were very fond of the potato salad.  The service was good.  They don't really do much for you though.  But they are friendly and very attentive.  They brought us ranch and extra BBQ sauce and offered to help us carry some of they platters to the table, but we came prepared.  But why would I only give them four stars?  Well, I'm definitely a fan of this place.  Some of the best BBQ I've had in a while.  Probably on par with Famous Dave's and definitely leagues ahead of Lucille's.  Now only if they served rice, I'd give them an extra star.  Because as you know, Filipinos like rice with everything especially meat. Would I go back? I'd like to, but the 70 miles trek will most likely not be made often.  Only if they would branch out to OC.

Phil's BBQ is definitely worth the wait.  The line on a Sat night extended to all the way to the back of the restaurant.  We were comtemplating whether or not to wait when my friends said the call in pick up line is only a 20 min wait vs. the 1.5 hr long line so that's exactly what we did.  We ordered 2 full racks of ribs, 1/2 a chicken and onion rings to go.   The meat was tender and the  surprisingly, the chicken was really moist.  The sauce was the perfect tangy with a kick of spicy.  I will definitely come back if I have the chance and call in my order.

It's the best baby back ribs I've had in San Diego.  The bbq sauce was a little too overwhelming -- maybe they slopped on too much, which is my only complaint.  Other than that, if you're looking for good ribs that just fall off the bone, this is the place to go.  The line is always long, but it moves fast.  Just have someone scout out a table while you're in line!

Pork Heaven! I LOVE Phil's. In fact, one of the few things that is memorable about the three years I lived in San Diego was Phil's. The pork ribs are show stoppers, and I would recommend just diving in and splurging on a full order of the ribs. The mouth watering meat is tender and falls right off the bone. It is slathered in spicy and sweet BBQ, and there is even some honey in there. I couldn't imagine a better set of ribs. They would convert even the most stubborn of vegans into a meat eater and become a true believer! Equally delicious are the yummy fresh cut fries. I usually get a double order of that, since you get two side options with the full order. I don't particularly care for the other side accouterments, but some friends of mine like the beans. I, personally, do not care for them. I would, however, recommend steering clear of the beef ribs. Honestly, there is nothing to write home about them. Too much bone, not enough meat, and fatty without all the delightful flavor the pork brings! Also, the line can be long, if ordering take away, make sure to call in advance. But any negatives are quickly swept away by it's powerhouse pork ribs. Phil's is awesome!

Can I get a BBQ Amen??????????? I want to be baptized in Phil's BBQ sauce it's that good.  I had the beef and chicken combo where you get a little bit of moo and cluck with 2 sides (I picked the fresh cut fries and the coleslaw) for a decent price if i do say so.  The size of my plate was like a trough when it came out!!!  I had two large beef ribs, chunks of boneless chicken and fries and slaw. So good I wanted to hump the chefs leg.My friend didn't think I could eat the whole thing but I did....like a champion!!!!!! Try it!

By far the best ribs place I have ever been to, and arguably the best in Southern California! It can get a bit hectic and the wait may be long to get in, but man is it worth it. Their Baby Back ribs are drenched in BBQ sauce, and their Beef Ribs are amazingly good with a lot of meat. The sides are delicious as well, especially their macaroni salad and onion rings! Their bar has a decent selection of beers, but definitely come here for the ribs. YUM YUM YUM. Most of the time I make a trip to SD, I want to give a quick visit to Phils, because I know it will satisfy my cravings for ribs :)

The sides are great, the portions of BBQ are huge, and the prices are very reasonable, but it's just not worth the line you have to stand in. I've had the same BBQ at many other places, but maybe it's because San Diego is lacking in decent restaurants, but the line is not worth standing in. Get there around 5 Tues-Thursday or get takeout.

So I was attracted to this place due to the large number of high ratings on Yelp.  I went there around six and was expecting a lonnnng line but was pleasantly surprised.  When waiting outside the aroma of the bbq was great.  I was greeted by an affable staff and the menu was nice and simple.  I decided to order the baby back rib chickless dinner, which I recommend to anyone for their first order.  Needless to say the food was delicious.   If you haven't made it to Phils bbq then you are definitely missing out.

The simple fact that there are 1195 reviews should tell you something. If your ever in SD, this is the place to be. Well maybe not the place to be but its a must stop place, if you like bbq, that is. Their ribs are finger-licking good, their cole slaw, hands down!  Prices are reasonable. A well portioned half rack of ribs and two sides plate will cost you about $14. The full rack is about $20. There is also chicken and other stuff to choose from but the ribs are the must-haves! The only downer is the LOOOONG line to get in but totally worth it!

Tasty BBQ.  Great sides.  Like everybody else says: the onion rings were exceptional.  A little too much sauce for me on the beef ribs.  Next time I would get the sauce on the side (and probably not even use it).  Get there early or you WILL be waiting in line.

I'm not a fan of BBQ but this place is my boyfriend's favorite BBQ joint so I gave it a shot, I am glad to say it's awesome! The chicken is tender and BBQ sauce is delicious. Onion rings and fries are amazing. The people and staff are very friendly and welcoming. Overall a great place for BBQ.

How do I even start?!  First of all I would like to say I am a Phils BBQ regular!  This is the best place in San Diego to have delicious bbq ribs!  The sauce is spectacular making every bite incredible.  Don't miss out on the onion rings!  Let me say that I don't eat onions, the only place I will eat onion rings is at Phils!  If  you havent been here, you are missing out on a lot.  There is usually a line to get in, especially on weekends, but the wait time is worth it all!

I literally came from San Francisco for this! Well... not really. Anyway, my friend took us here after we arrived. I ordered the half rack pork ribs dinner with the baked potato. The ribs were mind boggling! The meat came right off the bone as my teeth got a grip of it. It was amazing! Oh yeah, the BBQ sauce on the ribs were GOOD! It was sweet with a bit of spiciness to it. As for the baked potato, it could have been a lot better, but it was just dry. I tried my girlfriends fries which were pretty good. Overall Phil's BBQ must be one of the best baby back rib restaurant I've been to! I like the whole concept of the restaurant: wait in line, order, find an open table, wait for your pager to call your order. Oh yeah, they clean up the tables pretty quick!

The bbq sauce on my ribs was a bit too tangy for my taste buds. Minus one star. The service was not of my expectation. I guess its because I got stuck with a bad waiter. Minus another star. All the other waiters looked like they were having a good time with their customers. The onion rings didn't have any taste and the fries were too salty. The wait was about 20-30 minutes. My boyfriend recommended this place because he said its the best BBQ in SD. I can't say they're the best because my ribs were a bit burnt, but they did taste better as leftovers the next day.

finger-licking good! but if you're like me (eye too big for mouth!) you'll probably be so stuffed you won't even bother licking your fingers. i got the full baby back ribs with 2 small sides. BARELY touched the sides of fries and cole slaw. i have this determination problem where if i'm determined then i'll do it no matter what...kinda wish i didnt now...somehow i finished all the ribs and i swear to you i couldnt move after. the ribs were damn good especially if you love bbq, and that's coming from me...im not even a big of a fan on ribs. however i am a fan of stuffing myself with as much food as possible. guranteed you'll leave here stuff but it's not cheap... we came around 1pm on a sunday and waited in line for a good 30mins atleast. drink+baby rib+sides came out to be 23 dollars. to quote a friend "i feel like i got a baby cow in me"

I am so picky with meat! But this place was so good, their meat wasn't over or under cooked it was just right. Though its out of what I would pay for ribs it was good. The cole slaw was the best I ever had. The wait for me was about 45mins and even the ones we took home were still good. Since I live far I bought the sauce and seasoning to make me own and its awesome. The take home food was good and that's very surprising! Five stars for me is even more rare I'm horribly picky.

After a long day at the beach, I was really excited to come here...it did not let me down. 5 stars all the way! I shared with a friend and we got the full baby back ribs with some fries.

A sign to tell you how long the wait is....its like a ride at disneyland.  But it is definitely worth the wait.  The two times that I came here there was a line so I did the next smartest thing...call in your order.  The wait 20 minutes...what you should get the fall-off the bone ribs and chicken...so delicious.  Over the weekend we also ordered a tri-tip sandwich to try...would love to tell you how it tastes but a doggie ate it during our photo shoot before we got to try it.  Maybe next time I"ll get to try it.  This place is a must when in SD!

Well if 1500+ people tell you to check this place out, you really should stop reading and go eat some lip-smackin' BBQ. Period. We've been loyal Phil (and Jeff!) fans since the Goldfinch days and all I can add is that their Caesar Salad is a MUST.  Why people don't talk about this salad of anchovy-flavored goodness is beyond me.  So in addition to the ribs (beef, baby back or boneless chunks of goodness) order their Caesar Salad----Welcome To Flavor Country!

Got the full baby back ribs.  I like the soft texture and the cole slaw's pepery kick but the flavor wasn't good.  The sweet beans were subtly sweet and were tasty. Nothing all that great because I didn't like the sauce at all.  They should put the sauce on the side as a default.  Would like to give a higher rating but 3.5 wasn't available.  The lines are SUPER long and the place is packed.  The price is decent.

I came here yesterday w/my bf & some friends & we were all completely underwhelmed after all the hype.  The line wrapped around the building & despite the wait time sign that read about 21 minutes, our wait was significantly longer than that from that point.  You order & pay first & then go find a place to sit.  We split up our group so that 2 of us went to order & the other two looked for seating but seating was that difficult to find.  The real hold up is ordering.   As for the food, my bf & I shared a full rack of baby back ribs, a large side of steamed veggies, large potato salad, & onion rings for the table.  The portions were just enough to fill me up & was around $35 w/tax&tip for the 2 of us.  Surprisingly, the veggies were probably one of the better selections.  Came with broccoli, zucchini, yellow squash, cauliflower & carrots.  The onion rings were a little over-battered for me but that's just preference.  I know plenty of ppl who like their batter heavy.  The ribs were definitely not what I expected.  Fell off the bone, yes, but not juicy! We noticed that they were actually pretty dry.  The sauce was alright, tasted like apple cider vinegar & they did a good job of putting just the right amount on.  It's also just the right amount of spiciness.  All in all, dinner was good but I'm not sure I would ever go back if there's a wait especially since I feel like i could get a similar if not better dinner elsewhere.  There was even a wait for the pick-up to-go orders!

This place has really high rating on yelp which made me wanna give it a try.  The first thing that I noticed when we arrived was the long line of waiting (was told that the wait should be at least 45 mins to an hour) so we decided to order to go and ate in the car.  We ordered the baby back ribs with two sides of cole slaw and mashed potato, and the onion rings.  The ribs are really tasty!!!  I really hope there will be one BBQ house in LA that can be compared to Phil's BBQ in term of quality.  One word in summary:  GREAT!!!

Phil's! Phil's! Phil's! LOVE this place! Well, since only 1500 other people have written a review, I figured I'd throw mine in as well, just to help people make their decision. If you haven't eaten at Phil's- GO THERE NOW. If you have eaten at Phil's- go tonight for dinner! Phil's has the best BBQ I've ever had. And I live in the south. The sauce is so sweet and so spicy, a perfect complement to the tender, delicious meat it covers. Excellent sides, cool atmosphere, big-ass drinks with free refills, you can't go wrong. Every time I go in, I get the platter with 1/2 ribs and 1/2 chicken with baked beans and an order of onion rings. The onion rings are beer battered, crispy and crunchy, HUGE, and you get a massive pile for a small price. Also thoroughly enjoy the baked beans and coleslaw, but the real star of this place is the BBQ. You can get the chicken cooked many different ways, I usually go with the chunk-less, which is just chopped up pieces of chicken, although the chicken breast is also very, very good. If you're going to eat at Phil's, though, you HAVE to eat the ribs. Fall off the bone, so tender and juicy, and the sauce... Oh, the sauce! This place is THE BEST! Of course, you have to time your meal here just right, as it will get PACKED. They shuffle people in to take orders, but they do not seat you, so you have to find your own table, and people really take their time to eat here, so you may get your food and not have a place to sit, so be prepared. Huge place, lots of seating (indoor and out), and seats in Phil's Beer-B-Q, but still, this place gets full. But it's oh so worth it... go in hungry, try to stay positive, and once you get your food, sit and enjoy. And get ready to come back many, MANY times.

Wow..we came here 4:30pm on a Friday and there was already line out the door.  The BBQ back was yummy.  The portions are huge so I decided to get the Rib Ticker.  That is enough food and the onion rings fit around my wrist.  Flavor was awesome and not greasy at all.  I'm definitely stopping by the next time I'm in SD.

Look at the constant line wrapped around the restaurant and believe the hype. This place is delicious.  I can't claim to be a bbq expert and doesn't a bbq restaurant in San Diego just sound weird. But this place has perfected some glorious beef and pork ribs. I've never had the chicken but my friends have enjoyed them.  Get your order with a side of baked beans it macaroni salad. Their potato salad and fries are also great choices. And for your own good, don't forget to get yourself a bib.

I hate BBQ, but I went to this place on vacation with my BF to humor him, and I have to say I enjoyed it. We had seen this place on Man Vs. Food and it has great reviews, so we dropped in. The line was out the door and around the corner, so we opted for the bar. I order the Chick-Less Dinner with chunks of white meat seasoned and bbq'd with Cole Slaw and Fresh Cut Fries. We had a bathtub-sized side order of the onion rings. HEAVEN ON EARTH. This place was definitely worth the wait!

Alright, so everyone in the world has already reviewed and loved this place! I got to Phil's around 9pm on a Saturday night and the line was really long. We were told it'd be an estimated 45 minutes to get seated. From the line, we decided to call for takeout, got our food 20 minutes later, and went to someone's apartment to eat. The people there were REALLY nice and the food was good and generously portioned! Minus one star for long lines and long waits. I wish I had had time to stay longer and actually eat inside.

Oh those ribs!  Fantastic rub followed by the almost perfect sauce.  Nice balance of sweet and vinegar.  Fall off the bone but not mushy or too loose.  The only short fall is the lack of smoke.  Re heated on a grill adds nice grilled flavor but dried out some parts.  Pass on the beans, just wrong texture and lacking in taste.  Not worth the 2hr plus wait that seems to be a daily occurrence.  Get take out and be earing in less than 15 min!

I always have to come here when I'm in the area. I love their beef ribs! They're so tender, flavorful, and the meat practically comes off the bone with very little effort. The staff is extremely friendly. The baby back ribs and chicken are also pretty good but my favorite would have to be the beef ribs. The fries, onion rings, and corn on the cob are average, nothing special, but definitely goes well with the ribs. This place is ALWAYS packed so expect a long wait. Well worth it though!

As you can tell, everybody says this place is great. So I'm not going to waste your time and I'm cutting to the chase: We had baby back ribs, onion rings (large size), macaroni salad, and el toro sandwich. There's nothing more you need. Though, I heard that some people really enjoy full beef ribs or something like that. I will try next time and report back. But you must get ONION RINGS and the EL TORO SANDWICH. They're good, and relatively inexpensive. It's like.. $7 for each, but the portions are quite large and always super tasty. Bon Appetit! ps, expect long lines. it's always busy. however, it's part of the experience as you talk with friends, family, or make new friends! no wait for bar though!

After hearing the hype about Phil's for so many years, we finally got in there to give it a try. Well, it wasn't worth the hype. I got the baby back ribs, my other half got the pork sandwich. The dry rub on the ribs was good and the meat was tender enough, but the sauce is nasty. It's that vinegar-based Southern Style sauce. YUCK. My other half found the sandwich to be okay as well but also thought the meat was a bit dry/stringy. So now we've tried Phil's and know that when we want BBQ the only place to go is BBQ House in Ocean Beach. Now THAT'S some fantastic BBQ!

I only have one word for Phils BBQ, "WOW".  And that's a compliment from a girl who doesn't eat cow or pig and def doesn't eat lots of BBQ. I can't believe how amazing your food actually is. It's no wonder there is ALWAYS a line wrapped around the restaurant every time I drive bye. I picked up some ribs and chicken w/ beans and mac salad for my boyfriend the other night and he was also pleasantly surprised at how tender the meat was.The only thing that disappointed me was that the mac salad was actually better than mine, and i'm pretty well known for my sides. We will forever be long time patrons of this establishment and are soooo happy we finally decided to give it a try. TOTALLY worth the wait, just see for yourself....

Every time we take a trip to San Diego we always stop by here. The lines get really long but the line moves pretty fast. I am a beef rib type of girl so that's always a part of my order. Since we don't live around the area every time I order I tend to order the whole menu. Everything is pretty good. I was surprise that there burger was sooo yummy also. The only thing I was not fond of was the El Toro sandwich.The BBQ sauce on there tasted different from what they put on the ribs so if you get the El Toro ask for the BBQ sauce on the side so you can try it before putting it on your sandwich. Other than that this place is a winner!

Oh Phil's BBQ...I ate so much here I had food coma on the way home.  Had their tri tip sandwich, the best of both worlds baby back ribs and chickless chicken with the mac salad, french fries, and onion rings.  EVERYTHING was good..the onion rings and mac salad were probably the best I've ever had.  The chicken was so tender and the meat on the baby back ribs easily came off the bone.  It was so good I even had some to go..and it survived the two hour drive home pretty well too.  Definitely going to be going here whenever i'm in SD.

This place was definitely 5 stars before it moved to it's new location. The new location is just as crowded, and the food is definitely not as good. I have never been a huge fan of their BBQ sauce b/c of it's sweetness and I feel it has fallen off even more since the new location opened. I gave it 3 stars only for the nostalgia of Phil's being the original BBQ spot for me in San DIego. I still give it to Phil's for their awesome Onion Rings that continue to be amazing and are still the best Onion Rings in town. But nowadays when I want some good BBQ I head over a few miles east and go to Bull's BBQ, less crowded, better sauce, and still a great atmosphere.

Great ribs.  This is my second time eating at Phil's and the BBQ items have always been outstanding.  I wasn't such a big fan of the long lines, but if you go anytime other than lunch or dinner time, the wait isn't so bad. The fries and cole slaw are solid.  Definitely check it out if you have the time.

I am not a huge fan of baby back ribs but when my boyfriend's best friend brought us here on our trip to San Diego, I can proudly say that I've converted. Permanently. The wait is usually ridiculous with the line wrapping around the restaurant. Fortunately for us, we came a bit earlier and was able to avoid the rush. My boyfriend and I split a full rack of baby back ribs, macaroni salad, beefy rib and the sweet bean thing. Our friend had the chicken which looked good but I didn't get to sample as I was so busy tearing the "fall off the bone" meaty goodness that was in front of me like a mad woman. IT WAS EFFING GOOD! I almost wanted seconds. In fact, I should have gotten seconds no matter how stuffed I was because Phil's BBQ DOES NOT DISAPPOINT! Service was friendly and very attentive. I think that was also why I enjoyed my meal so much. When you're dining in an area where the staff takes care of their customers, the meal just tastes better. Overall my first experience here was very pleasant. I will be sure to go back every time I'm in the area. You should go to!

I am not a fanatic of American food, but this one is just irresistible to me. I have been there twice, and each time I spent about 45mins to 1hour in line. It seems like that many Mexican families like to held their family part tere; so, a group of people before you might up to 20 people. However, a group of two sometimes can get the seat faster at bar area. Well, about their food: My favorite is their tender and tasty beefy rib, others are just OK.

Hands down the best BBQ in San Diego.  I've been coming to Phil's back when they were on Goldfinch.  Now i think his bathroom is bigger than the old place.  Meat falls off the bones, the fries are to die for.  I usually go back and forth between the Rib-tickler, 3 bones with fries, onion rings and slaw,The Broham sandwich, pulled pork, on a bun served with slaw on top, also you have to get fries with this one.  Both are great value's.

Last year after my poor review the manager contacted me. I explained the situation to him and his replies showed that he earnestly wanted to fix things. He asked me to come back and I told him I would. Well, I finally came back and I am glad I did. I came in with the same circumstances as last time. By myself, at around 11:30am and sat at the bar area again. This time I was able to get an order in immediately. The guy who took my order was courteous and quick. I was in and out of the place in under an hour. Compared to the last time I was there that is a massive improvement. This time I had a BBQ Broham sandwich with colossal onion rings. The food came out very quickly. It was excellent and with the coleslaw the flavor was balanced. The onion rings are a definite must.

So, having just written my review for (UGH! YUK!) Abbey's Real Texas BBQ, it made me remember to add my humble review to the thousands of raving fans for Phil's. Everything here is DELISH. The ribs are tender, the side dishes are awesome...all of them! Good chicken, good everything. If you dine in, it's hard to get anyone's attention if you need something that's not on your table. Also, the wait is usually atrocious. I know they can't help it, it's just because they're popular...but I just don't like to wait! But still, there aren't too many good bbq places in SD, Phil's is definitely one of them, and I'll keep going back. I just try to get there as early as possible! Also: Both me and a friend have at different times ordered Phil's for parties through their catering service, and WOW, do they ever take care of you. We both learned that you can pretty much order about 3/4 of what you think you need, because we had BOATLOADS of leftovers (Yum!). They packaged up the food very nicely, provided plates, plasticware, wetnaps, a TON of extra sauce. Perfect!!!

Hands down my favorite bbq in Califonia. I used to eat their bbq up to 4 times a week when I was a student at UCSD. I frequently drive down from Los Angeles just for the food. It's that good. The pork ribs are simply amazing. The meat is always tender and delicious. The sauce is one of a kind. I always make sure to purchase a bottle. I usually get the sweet beans on the side. Also make sure to try the tri-tip sandwich. The price is great, $20 for a full rack dinner. Most bbq places will charge anywhere from $26-30. Some people may have a problem with the long line but it is definitely worth the wait. There is a long line for a reason. Parking is ample and the portions are huge. You will not be disappointed.

Chickless Dinner with macaroni salad and fries. BOOM. You're welcome. Just thinking about it makes me hungry and my mouth water. Their sauce is the best part. So unique and different from any other BBQ sauce I've had and sooo good. I buy it from costco to cook at home when I can't make it to Phils. If you go on the weekends at any time or for dinner on the weekdays there will be a line and it seems to be getting longer and longer. At peak times it can be over an hour but totally worth the wait. If you haven't tried Phil's, you need to.

Once again, following the Yelp reviews, came here prepared but again, didn't have the problems other Yelpers claimed. Sunday at 9pm there was a line around the corner but the line moves very quickly and we ordered within 30 min! Well worth the wait in my heels. For the 2 of us, ordered the full dinner baby back ribs with 10 ribs and for sides we got fries and Mac salad. Also ordered a small onion rings since those seemed to be popular. The ribs were freaking amazing, just for that, everyone needs to go hear. Theres lots of meat on the bone unlike Daves Famous BBQ which barely has any meat! Now I feel robbed at Daves! That one meal is more than enough for 2. We killed the ribs first. The fries were normal, peeetu good, like the Mac salad. But I don't get the deal with the onion rings. Yes they are huge but if I ear something and can literally taste how bad it is for me cause it's super oily, that is not what I want to feel when I'm eating something. Other than that, it's good but I'll never order the onion rings again. Ate 2 n threw out the rest. Phil's has lots of advertising signs up about yelp n twitter etc so it's cool they care about the customer service. I'd give it a 5 but knocked it down one cause all the hype over the onion rings n I was disappointed. The baby back ribs were a million percent what everyone said they were. Hope they open a shop in norcal in San Jose or San Francisco!

Hell. Yes.   I don't care if I have to wait an hour in line on the weekends (which is unfortunately true)- it's so worth it (if you're in a rush, it's probably best to call-in and pick up your food instead)!  I love their ribs and seasoned fries!  Their portions are fairly big, so as a college student on a budget, I used to get the half-rack and save whatever I couldn't finish for the next day's lunch.  Try the onion rings as well- they're so good!

We  went there at 4:30pm on a Saturday. There were probably 100  people in line (no exagerration).  We waited 1 hour in line to get to order the food.  Don't be fooled by the sign that say 21 minute 33 second wait! It's longer than that.   Why in the hell would I give it 5 star! Because the food was incredible.  The baby back ribs  and beef ribs were juicy. The baby back ribs melted right off the bones when we ate it.  We also ordered the Colossal onion rings ,fries, and corn on the cob. The waiter were very attentive, and came by our table every 10 minutes.  All in all it was worth the wait.  We order 2 full orders of ribs with large sides,2 drinks, and onion rings for under 50 bucks. I believe thats a great deal.

Phil's has a good thing going!! They make really good BBQ and thats hard to find in San Diego. If your looking for true Texas BBQ this is not the place. They do have great Baby back ribs and I specially like the Rib less plater!! Basically the lazy mans BBQ!! LOL. No bones to deal with!! The only thing I don't like about Phil's is that  It's a bit chaotic in the restaurant. It's always packed, specially on weekends. You feel like your fighting to find a table and I personally could do without that. Fortunately the BBQ is good enough to put up with the Chaos once in a while!! Check it out!!

It gets four stars because number one: I'm a southerner and feel (while there are many greats) the south just does it the best - AND - the place is so crowded (and with good reason)! I'm not used to the order in line style as that's not how people back home do it, but it works for the volume. In all of SD, I haven't experienced better bbq that reminds me of hom. The ribs are great and so are the sides. I do wish, however, there were more options like fried okra, corn nuggets, and Texas style bread. I wouldn't take friends that I haven't seen in a long time to catch up, because I can't hear myself think there, but the call-in/carry out is genius! It's delicious. People seem happy to be there. The employees are real nice and I hear from friends Phil's a real delight.

Phil's BBQ is one of my very favourite restuarants. Although, I liked the Mission Hills location better, the Mid-Way one is pretty neat too. When you are there you can splurge and get a huge, delicious full dinner of beef or pork ribs (both are equally sumptuous), or you could choose a lighter, cheaper, but nonetheless tasty, sandwich (the broham is my favourite, but the chicken is good too). My entire family and most of my friends crave Phil's BBQ on a daily basis and we usually go at least once a month.

Decent for California "BBQ".  However, if you've ever had authentic BBQ from anywhere in the South beware of the following: 1.  BBQ is not smoked!!   2.  Baby-back ribs was slightly more tender than what you can find at Chilli's.. 3.  Chicken was bland and rubbery.  Drizzling a crapload of sauce does not compensate.   With that said, the onion rings are awesome!

I've eaten at nearly every BBQ restaurant in Memphis, Tennessee, from Interstate BBQ of the world renowned Jim Neely to Corky's, and Phil's blows all of them out of the water.  Relaying to the reader simply how good Phil's ribs are is impossible.  The tender meat falls right off the bone like no other.  However, the word is out about how good Phil's ribs are, so be prepared to wait in a line.  Be that as it may, Phil's BBQ is one of a kind and well worth your time, money, and appetite.

WOW!!! BBQ doesn't get any better than this. For me, BBQ was always sweet and that was, in my opinion, the reason why people liked it. Nope, not here. This place blew me away with how tender their ribs were. It was sweet without any sauce but the sauce blew it out of this world! I like the amount of side dishes they served. A LOT of fries and cole slaw for me! This place is jammed pack so don't expect to just go in. You'll be waiting 30 mins like we did but it was worth it. Abolutely loved it! Best of all, my friends all said it's a little pricy but around $14 for the half ribbed filled me up. They come with  2 huge sides!

The best of BBQ's at Phil's, it is so good!  I could eat there every day if I could take the unhealthy aspect of barbecue.  But if I can I will definitely make it out there at least every two months or so.  The ribs are cooked to perfection, they are so delicious.  The sauce is unique, somewhat spicy but not overwhelmingly spicy, a bit of a kick.   We had the privilege of meeting Phil himself, he is a great guy, super friendly and down to earth.  You have got to go eat some BBQ, don't just eat ribs......eat the best........only at Phil's.

Phil's 1000th Review! This place is simply amazing: best bbq in San Diego and some of the most desirable comfort food in the county. I have had exceptional bbq in Texas, and this joint is right up there with the greatest of them. The bbq sauce has a wonderful vinegar-based composition with just the right amount of sweetness. I recommend the El Toro sandwich (tri tip steak smothered in sauce inside a perfectly textured bun) and onion rings. I have been to Phil's a half-dozen times and never have been disappointed. With first-class, friendly service and outstanding food, you will have a memorable meal Phil's.

Crazy wait, great food.  Pork ribs were a bit burnt on the outside but that may be the style Phil is going for.  Importantly, the ribs were juicy and not overcooked.  To-go order sides seemed a bit small, and the beans left a bit to be desired.  Nothing that would keep me from coming back.

After going there for a friends birthday this afternoon and receiving the outstanding service that we did I couldn't resist jumping on Yelp and giving them a 5 star rating....They were more than happy to accommodate our large party of 12 + a wheelchair + a baby - The food was delicious and the continuous level of friendliness and attentiveness from the staff was great - what was especially interesting is how TV's in restaurants usually bug me but they didn't in this environment - with the pace of this restaurant it is easy to acknowledge the presence of the TV if you'd like or ignore them and enjoy dining with your peeps...my suggestion for dining is some ribs with the steamed veges - delicious and satisfying fo sho !!

I come here every time I visit San Diego.  Best BBQ around.  Always a line, but the line moves relatively quickly.  Never really have to wait long once you order and they try to seat large groups promptly.  When it comes to ribs and onion rings, I really can't think of a better place!

Two word: Beef Ribs. Get them! Juicy, flavor filled, tender yet cooked well. The line (about 30 minutes on a weeknight) was well worth it. Bring a couple of friends and hang out in line. The price was pretty decent too for what you get. We also had pork ribs and they were excellent as well. The rest of the reviews speak truth about this place.

I am not a rib person, but their baby backs are so good that I may become one!  I love to over the 11.95 Chickless dinner - it is 4 baby backs with a handful of large chicken breast pieces.  Phil's runs like a well-oiled machine and the long line is well worth the wait. Phil's is one place I will go again and again.  The sauce is sweet and spicy and just simply perfect.  The veggies and fries and onion rings are all great sides.  Make sure to order a Whoopie!  It is a tasty finish to a wonderful dinner. PS.  Best fries in San Diego.  Seeing that my dad is an Idaho potato farmer, I am a potato connoisseur and love the fresh fries at Phil's!

Everybody loves a good bbq, as do I.  As with most discussions around the topic of BBQ, preference always comes into play.  Location and options (alternatives) are also a realistic consideration.  Phils has always been one of the local favorites in the SD area.  But, is it really worth the notoriously long wait and lines out the door. On the whole my experiences at Phils have been very good.  For us, its almost unimaginable to not get beef ribs as well as babybacks whenever BBQ is on the menu.  I occasionally like to add bbq chicken as well, but, most places don't do the poor bird justice.  Oh, and the sides ... the sides ... mac'n'cheese, corn, french fries ... what more is there to say. To be honest, the BBQ sauce Phil's puts on its babybacks tend to be a bit more tangy (more vinegar) than I personally like.  Some people love the acidity, while I'm only ok with it.  But, in good conscience, I have to acknowledge that the bbq is consistently good, has a good balance between tenderness and "bite".  Its almost always well-prepared.   For me, complaints about the wait are always secondary, as good places will almost always have loyal patrons.  The question is whether it is worthwhile.  BBQ is at the end of the day, comfort food, and walking away feeling "comforted" and "satisfied" are as important as any other consideration.  In that department, I think Phils consistently delivers.   But is it mind shattering as far as BBQ goes?  Not by a long shot.  And it may simply be a function of proximity and location options.  Unfortunately, living in California, as great as our food options may be in most areas, I openly acknowledge that this is one area where we may fall a little short. At the end of the day, I will continue to go to Phil's should the opportunity arise when I'm in SD.  But, I will also not miss it when I'm not there.

The line feels like sea world "de ja vu". Unless you are dying to eat there, call ahead or go to the pickup line. much much faster. Beef ribs: orgasmic. Baby back (pork ribs) - mediocre at best. Sides = eh.  nothing special.

If you plan on checking this place out make sure you have plenty of time because you are going to be in line for a while...the lines are long. Well at least when I went, but I here during the week its not that bad. The good news about waiting in line is that the food is worth the wait and once you place you order you receive your food fairly quickly. I had the baby back ribs and they were awesome...I think there sides need improvement... for the sides I had potato salad and macaroni salad. I also tried the baked beans from my boyfriend's plate and I have to say they were good. Better than the salad choices.

When in San Diego.. do as the Diegans do and get yoself some Phils BBQ! The food here is definitely worth coming for and waiting in line is the least you can do to experience the best BBQ of your life. It's like waiting in line at Disneyland for the Indiana Jones ride.. you wait and wait but once you ride it.. you wanna go back in line and go at it again! Phils definitely does BBQ right..without all the hootin and hollarin of "we got the best this" or " we sell of the most that".. when they have a sign that estimates your wait time in line, you know you're at the right place for some good eatin'. I suggest studying their menu either before arrival or picking up a menu to look at while you wait in line cuz it's like an oral exam when you come up to the bank teller style ordering stations cuz I felt a little pressured to already have made my choice. Rehearse what you're going to be ordering to yourself a few times before you reach the front and you'll do just fine. Cool facts- *Cafeteria style dining.. (that means no creepy old ladies taking your order with a fake southern twang) Simply.. 1) wait in line 2) order food 3) find a table 4) pick up your order when ready 5) dig in *you can purchase jars of their BBQ sauce or dry rub *call in your order if you don't wanna wait in line.. but if it's your first time.. pay your dues and get in that line! *sign up for their email club and you get a front of the line pass for your birfday (sorry no cheesy birthday song for ya) *open late night

Phil's BBQ is definitely one of the most talked about place in SD that my friends have been telling me and I finally get to try this place. the followings are the food I've personally tried and these are my personal opinion. Beef Ribs - Juciy and tender. Perfectly cooked, perfectly executed. I'm actually surprised by this because alot of BBQ places failed at cooking beef Ribs and Phil's Definitely Aced it. A MUST ORDER! Baby Back BBQ Ribs - It's definitely a good pick. One of the better baby back ribs place in southern California. BBQ Chicken - simply plain because the chicken wasn't marinated. Yet, the bbq sauce compensated for the lack of seasoning. Onion Rings - freshly battered definitely and huge compared to others. Fries - They use freshly cut fries so they are definitely fresh fries and they resemble more to In & Out fries Overall, definitely a good experience. It meet and exceed some of my expectation. I'll go back there again for the beef ribs.

GET THE RIBS. NOT THE CHICKEN However, the wait is very long on weekend dinners (well all the time usually wait is 10+ minutes from my experience). The sides are ridiculously filling. I have yet to see a single human being who can finish a full plate by oneself (9-12? ribs and 2 sides). I can BARELY finish a half although I eat a lot. Onion rings here are ridiculous as well. They are gigantic and tasty as well. All the sides are very delicious in my opinion and when you are in San Diego area, Phil's BBQ is a place to visit at least just for the experience. Food can be a bit pricey but is very good and I highly recommend this place.

This review isn't necessary, but I will write a short one anyways. Phil's is probably the best BBQ place I've had. I LOVE the beef ribs as well as the macaroni salad. The sauce is like an addictive drug. I've had Phil's at the location as well as delivered from my friend and eaten a couple hours later. Both times were amazingly delicious. This place deserves all the hype.

This place is delicious! Although, I don't know if you want to trust my judgement because I don't eat red meat, therefore I've only had their chicken dishes. However, hearing my friends' opinions and seeing the other reviews on here prove that their pork/beef rib and chicken dishes are all amazing! I've been to Phil's twice. The first time, my friends and I went in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday, so we were seated almost immediately since there wasn't much of a line. However, our food took a bit of a wait. Here is the way they serve their food: you wait in line to order, once you order they give you one of those buzzy things that go off when your order is ready for you to pick up at the counter, then you take a seat and wait for your order to be completed and you pick it up once it is ready and take it back to your seat. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwich, along with the macaroni salad side. I have to say, I was definitely impressed. I wasn't even that hungry when I went, but I ended up finishing my plate! I'd have to warn you, the meals get pretty messy. They do provide a roll of paper towels on the table and they have moist towelettes for you as well. The second time I went, we went at night during the week day. There was a bit of a line, but it didn't take too long until we were at the front. We ordered and, although the place was quite busy, we didn't have much trouble finding a table. The employees were super friendly, but they didn't act fake either. There was a birthday celebration at the table next to us... It was actually fun singing along with them. It wasn't too corny, yet they managed to get us to participate. We had multiple employees come by and ask us if we needed anything, and when our buzzer things went off, they offered to get our plates for us (which is service we didn't get the first time I went there)! I can't say anything negative about the staff at all. One of them even offered us free dessert if we found him after our meal and told him how it was (we ended up being way too full after to pursue him though), As for what I ordered, I had the Chick-less Dinner (white meat boneless chicken) with baked beans and fries for my sides. The fries were really good with the creole seasoning they provide. What I loved about my meal was that since it was boneless, I could eat the whole thing with my fork and knife... mess free! I'm typically picky with my meat, yet I was very satisfied. The sauce is really good as well. It has this spicy kick to it that I really like. Although Phil's is so awesome (food, service, atmosphere, everything), I'd have to say that it's really something that I wouldn't indulge in, but to enjoy every once in a while instead.

it should be called PHIL'S GRILLING not BBQ. to me if its not slow smoked its not bbq. we've eaten a handful of times at phil's when they were located on goldfinch in mission hills and once and awhile co-workers will have phil's cater our lunch because they swear by it, to each his own i guess. the meats are good but its not "OMG the best ive had ever". if you've had southern bbq (s.c. tenn, k.c.) or even texas bbq then you know what real ba-bq taste like. also i'm not a fan of the black peppery sweet sauce, bbq can have a little kick but it shouldn't be a black pepper kick. its true if you go to tennesse or south carolina each bbq joint can differ on sauce but none of them taste like phils, and i guess its their way of making themselves different but i still can't stand the flavor. if you want a real bbq experience there's only one place to go and its not k.c. bbq in downtown or abbey's or baby back jacks, or the pit, or johhny rebs but Burrells:  http://www.washington-sq… you want real pit slow smoked bbq there's only one place to go in all of socal. we were just there last week after missing them on new years day and the bbq and sides is still the same, absolute killer pics: http://www.yelp.com/biz_…

My goodness there are so many great things to say. I'll keep it simple as I really don't take myself too seriously: the food is almost perfect BBQ.  And their beers are literally ice cold as they come out of the tap.  Get there about 15 minutes  before it opens as the lines grow rapidly.  And hey owners of Phil's: I'm on to your game of wafting delicious smoke all over the swap meet.  And I am your humble and willing servant as a result.  Well done!

Having been a Pharmaceutical rep for almost a decade, I've been to most of the fine dining and moderately priced food joints in SD.  If I was going to eat one place in SD county it would be Phil's BBQ.  It's not fast food, if you hate lines...a McDonalds and TacoBell are around the corner.  Don't come here to "try" their chicken caeser salad...order the full-rib dinner and dig in and enjoy some of the best ribs en los Estados Unidos.

I don't think I have ever had better BBQ in my entire life! I had the pulled pork sandwich. There was so much meat that fell out of it I could have made a whole other sandwich! The onion rings were amazing...order the small...I promise that will be enough. My boyfriend and I both ordered baked beans. He loved them, but I wasn't a fan. Way too much pepper. I dislike pepper, but if you dig it then these beans are for you! The baby back ribs that he had were the best ribs we have ever tasted. I loved everything! The long line didn't seem so bad because the whole time I was trying to decide what to order. The guy towards the front on the line made it fun too. He said "I have a beer garden and you're standing in it!" Made me want to buy a Fat Tire not only because he said that but bc it was in a can. How cute! I wish I lived closer to SD to have this right now!

This is by far the best BBQ you can get in San Diego. The ribs are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!! Do yourself a favor and get a full rack. The french fries are really good. I have gotten the ribs probably the last 10 times Ive gone, but I've gotten almost everything on the menu. It's all good. Since they opened the second location in San Marcos, the lines are much shorter.

Best BBQ in San Diego, but......the lines do suck. I would suggest calling in a take out order or trying to pick off peak hours. The broham pulled pork or el toro tri tip sandwiches are all you need and want. The portions are pleasantly large especially for the great prices. Again best BBQ in San Diego!

Phil's is just a great place overall. The people are great, the service is great, and the food is well, lets just say that IMO, it's the best BBQ in San Diego. The sauce is the boss as Phil himself says. Its got just the right amount of tangy-ness and saltiness that goes good on anything, even coleslaw. The BBQ Broham is a pulled-pork sandwich with coleslaw and a great start for a newbie. Both the pork and beef ribs are delicious, although you get much more with the beef ribs because they're about five times as big. The chicken is good too but I recommend keeping the bone because the bone-less tend to be a little dry. And a small order of onion rings will be enough for 4 people. The only possible bad thing about Phil's is the line which most likely will be there because all of San Diego loves this place for its longwithstanding tradition of authentic BBQ. But its worth the wait and if you prefer, call in and get your order to go. No waiting for that, just walk in and pick up your order after calling.

As far as BBQ goes this place is prime. Not a very large menu, but outstanding BBQ. I personally like the chicken and tri-tip, but they're big on ribs. If you eat lunch there get there before 11 pm or the line is out the door. They don't have a kids menu though.

Phil's is a vegetarian's worst nightmare and a carnivore's best friend! I don't know where to start but let me just say that you can't go wrong with any of the selections on the menu. Their baby backs are cooked to perfection as the meat slides off of the bone as you sink your teeth into one. All of their sides are yummy but my preference is the onion rings. Whether your dining in or taking out, be prepared for long lines that can sometimes stretch out the door. I wouldn't be disappointed though as it will all be worth it in the end.

Ate here for the second time last night.  Line out the door and into the parking lot on a freaking Wednesday night at 6:30 pm!  Not acceptable.  However, we were meeting friends and had to do the wait.  One hour later, we ordered our food.  I truly do not understand why people wait this long for quite ordinary food.  Their food is decent, but not worth the wait or the price.  There are many restaurants that serve similar or better BBQ, burgers and sandwiches without the extraordinary wait.  The pork ribs, burger, and pulled pork sandwich are pretty good, but nothing I would crave from Phil's.  The fries are like In & Out, except not as good.  The onion rings are giant and greasy, not that great at all.  Their BBQ sauce is decent but very sweet.  I would never wait an hour for this food.  Why do others?  Not sure, maybe Phil is a master at marketing?  Maybe their is a shared collectivism at play?  Maybe there is no other BBQ place in the immediate area?  I cannot explain this strange phenomenon, but refuse to be a part of it anymore.  I will never again wait an hour to consume very ordinary and overpriced food.  On the bright side, I did not get sick eating here.  Oh yeah, if I were to take into account the horrific wait time, I would have given Phil's one star.  However, just judging the food alone, it deserves three stars since it is decent.  Enjoy the wait, it will be long.

I have to say I don't get it. Yes, the food is good but good enough to stand in line over an hour for? I think not. And then to discover that after all that waiting you are not even served but give your order to a cashier, get a pager, and then have to go get it yourself? At least it was done quickly after the order was placed, but I just found the whole experience disappointing. Maybe I just don't get the allure of BBQ enough to appreciate the long wait and lack of personal service.

Being from Texas, I was skeptical about finding good BBQ out in California, seeing as I've had many amazing experiences with BBQ down here. However, due to raving reviews from both friends and Yelpers, we decided to make it a point to try this place out... and it was worth it. The line was wrapped around out the door, and being impatient and hungry as we were, we decided to call in and to-go instead seeing as we were staying at the hotel across the street. Thank goodness! The to-go line was much much shorter and we got our food within 10-15 min. Both the beef and pork ribs were delicious, and I highly recommend their beans and coleslaw. The El Toro sandwich was really good even though I was stuffed by the time I got to taste it. They initially forgot some of our sides, but that wasn't a problem since we just had to run across the street to get it, and they even threw in some extra onion rings for the trouble. Good service and great food!

Last year during a trip in the south we tried some local BBQ joints. In Owensboro KY it was OLE SOUTH in Nashville it was Calhoun's and in Memphis it was The Interstate, Neely's and the Rendezvous. We had seen some of these on the food shows and were looking for the "REAL SOUTHERN EXPERIENCE  with BBQ and we were sorely disappointed,. Phil's beat them all in every way. We always TAKE OUT because of the crowds and when we announce an event with Phil's as the main course or guest limit is always filled. We love the ribs and chicken plates and even though I fancy myself a good cook I can not come close the meats and sauces. One time I came close but it took 14 hours. Rib meat falling off the bones and chicken moist and succulent. Beans, coleslaw and potato salad better then Moms and she grew up along the Ohio River near Kentucky. Will success spoil Phil's BBQ? I hope not

The best rib ever.  Not dry like other places.  It is so juicy and worth the wait, 1 hour usually.

I have had better BBQ in my life but I haven't had better in San Diego. The Best BBQ in San Diego by far!  Now without the hour and a half wait for your food from the old Mission Hills location, Phil's seems unstoppable.  Still a slight wait and a struggle to find a table during lunch and busy nights but it is so worth it.  Ribs are great - dry rub style though so get the pulled meat if that is not your style.  I think I just drooled on myself just writing about Phil's.

Phil's is amazing. I am blown away every time I go. My wife gets the Broham and I usually get the rib tickler or ribless dinner. The customer service is always on hit. My only complaint is that they close down for about a month over the christmas season. What are the Phil junkies supposed to do. I see myself rocking in the fetal position until they re-open. When I die I want to be laid to rest in a vat of their bbq sauce seriously. I have watched plenty of these travel shows on the food network and they have been to some good spots in San Diego but they haven't been to Phil's  they are definitely missing out on the Best BBQ in California and I have eaten BBQ all over the state.

Not the best ever, but definitely the best you're going to find in San Diego.  The owner of Geno's needs to go here and take some notes.  This place is a business marvel and I admire it greatly.  I've tried just about everything on the menu and you can't go wrong.  One bit of advice though, if you go at lunch you should call ahead and get it to go because the line can get a bit long.  If you do call ahead don't plan on eating it there because there is a Rib Nazi who will kick you out.

Phils doesn't need my review. But I love you Phils. I lived in Georgia for 18 years. BBQ to Atlanta is mexican food to San Diego. So i was eating BBQ about once per week when I lived in ATL...OK...so now that you have my credentials...Phils is about as good as it gets. We could very easily have a average BBQ joint in SD because let's face it...it's not SD fare...but we are super lucky to have this gem...If Phils were in the south...they would still pack em in...

went to phils the other day with some friends. dont be alarmed if you see a line outside because theres always a line! we got there around 5pm on a saturday and waited about 20 minutes in line. it seems they got a good technique down: they ask how many in your party, bring you up to the register to order, then by that time they've got a table ready for you, a very short while later they call you up and your food is ready at the counter. it sure beats the really long wait times at the old location on goldfinch. on to the food. pulled pork is good, but the sauce is a little on the the sweet side for my liking. onion rings are on point. the small order is plenty for two people to split. pork ribs were a tad on the dry side (maybe its the batch that i had). but again, the sauce a little overwhelming on it. if there was six stars, i'd rate it at a three. neither hate it nor like it.

Best BBQ (maybe ever). Every person I have brought here thinks it is amazing. My fave is the ribs and chick-less with Cole slaw and baked beans, get it EVERY time. Only bummer is the place just gets so busy sometimes that the wait can be painful, especially if you are starving and have to be tortured by the delicious BBQ scents filling the air. I thinks it's a good idea to call it in if it's a really busy time. Or a little trick I just learned- you can order at the bar. Go in and grab a beer while you wait for the delicious food.

I willingly make the trip from LA to SD just for phils.  Yup, it's that good. Amazingly, every time I go, there's always long line of people that goes around the building. If you want to avoid the long line, you can go straight to the bar and order your food there but you have to eat there. Since it's a self sit in restaurant, they hand out pagers. You can ask the staff to help you get a table as you wait in line. After getting my food, I forgot to order a drink.  When I offered to buy a drink, they gave me a free drink.  I've done this twice.   I usually order the half rack of baby back ribs with sweet baked beans and fries.  /drool They have creole salt and this hot sauce which I both use to put on everything.  Mmmmm. They have lots of TV's. They have cleaning stations which consists of automated faucets, foamed soap, and automated paper dispenser. I bought a shirt from phils and random people from LA recognized it.

oh, it's good. My husband and I took a southern road trip last year with the goal of eating as much BBQ as humanly possible (yikes!)... when we got home (to san diego) we tried Phill's for the FIRST TIME and YES YES YES it is right on par with what the South has to offer. Sweet, spicy, sticky, messy... savory... ummmmm.... You can smell the goodness when ever you drive up sports arena blvd...  did they have to put it next to target?  ;)   actually the location is sorta unappealing, I wish it was somewhere more "down-home" feeling... with picnic tables and such!

The rib-less dinner has got to be the most slutty/delicious meal on the market in San Diego today. Just a pile of sweet meat and a huge side of fries. Now that the new phil's has a beer bar it's very tempting to top it all of with a pitcher of brew but if you do you may want to call a taxi ahead of time. Not because you'll be too drunk to drive but more so because of the intense food coma that will follow. Delirious with satisfaction.

Super delicious ribs doused in tangy sauce - loved it! And this coming from a 13 year vegetarian says a lot. I went to Phil's BBQ for the first time last night with my boyfriend + family and while the atmosphere is a little chaotic (line around the building, paper towel rolls needed everywhere) the restaurant help was super friendly and constantly asking if we needed anything and the food was delish. Steamed veggies were fresh and crispy (like steamed should be) and the onion rings were some of the best I've ever had. I had the beef ribs instead of the baby back and I'm proud to say the beef are better. yum.

By far the most overrated restaurant in SD. I love BBQ but this is not BBQ sauce it is sugar that is why so many people like it.. just the sweet tooth. I like real pit BBQ that tastes like a rib ate a tree and they both caught on fire. Not like... that cow musta been a diabetic. I know there is a shortage of good BBQ in California in general but just because it might not be as bad as most of them does not make them good.

Good BBQ for a place not in the South. I've spent most of my life down South so finding great BBQ in other regions is usually a tough task. But Phil's was pretty good. I had baby back ribs with onion rings and fries. The onion rings were especially good. The ribs were sweet and fell right off the bone perfectly. Phil's also has the coldest beer taps I've ever seen and the Stone IPA I had here was the perfect compliment to my meal. Service was great, the bartender was very friendly and even took the time to learn our names which added a nice personal feel. My friend who took me here is a local and says that the best way to beat the usual lines is to head straight to the bar and order there, then you can also sit and have beers while you wait on your food.

3 stars for food plus an additional star for the nicest damn people working there.  Generous portions - had the tickler rib plate with one beef rib and was stuffed afterwards.  The sauce may be a bit too vinegary but everything else is good.  The beef rib was a bit overcooked but the babybacks were nicely cooked.

Phil's BBQ was great! I got the Best of Both Meal which had the ribs and chicken. It came with two sides. The ribs were very good. The BBQ sauce was lathered on just right and had this tangy kick to it.  The chicken was moist and not dry at all. Very good experience eating there. They also provide you with a bib for when your grill gets all dirty with BBQ sauce. There's no need to be shy when eating here. Pretend like you are a baby and dig in.

OK we've been back since the last visit and this place came back with flying colors!. Man were we treated like some sort of VIP (and were def not) I joked to my husband "hey maybe they know it was me who gave the bad review the last time" We stood in the long-ish line because we had kids otherwise we woulda hit the other side. Maybe a 20 min wait. no big deal. While we were in line we were greeted by a very friendly staff member in line. She treated us like we were long lost family, talked to my girls and really was very nice. Everyone from that point on was so helpful and courteous. Right to the time we sat down to eat they brought us plates an extra paper towels asked if we need refills. I tell you they really are on the ball when it comes to customer service. The food was very good. We were very happy and we'll be back.

Ever since they moved from their previous location, the quality is lacking a bit. Don't get me wrong, the food is great but not what it use to be. In San Diego, this might be the best place to get some BBQ at a fair price. When I go here, I tend to order the baby-back pork ribs or "The Tickler". Honestly, when I host guest from out of town; I tend to bring them here. But be careful, if you get someone from Texas or somewhere in the Midwest.. They'll say this place taste "OK". Born and raised San Diego, this BBQ is pretty good. They give you a healthy servicing size so there's no way you can't be full. WARNING! You may experience some food coma after eating here! Tip: If you see an extremely long line out the door, phone it in real quick and go straight into the left line (much faster). Pros: Price, location and great takeout ordering system Cons: Too much sauce on everything (but you can request for it on the side).

Maybe I am a contrarian. Perhaps I was told too many good things about it. There is even the slight possibility that I am just crazy and don't know a good thing when I taste one...but, well, I just don't care about Phil's bbq. A long line usually signals good things to come. But there is something odd about this one. What I am looking for in a long line at a bbq place is a group of large, older men, who talk loud and knowingly about the bbq they had one time in the good ol' days. Not a single one there. This alone makes me afraid, not afraid enough to abort this outing however, especially since I am with a friend and leaving for such a simple reason would seem silly. Standing in the line, I feel a great disturbance; the air...the air is so relatively clear. What I do smell is not the aromatic face punch that accompanies barbecued meat. I smell cars and the sweat of people who are standing in the sun. "Hey boys! Ever been here before?!" Oh good lord, what was that? My confusion due to the non-barbecued air allowed a greeter to sneak up on me and my compatriot gave me no warning. There is fear in the air and I think she senses my weakness; her smile grows as I answer in the negative. "Well welcome!" My god, so many exclamation points. "You boys like to dance?!" Please, please, please...if I survive, I will go to church, I will be a good boy, I'll call my parents more often and help the elderly. By a miracle, the person next to me thinks she is talking to him and she parades off. Only a few more minutes to order. To the menu. Ribs, chicken, burgers...no brisket? Excuse me? How do you have a bbq shop without brisket? And by "how do you," I mean "how dare you." Alright, alright, everything is going fine. Ribs. There are ribs here. Order that. So to the order. Best of both, which is pork ribs and chicken. A beef rib. Sides of french fries and cole slaw. It comes quickly. Okay, everything looks good. But I make a mistake, my hand reaches first for a french fry. I chew. Chew again. Oh...oh come on. This is pitiful. The fry is almost cold and only has a little hint of crispiness at the ends. My comrade notices and asks what is wrong, perhaps slightly worried since it was his idea to come here. A smile reassures that all is well. I was just thinking of something else, which is technically correct; I am thinking of the last time I had good fries. Fine, Phil's bbq is not known because of the sides, time to turn towards that queue of meat. Pork ribs are the first sacrifice. After two or three ribs, my mind is a blank. Sure the ribs were basically floating in a decent sauce that was probably applied after the meat was cooked, but what about the meat itself? Is it dry or tender? Cooked well or burnt? Again, my mind is blank. The nuclear blast of sauce has destroyed any ability to discern whether the meat is good or not. Try the chicken instead, that isn't smothered in sauce. Well, it did have a smokey undertone and the meat had to do more work than the pork; it did that work adequately, like a temp. There was nothing to hate about it...there was nothing to feel about it. No, it just was. All the while, workers are hovering "Can I help you?" "Hi, my name is X and if you need anything just ask." Round and round he goes. I would love to ignore his presence, but that means I would have to focus on the food. My friend, being the perceptive sort, notices the displeasure. "What do you like the most?" A question with a lot of room for an answer. "The beef rib was by far the best. A good amount of meat with not so much bbq sauce," is the honest answer. We let it rest there. And so will I.

The wait wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, considering the line was around the side of the building and behind the 21-minute mark.  The baby back ribs were excellent - very tender, but the sauce was much sweeter and less smoky than I would have liked.  The sides we got with our ribs were fries, potato salad, baked potato, steamed veggies - everything was very good.  Service was also quick and friendly.  Really where I didn't find it mind-blowing was the sauce - I like to have a mix of sweet and savory and theirs was almost like eating dessert. 4/5 for you.

Definitely a hot spot for San Diego. I been told by numerous friends that I should check this place out if I ever make it out to SD. I did for the first time yesterday and it was great. I had a half rack of baby back ribs, and half rack of beefy ribs and sides of bake potato, french fries, mac salad, and onion rings. The meat was very tender indeed. The sides were ok and was not anything to brag about. The line is long to get in but the food comes up rather fast so it would be about the same as any other restaurant. I wouldnt say its my favorite bbq place but its definitely a San Diego gold mine.

my favorite is the baby back rib. very well marinated and the meat literally falls off the bone. the BBQ chicken is decent. beefy rib is also good. it has a stronger taste but the meat is noticeably tougher. the side dishes are mediocre. you can't really go wrong with fresh cut fries, corn,  cole slaw, and potato salad. customer service was great. although it's more of a self service dining. they still have people going around to offer services. sort of like pat and oscars. try to beat the lunch/dinner rush though. the line gets super long!

I'm a big fan of Man vs Food and we saw this place on his San Diego show so we had to try.  You can smell the BBQ aroma from the freeway.  Everything looks really good but I settled on the baby back ribs and onions rings.  I also added one slice of beef ribs just to taste test.  I have to say that both ribs (baby back and beef) were EXCELLENT - 5 stars.  However, the onion rings were ok since I was not a big fan of the batter they used.  My wife tried the "El Toro" that was featured on the show and she finished every bite.  I would definitely return for more ribs, but next time I'm going for the pulled pork sandwich.

I'll qualify this review by stating that a) I'm a fan of North Carolina BBQ, which is a whole different animal (chopped, slow cooked meat with a vinegary and not sweet sauce) b) that aside, I don't eat beef or pork.  Yeah, I know, what was I doing at a BBQ place?  I was taking my boyfriend out to be nice.  He ordered ribs, which I thought were a little pricey, and I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich.  Both portions were generous, his ribs were slathered in sauce, and my chicken was also drowning in sauce.  Yuck.  If you are a fan of the red/sweet/spicy sauce, you'll be fine.  I am not, and I found it too sweet and way too overpowering for the chicken (not that the chicken really made an attempt to have its own flavor).  The meat was dry, and after a couple of bites I gave up trying to pretend I liked it.  I got my sandwich to go and my boyfriend had it for lunch the next day.  He did love his ribs, but he's never had NC BBQ so what does he know.   On the overall experience - we were there early (before 6 pm) on a Wednesday night and were lucky to snag a seat at the bar with no wait.  Place was hopping.  The bartender was nice, and chatted with us.  When he noticed I didn't like my food he asked me if anything was wrong and recommended getting the sauce on the side next time (if there is a next time).   We had a nice chat about regional BBQ variations.  No complaints on service.   Overall, I wouldn't go back, but it is mostly because I am not a BBQ fan in general.  Two stars because chicken was overcooked, prices were high, sides had to be ordered separately, and they didn't have hush puppies on the menu.  If you don't like BBQ, don't go here expecting to find non-BBQ items on the menu.  It is BBQ centric.  And vegetarians beware - they don't cater to you.  So expect to make a meal of the sides.

Really good BBQ - This place deserves 5-starts but the line, my gosh the line is a story in itself. It is worth the wait, or if you are smart come early in the afternoon or sit at the bar. Definitely the best BBQ in San Diego, maybe in all of So cal, I still have a few favorite spots but this place satisfies.

I would drive all the way down to SD just for a plate of Phil's BBQ.  There's always a 45 minute wait but it's totally worth it.  Try the baby back, beef, potato salad and onion rings.  They're super fast and the staff are so friendly and accomodating.  If you want to have it to go, you should call in first.  There's usually no line for that.

So you know that whole thing about America and obesity? Well, if obesity defined America, this place is like the holy bible of America. It's the thesaurus word under America. Hell, go to Wikipedia to search Phil's BBQ and you'll get the message "redirected to AMERICA". In either case, DAMN THIS PLACE IS CROWDED. Do you guys reaaaallly have to all come to the same damn place where I eat??? At the same damn time???? I DON'T EVEN COME HERE OFTEN. But yea, despite the crowd the food is pretty mediocre. Meat is often overcooked, and slathered with ridiculous amounts of mediocre BBQ sauce. As a grilling man... seriously, I can make something better (and my friends agree). The portions are HUGE but the price is high. Seriously, go to Costco and bake one of their frozen pork ribs. It's much better bang for the buck. The staff are very friendly though. That's a plus :) Oh, and if you are on the skinny/not-too-fat side of picture, go here. You'll feel even better after seeing the people around you.

The food is perfect and big.  I split a full rack of ribs with my wife and we had left overs.  The sides are big.  Maxine was amazing, helpful, kind, and when I asked what her favorites were she said the baby back ribs, and the Broham.  The Broham ( pulled pork)  is huge for $6.45.  She didn't just say everything is good like you hear when you ask this at some restaurants. She even advised to get the coleslaw on the side to put on ourselves.  I am sure everything is good here.   Cory was our server and couldn't have been more helpful.  When I asked Cory to get us crackers, or bread as our two kids were restless and hungry, he said how about a couple of french fries.  When he came back to the table he said the kitchen gave him more than a few fries it was a small basket.  If Phil reads this I want him to know that Cory didn't give us a full order, but it was more than a few fries.  No charge at all.  How nice of them.  Who does that in the restaurant business.  Even if he had to charge us for the fries it was ok, and we expected to be charged, but it was quick and took care of our kids. Smart business. We went this year to Dallas for the best rated barbecue by Dallas magazine in 2010.  It was great as stated, but  Phil's is better, and you get more food for the money here.   I do not say this lightly.  When you go out to eat you want better food than you can cook at home, and you want food that you don't have the equipment to make it properly.  That is why you have to eat at this is the place. The to go process is so well organized, and the eating there is also well organized.   I will say if you are very hungry you might  want to eat something small before as the wait can be over an hour easily to get in.  I would go when you aren't so hungry, or call it in to go.   I would get it to go with small kids.  The kids won't wait that long patiently.   If a restaurant has over an hour wait most of the days it is open, they must be doing something right.   I have also never seen a restaurant with almost 2000 reviews on yelp as they have. If you haven't had a meal here.  You have to go now.  There is another location opening in San Marcos, CA in a few weeks.  Everyone is already talking about this as I live in San Marcos. I heard about the new San Marcos location at the park with the kids.   If you don't like Phil's you either don't like barbecue, or you don't like to eat food. Seriously I would give them 6 stars if it was an option.  After typing this now, I am going to Phil's today for lunch, and it is a 40 minute drive each way for us, but worth it.

I was first aware of Phil's BBQ when I moved to Point Loma and saw a huge line outside of the restaurant.  I said to my husband, "wow that place must be awesome!"  A couple days later we were on Yelp looking for a new place to try when it came up with a high rating.  That sealed the deal and we were not disappointed in the least!  Phil's not only has amazing BBQ, but great atmosphere as well.  Of course the wait can be a bummer, but we try to go at less busy times.  Also, it may take a while to find a table, but employees are extremely friendly and helpful.  All I can say is that it's certainly worth the wait!

If you haven't been to Phils - you should probably go. Its the best. The chickless chicken is my favorite - white meat of chicken cut up with BBQ sauce. The service is great - even when the line is LONG. Suggest going on a week day in the afternoon if you can. Otherwise - man up and wait in line, its worth it!

I had to write about a favorite restaurant as a writing exercise to jumpstart my brain for my graduate program, so instead of writing out a new review, I'm just going to copy it here... Anybody who lives in San Diego knows that the best place to get delicious barbeque is at Phil's BBQ in Point Loma. This restaurant is the perfect place to get some lip-smacking, finger-licking grilled foods at inexpensive prices. For less than twenty dollars, you can order a full rack of succulent pork or beef ribs, with a choice two side dishes such as corn on the cob, cole slaw, and fresh cut French fries. But the crowds of people do not come to Phil's just for a deal on their meal; they also come here for the famous sauce. Phil's sauce comes from a secret recipe which blends the best qualities of sweet, spicy, and tangy into a symphony of flavor, which combined with the natural flavors of the grilled meat make for a very memorable dining experience. The sauce has even won awards at prestigious barbeque competitions around the United States. So the next time you have a major craving for some serious barbeque, you cannot find a better place to go to satisfy your appetite than Phil's BBQ. Just in case you can't tell...I love this place!

Worth the wait and lives up to the hype! Be prepared to wait at least a good half hour to get into the restaurant as the line usually wraps around the building. But once you get in the front doors that BBQ smell greets you and everything is right in the world. All I can say is ribs, ribs, and ribs. Their ribs are delicious and moist with just the right amount of flavorful sauce. I'm a big guy and a half rack with the sides are the perfect portion for me. An order of the full rack will guarantee a goody bag to take home. For the sides, the onion rings are delicious and their baked beans are good. The staff at Phil's are extremely pleasant and make you feel right at home. I've spent four years in the Deep South and I've had some great BBQ out there, so my standards are high. The good news is that Phil's meets them.

I found out about this place from the Man vs Food website and I understand why this is one of the restaurants they chose out of all the good restaurants in San Diego.  I had the pork rib dinner and I have to say it's one of the best BBQ meals I've ever tasted.  The sauce has just the right amount of spice and tanginess.  The two sides I chose were the beans and potato salad, both very good as well.  The last BBQ place that  I felt left the same impression was at Gates in KC.  Lastly, you can't beat the price!  For the amount of food you get, you can't beat it.  I highly recommend that if you find yourself in San Diego, that you try and find a way to make it here.  Even if you see a line, it'll be worth the wait.

This place is really good.  I'm not going to lie.  Since I have lived in California all my life, I haven't really had great bbq.  So one of my friends who live around here told me about this place, and was surprised how good it is.  This place is where you order the food, and then you sit down and get the food, it's not like a sit down dinner, and you order off a menu. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, and I think it was the best that I have tasted in a long time!  I highly recommend this place to people who feel like bbq  in San Diego, that's not too expensive!

Took my Family to Sea World and after a day of crappy theme park food, we yelped a restaurant with high ratings for dinner. It lived up to our expectations! The line was quite long to wait in which was the only downside, but they were very efficiant at making sure it kept moving at a good pace and even offered a beer stand and heaters outside. When we got our food it was easy to see why everyone wanted to come here! The food was fantastic. Hands down the best coleslaw I've ever had and I'm really picky with coleslaw. I ordered a BBQ Chicken sandwich. The sandwich was huge. My husband ordered the ribs and was equally as happy. I wish we could bring Phils back to San Jose with us!

Truly the go-to barbeque place for any meat lover in or visiting san diego. In particular, i order the beefy rib tickler: 1 big beef rib, coleslaw, fries, and two giant onion rings - for a price of 7 dollars, i consider it the best deal in town. The beefy rib ticklers are the best, in my opinion, with the chicken and pulled pork being somewhat average. I don't know how phils does it, but everyone who works there seems to be ecstatic, and in a genuine way, too. though its mostly self serve (order at counter, pick up food) someone always comes around to check on you. The lines are bad, like disney theme park bad. If you're not hungry when you get there, you will be when you order. expect ~40 minutes or even longer on a friday or saturday night. That said i can't let that detract from the overall rating- the place is operating at max capacity and the staff is working hard.

The best BBQ food in San Diego period! The ribs are perfect with the right amount of BBQ sauce and the barb-q flavor. If your craving for some serious BBQ then dont think twice before heading to Phils. The sides are delicious as well. We have tried the baked beans and macaroni salad. Favorite dish is Ribs but the BBQ Chicken is also very good. This place gets super busy, so best time is after 10 pm if you can wait :)

This was my 1st visit to PHILs BBQ restaurant. The Baby back ribs needed more sauce. Some extra sauce on the side would have been appreciated. I would have liked to see the sauce available on the table like the ketchup. If you have ever been to NY, the Restaurant called \"BBQs\" has the sauce on the table in a glass bottle. Its nice so you dont feel like you need to ask anyone for more sauce. The side of coleslaw was bland. It needed some salt, pepper and brown sugar or something. I was disaapointed in the coleslaw. Maybe rework it. The slaw at Anthony\'s Fish Grotto is great maybe try it and see the difference I am referring to. The baked beans were tastless too. It needed some Brown sugar/Maple something. I needed to use the ladies room before I left. It was a ruddy mess. There was pee all around the toilet and on the floor. I told the staff about it. Their bathroom only has one toilet and needs to monitored like the bathrooms at Target. They have a check list that shows the time of when and whom cleaned the bathroom last. I left feeling a little angry about the cleaniness and care of the bathroom. As someone who worked in the food service industry for many years, bathrooms often times make or break a restaurant. It gives your patrons some insight on how clean the kitchen is. hmmmm... I left feeling a little concerned. They did not have any rolls/cornbread it seems like if you offer side dishes they should compliment your meal not take away from it.

Line moves fairly fast, and the food comes out pretty fast after you order. Baby Back Ribs, Marcaroni Salad, and French Fries yum...  The meat just comes off the bone so easily! I usually add in half a chicken as a side if I split a full rack with a friend.

Probably some of the best food I've ever eaten. The meat is so tender and juicy that every bite melts in your mouth full of flavor. Definitely a must go if you're in San Diego, although the wait time may be long.

One of the bes BBQ place on the west coast. Get some ribs, onion rings a cold beer and add some friends and thats what i call a good time. if you come to Phils and leave hungry you must have done something wrong. the food is guaranteed to fill you and leave you satisfied.

It's good, but I don't understand the hype.. and I certainly would not wait over an hour in line for this.  Doesn't taste magnificently better than any other BBQ ribs I've had.  Don't get me wrong, the meat slides off the bone and has just the right smokiness, portions are good, and both times I've been here I had a satisfying BBQ meal.  Prices are reasonable and there is a good selection of everything on the menu.  But for the wait and the reviews on here, I expected almost orgasmic.  Maybe that's my problem: I had high expectations.  My advice?  Don't expect anything spectacular.  You can expect a long-ass line though.

The two factors that will probably most determine whether you like Phil's are what you think of their BBQ sauce (since they put in on everything) and how you feel about waiting in line to get in (since you might end up spending more time outside waiting to get in than inside eating). Once inside, you order, receive a pager, get drinks and cutlery,  and then find a place to sit if a table was not already reserved or selected by one of the hostesses. By this time, your pager will probably alert you that your food is ready. Instead of napkins, each table has a roll of paper towels. The big draw is probably the ribs - but if you want both more meat and a lower cost, I'd recommend ordering one of what they call a "sandwich". Be sure to get a fork, because they give you far more meat than what fits in the sandwich. Phil's has a note to Yelper's at the entrance asking to let them know of any problems before Yelping - so be sure to say something if the restrooms look like they did when I was there....

I came here on a Friday night with a party of 4. We are all from the Bay area, but I had moved down to San Diego about a year ago. We've all been dying to try this place since it was on my "Man Vs. Food" list. I think for a party of 4, I waited about 35-40 minutes? Service was extremely friendly. One of the workers came out and let my Bf and I try the baked beans and macaroni salad before we decided to order it. Extra Star for her! I ended up ordering the full side of ribs (12 ribs) and got a side of fries and potatoe salad. My Bf ended up ordering the chicken and got a large side of baked beans. The sides are RIDICULOUSLY amazing. I would never order beans as a side but their baked beans are SOO addicting-sweet, tangy, buttery goodness. My ribs were fall off the bone tender with a good amount of BBQ sauce. Fries are like IN-N-OUt but bigger. I would definetly come here again regardless of the lines!

Hands down, best bbq I've ever had. The bf and I came here with some San Diego friends for a last lunch before Sea World and then back home to LA. Needless to say, I have yet to find a great bbq place in LA... First off, be prepared to wait. We came at around noon which is prime lunch hour. We made sure to drop someone off to wait in line so we could park. During that 5 to 10 minutes, the line had grown to 8 parties deep behind us. Given the amount of people ahead of us, I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the line moved. After ordering, I was again pleasantly surprised by how quickly the food came out (given the line.) My friends and I had the Barham and the bf had the 7 rib dinner with beans, slaw, and an order of onion rings. Can I just say, the slaw is AMAZING. The Barham is big enough to share the meat with someone else as long as you order another set of buns. Delicious, fall off the bone, pulled pork. The ribs were mouthwatering and perfectly seasoned, sauced, and VERY meaty. Also, the service is excellent. Could be because they were trying to get us in, get us out, and keep the line movin'. I didn't mind though, I wasn't there to chill, I was there to EAT.

Phil's was on my son's foodie bucket list and glad we made the trip. Everything from atmosphere, to service and especially the food is worthy of the rave reviews and 5 stars.We viewed the webcam the day before and decided to get there before the lunch/dinner crowd. Perfect! Walked right up to the order counter.  Portions are huge, sides are great. Go ahead and get messy.  They have a wash up area outside the bathrooms. You can purchase their bbq sauce and rub or order online.

Came here with friends that are visiting. They don't have a Phil's BBQ in their small town in Colorado so they wanted to go. I had never been here before. I shared the half BBQ chicken dinner and it was plenty. We had cole slaw and sweet baked beans for sides. I was surprised by the sauce because it was really sweet and tasty! Wines and beers are reasonably priced. They have pitchers of beer for $13 -$15. I'm not a meaty BBQ person at all so this was a nice treat. Will be back for ribs OR BBQ pork sandwich and will be sure to share again next time!!

I always have a delicious meal here, and I think it's because of their baby back ribs. Its so soft and tender it just melts in your mouth. Not a big fan of their beefy ribs though. I had it once and the meat is all dry and ehh. Normally I'll get the half pork ribs and half chicken meal, so I get a little more variety. My usual sides are fries and mac salad because I feel as though it complements the meal perfectly. If only their corn on a cob didnt count for 2 sides. Lines are pretty much always freakin longgg as ef. More often than not, you'll be waiting around the corner, especially on weekends. But I did notice they set up a mini bar outside so you can have a drink while you wait. What a good way to keep hungry customers happy. But if you're with a small party, try catching an open table at the bar to avoid the wait. The bar is the perfect place to sit during basketball and football season because they have the games playing on multiple TV's. Keep in mind they are closed on Mondays!

Love Phils BQQ!!!! Must go here to get the best bbq in San Diego. Once I arrived there before they open and there was already a line outside but the lines are always long and worth the wait. The service is really quick, after paying, they give you a pager so you know when to get your food. They dont have waiters to escort you to your table so once you find a table thats being clear, run to it before someone else!!!!

Note: Jim gives it a 3.75, while Lane gives it a full 4. we ordered: a half-rib dinner with potato salad and french fries and a half-chicken dinner with beans and macaroni salad. Lane: i was expecting a lot before i came and I was pleasantly surprised about the quality of the meat. i liked the sauce but its on the sweet side and the french fries were really good. the potato salad was kind of plain but tasted fine with a little bit of salt. Jim: the sauce was really good and flavorful with a little bit of smoky spiciness in it. the meat of the chicken wasn't as great as everyone made it sound, but it was still pretty solid. i wish it was juicier. the beans were very hearty (and sweet in a good way according to Lane) and the macaroni salad was pretty plain.

What a happy surprise Phils BBQ turned out to be. We went to San Diego on our honeymoon and while staying in Mission Beach happened upon this place on a Sunday night, only a 20 minute wait, which by the locals is unheard of.  The food is really great for the price, and a good value since you don't have to tip, you order the food and pick-up yourself. Its a fun, casual atmosphere. If you like a bit more quiet sit outside. No lovely view, but the yummy tasting ribs make up for it. A must try while you are in San Diego. Way exceeds any Rachel Ray recommendations hands down.

But once we got to the register, got out buzzer, after getting our drinks and sitting down at a table...literally 3 mins later...our buzzer went off and the food was ready! WOW! not only that, but one of employees circling around offered to get our food...how awesome is that! this place is great. we arrived bout 645pm or so and the line was hella long. when we left bout 830pm the line was still just as long. people are down to eat here no matter how long the line is!

I was pissed, i turned to him and said "these better be the best ribs ive ever tasted". since we were so late we took it to go, and once i sat down and started to eat i turned to him and said " these are the best ribs ive ever tasted"!

Went there on a Tuesday night. Luckily, we got there before the line extended and wrapped around the building. Probably waited around 20 minutes before we ordered. I had the beef ribs and friend had the baby back ribs. Just like the reviews say, the meat is fall of the bone goodness. The sauce was a little strong on the vinegar, but it was good overall. Biting into the meat left hints of smoke flavor and bbq sauce. This place is definitely not overhyped. Lived in Orlando for 2 years and this place is pretty damn good!

I don't know if  it was too hyped or what, but the food was just okay... the beef ribs were good.  Good texture and taste, but I'm all about the sauce.  And Phil's bbq sauce doesn't have it.  Must get the cole slaw..  Some of the best slaw I have had in my life... Also, the price is right, not too expensive for some good ribs...

SWEET HOLY JESUS, as my son would say.  This is the SHIZNIT.  Pork ribs are THE BOMB, the chickless is heaven, NO BONES about it.  LOL  I didn't like the potato salad, I like my own better with mustard - too much FREAKN mayo, PHIL and add some damn salt.  This was the first time I got the onion rings because my friend wanted them and they were delicious, eat them while they are HOT because I found them a little soggy when they cooled.  I also got the baked beans and they were wonderful.  I always get the same thing, but next time no potato salad, probably corn on the cob or the mac salad that someone suggested.  What's missing is cornbread or a biscuit, although this aint KFC folks! This past weekend we went and of course, we got there kinda late and the line was out the door.  I was up for the wait, even though I was starving, because I love this place, but my friend and the kids didn't want to wait, so we called it in from the parking lot (got a menu from outside - sent the kids for that errand) and in 20 mintues, we were at Crown Point beach mackn on some RIBS!  Next time, I will order the pulled pork, though because I heard it's awesome.  I want to go there again today I love it so much, but I guess it's closed Monday and I still have left overs from Saturday!  The portions are awesome and the only other suggestion I would have is the wax paper under the food rips and is a soggy damn mess when you get through, but love the paper towels on the table and the wet naps.

The line was insane! When I first got there I was like no way I'm going to wait in this line. But the line was well worth the wait. It was about 35 minutes when I went on a Saturday night which wasn't too bad I guess. Anybody who would rate this anything less than 5 stars is crazy! This place is amazing and has the best ribs I've ever eaten. I had the full rack of ribs with some corn on the cob. The ribs were very moist and fell right off the bone and the corn was delicious as well.

I would give it 5 stars however there are 2 things happening since they moved to Point Loma. 1.- The lines are just to long, you should consider dinner reservations. 2.- The quality of the food is deteriorating since they are handling higher volume of orders. In several instances, the food is cold or slightly warm.

Went for my first time last week, and I was not disappointed.  The beef ribs are great.  I am a fan of the more spicy, less sweet barbeque sauce usually, but the flavor was excellent.  Also, the potato salad was something special and was a great compliment to the ribs.  Well done Phil!

The Best Ribs I have eaten so far.  I have had ribs in Memphis and Chicago and PHil's is hands down the best.  I also gave this place five stars because now they are located in a bigger establishment on Sports Arena Blvd. and they have put in a beer and wine bar.  I am contemplating flying out to San DIego just to have them. Phil when are you going to open up more of these across the country.  Seriously lets talk.   I always get the ribs and I have never been dissapointed.  Wether it was take-out or eat in Phil's is hands down the best.  Or maybe hands up because i have sauce all over my fingers........

YUM!  After watching the food network for an hour about BBQ, we had a craving. So we headed down to Phil's, after a 30-45 wait we had both beef and pork ribs and loved them both, though preferred the beef.  A great place for large parties and messy tasty bbq!  If you don't want to dine-in and wait in their ever present line, order the take-out and enjoy at home.

I think this place is sort of overrated. My friends hyped it up a lot. I thought it was decent but nothing to go crazy over. This is a seat yourself place. The line can get super long, so try to avoid dinner/lunch rushes. It's good to go if you have a friend to share it with so you can split the price. Full racks are about $20, you can also get half rack or go with cheaper chicken option, or do samplers. The ribs are nice and meaty, but the sauce isn't outstanding- it's very tangy. It could use more flavor. Comes with 2 small sides or 1 large side. I tried macaroni salad, potato salad, fries, and baked beans. The salads are not that great. Fries are ok. Baked beans are good (very sweet), but it's too heavy to eat with all that meat and bbq sauce. If you want green salad you have to buy it seperately. Drinks- they have a bar but they only serve beer or wine or sangria. What I like about this place is they have beef ribs. It's bigger and more meaty than baby back ribs. You should definitely give it a try, since it's not something you can easily find at other restaurants.

i went to phil's in the past week with the gf and one of her friends, i heard the food is soo good sooo i had to try it. we were running late and the kitchen closed at 10pm sharp on thursday. so we rushed over there and had 10 minutes to order, we ordered, the full rack of ribs meal with a corn on the cob side, a 1/2 chicken meal with macaroni salad, a side of onion rings and 2 cokes, total about $33.. i know.. soo we found a table, and took a seat, i think we probably waited about 15 minutes, at this point we were starved.. then it happened...   our number was called *choir music*.. after bringing the 3 hot trays back to the table the food smelled delicious, and the fact that i can see the ribs and bbq chicken just covered in bbq sauce just made my mouth water. at first i was a little hesitant to use my hands, but after seeing that i could not fully enjoy the experience i dug right in. the meat was moist and tender, it was great, unfortunately the sides were ok, as far as the corn, after seeing the pictures of how much fries you could get the fact we got 1 corn on the cob as our large side seemed a little sad. haha and the macaroni salad needed some more mayo in it, i know its isnt good to eat mayo, but comon this place doesnt even serve salad, why not seal the deal and put more mayo! lolz.. after we were done eating, you could see we were all stuffed and very happy. the busser was really quick to clear off our table which was great! basically, loved phils, and if i didnt have to drive 2 hours to get there i'd go tonight..

I went in on a Friday evening. The line to get in wrapped around the building; I ended up waiting for around 80 minutes. If you're one of those who are okay with waiting in line for roller coaster rides like Goliath, then you can wait for Phil's BBQ. It was well worth the wait when I actually got to sit down and take a bite out of that melt-off-the-bone baby back rib. GOTS DAYUM that was bomb. I shared a half rack with a girl friend of mine and shared a thing of onion rings, which was also fantastic. Half a baby back rib dinner will get ANY person who eats a normal portion full. For what you get, the price is very reasonable. The atmosphere is very fun. They've got the season's sports playing and some music to play along with the Texan theme they've got going. Four stars all around baby. Just didn't like the wait.

I've had Phil's catered twice and been there once.  it's super crowded so it can be a drag to come here if it's dinner time. The ribs were great.  Not the best i've had (I like them practically falling off the bone), but they were damn good ribs. The chicken I liked better than the ribs.  Juicy and tender and very messy :) Baked beans and macaroni salad...artery clogging heaven.

My brother suggested this place. He told me the BBQ was amazing experience and I needed to go, so my mom took his advice and planned my Dad's 50th bday here. I arrived early so I could reserve a table ahead of time for about 15 guests. And when I got there there was a HUGE line. (like all the way around the corner of the restaurant. This place was so awesome they made room for us and my relative are so crazy and kept adding on more people and they were still very friendly and accompanied our needs. And not to mention the food was amazing. Wonderful experience!!!!

After living in the South for 10 years good barbecue was one of the things I missed the most when i moved to San Diego.  Fortunately, there's Phil's, which is the best and most authentic barbecue I've been able to find.  The ribs are so tender, the cornbread is delicious, and all the food is true to real Southern (not Texas) cooking.

Great pungent and delicious bbq. My entire family loved this, I had the ribs, wifey and kids had chicken and sandwiches. You usually have to wait outside but the line moves and its worth an hour wait. Kind of like a cafeteria where you order at the counter, pickup you grub and find a seat. Lots of room, but this is a destination restaurant. You won't be dissappointed. If you like people watching this place piles em in.

Waited an hour and half in line which was not bad at all cause we met some pretty cool people in line.   The food came out fast!  Which was really nice the line starved me.  Not only that, but the food was really affordable The bibs that they have, have a little trough at the bottom that really do catch pieces of food as they drop down while you're devouring your food.  And hey, after you're all done, you can finish up those last bits if you're still looking for more food. The food was great with really tender meat just falling off the bone.  The beef bone was GREAT (I'd recommend it over the baby back ribs to be honest).  The onion rings were just warm but were still delicious when dipped into the ranch sauce.  The fries were decent, but I wouldn't recommend them if you can avoid them (I'd rather put that money into some more beef bones if you ask me). The only thing that irked me a little was the very loud environment.  I felt that I had to talk very loud to be heard by the people I was with, but it wasn't a big deal because it's not supposed to be a quiet restaurant in the first place. Verdict: The food is amazing for the price.  Great place for college students.

Definitely 5 stars for the food (delicious), but 3 for the LONG lines and atmosphere (i.e. not a place you'd want to chill in for too long), so I give it an average of 4 stars. Ribs are excellent, pulled pork sandwich is excellent, tri tip sandwich is good but would stick with the pork-based stuff next time.

Found about this place online and had to give it a try. Called in to get directions and was told there was an hour and a half wait. I was thinking to myself yeah right, but decided to just order for pickup just to be safe. Thank God I did, because when I got there the line was out the door and around the restaurant. We still had to wait about fifteen minutes for our pickup order but  the food was worth it and more. We got the full slab of baby backs and chicken BBQ and beans. The meat practically fell off the bone cause it was so tender. Mmmmmm good food!!! Now I know why the lines are so long there. Whenever we go back to SD I'm gonna make sure to come back to phil's BBQ. However, word to the wise, if you don't like waiting in line, order for takeout is the way to go.

What can I say that the 1500 other reviews already haven't. This place is the shit tho! Worth driving 2 hours just to get some. (Just realized I sound like some Horny-ass dude) Babybacks & Chicken- Yum Mac Salad - Delish Potato Salad- decent, not a red potato gal O-rings- I LOVE their onion rings.... seriously I come down here just for those suckers. BBQ Buckham- My friend ordered this (We call him the 'Hoover' u can figure it out) this mess filled him up to the brim. Wish there was one in LA. We love it! Our wasitbands definitely do not. Oh we've been lucky... I think our longest wait in line was 20 mins. *knock on wood* Shareing is Caring. You may be greedy and think "NO! I will not share this deliciousness with them."

As a lover and huge connoisseur of baby back ribs, I had heard great things about Phil's BBQ.  However, I'd have to say I was pretty disappointed.  The service and atmosphere was great, but the ribs just didn't deliver.  The ribs had way too much BBQ sauce on them and the sauce was very spicy and tangy, definitely not one of the better BBQ sauces I've had for baby back ribs.  If it's not broke don't fix it, traditional BBQ sauce has been used to make delicious baby back ribs for centuries and messing with it can really ruin ribs as is the case at Phil's.  The ribs are very tender and cooked well, sadly though, a bad sauce can really ruin good ribs.  My advice to them would be to get a new BBQ sauce because unfortunately it ruins an otherwise good restaurant.

Not only is the food the best ever - the service is beyond amazing! We went to Phil's last night for my son's 12th birthday because it is his favorite place to eat. It didn't matter that it is 2 hours from our house!! It's that good!! Anyone can tell you how amazing the food is and how the onion rings are addictive!! But I want to talk about the service! We had 7 people in our party and three of the staff went beyond the call of normal service to ensure that we were seated and happy and they even sang to my son which I didn't know they did there!! So thank you Tory for singing and finding us a table!! Thank you Lavele for the birthday shirt and making my son feel so special!! And thank you Maxine for making sure we had everything we needed!! You guys are incredible!!!

Mmmmm, how could anyone not like Phil's? I've lived in the area for several years, but surprisingly I had never been inside this San Diego institution until just recently. It was one of those places I had always heard about and had been meaning to try, but just never got around to. Finally, a couple of my friends decided that it was time to pop my Phil's cherry. At first, I was put off by the line to get in that wrapped around the back of the building. I'm not a very patient person to begin with, and when I'm hungry I'm even worse. But once I caught a glimpse of the expressions on the happy, finger-licking patrons inside, the wait really didn't seem all that bad anymore. I ordered the Broman (pulled pork sandwich) and macaroni salad, and my friend and I split an order of onion rings, which all together came to about $10 for each of us. Portions were big - there was so much meat piled on my sandwich that I couldn't see the bottom half of my bun for most of my meal. I'm pretty sure they lace the macaroni salad with crack. I seriously couldn't stop eating that stuff. The only downsides to this place are the small and ever-crowded parking lot; the long line at the front door; and that overly-full, heavy feeling you experience when you leave. Oh, and they charge extra for a side of ranch dressing, which seemed odd for a sit-down establishment.

This was a real experience!   We tried to visit Phil's the night before but the line was so long and the place was packed out.  We went back at lunch time and although it was really full the line was short and we stopped.  Wow!  I'm glad we did.  I am not a BBQ fan, but I loved the chicken breast burger. It was so fresh, hot and spicy/sweet- mmmm. The three ribs, fries and cole slaw was not cheap but it was really tasty and good.  We sat out on the porch and although the tables and chairs are not particularly charming it was ok for our quick visit.  The waiter out there was really helpful and attentive.  Great lunch!

Phil's is the best BBQ in San Diego and one of the best I've been to anywhere. The food is amazing and even when it is busy, the place runs like a well oiled machine. We drive about 50 miles each way to get there and it's well worth it. The new location in San Marcos is coming soon and since I work there, I may be in trouble. If you haven't been, shame on you.

Are you kidding me? I don't understand any review less than 5 stars.  How can you complain about the best bbq you'e ever eaten???  It makes standing in line well worth it, part of the experience, and once you finally get your lips over the mouth-watering delicious sauce, it reminds you why you stood in that ridiculous line in the first place.  Once it hits your lips...it's sooooo good!!!  If you don't want to wait in line, phone-in your order for crying out loud!  The line, however, prevents me from eating it EVERYDAY and gaining 1000 lbs.  IT'S THAT GOOD.  From the ribs to the sandwiches...Anyone who tells you otherwise is smoking crack.   And for the price??? C'mon now?!?!?

Phil's is good, but it's not good enough to line up for an hour like everyone does.  The babyback ribs are tender and the sauce is ok, not the best I've tried, but it is good.  The onion rings are really good because they're not breaded like your average onion rings.  The prices are decent, too.  I still think Tony Roma's ribs are better.

I wouldn't say this is the best BBQ place ever, but it's pretty damn good. The line is sometimes insane, but sometimes there are no lines. I love the beefy ribs because they are drenched with the BBQ sauce. The french fries are good too because it's fresh cut. Phil's is definitely a great place to bring friends and family who aren't native to SD. Also the price isn't too bad for the food.

Okay so I've been coming here for years now, my parents took me to the old location in Mission Hills when I was a little girl and I've been going back for more ever sense. I must say since they have moved the line is a bit of a joke. I normally call when I am leaving my house and then by the time I get there my food is ready to take home and enjoy. Yesterday I decided to a meet a girlfriend for lunch and wait in line (ugg) The line actually only took about 15 minutes and I must say the ladies who were working were extremely friendly. I learned a great tip, the bar is first come first serve. So now for the food. I usually get the broham with coleslaw on top which is impossible to eat but I do it anyways. I also love the onion rings with ranch, amazing. I love Phil's every once in a while. YUMMMY and messy BBQ, what more could a girl want.

I had lived in San Diego for three years before I first went to Phil's on September 16, 2010.  I don't know what kept me away, but I'm glad I had the chance to go.  I knew the wait would be long, so I was prepared for that.  The staff who helped me and my friend while we were in line, when we were at the front of the line, and when we ordered were all great.   However, that's where my great experience ended.  Once we got our food, I proceeded to get a drink.  I wanted a Diet Coke with caffeine in the worst way, so I went to the drink station and filled my cup with what was supposed to be Diet Coke.  Unfortunately, all of the Diet Coke dispensers were filled with regular Coke.  I then told a staff member, and she did a taste test and agreed with me.  She told me that she would fix the problem, but she never did, and I spent the better part of the next hour trying to get someone to make this switch.   Don't get me wrong -- the food was great and I definitely see why people wait and hour plus to eat at Phil's.  I'm sure I will even return at some point in the future.  But at this point, I am left with a bad taste in my mouth from this experience.  Phil's can get something right that is so hard to do -- good BBQ -- but it can't correct a simple soda mix-up.

To each his own. I find the bbq sauce to be cloying and overpowering of the bbq flavor of the meat. My advice, ask for the sauce on the side and add your own to taste. San Diego is not known as a mecca for BBQ, so it not difficult to see why this place get the raves that it does.Life is too short to wait in a line for Phils bbq. Sometimes less is more. Phils a prime example. Porkman

You will be BBQ'd out once you leave this place!  Great foods.  Beside the delicious BBQ, I love the onion rings, you can tell it's freshly fried with the explosive taste of fresh onion contained inside as you take a bite into it.  Fun place to eat at every time I'm in SD.  But like everything, good things will come if you're willing to wait...in that line that is.  =D

If you're ever visiting San Diego, or live in the San Diego area, this is the BEST BBQ place ever!!! Pre-warning: this place tends to get packed very fast, & luckily when I arrived I had a reservation party to attend to, so I easily ditched the line. The size of the food is massive... yes I said massive. It's not expensive & definitely worth every dime, nickel & penny! It's a place cool enough for kids but chill for college students to go to. Definitely a must eat place.

Ok, I'm sure I don't have anything to say here that hasn't already been said, but I feel obligated to leave a review anyway because it is just that good.  I know there is better BBQ out there in the world, but this is by far the Best BBQ in San Diego!  And the sides???  Mmm!  It is all just soooo good!!!  I have been many times, and I'd say some favorites are the ribs (beef or pork - you can't go wrong), the El Toro, the Broham...and as for sides, the macaroni salad and the onion rings are my personal favorites.  Definitely don't come here if you are just "kinda hungry" though, because once you taste it you will just keep eating until it's gone.  The line does get crazy long, but it's worth the wait.  And if you don't feel like waiting, you can always call in an order to go.  Of course it's not as good to-go, but it's still pretty damn good.

Phil's menu is full of good choices. For your first time try one of the ticklers: Ribs, coleslaw, onion rings and fries. Other good choices are El Toro (sliced tri-tip sandwich) or BBQ Broham (pulled pork sandwich). If you phone the order to go you can eat in the comfort of your home/hotel and avoid the line.

Just be ready for a long wait if you want to eat here. This restaurant serves huge portions and just make sure you have a big appetite. Its pretty crowded as well.  Ribs are huge and juicy and I love their macaroni salad. Just be ready to eat like a dog because it can be messy.

We loved Phil's so much we had them cater our wedding! I know what you're thinking: BBQ for a wedding? It was the best decision we ever made! The staff was amazing and I probably made 345346 calls to the department confirming things or changing orders, etc. and their patience never grew thin! We had a tight budget on our wedding, but the one place my husband knew we'd spend money on was going to be good. Worth every penny. Even with our budget, we still were able to afford a full dinner menu for 50 people in an affordable range! They came and grilled right at our wedding location and during the ceremony, our wedding party was salivating in excitement for dinner as they could smell that sweet meat grilling away! I think I'll go ahead and add a picture of the meal at our wedding! Phil's is what it advertises itself to be: A great business that serves great food!

After all of the other great reviews written for Phil's BBQ, what else is there to say really?  I was surprised that the line still wrapped around the restaurant at 3pm on a Sunday, but it was well-worth the wait.  The food is absolutely delicious - even the tickler is really filling (baby back ribs, onion rings, cole slaw, and fries!) What tops off the experience is the service - the employees are so friendly and really make you feel at ease.  If you have some time to spare and are craving a delicious meal that's worth the time and money, Phil's BBQ is definitely a must-do in San Diego!

Best BBQ in San Diego. Been going here for 4 years. Always get the beefy chickless combo. Their beef ribs are SO tender it's amazing, and their sauce is great. All their side are good too, my favorite being the potato salad. Great atmosphere and friendly service.

Always on the search to satisfy my insatiable appetite for roadkill... this place simply kicks ass!  Waited about 15 min to get in and get seated.  The interior kinda reminded me of some places I've been to in New Orleans but anyways.  I've been to plenty of bbq joints in and out of Cali and I'm always plagued with this lingering feeling of "what if the bbq sucks?".  I admit I had the same feeling walking in and ordering.  But once the food came out and I sank my canines into the meat, I knew that my mouth had won the lotto.  The meat was very tender and the caramelized sauce looked perfect.  Not like some Texas joints where the meat looks as if it's been napalmed.  This place definitely lives up to the hype.  I wish I could review the sides but I was too fixated on the ribs to notice.  I will definitely be going back sometime in the near future with some eager out of towners...

I've come here several times.  The wait is always very long.  I prefer the baby back ribs to the beefy ribs, as in my opinion, they have more flavor, but you get more meat with the beefy ribs.  Most of their side dishes are okay, but I don't like the fries because they tasty bland after becoming cold.  The onion rings are tasty and big, but slightly on the expensive side.

I guess every city has one of these: a curiously mega-popular, stand-in-line-no-matter-how-long-it-is joint to which everybody in town flocks.  In my experience, they invariably turn out to be over-hyped, over-exposed mediocrities that seem to be popular merely for being popular, and Phil's is no exception. I found myself in the area yesterday, and I just had to try the place that has four-and-a-half stars and 2,285 reviews (not even New York has any place with that many reviews).  I figured 4:00 in the afternoon was a good time to go to avoid the crowds.  So I was surprised to find this barn-sized place nearly full even at that early hour, although luckily there wasn't much of a line (the line ended up outside the door by the time I sat down, so I guess I did come at a good time). I got the rib-less dinner, mostly so I wouldn't have to get my hands messy.  It came with two sides (or one big side), so I got the "sweet baked beans" and the potato salad, two musts for me at any BBQ place.  I like that they tell you (both verbally and on the receipt) how long your food will take to come out, even though they were wrong (they said 15-20 minutes, but it was only about 5 minutes). When it arrived, the pork didn't look very appetizing.  And it wasn't.  It was absolutely smothered in BBQ sauce.  If you need to drench your meat in sauce, something is wrong.  And the sauce wasn't even very good.  It was sweet and tangy, but far too rich and overpowering. Of course, the meat itself was a bit dry and tough, so there wasn't much to overpower. The sides weren't any better.  The "sweet" baked beans had, yes, an underlying sweetness, but they also had a bitter flavor that wasn't pleasant at all.  And the potato salad didn't have much taste at all. I don't get the popularity.  I really don't.

Decided to try the baby back ribs here. First couple of bites it was pretty good then it became way too sweet. Ribs were covered with so much sauce that I couldn't even taste the meat itself. Next time if I ever come back, I'd have the sauce on the side. Lines are long too..wait was about an hour.

Okay....so usually Phil's BBQ is on my wish list of places to eat but everytime me and my boyfriend pass by this place, the line is around the building.  Today, though, being a weekday, we made the trip from Mission Valley and walked right into the place and up to counter and ordered.  We both ordered the Beefy Rib dinners (3 Ribs - Two sides) and sat down and eagerly awaited the ribs we have had in the past - tender, moist meat that falls off the bone.  Today, however, that wasn't the case - even though it wasn't busy, our food took longer to get to us than on the busiest night we've been there.  And when it did finally get there, we were shocked to take our first bites into ribs that mostly were fat and gristle.  Although their delicious sauce disguised the meat for what it was, it was almost inedible for all the fat, gristle and tendons.   I can see getting a bad batch of ribs once in awhile but this was ridiculous.  It shouldnt have been served.  Had we not been starving, we may have gotten up and left our side dishes too.   For $15, we expected more.    For $40 bucks, we could have went and had a good sushi lunch.   Well, I think Phil's is off my wish-list.   Maybe Phil's success will be it's demise - losing sight of what made it a good place to begin with.  If you want good BBQ, without the hype and the line, pass on this place. UPDATE: My boyfriend's "ribs" went right through him - not-so-easy in, but very easy out.

Always a great place for BBQ. I am personally a fan of the Beef Ribs. The baked beans are great but the meat is why you come here. The meat is BBQed and slathered in Phils special BBQ sauce. The sauce is what carries this BBQ and there is no doubt about it. If you come here earlier in the day then you can beat the crowds. It's a shame that they are closed on Mondays though :(

This place doesn't need another 5-star review, but I'm going to give it one anyways. I was just down in San Diego for the weekend and hit this place up on the drive back to OC.  Since it's only about 10 minutes from Gaslamp, it was definitely worth the detour!  Reading other reviews, we tried to get there early.  We got there at 11:15am on a Sunday, about 15 minutes after it opens.  There was already a line of about a dozen people out the door.  The staff keeps it moving pretty fast, and we got through in about 20 minutes.  They are also really helpful with seating, so don't be worried if you don't see a table open. I ordered the baby back ribs.  They were fork tender and the sauce was sweet and tangy all at the same time.  I'm surprised not much has been written about the baked beans.  They were the best beans I've ever had in my life!  They had a great smokey taste, so you definitely knew they did NOT come from a can.  They added a dash of cajun seasoning to the potato salad that gave it a nice kick too.  The onion rings were also delicious, but they were served with ranch dressing.  Next time, and there will definitely be a next time, I will ask for an extra side of bbq sauce for dipping.

Overrated. Based on food alone (we waited for an hour in the rain to get in the place)-- tri-tip was dry and rubbery. Beef ribs were fatty and barely had anything edible on them. They look like huge Fred Flintstone ribs, but there wasn't any meat on them. The best thing we had were the onion rings. We were disappointed with the place. Service was fine, no complaints there. Update: The owner did email me and try to make it right. I'm pleased with the customer service :) I hope the meal we had was just an anomaly.

Phil's BBQ is a favored spot in San Diego for many San Diegans and for good reason. The food is tasty and you get a lot of it. Now I'm no BBQ expert and I've come across many a BBQ snob (when I mention Phil's), but those people should realize that the definition of what makes good BBQ is different for each person. All I know is that Phil's BBQ is tasty and I enjoy it so much it's in my regular rotation. I like the variety of plates they offer  Can't make up your mind between chicken or ribs? No problem, they got the "Best of Both" plates that include a quarter chicken, beef or pork ribs and two sides (I always opt for the bake beans and mac salad). The onion rings are very good too. If you're in the mood for a burger the BBQ Cheese Burger is yummy as well as their sandwiches. I'll usually get the BBQ Broham which is pulled pork shoulder meat topped with cole slaw. Once you get through the long line, service is quick and prompt. Sometimes though, when the lines are especially long, they have a poorly implemented system where once you get to the head of the line they shuffle you off back outside to wait for your name to be called. Also keep in mind that they are closed on Mondays. All in all, good BBQ for a reasonable price. Recommended.

phil's is good. probably really good for california BBQ, and maybe that's why there's always a line. it's nice to see restauranteurs making money doing what they like, so good for phil's. i don't consider myself a BBQ snob or aficionado, but i did live in kansas city for a while. and maybe for that reason i'm a bit biased. there are three aspects of BBQ, in my opinion. 1) the meat: i didn't find phil's meat all that flavorful. it didn't have the gamey, porky, smokey flavor that coop's has. in fact phil's meat didn't have much flavor at all. it mostly served as a phil's BBQ sauce and grease delivery system. sadly, phil's also doesn't have brisket or burnt ends. 2) the way the meat is cooked: i read somewhere that phil's doesn't use oak smokers or even wood, but humidified ovens with their own version of "the texas crutch". phil's meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, but it really lacked complexity. i've only ever had the ribs and pulled pork there, and when i had pulled pork it was, sadly, quite cold. not good.   3) the sauce:  midwestern style BBQ sauce wins hands down over other styles in the states, in my opinion, with TX style a close second. in both regions, the sauce is never applied to the meat by the person serving the food. instead it's slathered on by the person eating it.  i really dislike phil's sauce. it's too thick, too sweet, and they douse the ribs with WAY too much of it, even if you ask for less. this is disappointing. the meat is a bit bland. maybe they know this. but a lighter, punchier side of dipping sauce would make their ribs much better.

Visiting San Diego with my family and decided we wanted some BBQ, after a search of Yelp came to Phil's.  We arrived around 5 on a Thursday and the line was out the door, I would imagine there is going to be a line most of the time. We tried the pork ribs, beef ribs, tri-tip sandwich, chicken, onion rings and probably something else I can't remember.  The meat was flavorful however they used too much BBQ sauce which over powered the meat flavor in our opinion.  Our favorite was probably the beef ribs, a lot of meat on them bones.  When you order they give you the choice of putting the sauce on the side so if you don't like it drenched may want to leave it off

Just finished eating Phil's BBQ and honestly, it was just so-so. This is my 3rd or 4th Phil's meal and I always have the same impression when I finish....  Good, not great. The ribs were flavorful and tender, but I had several bites of gristle among the meat.  The pulled pork was very dry without sauce and I don't love their sauce.  Prefer a more Carolina vinegar based sauce.  Cole Slaw has way too much mayo in it.  Beans were tasty but watery.  Maybe I am just spoiled from 4 years living in Kansas City and 4 months spent in Charlotte, NC, but this is just not great BBQ.  Personally. I think Bubba's in La Jolla Cove is actually much better.  Their meat is very tender and flavorful, especially their sliced brisket and BBQ chicken and they have a few different BBQ sauces, including one that is more vinegar based. To wait in line for an hour to eat at Phil's just isn't worth it.

Not sure why everyone lives this place. Maybe cause it's one of the only BBQ joints around. The food is good. Not great. I lived down south for a couple years and know good BBQ. This doesn't impress me at all. Decent at best and the wait is always harsh. San Diego needs some better BBQ spots for certain. 3 stars cause it's just ok and the wait sucks.

This is probably the best bbq in San Diego, hands-down.  The place is always packed and the food is always good.  I usually stick to ribs and chicken, but the broham sandwich (pulled pork) is excellent as well.  The sides are pretty good here as well, I especially like the onion rings here, probably the best o-rings in SD. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable.  Probably not a whole lot I can add that others haven't already said.  I would just try to get in early if you can to avoid large rushes or call in your order and pick it up then just eat there.

Went here last month during my vacation down there by the recommendation of my step-dad's cousin. I'm in love. This is the best barbecue I had ever had. Everything was great besides that I had braces so I couldn't fully enjoy it with a full bite here and a full bite there but man, if I enjoy it this much, I don't wanna imagine how it will be with my braces off.

After hearing all about Phil's and how it's so good, I decided to give it a shot. I must say this has got to be the most overrated food in San Diego. It was average. Nothing out of the ordinary. After all was said and done, I had waited about 40 minutes for a mediocre burger. The potato salad was awesome, so I'll give them that! To each his own, I guess.

But still, if you like BBQ, you will enjoy Phil's, even though it may not measure up to back home. Its pretty crowded usually, and I've found that calling ahead to order take out is a good way to avoid waiting in line...I've also had good luck a few times eating in the bar area, where you can order directly from the bartenders. Get the pork baby back ribs with baked beans and corn on the cob as your sides.  Its the best item on the menu.  The other items are also very good, but I'm partial to ribs in general at a BBQ spot.

Haven't experienced much BBQ in San Diego but never really had to because this place is chronich. I always get the rib chickless dinner. For as busy as this place is they are very efficient and I've had a good experience every time I ate there. Eat here!

OK, quality of the dinner does live up to the reputation, great BBQ   But aside from that, I would like to point out something else I was quite impressed with the quality of customer service that they provided me today They were soooooo busy, but they still managed to take care of me and other customers, and they did it with a smile I give this place 5 stars because of that.

Phil's is the shizzle.  That's right.  I said shizzle.  Are those onion rings awesome or what?  Is Phil's the best BBQ in San Diego?  Is it the best BBQ in California?  Is it the best BBQ this side of the Mississippi?  I really don't care.  All that matters is that I love this place.   Don't like the line?  The solution is quite simple.  Go to Phils website, pick out your order and call ahead to take the BBQ home.  That's how I do it.  I called them this evening (Sunday) around 6, got to the restaurant about 6:20 and after congratulating Phil for being selected as the 2009 Restauranteur of the year by the California Restaurant Association, my buzzer went off telling me that my yummy ribs were ready for the ride home. Grabbed my full rib dinner with large mac salad, small order of onion rings and small beans and trotted (okay, I waddled) out the door to my car.  It's always so hard to drive home from Phil's with the wonderful aroma of those ribs filling the car but I managed to make it all the way home.  Again, as always, happiness was the end result of the meal. Their website is: http://www.philsbbq.net/ PS.  They're putting a new Lefty's Chicago Pizza in the old Phil's place in Mission Hills (if you didn't already know).

Nothing I can say that has not been said already. Just moved down here from LA 2 months ago and have eaten at Phills BBQ 9 times already.  I make it a point to go once a week! Don't let the long line scare you, they are fast and you will get to order in no time! Trust me, do NOT let it scare you!  15-20 min tops if it goes out the door and around the building.  Yes that's it.  Even IF the wait was 30 min or more (and it won't be) the Food... is... so... freaking... worth... it.

Phil's is BBQ heaven. A long wait but fun and worth the wait. You can order and pick up but the atmosphere is worth the line. The rib meat falls right off the bone. The sauce is tangy with a tinge of sweet. I love that they are not drowned in the sauce, you can get some extra BBQ sauce on the side and they serve it hot and the extra sauce is free. Can't beat that. The onion rings are a must. They are HUGE and you can get some good ranch sauce to dip them in. Make sure you share because the portions are BIG! Just the way BBQ joints are suppose to be. The place is modern and roomy. Flat screens playing big games, cool background music and serve yourself soda to wash it all down. Finger licking, lip smacking good. P.S. I like the coleslaw because it is not sweet like a lot of other places. Good balance. Beans are good too. Line looks psycho long but moves pretty quick. Even when wrapped around the building it is only half an hour. Worth the wait.

For the price, nothing beats phils. Their portions are gimongous and food comes out pretty quickly. The line tends to get very long but you get to the front in no time.  Their staff is also very very friendly. Eg. My gf and I placed our order and after waiting for, seriously only 5 minutes, an awesome waiter by the name of Darrell came by and asked us if we've been waiting long. I told him no it's only been 5 minutes and he tells me to hold on to go check up on our order. He then goes to the front counter and WAITS there and then personally delivers it to us. How awesome is that?? I love this place and though i live all the way up in northridge, I'll be making frequent trips to phil's.

I saw great reviews on here and took my family out to give this place a try. We have two toddlers and an infant and the staff was great with them. The ribs (pork AND beef) were amazing and the onion rings were the best part!!!! My kids even scarfed down the coleslaw, and the baby was sneaking it off of her brothers plates. If you get the bigger meals, obviously it gets a little more pricey. However, I got the Ticklers meal and it was only $6.95, and way more than I could eat. I didn't even touch my fries after the ribs, slaw and onions rings that all came on my plate. We are a very satisfied family and will definately be going back soon!!!

Best ribs I've had so far! They have great sides too! The only problem would probably getting a table since it's first come first serve and seat yourself type of restaurant, plus the place is usually packed! On weekends we usually just phone in our orders, pick them up and enjoy them at home. :) They do have outdoor seating that our family usually takes and we get a long table. It come with heaters so it's still good during winter.

Oh my god this place has the best ribs in the world! I ordered to go so I wouldn't have to wait in the long line. When I was waiting for my order to finish up I saw them making the meat and it looked amazing. The ribs were so good and it fell of the bone! The sauce was really good as well. I could eat this everyday if I could afford it. the fries were normal and the onion rings were really good but super oily. My second trip I got the beefy ribs and they were as good as the pork ribs. It was so soft and tender. The bone was so freaking huge, it was literally foot long! The wait in line was about an hour but it was so worth it. It is hard to choose from the pork or beef ribs because they are both so good.

Fri. 3/5/10 - Arrived with a group of 10 diners just a few minutes after they opened.  The line was short and the wait gave us time to plan our lunch strategy.  BTW...I dare you to stand in line at Phil's without getting hungry. The smell of BBQ sauce is everywhere! We were prepped in line by (Rhonda) so that we knew when a register was available to take our orders. They let us know that our food would be ready when our "call" device rang and helped us to the drink machines to "fill em' up" while we waited for our meals. (Louis), our table attendant, was very helpful and told us that if we needed anything he would be happy to help.  As our orders were ready, he told each person to stay seated and that he'd be right back with the food.  He was fast, efficient and made us feel welcome and comfortable. Dishes in this meal included: BBQ Broham Sandwich (Pulled Pork Shoulder) with fries El Toro Sandwich (Deli Sliced Tri Tip) with large side of O-Rings Half Rib Dinner with side of Cole Slaw and fries Let me tell you...there was enough food to feed an army.  With the number of fries and onion rings that were ordered, we were able to make them a community plate. The El Toro Sandwich (Deli Cut Tri Tip) I ordered, was tender, tangy and smoked to perfection.  Put a couple of the onion rings on the sandwich and you've definitely got a meal to remember.  The BBQ Broham Sandwich (Pulled Pork) was just another stack of BBQ'd goodness  between two buns and the cole slaw that was included with the sandwich complimented it very well.  At one point there was total silence at the table ++good sign++ while everyone enjoyed their food.  The ribs looked and smelled wonderful and had I not been full, I would have sampled some of it, but I'll just have to do that on a return visit.  Oh yes...there will be a return visit!  As I looked around the table I saw nothing but smiles (and an occasional "belly rub"). As we prepared to leave, (Rhonda) came by with a smile and a hug to thank us for stopping in for lunch and invited us to come back soon.  She was warm and sincere.  Thanks to Rhonda, Louis and the rest of the staff at Phil's for the great food and superb customer service.

First visit to Phill's...but come on, I take my BBQ seriously. An hour and forty minute wait without one sniff of smoke...I should have known.  My group all agreed that the side dishes were very good. The ribs and the chicken were just OK. The meats slathered in too much house sauce seemed only to cover up the sin of no smoke ring or smoke flavor.  Not worth the wait in line. There has got to be a real BBQ place in San Diego for my next visit...Anyone?

I would give one star, but I think that then nobody would take it seriously.  Plus the actual Pork rib meat had good smoky flavor and they alone without sauce deserve a 4 plus star rating.   I grew up in Oklahoma and spent a lot of time in texas.  BBQ is big where I come from.  I have had Lots of Good BBQ and plenty of bad BBQ.  This is the 3rd time I've had Phil's.  We were going to try Abbey's tonight (Saturday) but they were closed. I gave it 3 chances.  The Corn on the cob was pretty good.  The kids "Tickler" plate of Chicken Brest was pretty Good.  I have a big problem with the sauce though.  Both my wife and I find it WAY too sweet.  If they offered some other Sauces, I might go for the ribs.  Now for the Bad. I ordered the Toro Sandwich.  It was inedible.  Smelled like B.O.  Seriously.  I threw it in the trash and ate most of my wife's pulled pork sandwich which was merely Bad.  But at least it was edible. Incidentally I ate at Kaminski's BBQ in Poway for Lunch.  I had the Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich.  It was Excellent.  Their Brisket is good too.  Next time, My 25 minutes will be spent driving to poway instead of waiting in line at Phil's. FYI.  This review comes from a person who loves food.  I will eat just about anything and I will always try something a second time if I didn't like it the first time.  I plan to write some positive reviews for some joints I do like.  It's just that I am blown away that Phil's is considered the Best BBQ in town.  I will try some other BBQ joints that are rated well.  But maybe if Phil's is the best San Diego can do, This means there may be room in the market for some Restauranteur with a good BBQ Recipe.  Sorry For Hatin' Phil.

This place is AMAZING!  I am not a BBQ fan, but Phil's has won me over!  Sometimes I find myself daydreaming about this tasty food.  And yes, there is always a line, but that's because it is sooo good!  We always call in the order and eat at home, but I also don't mind waiting in the regular line because it is worth it!  The staff is super friendly and they work hard to get your food to you quickly.   The BBQ sauce is very yummy!  I always get ribs.  And the mac salad is to die for!  Even if you're not a fan, I suggest you try it.  I would kill for that recipe.  The onion rings and fries are awesome too.  I don't like cole slaw, but they even managed to make that good enough for me to like.  The portions are good, plenty for leftovers. Phil's is my favorite place to eat!

This is the most over-rated, over-hyped restaurant in San Diego.  The quality of the food is actually good, I hasten to add.  But if you are going expecting proper bbq, this isn't it.  There's really no smokey flavor to speak of, and the sauce is this bizarre concoction that's more like chinese sweet and sour sauce than bbq sauce. As I said, the food is not bad, but given the price and the crowds and the general hype about this place I prefer to steer clear.

The only reason phils didnt get five stars out of the thousands of reviews is probably everyone knocked it down a star for the long wait. But that just means that the fooood is reallyy that good! I come here all the time and just recently went with a party of 30 for my friends birthday. The servers accommodated us quickly and efficiently. They were all on top of their game and I was very impressed. I always come here for the EL TORRRROOOO which id the best ever and THE WHOOPIEE PIES. You have to get the Whoopie pies seriously! This is the second thing I love about coming to Phil's. First being EL TORROOOO of course. I do wish they had better sides like mac n cheese or mashed potatoes...o well still delicious.

By far one of the best BBQ ribs i have had, the sauce is sweet and delicious and the brisket falls off the bone. All of the sides are great and the onion rings are must have. I recommend going in week-ins at like 2p.m. to 4p.m. because the lines on weekends are ridiculous. Overall, you must go here if you live in San Diego.

Absolutely the best BBQ! Ever! Let me make it short...stop reading my review and get over there!!! If it's your birthday then you better go NOW!!! No waiting in line for birthday celebrants! It was my wife's birthday and we decided to have lunch at this place. To share to everyone, my wife doesn't like BBQ at all. It took a lot of convincing to get her interested. Plus reading the reviews here at yelp helped. Again, it's her birthday and I was worried that she'll be disappointed. So when we're about to order, I decided to order almost the whole main course. Full rack of baby back ribs, 2 beef ribs, tri-tip sandwich (El Toro), pulled pork sandwich and 3 small side dishes. The baby back and beef ribs falls of the bone and it's cooked perfectly. The pulled pork and tri-tip sandwich were so tender and juicy. Their BBQ sauce was tantalizing and full of balance of saltiness, sweetness, sourness and spiciness. Anyhow, here we go...I was patiently waiting for my wife's reaction and it only took one bite of the beef ribs then she's IN!!! It's like Pacman and Pacwoman doing there thing. After an hour, the only thing was left was the tri-tip sandwich, which we took for to go. We also bought a whoopie pie for dessert, Phil's dry rub and BBQ sauce. I beg you!!! Please go to Phil's BBQ asap!!! You won't regret it!

Best in the Country! I have lived in the South, had Kansas City authentic BBQ, and traveled across the country several times and I have to say this is my favorite place of all time! I think their BBQ sauce is the best anywhere. A bit spicy, a bit sweet, and a bit tangy. Its perfection! Best Menu Items: Baby Back Ribs- Pure perfection! Brohman (Pulled Pork Sandwich) - Best I have had in my life! El Toro (BBQ Beef Sandwich)- If you like sliced beef than this is for you. Onion Rings- Handmade and some of the best ever. Get BBQ Sauce and buttermilk to dip them in. The wait sucks though. Either go towards closing on a weeknight, or do take-out. I don't even bother waiting in line anymore. Glad to see it doing so well these days. The owner Phil is a great guy!

Simply Outstanding.  We love Phil's!  The food is great and the beer is frosty cold. We get the El Toro and the Ribs dinner, they are consistently great. If you love BBQ - you have to try this place!

BOMB! I typically come here for the El Toro or the Phil's Ticklers. Phil's BBQ is delicious, comes in large qualities and is completely affordable. The sauce is excellent, the people are friendly, and the place has a fun, relaxed atmosphere. Unfortunately sometimes the line gets ridiculously long, particularly on Friday or Saturday nights. You can literally wait an hour in line and the wait will still be worth it.

Went here last Sunday, must say the food was excellent as always.  I just find that is was completely absurd that they were passing infomercials on the tv, while there was an NFL playoff game going on, asked the waiter if she can change it, and she said no, you can go to bar and watch it.  C'mon man!! Atleast I now know not to come during NFL sundays.

When the line is all the way around the building, that's a sign the food is great.  For those who love BBQ like myself, I can't stop raving about this place.  The portions are great for big eaters.  The food quality is very tasty.  The beef BBQ ribs are my fave--the meat just comes right off the bone and not full of fat like some rib places.    Food has always been consistently fresh and hot.  The service is very nice.   The only thing I don't like is the long wait if eating indoors on a busy night, but definitely worth it when you got to have BBQ.

sorry guys and gals.  this isn't anything better than flamed burned grease and bbq sauce over a wood blame. The chicken did seem to be juicy but lacked thr rich smoke ring.   It ain't "low and slow"  we went on 1-12-11 just after they reopened after their holiday.   Very organized service,  SidesI had were nothing special.  I wish people would not hype these "trendy" resturants when they don't know what the heck they are talking about.  Talk about the blind leading the blind. For my disclaimer... I find most bbq joints on the west coast barely a 3 or 4, never found a 5 yet out here, except by friends who are obsessed with bbq/grilling want to know more about bbq/grilling , try amazingribsdotcom.  they are a good place to start(this is a not my maketing scam to get you to go there) -Brian

I don't know what the craze is, its pretty good but ppl make it out to be the best ribs out there.  I have to take off a star b/c the line is usually crazy lines.  The broham sandwich I had was pretty good but you need extra sauce b/c it can get a little dry.  Also, the onion rings look like they are genetically engineered b/c they are huge!  Other than the long line, its worth checking out but don't have your expectations super high like i did.

Very good BBQ.  I had the chicken/pork rib combo and the ribs are definitely better than chicken.  Their pork rib is very tender and flavourful.  The chicken, on the other hand, is a bit dry.  so if I go back I will probably go with just the pork rib dinner.  Portion is very good for the price also, especially the french fries side.

I unfortunately work in the office complex behind where this Phil's BBQ is located.  I say unfortunately because I really wish they would go away.   My coworkers and I were so excited when they opened the location here, and we all went there quite frequently in the beginning.  My company also holds meetings occasionally at their Events Center. The food is just average, definitely nothing to rave about, but my real beef is with the absolute chaos that the restaurant has brought to the area.  They are the worst neighbors! They took over several prime parking spots with all of their delivery trucks.  In spite of designating so many good parking spaces for their delivery trucks, they still park them illegally next to their building, blocking access to other open, unmarked spaces on our side of the complex.  On top of that, their employees park on our side of the complex, including in a few spots that my company specifically designated for our own clients.  On Mondays when we get to work, we often find empty Styrofoam containers, rib bones, and Corona beer bottles and tops scattered around the parking lot.  Also, since they moved into the area, a few of us have had our vehicles hit in the parking lot, including myself.  Not to say that it is the Phil's BBQ employees, but it seems awfully coincidental that it started happening around the same time that the restaurant moved here. I think they just need to move to an area that is much less congested, preferably a larger stand-alone building with its own parking lot.  That way all of the masses of employees and customers have sufficient space.  This little office complex is just way too small.

This Place is excellent!! The food is amazing, the customer service is superb.  I have come here with my family and they they enjoyed it.  My favorite is the baby back ribs.  I also like it boneless. So much meat and almost no fat. Juicy and delicious.  Their onion rings are great too.  The only thing I think is a little annoying is the line on a weekend, but any place that's good will have that..  So its well worth the wait.  The Prices are OK. Their not cheap but they aren't crazy either.  Just depends on how much you eat..This is definitely a place I would recommend.

There are millions of people in the South laughing at us SoCal folks right now.  There is probably a taco shop in Memphis that is a step above Taco Bell that all the locals are giving 5-Star ratings to as having the best Mexican food ever.  Phil's is our equivalent of a Memphis taco shop.  Phil's food is good.  There wouldn't be a line stretching around the building during the lunch and dinner rushes if it wasn't but as far as being the best BBQ of all time??? no.  I'm not a big fan of beef ribs but I'd say Phil's are pretty good.  The babybacks are well seasoned and smoked til tender (and the sauce is 4-star).  The chicken is good too.  The brisket is out of this world.  Oh...wait...they don't have brisket.  You MUST have brisket to be considered a BBQ joint in my book.  I am well aware there are many types of BBQ but brisket is a BBQ staple and Phil's ain't got it.  I might be low-balling with the 3-star rating as the place is clean, friendly, and the food is certainly good, but I tend to be more of a realist and I honestly don't believe this is 5-star BBQ.  It is a bit pricey but you can get a good value with one of the "tickler" baskets or sandwiches (and news to all of you fat Americans out there, myself included, you don't need a full rack of ribs with fries and baked beans...portion control...portion control).  I truly do love this place, but as Yelp ratings state "3-stars is A-OK" and Phil's is exactly that.  Nothing incredibly special, but A-OK.

Hands down, best BBQ joint in San Diego.   Yes I liked the feel of the restaurant better when it was in a tiny house in Mission Hills (dangerously, within walking distance..) and yes the new location is less personal.  But take it from a near-weekly customer for the past 4 1/2 years or so.  It. Just. Doesn't. Get. Any. Better.  Enjoy an icy cold Arrogant Bastard with your Broham sandwich--you'll see what I mean.

I am not a BBQ fan, but the sauce blew me away! Sweet and tangy but not overwhelming. Rarely do I eat Chicken when I order out, but the chunks of chicken breast were tender and juicy with just the right amount of sauce. It was so good that when my conscious started questioning if the chicken was hormone and gmo free, pastured and cruelty free, my taste buds promptly dismissed my snobby organic standards. I would not have cared if the chicken was crated all its life, lived in its own feces and had breast bigger than mine, I would have still gobbled Phil's BBQ up! Even the french fries, onion rings, and macaroni salad were delicious. And I dislike onion rings and macaroni salad.  My boyfriend has even associated being new our new home when he smells Phil's as we near our place.

I can't say enough good things about Phil's BBQ. The ribs are mouth watering and the prices are perfect. I tell everyone I know that hasn't tried Phil's to give it a try and they will be hooked just like I was after the first visit there. This place has to be good to have customers waiting outside in the cold for over 30 mins just to get inside. Experience Phil's for yourself.

The BBQ was freakin' awesome!  I ordered the baby back ribs and they were fall-off-the-bone saucy goodness on a plate!  Not only was the BBQ some of the best I have had, but the sides were equally savory.  The cole slaw was awesome, the onion rings were awesome, and the macaroni salad was awesome.  The entire meal was awesome.  The only reason I am not giving Phil's 5-stars is because of how long I had to wait.  I hate waiting, but for Phil's, it might just be worth it!

The staff at Phils looks like they want to die. They lack communication between one another and have no idea what is going on. They tell you "Sit anywhere you can find a seat". We went to a table then another girl said "Oh! This table is for a larger group!, you can go sit inside or somewhere else". Seriously after an hour of waiting!!! They should retrain their staff on customer service skills. Not one person seemed happy to be working here. I would recommend McDonalds before this place!

Very disappointed, I drove from orange county for the signature BBQ tri tip sandwich after seeing it on tv.  It looked nothing like the the sandwich I saw on tv.  It was too thinly sliced and didnt appear to be cooked as it was on tv.  The sauce was terrible and had it not been for the ice cold beer my lunch would have been less than two stars.

I love Phil's! I always get the ribs and a huge macaroni salad, which is some of the best I have tasted I might add, and the onion rings are to die for....But i just wish they would get a bigger location for San Diego, theres just so many people who want Phil's and not enough space. I will wait in line for however long for this BBQ but it sucks when its cold outside haha. I waited 30 mins in the call-in line! But it was worth it but much better sitting down...so Phil's think about moving to a bigger location in San Diego ( just for me :) because San Marcos is so far) ha just kidding...but not really.

Phil's is AWESOME! If the line wasn't always so long I would eat here more often. Some people give Phil's a bad review over the line, but in reality if a place is always that busy the food must be great, Right? It's always worth the wait.  A little tip for those who enjoy the El Toro as much as I do; If you order one El Toro with a "bun on the side", and add an additional "bun on the side", you can can make two El Toro's for the price of one!! There's that much extra meat! JACKPOT! :)

My friend and her boyfriend came down from the Bay Area and I have heard so many good things about this place that I decided that we should try Phil's together. My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile but have always been discouraged due to the length of the line. Anyway, we arrived to Phil's around 7:30PM on a Friday night, the line was fairly long, it took us about an hour till we finally were able to order our food. It's a seat-yourself-after-you-order type of place. Good thing there were plenty of places to sit so it wasn't too bad. The wait for the food wasn't too long so that was good. I ended up ordering the El Toro which is a tri-tip sandwich and a small side of onion rings. My boyfriend got half Beefy Ribs and half chicken, while my friend and her boyfriend got the baby back rib dinner. The El Toro, it was good, but it wasn't what I expected. I was hoping for something sweeter, but it was more tangy and had a kick. I'm not a huge fan of spicy food D: Good portion though. Anyway, the onion rings were really good, and HUGE! I loved the batter! I tried a piece of my boyfriend's chicken and rib. LOVED LOVED LOVED the chicken! It was so tender and bursting with flavor! The rib was pretty good too, but definitely didn't leave me with the same reaction as the chicken. For the half beefy rib and half chicken, it's like $12.45 which is an amazing deal! My boyfriend was full off of one beefy rib (they're huge) and the chicken. My friends enjoyed their meal as well. The workers are super nice too! I would definitely come back, my boyfriend and I made it a point to come around 9:30PM on Fridays (when they close at 11PM) since the line isn't long, there is a lot of parking, and plenty of places to sit [: I also forgot to mention that they were giving out free samples of their fries while standing in line.

O.K., this is the first review I've written on YELP and I need to set the record straight on BBQ.  Phil's is just o.k.  If you don't know, then you don't know and that's a lower case O.K. at that.  It is a poor rendition of a North Carolina BBQ.  I have had the savory pleasure of having BBQ all over the US including my favorite in Nashville, TN's Bar-B-Cutie.  It is NEVER about the sauce and for me, I like a dry  rub that brings out the best of the meat.  Leave the vinegar at home.  I was just there tonight to give it another shot as I had not been there for about a year, but it left me wanting to have some real BBQ.  I gave it two stars as it is a least palatable.

A~V~E~R~A~G~E! boo... we ordered their infamous ribs and it was super soggy (the meat wasn't even cooked well) with the sauce drenched ... trust me, i love me sauces and drenching my food with yummy sauces but this was no bueno!!! nonono!!!! even their sides, we ordered their LARGE veggies... their LARGE could have easily fed a 5year old because it def did not fill up 2 hungry pigs... damn PHIL, what are you thinking??? just to give you a quick overivew, they have tons to choose from. from award winning ribs, just serving baby back rib dinners (a full rib set is looking at 10~12 bones for ~$20, and half of it, was like $13.) this includes 2 small sides or a large, but i shit you not, their large was not really a large... you can also order just the ribs.... they also have bbq chicken dinners, or you can get the best of both.... ) they also have sammies, and more... i would HONESTLY save my appetite and go to tony roma's for their ribs... HANDS DOWN... service was great, attentive and super friendly! for a place this busy the wait wasnt that bad, we waited 10 mins max and ready to get our grub on... very sad..... left disappointed.... not my favorite place, THATS for sure... closed mondays.

p.s. if you write a bad review, the "owner" berates you and insults your bbq iq in an email he properly corrected me by informing me that they serve tri-tip (actually best when grilled over a hot hot hot fire) not brisket (best when smoked low and slow), this should tell you a lot about the place

i'm not sure what the hype is all about. you stand in line, you order at a counter and a few minutes later you pick up your order from the kitchen. the food is average, at best. i came with a large party and we all ordered different things. the consensus was that the portions are generally sized, but in terms of BBQ the food is just OK. definitely not worth the wait, in my opinion -- well over an hour on a wednesday evening.

ru kiddin me? People in San Diego are just as bandwagonish with food as they are with the Chargers and the Raiders. I guarantee most people writing these reviews have never had bbq OUTSIDE of the state before. The sweet rub is full of sugar because it chars easily. Ive never had charred bbq until Phil's. They should call it Phil's coleslaw because that was better than the actual bbq. The sauce was mediocre..the meat was just ok. The BBq Pit in National City taste better if u ask me. Also, what do people get out of trying to eat in a place with soo much activity?? Im there to eat, not listen to 1000 voices in my head. People saying the BBQ was super yummy really concerns me if they consider this real bbq. id hate to see their reaction if they visit CHicago, Kansas, texas, or Ga bbq places... San Deigo needs to stick to what their known for...a good burrito. lol..not funny

5 stars for the staff!   bf and i drove down to sd from long beach one friday night just to have an adventure and get some (what we heard is) great bbq.  side note: our friend was absolutely correct.   anywho...bf called the place to see what time they closed..let em know we were coming from lb.  when we arrived, my bf mentioned we'd traveled a while just for this bbq and the guy taking care of us at the counter asked if we were the couple from lb.  we're famous.  we got drinks and a few extra rings on the house.  THANK YOU! now...we ordered a literal metric ton of food for the two of us cuz we were like "how often do we make it out to sd, and anyway we drove an hour and a half, let's make this worth it."  boy WAS IT!!!!  this place is amazing.   phil's is clean, tastey and the staff is outstanding.  we shall return again and again...even if it's just for a saturday afternoon adventure cuz we've got a rumbly in our tumblys.

if there was ever a restaurant that fit the description of "ayite," it's Phil's.  the ribs are good, but i don't think 900 5-stars good.  bbq sauce is on the sweeter side (rather than spicy).  for toursists, like myself, it's a tough call on whether to use one of your few meals on this place while in SD because the wait is long and you only have the choice of ribs or chicken - no brisket and no links.  this place is a one shot deal for out-of-towners, go here just to say you've tried it.  definately not a repeater like Versaille in LA or even Roscoe's.

My best friend drove from the bay to visit me and one of the things he wanted to do was eat at Phil's. Keep in mind that I live about a hour from LA, where we could have easily picked a spot there. Better yet, we could have ventured a little further to Orange County but none of those places could replace his dying wish to go to Phil's. So off we went, which was a 2+ hour drive. When we got there, the line wrapped around the building so I had an general idea about this place, meaning it must be pretty damn good. My best friend told me Phil's had the best ribs and onion ring he has ever had in his life. What did I think? It was great. The meat had a nice smokey flavor to it. Omg the meat was so good, it literally fell off the bone. The dinners come with two small sides or one large size so I picked the fries and macaroni salad. My best friend had the ribs, potato salad, and baked beans with a side order of onion rings. We both thought we could finish our meals in one sitting but we were sorely defeated by the meal. The portion was big, the staff was wonderfully nice and funny, and the meal was great! Great choice, bff.

i can't believe that i haven't written a review of phil's bbq.  i've been coming to phil's back when it was in mission hills. when a place has a reputation for being amazing, and never disappointing...you kinda figure, it's just a given, and no words are needed.  phil's bbq is as busy as ever, the line goes out the door and around the restaurant. i couldn't believe how fast our food got to the table. ESPECIALLY because the place was packed. we ordered, got our drink, sat down, and our number was called. the baby back ribs have a great char to them but are still tender and fall of the bone, finger lickin goodness.   the buttermilk onion rings are BIG and they are crisp. the small order, is not so small, and is good enough for two. the service is TOP NOTCH. the table attendant was attentive, super friendly and pleasant - was so fast with getting us extra sauces and napkins, and offered to refill our drinks. brave the line, and get urself down to phil's!!

Went there over the summer and mind you I came to San Diego from St. Louis which is second to Kansas City for BBQ.  Phil's is very good-almost as good as St. Louis.  I would have given them a 5 stars but the place was so darn crowded and I hate to wait in line for food of any kind.  Our waitress was excellent.  We had a large crowd and usually you have to stand in line, place your order, pay for it then if you're lucky you can find a seat.  She allowed us to do it backward.  We found a table for the group and laid claim to it.  The she let one of us go up to the corner of the counter and give our order.  If they are doing so good, maybe they ought to open up two or three more stores in town to decompress the one they have now.  I'll probably go back sometime but it'll have to be without kids.  There is no way they would be able to stand in line and wait for as long as it can take on a busy night.

Wow, Phil's BBQ in Point Loma is off the hook. Now I'm not a huge BBQ saucy guy, I love a good BBQ chicken or meats, but haven't been a sauce kinda guy until I was introduced to this spot by friends who live in Spring Valley. When you think about going here I'd suggest viewing the website to see the on location cam to see how long the wait is, we showed up around 3pm on a Saturday and OMG I was like "No BBQ is worth this wait" , boy was I wrong . I have to give a huge shout out to the ace staff "Christine, Tammie , Louis , Brandon and the Manager George, from the gate we were welcomed and made sure our visit was tops, thank you all..Now on to the food, after ordering we got out piping hot food within 10 minutes, and the fun began, the flavored of the ribs were sweet and had a little kick , and if you blew on them the meat fell right off the bone, the chicken came chick-less (or you could do the bone) and two side choices (double upon on the macaroni salad) wow, my girlfriend got the BBQ cheesburger and these huge , crispy onion rings..yum yum, we both pick and ate from eachothers plates until both were cleaned, we even got two large macaroni sides togo, I am now a BBQ fan (Phil's or nothing for life), thank you all and counting down till the next trip , lunch tomorrow lol

Phil's BBQ = California's Mecca of BBQ. All outdoor grills should be facing in the direction of Phil's BBQ. I used to work as a chef at a BBQ joint (Bruno's BBQ - don't go there, the new owners totally ruined the place) in Santa Cruz while I was going to school so I consider myself sort of an expert on the subject. Anything you order here will clog your arteries but consider the sacrifice worthwhile. All of their meats are cooked to perfection with the brown sugar expertly caramelized. The baby back ribs and the beef ribs aren't too fatty and melt off the bone. Their signature BBQ sauce is the perfect combination of tanginess and sweetness. The only suggestion I would make would be to add a little bit of black or cayenne pepper spice to add another layer of depth to the sauce. One order of onion rings is enough to cause deep vein thrombosis. Every bite is a delicious step toward cardiac arrest. The people who work here are fun and seem genuinely interested in you having a good time and enjoying the food. Don't be intimidated by the line that consistently stretches around the block, it moves fast. I'd happily wait 30+ minutes again just to have another opportunity to consume this soulful ambrosia.

Dunno what the hype is about. Had the baby back ribs and BBQ chicken with fries and corn. Chicken was good. Moist. Ribs were also good but kinda burned. I had to pick off the charred parts or else there would be flaky bitter pieces. BBQ sauce kinda too sweet. In my opinion, BBQ should be more savory. Meat was tender but not very meaty at all. Too mushy. The worst thing is that the food is not hot!! How ya gonna eat BBQ that's not hot? Not worth the hour wait.

Wow what can I say, its good to be suprised sometimes. When we headed out to this establishment, i didnt know what to expect (actually i was picturing a small run down hole in the wall type place). When we arrived, i saw it - "Phils BBQ" in big ass bright red letters. Instead of a small hole in the wall we stumbled across a bbq haven. Very big and modern. When you enter you place your order in the cafeteria style counter and sit yourself down somewhere (who needs waiter and hostesses anyway). After a good 10 to 15 min u get paged (the pager speaks to you too! sorry easily amused) and grab your food from the counter. I ordered the pork ribs and chicken with a side of onion rings and ranch. Took my first bite and wow  was in for a pleasant surpise. The ribs were bomb, the chicken was good although i couldn't finish it all and the onion rings were awsome. All i can say is i was very satisfied and way too full when i left. Prices were right and the food was plentiful and delicious- 4 stars

Let me start by saying I did not want to like this place.  I come from Texas barbeque, and we can be quite snobbish when it comes to barbeque outside the realm of the great state.  I was hesitant to believe all these Californians who said that this was the best BBQ on the planet.  So, when my friend suggested we go for lunch, I kinda shrugged.  Well, I will be the first to admit that was wrong, very very wrong.  I thought that the place was sit-down with a waiter, which is so un-BBQ to me, but nope, it is a line out the door, as it should be.  I got the quarter order baby backs, with a side of corn on the cob, and my friend and I split the onion rings.  For the price, I was pretty impressed.  I was totally full, to the brim, when I left.  I loved that the corn on the cob was a whole ear, not the half ears that most places give you.  The ribs were falling off the bone kinda good.  The onion rings were by far the best I've ever had.  Huge and crisp and dipped in nice and cool ranch.  I could have totally just eaten those for lunch and been satisfied.  We were outside the door in the line, and within about 15-20 minutes we were sitting at a table with our food.  For my personal taste, the sauce is a little thick and sweet, I prefer a more vinegar based sauce myself, but theirs is still pretty solid.  I will be back, again, and again, and again.

boyfriend has died and gone to meat heaven. we decided to take our cousins here based on our fellow yelpers enthusiasm. cousin is a total meat lover as well so despite the long ass line out the door, they agreed to wait with us. and boy was it worth it! i'm not even a huge fan of bbq and i totally grubbed out. first, the pork ribs were tender and the sauce was lip-smackingly good. the beef ribs were huge and the meat totally fell of the bone. i really liked their onion rings as well. we got a ridiculously huge basket of beer-battered rings that were a perfect heart-attack causing compliment to our meat orgy.

Not from this area, but I'm a big foodie and had to make the trip to see the hype. As I pulled up to the restaurant there was a line wrapping almost around the entire plaza. Finally found a parking spot. I was excited I've never seen a restaurant this packed. I knew it had to be amazing. The line looked about 1.5 - 2. Hours long. I decided to just do the take out and get out of there. As I took my first bite into my baby back ribs I wasn't amazed or disappointed. They were good but def not the best BBQ I've ever had. I've worked in the restaurant industry my whole life and have Tried numerous BBQ from southern states. I also currently work in a three star michelin restaurant. Overall the ribs were a 7/10. The pulled pork sandwich was a 6/10 as it lacked the ideal amount of sauce to adequately cover the large portion of pork the sandwich had. Not worth the wait but if your in the area and hungry its worth a try.

One of the best tasting ribs i have ever had. and i know my ribs. these pork ribs at Phils are to die for. the meat falls right off the bone and are dripping with bbq sauce.thats how ribs are supposed to be. i normally get a full rib dinner with fries and beans. i know what a fat ass. but if you can throw down then why not. it is pretty pricey and the place can get really crowded with the line going out the door around the corner. but i wont complain. all of that is worth it. and guys don't worry about missing a game. they have flat screen TVs throughout the restaurant that always have some sort of sport playing on them so you can catch up on anything you are missing. If i could i would come here all the time. but if i did then i wouldn't have any money left and i would probably weigh 300 pounds. so i'm gonna stick to the half rib dinner and hit the gym shortly after. thats if the food coma doesn't kick in.

would you drive from la to san diego to eat phils? and do nothing else? i would.. and i have.. and that's probably why this place gets 5 stars from me.. it's so good.. that i don't even mind the mind boggling line they have constantly out the door.. baby back ribs is the name of the game.. throw down 2 sides with that.. and i'm in heaven..   its not often that really really popular places can crank out consistenly good food.. but this place does it.. and does it good.. i like the fact that you just order at the counter and go find a seat.. there's no servers around but there are always really helpful dining room staff that can get you whatever you need.. but who need anything besides ribs and a roll of paper towels which is already on the table. i don't know how they do it, but the ribs just have this additional depth of flavor and smokeyness that you cant find anywhere else.. and its not even about the bbq sauce at all here.. most places slather it on.. this place uses it as an accompaniment to their delicous bbq'ed meat..

If you're into BBQ with a kick like me, this place is great. The yelpers who said that the sauce has too much vinegar might be right but I like it that way. I get the half rack rib dinner with corn on the cob and extra BBQ sauce. It's just enough to put me in a coma.

phil's is good eats in a great part of town.  maybe i am biased as i live only a few blocks away.  the only real bad thing about phil's is the wait sometimes.  it is very busy during popular times to eat.  however, truck on over there around 5ish on a sunday and you got it made.  they also have a few outdoor tables which i like.  i read they are opening a new restaurant over around sports arena that will have a full bar.  my thoughts is that it will hopefully make the wait a little less in mission hills.

If your looking for good ribs, this is the place for you.  I ordered their half rack of baby back ribs and they were served exactly as described... "slide off the bone."  I almost ordered a full rack thinking half wouldn't cut it.  I'm glad I didn't go for the full rack.  I was beyond full finishing a half rack.  The side orders are just as big.  You may want to stay away from the BBQ chicken.  It didn't taste marinated at all.  It's as if they grilled it and slabbed some BBQ sauce on it.  The restaurant is self seated.  You order and pay for your meal, then seat yourself.  On a Thursday night, finding a table to seat seven was pretty difficult, but the waiters were helpful in securing a spot for our party.  What was eye catching about this place was the open wash area they have for rinsing down your BBQ coated lips and fingers after you are done eating.  I just thought it was a bit funny.

Well you already know how good the food is, so let me expound on their EXCELLENT SERVICE as well.  Went with 9 peeps for the king's birthday celebration...as per usual, the line was long but that's never been a deal breaker, they had the hot heaters suntanning our heads so we were good. As soon as we were within eyeshot of the host, he came right over and asked how many were in our party, and IMMEDIATELY whisked us away to the magic land...to make it even easier for us, he took our order at the table, AND delivered our food!!! His fellow co-worker made sure to load us up on extra sauces, wet naps, silverware, etc, and came back often to make sure we were all fat happy campers!  I hooked them up with a ginormous tip and the left over birthday cake (take note people, the servers like cake too) and all was good in the hood...Thank you to Phil and his crew for yet another awesome dining experience.

Well, I was surprisingly dissapointed...the restaurant is large, great atmosphere, I got food to go. I had heard so much about Phil's, and never heard anything bad. So decided to head there after leaving Sea World...anyways, I am a HUGE barbeque fan, so I got the ribs, and the El Toro sandwich. The sauce is okay, not fantastic...the coleslaw was very dry, beans were pretty good. (fries at this restaurant are very soggy). Anyways, sandwiches were huge, but just not my taste. My husband loved them, though..so it depends on the person, I guess. I recommend Barbecue Pit in Fletcher Hills. My all time favorite barbecue in San Diego....maybe I was expecting Phil's to be similar..anyways, Phil's is also very expensive!!lunch was almost $30!!!Yikes.

Phils does a great job, the food is good, the atmosphere is casual like a BBQ joint should be. There is usually a line but the wait is not bad and the food is well worth it.  The prices are great for the meal you get. I would defiantly put this on the list of places to eat.

Awesome BBQ. I have a favorite place in NorCal and had been searching for a great place in San Diego. San Diegans already know about this place though - no need to let people know since the word is out. The Sports Arena location packs 'em in - what lines! The bar on the side doesn't serve food  though but provides a nice place to wait for a table if you can't find one (tables are first come first serve). The BBQ chicken is extremely tasty and an all-around favorite. For some reason their macaroni salad is better than any I've had elsewhere - not sure what it is, but it had that special something. Onion rings are HUGE and enough to share amongst a large group. Love how they offer fresh veggies as another side. Easy to be healthy here. They also have tons of drink options - iced tea, Crystal Light, Fresca, along with the normal Coke, Sprite, etc. Love this place. Love, love, love. Ahhh BBQ.

Dear San Diego: Do you know what real BBQ tastes like?  Apparently not.  I'm baffled that 1000+ Yelpers give this place 4+ stars.  The beef ribs and chicken were too tough, a sign that it was cooked too quickly.  Only thing decent was the baby-back ribs, but even then there was no hint of smoke in the meat or the sauce.  I rate this place just a notch above Tony Roma's,  but given the usual long waits, it's not worth the visit.

Yay! I am so glad that I get a second chance to come here again. I brought two other friends to try out Phil's. Crazy long lines outside the door. It's wrapped around all over the parking lot. Geez guys.. what a great way to scare my friends. They thought we were nuts, but I swear to you Phil's is that good! We went to the bar area, and we were so lucky to find seats. We didn't want to stand in the crazy line. Brad was the one that was taking care of us that night. GREAT customer service. He needs to be recognize for his service. He was more than nice, he provided us with a comfort that not many people possess now and days. So we were already full, and we wanted to share, so we ordered the half ribs to share with fries, and corn. Good golly the ribs were just as great if not better from the first time we had it. The meat were succulent and tender. Now this is how you should make ribs! The BBQ was not too strong, it was just right. I could not stop eating the it. Man! Looks like I might have to come down to SD more often just for some Phil's ribs!! This is a GREAT ESTABLISHMENT and I can only see growth in this business. Great service, fast,large amount, and delicious! There is nothing more that you can ask for. I would come here everyday if given the gas and the money. We had a pitcher of Stella to wash down our food. YUM! We also tried their Whoopee pie... I love the cream in the middle. This was a great experience. (=

We decided to go here with my daughters God Parents while visiting them in San Diego for Jacqueline's birthday.  They warned us in advance that the line was going to be long but the line would go fast.  It wasn't lighting fast but it went at a pretty decent pace.  From the moment we stepped inside and was directed to the counter to order, this place had their stuff squared away.  They take a member of your party to get a seat ahead of time so you are not stuck fighting for a seat.  The menu has enough things on it to choose from, but not so much so you are confused.  Additionally, while you are waiting in line, they have the menu plastered in various parts so you know what you want before they take your order.  They give you a pager for when your order is ready.  Our order was ready in about 5-8 minutes.  You pick your order up at the window, but if you have a bunch of items in the order like ours, they are very kind to help you take it to your seat.  There is plenty of condiments, paper towels, etc to help you devour your feast.  Everyone in our group with the exception of my son had the Broham, pulled pork sandwich.  Jonathan had the Beef rib tickler.  All I have to say is wow, I've never had BBQ like that before.  Attention all restaurants who are looking for an example of how your staff are supposed to treat the customers, Phil's BBQ is the place.  They checked back with us often but not often enough to be annoying.  I wish we could rate their customer service, because I would have given them six stars.  Now a lot of my friends know me not to give out 5 stars because I feel that there is something that could always be improved upon, but with my 5 plus years working in the food/IT industry, I could not find anything that needed improvement.  Keep up the good work and we will definitely come back to Phil's BBQ on our next visit to SD.

Over 3,000 reviews and they have 4.5 stars.  Should be 5, but 4.5 tells you something.  Over 3,000 people can't be wrong.  Best dang BBQ period!!!  It's worth the wait in line.  Get there before 5:30pm Tues-Thurs for dinner and it's only about a 0-10 minute wait.

A lot of times the second location of a local icon is one disasterous idea.  How can it compare to the original???  Phil's at Sports Arena is not a bad replica...at least in quality of the bbq.  It's much larger than the previous location, with enough parking, and lots of roll paper towels for all those times you're tempted to lick or wipe off that sauce.  However, it's better to lick off that sauce because it's a waste of good food.

Friends of mine that used to live in San Diego swore by this place, but I never had a chance to try it out until last night.  My parents were in town for my birthday weekend and my boyfriend and I were debating whether to go the Kansas City BBQ route, whose reviews on the food aren't fantastic, but are high on all the Top Gun memorabilia vs. the Phil's BBQ route where the reviews on the food are absolutely stellar.  Ultimately we decided on Phil's and were delighted with our decision even despite the 28-30 minute wait to order food (don't trust the 21 minute and 14 second sign! :)) and the fact that we had to roll ourselves out of the restaurant post Beefy Ribs & Chickless dinners with way too many sides (our fault for ordering so much--not theirs!)  It was incredible to say the least and hands down one of the best BBQ restaurants we've been to.  Make sure to bring an appetite (and a jacket and comfy shoes...if you go after 5:30pm, you're in for a wait on Sundays!)

We just came from here on a Sunday. The line was not bad shortly before noon, but when we left it wrapped around the building. Had been here once before, a few years back and it was mid-week. I simply can not see how a BBQ place can cater to this large volume of customers, and maintain a decent quality standard. As you can see from the number of stars I posted - this restaurant cannot do it all. The Beef Ribs were very fatty, under-cooked, and tough - yet burnt to a crisp and charred on the outside. This combination of poor cooking rendered the beef ribs as inedible. The white chicken meat BBQ was quite similar to chicken nuggets from a fast food restaurant, which is not bad, if you like fast food - or call it fast food made at Phil's. My wife had pork, which was not as bad as my two meat items. The beans were OK, not horrible, but not good. The coleslaw looked and tasted like the paper it was served on. San Diego does offer a few BBQ options, and all will be considered in my future BBQ meal choices. Phil's BBQ has decent atmosphere, but anybody who knows BBQ should know it is not the atmosphere these BBQ Yelp posers are overrating this place for. We are not planning to return.

my wife and i were looking for a good bbq place, a friend from work said to try phils it was the best bbq he'd ever had. first off we waited for about 1/2 hour just to get inside, which is usually a good sign. well let me tell you, for a bbq place in san diego it wasn't a place i'd recommend. the ribs were over sauced, the mac salad was dry and somewhat bland, the baked beans were easily forgettable and the baked potatoe (a large side) was quite small. if you get the bbq sauce on the side, i'd imagine it wouldn't be that bad. if you are from anywhere that has good bbq, don not go here.

Incredible! I took my parents here and they have been to their fair share of bbq restaurants up and down California and Arizona. This is by far the most delicious bbq we have ever been to. The bbq sauce was exquisite and the ribs and chicken were to die for. It's kind of strange how you have to order beer at the bar and take it to your table, but there are many kids there. Overall though, wow....Totally recommend. Enjoy!

This was a do over from a previous bad experience,and make no mistake about it there would be no bad experience tonight. The Manager, Fred, saw to it that my family and I circumvented a very long line,and we were whisked right in and next thing I knew they were taking our order. We were seated immediately,and received first class service from the Manager,as he personally checked on us and made sure everyone was satisfied. When we left we all agreed that the quality of the food was only exceeded by the service Fred provided to all of us. No doubt this was a five star experience,and we would like to extend a BIG Thank You to Fred. We will be back,and my family is still buzzing about the great food and service last night.

Poor service, limited menu and just ok bbq  despite all the hype.  Not worth the wating time in the line.We went twice and the line was halfway around the parking lot.  We were really disappointed with the food and service  the first time but decided to give it another try.  Again, a line in the parking lot but it was shorter.   We got our food and the bbq was mediocre again.   Before we finished, we had clueless customers waiting by our table.  We gladly gave up our table to them before we finished.  Go to Ms. Piggys in Coronado which has better bbq, selection and little waiting . You can always sit on the grass by the beach to listen to the music if you go on the weekends whch we do.  Better view, beer selection and corn muffins!

We stayed across the street at wyndham garden and saw a ling line out the door.  Asked our front desk about the place and she recommended us trying, but told us to just call it in and pick it up. When we got there, the line was out the door and almost around the restaurant. No line for phone orders, so we skipped the long lines and went to pick up order. Apparently they will do your order when you there so there so everything was piping hot. We ordered rib and chicken dinner with 2 small sides $12.95, 1 large spring mix salad $4.95, large onion rings $5.95. We hurried to walk back to our digs and we smelled the good food the whole time in our hands and couldn't wait to get our hands on them. Onion rings were the bomb!!! The batter was very good and the onion ring was Huge! Ribs and their sauce was oh so yummy.   My husband says this is one place has of his favorite BBQ place! We will Definitely come here when we r in SD.

This place is always packed. I suggest going at an oddhour so you have a seat within a reasonable amount of time. There nothing on the menu i do not like. My parents take me just to see how much meat I can consume in one sitting. So why the three stars? My friend Athena is a vegetarian who considers bacon a treat; it is sort of the same with me. I prefer to eat healthy and not feel blotted after. I know it is my own fault but it is Phil's and I do not go that often. Maybe I should take Athena here?

I haven't had a chance to dine here in years. Just a weekend ago, we were all out in SD. I thought, what better opportunity than then to hit up Phil's. We didn't think that the lines would STILL be as redic as when I first went there a number of years ago. Anyways, the line wrapped around 3/4 of the building. While I was glad to see that they were doing so well, I wished that there weren't such a huge wait. Starving, we went elsewhere to get a tiny bite.  We called in our order and 5 minutes later, arrived at the restaruant. And guess what, I didn't wait longer than 2 or 3 minutes. When I got there the line had disappeared. Amazing!! The food is so tasty, even when it's food you take out.  The ribs were the precious fall off the bone type. There are no smoke rings or anything but you can't expect that from ribs, FYI. I ordered a full rack of baby back's to share with Walter and Kaelani. They loved 'em.  The sauce had just enough of a kick and there was just enough sauce. Prices there are still just as reasonable as I remember.  The cashiers are friendly and deliver service with a smile.  If there is any place that you should drive out to for the day and really hang with friends, Phil's is the place!  If you're able to, have someone stand in line for you while the rest of the group swarms the bar area. They do a good job there. Some groups who were waiting in that huge line, I asked them how long the wait time had been estimated at.  The girl I talked to said about 45 minutes.  THat's not TOO bad considering a number of people were waiting around the other side of the building.  Anyways, I picked up my phoned-in order and we headed back home to LA.  I swear to you, we made it home in just under 2 hours. The ribs were still warm. And of course, we had a nice steaming hot pot of jasmine rice waiting for us when we got home. *Thanks Mom* We had said that we were all going to go to sleep because of the long day that we'd had and that we'd eat the ribs the next day for lunch or something. SCRATCH THAT!! We all sat around the table and started nibbling.  Eventually, we were all smothered and covered, like Denny's potatoes, in Phil's BBQ. Why not, right?  The meat was still warm. The rice was hot. It was the perfect scenario.  Too awesome!! Thank goodness I thought of this place when I did. This really hit the spot!!

i've been eating phil's for years. the mission hills staff used to know me by name when i lived up that way. come on, it's the best bbq in san diego. it's wet style. the meat is high quality and the ribs are really meaty, even the beef. the sauce is tangy and finger licking and addictive. half chicken/half rib dinner with beans and slaw. comfort/coma food.

Not that it needs any more praise....but Phils has some bomb Bbq! Coming from the south where grilling is a lifestyle I was impressed with their selection, flavor and tenderness. I'm not a fan of the long wait but its worth it to phone in your order and minimize your stay. Most people mentioned the ribs, I must concur; but I also love the chicken. *drooling* Anytime I'm in the sports arena area and smell that smoke in the air I end up making a beeline to Phils. Delish.

definitely the BEST place in SD for ribs. grab a brew and witness PERFECTION right before your eyes ! go with the (already highly recommended by fellow yelpers) BEEF ribs if you want a GARGANTUAN SLAB of carnivorous goodness or go with the pork if thats what you prefer--either way you WON'T be dissatisfied ! the line moves fast, and the serving style is kind of like fuddruckers i got the half chicken/half ribs plate and it was LIGHT on my pocket but HEAVY on the stomach--what more could you ask for? the chicken was--surprise!--TENDER in texture and NOT dry as i was sort of expecting. i recommend this combo plate for new-comers. the sides were also GREAT: i got the beans and potato salad, both recommended by the attendant. now, admittedly, i dont even LIKE beans and i have to say .. these beans were BOMB !!! NEGATIVES: the only thing i dont really like about this place is the seating style. at nights when its PACKED you have to "reserve" a table by practically hovering over a party who's occupying one, which feels kind of intrusive but eh, its not THAT big a deal.

came back here over the weekend, and it was awesome. i tired the chicken on the bone this time, and it's definitely better and not dried out, like the chickless. the lady i ordered from was really nice, complemented my tan, and we had a little convo going about hawaii and family, etc. very nice, especially when unexpected. anyways, back to the food. it was ready in no time! and one of the best things i love about this place is that the food is still good the next day. i usually order something big on purpose, so that i have lunch to bring to work the next day. after a meal like this, i'm too damn lazy to cook myself something to eat for lunch the next day.

For San Diego, im sure this is 5 star quality barbecue. But where i come from (mid-west) it's decent. Was craving some ribs one night when i got off work, about 10 o'clock at night on a thursday. Surprisingly no wait! Baby back ribs, side of beans and the onion rings i hear people rave so much about. The hubby got the beef ribs and fries. So, why 3 stars and not 4 or 5? The sauce on these ribs was good, don't get me wrong, but i believe in a thicker, richer, sweeter sauce. Oh, and they were fall off the bone, but a true barbecued rib should have a  little bite, or chew to it. The onion rings were ok. Very greasy and i didn't like the beer batter. really not much flavor to me. The beans were...well beans. Nothing special about those. Hubby's fries were addictive, but his beef ribs were more fat than meat. All in all i would give Phil's another shot, but i'm still on the search for a good barbecue joint.

Best baby back ribs I have ever had. The meat was very tender and fell right off the bone. The sauce was excellent and they heap plenty of it on top. Might be too sweet for some but not for me. The sides were decent but not amazing. I am a cole slaw lover, and I felt the slaw did not have enough sauce. The fries were very similar to In'n'out fries except larger, but I don't care much for in'n'out fries. The onion rings and potato salad were fairly typical. Overall, I have other restaurants I want to visit in San Diego, but I'd definitely be back next time I visit as long as the wait isn't too bad.

They have this entire process figured out (they even have a hand washing station) and at a really reasonable price.  Skip the sides and go straight for the ribs, they're the best!

I lived in San Diego for a year, and always tried to hit up Phil's whenever I saw the line wasn't wrapped around the back of the restaurant. Not only is every single item on this menu delicious, the service is amazing. The staff are super friendly and all seem very proud to work for this company.

The people who have given this place average or poor reviews don't know their elbow from ***hole let alone anything about BBQ. Phil's is without a doubt the best BBQ around if not the best on the west coast. I frequently travel from LA down to Phil's just to have BBQ ribs. I'm that serious about this place that I drive 200 miles to get it. I have yet in my travels to find a place that compares to Phil's. The only problem is that it feels like ALL of San Diego knows about it. The lines can be long but it's well worth the wait!

If this place were in the South, it would be just another bbq place, nothing special. The sides are not like true southern bbq. The beans are all wrong and the bbq sauce isn't perfect. However, since its not in the South it is  decent place to satisfy a craving for ribs. The ribs are usually very good quality which makes it worth the long lines and expensive prices. I usually order only the ribs since I think thats the only thing they do well (don't order the chicken unless you don't mind it to be a little dry, the pulled pork is pretty good though). Overall, don't expect much if you come from the south like me, but if you haven't experienced true southern bbq this place comes close.

There are aren't any words that can describe how fab this place is. the lines are extremely long but as soon as you take a bite of the tender meat...you'll completely forget you just waited in line for 45 min! The BBQ sauce is out of this world.! the staff are friendly and easygoing. if your not a big fan of SD this place will definitely put a positive spin to the city! If only they cud expand there locations!

While in the neighborhood for comic con, a friend of mines suggest we had this.  It was the best BBQ I've ever had.  Since I went with a big group, I got to try everything.  I really enjoyed their baby back ribs.  It just came off the bone.  The chicken was moist.  The BBQ sauce on all of it was just right.  Sure there was a long line, but good food.  You don't get served though, you find our own table and sit down.  I highly recommend this place if you are around and have an aching for BBQ.

I went here on a Saturday night, and yep, there was the Disneyland line and parking was a nightmare.  The awful thing about the line- every person in line seemed to be holding a spot for about 10 other people- literally- it was like they called all their friends and said hey, I'm already in line at Phil's, come on up.  Definitely questionable behavior in my mind, very unfair to all of us waiting.  After waiting for about 30 mins and moving about 4 feet (still nowhere near the wooden "20 min from here" sign- and probably not moving b/c people arriving were going to join friends in line in front of us), we copied the idea of the people in front of us- pick up a menu, call in, and 10-15 mins later, you pick up  your food (no line for that!) and you're out of there, with a few last looks at the poor suckers still standing in that never-moving line.  I don't understand WHY the line didn't move- when we went in to pick up the food, there was plenty of seating.... maybe b/c they have about 3 cash registers for dine-in orders, and 2 for phone-in, and tons more people are dining in than phoning in?  Don't know, all I can say is, definitely phone in and carry out!!!  Unless you care to spend an hour and a half waiting in line to eat, getting angrier and angrier about all the line cutting.   So, as to the food.  I got the baby-back ribs and chickless, with sides of baked beans and potato salad.  The baby-back ribs were awesome, definitely the best part of the meal!  Their BBQ sauce is yummy.  The chickless, was ok- hard to live up to those ribs.  The potato salad was awesome.  The baked beans- ew- they looked like soup in the container, mushy and didn't taste good at all- just not something I even cared to eat.  Not like any baked beans I'd ever had, and I usually love them. The baby-back ribs were worth going to this place for.  I'm glad, however, that I skipped the line- the yucky beans and so-so chickless were definitely not worth it. One more note- prices are very reasonable- I think it was something like $11 for my ribs, chicken and 2 sides.  Definitely a great place for barbeque, hopefully the beans were just a bad batch.

Best BBQ I ever ate.  I had to wait because there were a lot of people but I didn't care.  It was so worth the wait.  Everyone was friendly with smiles.  The waitresses even cleaned the bottles on the tables so the next person who sat down wouldn't stick to the bottle.  The ribs are a little messy as they should be.  I was so impressed by the staff and food.  I hope someday they bottle their sause so I can stock up.

Phil's BBQ is awesome.  Prices are reasonble for the quality and quantity of food.  We showed up around 5pm on a weekend for an "early dinner" and the lines were wrapped around the building.  We got take-out instead and found a nice park to enjoy our BBQ.  We have to get Phil's everytime we come down to San Diego.

Great food and Service always.   (Would have given 5 stars, except for a nonsense policy)  On Friday, after some debate of where to take Mom and kids to dinner for Mom' s Bday, I picked Phils because I knew they had TVs and I wasn't worried about missing Game 7 of the World Series.  When we sat down to eat, I didn't see the game on the tvs, they were playing some college football game.  I asked the server if they could put the game on and she straight out told me no! They NEVER play Big games in the dining area, only in the bar.  She said thy don't want to have a 3 hour line out the door because people will eat and watch the game for too long... I was shocked! After expressing my opinion and disappointment, (why even have TVs if you won't play big games? Duh!) the manager came over to talk to me.  I have to give Kudos to John the manager who made an exception about playing Big Games in the dining area and put the game on immediately! He apologized and made it right without question. That's customer service!

Not as enthused as I used to be about this place.  The ribs were good, but not great like they used to be.  Not sure why.  Average service.  Didn't appreciate hostess' reply to my answer that yes, I've been here many times:  "Oh, you must be one of the original customers."  Can you say Snooky?

I don't know if people in San Diego have never eaten decent BBQ or if they're just under the impression that drenching food in BBQ sauce makes it BBQ. Needless to say I was left unimpressed by Phil's and their "tri-tip" which arrived dripping with mediocre barbecue sauce The fries were decent, but definitely not worth the hour plus wait. I fail to understand why someone would come to a restaurant to eat alleged BBQ and be looked down on for not knowing how to order off of the menu. I ate Phil's with some friends before leaving for northern CA for a bit and on the way back I had to stop in Bakersfield at a real BBQ place to demonstrate to my boyfriend what real BBQ should be. Barbecue is an art, not a gloppy mess drenched in some sickeningly sweet sauce.

For some reason, Hillcrest is home to a lot of eateries that are hyped beyond the quality of their food. I'm sure there are places that are worth impossible parking and interminable waits, but Phil's isn't one of them -- unless you like waiting hours to sit in cramped eating quarters and eat fatty ribs. When a place has to post a sign warning customers against complaining, that's probably not a good omen.

Fast and friendly service. The ribs were really good, the cole slaw okay and the fries were horrible. They were not hot, sloppy and chewy.

We took our order to go and didn't wait 20 minutes. We went right to the to-go counter and ordered and we had our food in less than FIVE minutes and we headed right down the street to eat our food at the wetlands park 'Famosa Slough' down the street on a bench with the beautiful view! Amazing hot and delicious even 10 minutes after being handed the bag!

It was our first visit to Phil's BBQ, and I was really looking forward to some great food.  I had the baby back ribs/chicken combo with baked beans and coleslaw.  I LOVED the ribs as they were flavorful and fell off the bone.  Unfortunately, the bone-in chicken breast was somewhat dry.Both meats were dripping in their spicy BBQ sauce; almost too spicy for me, but definitely way too spicy for my husband (he had the tri-tip sandwich).  He said the meat was very good, but way too much spice in the sauce.  I would return, but would use their suggestion of having the BBQ sauce on the side.  Glad we came before 5:30 PM, as the place filled-up fast by 6PM.  Very friendly staff, too

With a sign that says, "Approximate Wait time for this point: 21 minutes 14 seconds," at the end of--what it seems like--a never ending line, who would not see Phil's BBQ as a favorable place. It is tough to say that good BBQ can be found in California, especially if it is in the coastal area of San Diego. Everything about Phil's exceeds all expectations. A good BBQ joint should guarantee a welcoming environment along with delicious food. The atmosphere and food is what keeps the long lines continuous and mouths watering for more. Phil's BBQ accommodates their customers through the whole process from waiting in line until you walk out on a full, satisfied stomach. There is a bar and free ice cold water for those that need some refreshments while in line. Hostesses are walking around helping anyone that has questions and recommending what they prefer. Along the line, there are also menus on display. The menus help the lines move faster, and everyone is able to get their chance at some finger licking good BBQ.  Although people mainly come for their food, Phil's does not forget to maintain a feel-good ambiance for all of their guest. The décor has a cabin meets homey feel. The tables and chairs are wood, which remind customers of family dinners.  There is a fireplace near the entrance that makes a person feel welcomed when entering the restaurant. Plasma screen televisions surround the whole place to accommodate the sports fans while eating.  The surrounding decorations are western antiques that represent tradition at Phil's. Despite the fact that BBQ has a Southern background, Phil's has achieved in bringing out the Western history of California into their BBQ. The atmosphere is friendly and there are fulfilled customers with gratified smiles that surround the restaurant. Through the décor and environment, customers easily forget that the restaurant is still a self-service place because of the at-home feel. After the line, guests are directed to the cashiers to order and find their own tables while waiting for their beepers to buzz for the food. Phil's does an exceptional job in maintaining the needs of their customers. They provide extra to-go boxes for the huge portions, bibs for the messy BBQ sauce stains, plates for sharing, and utensils for the side orders. There are also extra wet-naps and condiments available at the table. Although customers are able to do everything themselves, the waiters and waitresses are more than helpful. They come by and check up on their guests repeatedly and make sure that everyone is pleased. The workers make conversation with their customers and there are many interesting characters that make Phil's worth the try. It is easy to like a restaurant because of their food, but it is a bonus when their service is just as great. When the buzzer vibrates, come forth with empty hands and expect to come back, to the table, with muscles. The food is served on big trays that seem to weight a ton. It is amazing to see how generous Phil's is with their hefty portions. The delicious food will leave anyone satisfied and guaranteed extra for the day after, which is always a plus. The grand finale of Phil's is their food. The food is filling and inexpensive, which guarantees a satisfied stomach. The best order would be the baby back ribs and chicken dinner for $12.25. The chicken is mesquite grilled to perfection and very moist and the ribs are fall off the bone tender with a delicious tangy BBQ sauce. With the dinner, there is a choice of two sides that range from cold salads to french fries. The sides are a good accompaniment for the hearty BBQ because they are lighter in flavor, but just as good. There are also options of pulled pork, tri tip BBQ sandwiches or even burgers.  Phil's is also famous for their Colossal Onion Rings that are decadent. The onion rings are as huge as their name labels it. They hold a perfect amount of batter and are extremely flavorful along with their house ranch dressing. Phil's succeeds in establishing a memorable BBQ experience because of their delicious food.   Phil's BBQ does not disappoint any aspect: the décor, the atmosphere and most importantly, the food. It is evident that Phil's is a popular place because of their pleased customers that keep coming back and new customers that keep the lines long. If long lines are worth the wait, then this place must be self-explanatory. In any circumstance, Phil's is worth the distance, the calories, and the BBQ stains.

I went to Phil's on the recommendation of friends. First thing to know, order by phone ahead of time. We went on a Saturday night and the line to get in was around the building and getting longer as we watched. Since we had called ahead, we walked past that entire line, got our food, and were gone within 15 minutes. Even better, we had seven people order food and they didn't mind us all paying separately. Kudos to them for having a really friendly staff, but not friendly in the creepy way that some stores go for. I had the beef ribs meal, can't say the fries were any good but I ate five beef ribs and had a foodgasm. Excellent.

13 years living in San Diego and I had NEVER experienced..The ever popular Phil's!...My daughter decided to take me there tonight,We get there right?.. The line?...Out the door, and wrapped around the building!...I said.."Ain't no way I'm standing in THAT line for some BBQ!...She said "it's ALWAYS like this momma!"...We find a parking space sure enough, but barely.She suggests that we phone in...she calls..."2 10 bone full racks..$40!..ok it's BBQ i know it's expensive..the hostess says..10-20 minutes!...We leave go to 7-11  two streets over, come back...26 minutes had passed. We walk  in pass a Black Lady perched upon a stool being pleasant...she guided us to the next available cashier.Gives order...10 more minutes more to wait...mean while the staff is str8 hustle -bustle!...They MUST take Ritalin, or Prozac or sommin..coz?!...Uh Uh!.. They had me dizzy just  WATCHING them!...The atmosphere is crammed with the smell of Ribs and Beer,and folx grubbin everywhere!... To the left of the line is what I can only  describe as a modern day  saloon!..I expected to see Matt Dillon and "Miss Kitty" sittin over in the corner!.The buzzed crowd seemed to be having a nice quiet time around the watering hole! The pager went off and we were up...2 styrofoam boxes $40!..smh.When we got home it was more than enough!..altho i personally feel I got more char than meat but like Joe Pesci said..."they fucc you at the drive thru-(carry out)!"...They WERE personable tho...I appreciate manners at all times!....The taste is pretty good, a bit on the fiery side for me, but  it's a formula worth the money!...I just wish for the sake of those that were waiting, it was bigger...coz momma will have to have been drained dry by Vampire Bill to stand in THAT line!....All in all?...I liked it!

i would NEVER wait in the long ass line that is constantly wrapped around the building, but i did order take out. and it was like a dream. the best ribs i have ever had, and i'm originally from iowa where if anything is perfect, it should be the meat since it was slaughtered around the corner.  so, call ahead and order takeout, and eat at home.

This place is worth the buck. However there will be a line...A lonnng line. But the wait is worth it. Ordering shouldnt be so hard because while you are waiting there will be a menu for you to look at. this place is almost like a Pat and Oscars restaurant where you order your food and then find a table to sit at. forget about the way how things work there, lets just get to the food. there's only one word i can use to explain there food here "delicious" and the portions are HUGE. i only spent about 12-13 dollars for my entree and i could not even finish it. I got a half rack of ribs with cole slaw,fries, two giant onion rings, and when i say its giant i mean its as big as your hand. And Last, I got a beefy rib as big as my arm..(literally). I gotta say phils bbq do not cut you short. they wanna make sure your money is worth spent. its lively, friendly, and satisfying. i recommend this place to everyone who enjoy great bbq.

This was my first time here tonight. I waited in line for 35 minutes. Which sucked, but chatting with my friend actually made the time fly by.  When I got close to the entrance one of the female workers approached us and asked, "How many?" We answered two. The worker then stared at me and softly said, " So two, me and you."  I kind of blushed.  My crazy friend said, "Be gay so she'll hook us up."  The worker then told us there were seats over at the bar and told me to come over to her. My friend went to her and came right back. My friend said the worker probably wanted to hit on me some more. Talk about assertiveness.  So we finally approach a cashier and he was full of jokes.  We order the half-slab baby back ribs, bbq beans and cole slaw.  I get the buzzer.  We get our drinks and sit down at a booth. 5 minutes later the buzzer vibrates and we get our food.  The ribs were very tender and the meat just fell off the bone. The sauce was very vinegary and tangy. I like my bbq sauce a bit sweeter.  The coleslaw was yummy and creamy.  The baked beans were interesting. It tasted like bacon or something, I usually like it sweeter. All in all, I thought it was alright and I'd go again minus having to wait in line ;)

Even a vegetarian can love this place. My husband and I have a mixed marriage- he eats meat and I don't. Phil's leaves both of us happy and stuffed. I get the veggie burger BBQ style (smothered in their delicious sauce). Veggie burger is consistently tender- not a dried out puck like a lot of places. Add some of those tasty onion rings and a side of buttermilk dressing and I'm in junk food heaven. My husband goes for the pork ribs and they smell so good I always have to ask him for a little bite. Meat usually doesn't even taste like  food to me, but that little bite is succulent! Well worth breaking the vegetarian rules!

People wait up to an hour standing in line and I can see why. The food is delicious and the people are very friendly and helpful. Our family loves beef ribs and these did not disappoint.  The large sides were enough for four  the Caesar salad had a bit too much garlic. The beans were delicious.  The evening was a fun dining experience.    When in San Diego be sure to stop in.

i love barbecues and who doesn't during the summer? i went to visit San Diego over 4th of July weekend and decided to hit up this highly reviewed place for an American independence  day feast. my boyfriend suggested the place based on all of the positive yelp reviews and I was so glad he did. It was delicious, so delicious! I can't rave enough about the meat quality and the sauce. When we arrived, the line was snaking around the restaurant. We knew the wait could be as long as 2 hrs so decided to do take out instead. The line for that was manageable but still a bit long because they pack your order right when you get there to maintain freshness. We probably waited for 20 minutes before we got to the front of the line. When we got up to the counter to pay, the cashier had the food packed up and ready and was super friendly. They run the place like a well oiled machine managing the lines pretty well and getting things done efficiently. We took the food back to our hotel and chowed down and I gotta say the first bit was like ecstasy. If you love meat, you'll love how well cooked it is. It falls off the bone easily, there is no chewing involved almost, it's that soft! The sauce they use is not overpowering and compliments the meat well. I got the Best of both Worlds, half baby back ribs and half chicken and my boyfriend got the full rack of ribs. If I had to choose, the baby back ribs were a bit more savory then the chicken but that didn't mean I didn't enjoy my humongous chicken drumstick either! My boyfriend eats a lot and still couldn't finish 3 of the ribs so the portions are large. But it's so delicious you don't care until you've realized you're completely stuffed. We also ordered the onion rings and while I don't like them in general, the ones here are not bad. They're crispy and understated, complementing the rich BBQ aroma of the meat. I also got the mac and cheese as a side dish and loved their twist on the classic. I can't really describe what they put in there but it's pretty good. All in all, I will definitely revisit this BBQ establishment again when I head down to San Diego again. It's popular for a reason and I'm glad I got to enjoy this little piece of BBQ heaven.

i have never waited an hour for bbq before. but it didn't seem that bad with all of the ruckus and crazy people around in the area to entertain you. it was a random saturday night so i guess the hour wait shoulda been expected. it's kind of a half and half on fast food and sit in restaurant. you go up to the counter and make your order, then you seat yourself down and wait for one of the workers to give you your food. it's also self serve fountain drinks, which means free refills. holla atmosphere is very much like a sports bar fused with a family restaurant, along with the loud flat screened tv with the hustle and bustle of large families. ok, now onto the food. ordered the ribs, with coleslaw and fries. the bbq was really tender and pretty good. nothing bad about it. coleslaw was good too, and i guess the fries were also. there was nothing all too special about it, but i still consider it a lot better than average. i enjoyed my time there and i would definitely hit it up again if i ever had the chance.

Just went to Phil's BBQ for the first time (and I have been in SD since August, what is WRONG with me?!).  Oh wow, that was tasty! My first impression of the place what that the line was SUPER long, and the parking lot was pretty crowded (didn't help that it was a Sunday night with a Fleetwood Mac concert at the Arena).  But after my experience, I decided the wait wasn't that bad - it gave you time to work up the appetite you will most definitely need once you begin gorging, and it helps you to appreciate this place even more.   I split the full baby back ribs with a friend, and we couldn't even finish them (and let me tell you, I can put food away like a dude...usually).  Sooo yummy, the meat was fall-off-the-bone good, and they had the perfect amount of sauce.  The onion rings were so-so, but I'm not a huge fan of fried food.  I liked that you could get up and get your own refills of drinks too, because considering how busy that place was, waiting for a refill would be forever.  Despite the hustle and bustle, the staff were all super nice. And to cap off my Phil's experience, I watched a friend devour 30 ribs.  Nuff said.  I'll be back

the baby back ribs are moist and very good. the chicken is unforgettable. as for the sides the macaroni salad and bbq bean is the winner. only if they went easy on the bbq sauce on the baby back it would be all good. next time i'll tell them to put less bbq sauce on the ribs. best ribs i've tasted thus far.

If I ever had to pick my very last meal, hands down, it would be Phil's BBQ.  I would get a full rack of ribs with a side of their onion rings. I have been a regular customer of Phil's for 12 years now.  On average I would say I go at least 1-2x per month. I am a foodie big time and this place is my favorite. I've probably turned 75% of my patients onto this establishment. Whenever friends and family visit from out of town this is the first place they want to go.   It's not hard to understand why.  This place is extremely busy for a reason. The food is consistently amazing. I have tried ribs everywhere including the southern states.  Nothing even comes close. Everyone is so happy while their eating so satisfied once they are done.  The service is amazing.  The staff is extremely friendly and bends over backwards to make sure you are taken care of.  Bring your appetite because it's a lot of food!

Normally I am not a huge fan of BBQ ribs. However, this is a place not to miss. The moment we arrived, there was a long line wrapped around the entire block. It was 2:30pm on a Sunday afternoon before the 4th! We proceeded to just call in for a to- go order. The smell of the ribs filled our car on our way to the hotel. A full rib between two people was gone in 15 minutes.

it's ... AMAZING. The waiting is almost unbearably wrong but it's definitely worth it. I mean, there's gotta be a reason why there's 5 gazillion people waiting for it right? Go with a group of friends, the waits pretty fun then :). orderings simple, just order ribs. duh. hahha. Took my parents here and they loved it too. and it's within price range compared to the fancy top notch restaurants who ask for an arm and a leg for bbq ribs... If you cant stand the wait, just take it togo, there's no line for that.

I've passed by this restaurant dozens of times while driving around Point Loma. My boyfriend lives here, and I can smell the aroma of Phil's BBQ from my bf's place. But every time we decided to go, it was super crowded and we ended up leaving. But yesterday, we decided to go because it was a Tuesday and mid-day. I ordered the the half-rib dinner (with a side of baked potato) and my bf got the BBQ cheeseburger (with baked beans and french fries). We waited a few mins until our food was done. OMG.....the ribs were finger-lickin' good! The sauce was tangy, but just right for the smoked ribs. The meat just fell off the bone as I sunk my teeth into those scrumptious ribs! The baked potato was pretty good, and so were the baked beans. The fries were so-so, but I could honestly live without them. I have officially experienced the BBQ at Phil's....and what a good one! I would most definitely come back here for some more grub :)

Finally had Phils BBQ after hearing the hype.  The line is usually pretty long, we waited about 45min.  There is free lemon/cucumber infused water while you are waiting in line which is pretty cool.  When your up, you go and order your food, and find a table to sit.  Then they will buzz you up to grab your food, which takes only about 5 minutes.  Everything is basically self serve, and you would think you wouldn't get much service but the service is great and friendly.  The lady who took our order wasn't knowledgeable about her BBQ. We asked her if they had trip tip and she looked at us like we were aliens.  The menu is very basic.  The BBQ is good, but doesn't live up to its hype. The sides are good, prices are good.  Its not a place I would go out of my way to get BBQ.  Lucilles is very much comparable. Lucilles beef ribs beats this place.  But i think the pork ribs here are better and fall off the bone tender.

Hands down the best ribs in the area.  Staff is pretty friendly and accommodating.  The side dishes could be a tad bit better though, the baked potato I ordered was a little undercooked (hard).  Other than that, they live up to the reputation.  Try the Sangria, it's good.

For my birthday, my daughter wanted to take me out to dinner at Phil's BBQ.  By the time we left the house, it was after 8 p.m.  By the time we arrive at Phil's BBQ, customers were backed up in line almost around the building.  I said, "I'm not waiting in that line?  I think I can put on a great BBQ so the next day around 4 p.m. we tried it again and I decided to see if the long line was worth the wait.  After almost a hour in line, I placed my order.  I ordered the "Pork Baby Back Dinner" with potato salad, cole slaw and onion rings.  The wife ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich.  The Baby Backs were slightly charred but tender and very good.  The cole slaw was not as good as mine, but good.  The potato salad wasn't that great.  The potatoes were under cooked and lacking taste.  The onion rings I had were "over-cooked".  As far as the wife's pulled pork sandwich, she said the meat was dry?  I know why the meat was "dry" Phil?  On the other hand, Phil's BBQ Sauce matched my favorite, Tony Roma.  I even purchased two bottles because it's very good.  Trust me! The atmosphere was great, hanging out with the family, but if I had to do it all over again, call ahead and do the take out.

As 400+ others have stated, Phil's is great. Definitely on the short short list of BBQ in San Diego and probably this side of the Mississippi. The only reason I'm reviewing is to compare it to"Famous Dave's" (my north county BBQ equivalent). Food quality wise I'd say Phil's wins on meat quality, though ribs at both places were excellent. I preferred Phil's brisket which is thin sliced and slathered in sauce, to Dave's thick drier chunks. Onion Ring wise , my other gauge of BBQ place quality, Dave's has delicious crumb battered strings and Phil's has fat tempura rings. Both are primo, though I love Dave's ring sauce. Price wise they are comparable ($10ish for a sandwich/drink, $15-20 when ribs are on your mind) and Phil's has a more homey authentic feel, to Dave's engineered southern decor.  All in all, I would likely prefer Phil's, just because it felt more like a down home cooking kinda place to me. A very laid back comfortable atmosphere. That said, I won't be traveling to SD just to get it.Next time I'm down South I know where to stop for lunch.

Thank God I went to San Diego with someone who used to live there, otherwise I probably would have completely missed this carnivore's delight. I don't even eat chicken (really) and was impressed with the BBQ'd chicken pieces (can't seem to remember the more aptly-titled menu name of the item...but at least I didn't call it "road kill") I had during a delicious and tummy-pleasing meal. I can attest that the ribs and onion rings (like I had any room for them after a plate of pure protein, their plates come packed!) are equally pleasing from the bites I snatched while my dining companions were engrossed in a college football game. I tend to prefer quicker-paced, down-home style joints, so long as the food is the #1 rather than paying to have an ambiance. Here that is the case. My only beef (bad pun alert!) is the wait, which we narrowly missed by slipping in around 11:30 on a Saturday morning the day of a big Chargers game. But it would have been worth the wait, their sauce alone allowed me to consume poultry, which is usually only done if I'm drunk and craving Popeyes. Don't matter if bird, Piggy or Moo-Moo usually suits you, you will enjoy all at Phil's.

Since this place has 2000+ reviews so I won't be very elaborate with this review. The hype for this place was off the charts: 4.5 stars with more than 2000 reviews, a line wrapped around the building, and a business very adept at using social networking. I have lived in North Carolina for most of my life where discussions about the quality of BBQ can invoke firearms and hand to hand combat. My family has made BBQ for years too. I ordered the BBQ sandwich which was just about as average as you can get for BBQ. Subtle flavors and a bit too dry. The bun was a bit too hard for my liking also. I wish I could be more descriptive about the taste of the BBQ but again there was nothing memorable. The sides from this place up the rating. The BBQ baked beans were very tasty and the potato salad was also pretty good. Tasted the sig-o's fries which were tasty but the onion rings were a tad too greasy. Seems everyone in this joint was enjoying themselves and service was very good. Decent food but we have hundreds of little mom and pop places back in the South that would destroy this place. Nice try Phil...

I ordered the baby back ribs half rib plate with fries and a macaroni salad. My friends ordered the same ribs but with different sides. All of their ribs were the same size and several inches long. Three of my ribs however were less than an inch long and were pathetic in comparison. They barely had any meat on them. To add insult to injury, the chef must've known that I was getting short changed on the ribs, and dumped a *huge* amount of fries on my plate. For $14 I think I got ripped off. Won't be coming back.

I dunnoe... Maybe I have high standards because I was born and raised in Texas where BBQ and steak is a part of everyone's meal 3 times a day... but this place just didn't do it for me. I got the ribs and it wasn't very juicy and tender and it was completely flooded with sauce so that all I tasted was sauce and not the meat.

My husband and I were in town for a wedding and had a chance to meet a friend for lunch here prior to. Wow. I wish my friend had warned me about the HUMONGOUS portions (for under $7 each!)! Had we known, my husband and I could've easily shared a sandwich, but we ordered our own sandwiches and fries to share. He enjoyed his El Toro more than my Broham, and I enjoyed my friend's Beefy Ribs more than my Broham and his El Toro. The pulled pork shoulder on the Broham was okay, but I thought it could have afforded a bit more sauce and would have benefited from being more tender. I did, however, very much enjoy having it with cole slaw between two buns. You seriously have to pull off 1/2 to 2/3 of the meat before you can even pick the danged thing up. I was almost too full to start the sandwich by the time I got 1/3 of the meat down. (Then I realized I could push the extra meat to the side.) The El Toro was heavy on the sauce, so I would only recommend it for serious BBQers. Beefy Ribs were super tender and juicy and well complimented by cole slaw and fries on the side. Huge portions, great prices, and fun atmosphere granted Phil's BBQ 4 stars from me.

They say the BBQ is the best thing about this place. I can honestly say the food is bomb-diddly-icious, but the service was even better. Phills BBQ was on Man Vs Food which is one of the reasons this place is just so bangin'. The other is the quality of the food and the dedication of the staff who works there. I have driven past Phil's twice and on both instances, there was a line that stretched around the entire building and into the adjacent parking lot. The wait to get in is usually around 1.5 to 2 hours, but trust me, it is well worth the wait, and besides... patience is a virtue (they even have a sign in the restaurant that states it). Once you get inside, their wonderful greeter acknowledges you and your party in such a wonderful manner that it almost seems as if you two are bff's. You order your meal at a counter and an electronic buzzer is given to you to let you know when your food is ready (the kind other restaurants give you when you are on the waiting list). The food comes out fast and hot. Every now and then, the greeter and other staff members come around to your table to check on things. They want to make sure you are taken care of just like a VIP. If you need anything they will literally bend over backwards to make sure you get what you want. I understand that no one wants to wait 2 hours to get a meal, but when the food is as good as they show on tv, and the service is even better, who can complain? 5 stars, 0 problems, 1 happy customer =)

It's sad that it's taken this long for me to review Phil's but I just ate there two days ago so I figured I mind as well do it while it's still fresh in my mind. Don't get me wrong Phil's is great, best BBQ in San Diego hands down. It only gets three stars though because I've had better BBQ, and to be honest a few days ago the stuff I had, which is usually amazing, just wasn't giving me that satisfaction I so greatly anticipated. I had the BBQ Cheese Burger which before had been one of my favorite burgers ever, but this time they forgot the onion ring on it, and I didn't realize till halfway in. I also ordered the El Toro solely because it was featured on Man V. Food. I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of trip tip that accompanied the sandwich, but it just didn't taste as amazing as it should have. The sandwich itself was almost too simple to be delicious, just meat, bread, and bbq sauce; which I've seen done way better at way less known joints. The onion rings are the best part in my opinion, but some of them have to much extra fried batter stuck to them, and it demoralizes me whilst eating them. The BBQ sauce that everyone raves about is not the best, trust me people I have had much better (Lucilles/Famous Daves). I love Phil's though, and it's always a great place to eat if you don't mind lines.

I remember hearing about this place years ago when they were still in Hillcrest, tried them, waited a loooooooong time and wasn't too impressed, I mean it was good, but it wasn't like, slap yo mama good...  I'll take Famous Dave's over this place any day of the week, just for the consistency in flavor, better prices and not having to wait forever... To me this is a slightly over-rated eatery, and now they are down by Sports arena, the lines are ALWAYS out the door and you have to wait even looooooooooonnnnnnnnnger... you won't find me waiting in one,in fact, for the prices and the wait, I'll pick up some tri-tips, BBQ em' myself and make some tri-tip sammy's so good that when my mother-in-law ate one she slapped ME and took the one I was going to eat right out of my hands... (Note: one of the owners contacted me and told me he was going to have me killed if I didn't edit this a little... JUST KIDDING, but one of the owners did contact me and made me an offer I couldn't refuse... Next time I go, I get to cut in line. So I gave one more star for customer service. And I plan on sampling a Tri-Tip sangwich this Summer, which is, ironically the only thing on the menu I haven't tried...

Phil's BBQ is way overhyped.  The San Marcos location definitely doesn't measure up to the previous Phil's stores.  The meat is drenched in BBQ sauce so you can't taste the meat, which is probably a good thing since the meat is overprocessed and tastes like freezer meat.  Seems like the quality went wayyyyy down.  There are better BBQ restaurants all over San Diego...wouldn't go back here.

Okay honestly, had I been writing this review three days ago, I would've given this place a solid five stars because their grubs are amazing and finger-licking good. So why four? Because I raved about this place to an out-of-town friend, so when he finally made a visit, of course I took him to Phils to show him what's up! The times before, I waited an hour or so and it was well worth the wait, but this time we went on a Saturday and waited in line for two and a half hours for some baby back ribs. TWO and a half hours! By the time we sat down, we were so over it that a bag of chips would've made us happy. I highly recommend coming here at five or eight to avoid super long lines.

I loved the beef ribs and the chicken. it was super good. husband got the beef tri-tip and was pleasantly surprised about how good it was. he liked that as you continued to eat your bbq there was a slight kick. he's not into sweet bbq. this was not too sweet and perfect for him. I loved the potatoe salad, the onion rings are meh, and i enjoyed the baked beans (they had a bite too).

i really only have 3 problems with Phil's (and one of them kinda isn't their fault) 1) Even as a 20-something, I appreciate keeping the bar area seperate from where families sit- it just makes a more welcoming enviroment when there are kids around. But PLEASE, there is nothing worse than waiting in a formidable saturday line, than having to wait in another line to get a beer. maybe this is just some weird city regulation at work, but it's kind of a bummer 2) It's my personal taste, but the sauce is pretty sugary. i recently ate a another bbq place out of state, and their sauce was as sweet, but they threw the whole batch in the smoker with the hog, and it was PERFECT! maybe a sauce option? 3) (the not fault one) BBQ is expensive! A meal of mainly meat is sure to rack up a bill and put you 6 feet deep in the couch for a couple hours. But any meal that you have to wear a bib for is not one a personally want to break out a Ulysses Grant for, but so is the nature of the beast. And I could have just missed it, but I don't remember seeing any straight pulled pork, which is mother's freakin' milk. That being said, i think the rating speaks for itself. Damn tasty. plus Phil's onion rings + ranch dressing + tobassco sauce= hospital strength food coma enducer.

the line is always up to, our spilling out of, the doors here, so that should be your first hint that it is amazing. the scent of phil's bbq can me smelled from blocks away. as probably the best bbq in sd, phil's offers pork ribs, chicken and beef ribs that slide off the bone and are marinated in the perfect bbq sauce. the sides are so delicious that the two that come with the meal are never enough. pasta salad? potato salad? baked beans? corn? french fries? cole slaw? onion rings? TRY THEM ALL.

this place has the BEST BBQ EVER! highly recommended, its pretty crowded. the food comes out extremely fast, which is awesome. the only thing you really have to do is find a table for yourself, which is kinda hard though. the ribs are delicious and i love their onion rings! really big and verryyy crunchy! (theirs a lot of oil though, but its all good) expect to get your moneys worth.

Wholly BBQ! The food here is great! I came here last Saturday after touring UCSD with my niece. When we drove up into the parking lot, i was hesitate about eating here because of the long line but when we got in line, I was distracted by the music they were playing on the outside speakers and the menu above our heads. I was very indecisive on what to get because everything look so good. About 20 mins later, it was our turn to order and I ordered the combo meal with Chicken-less and 4 ribs. You also can choose 2 small sides or 1 lrg one. I haven't eaten pork in years but since I was at the best BBQ place in SD (base on Yelp), I just had to give in and try it. I split my meal with my husband. We were both fulfilled after eating the beans, potato salad (I'm not a mayo eater either, but this was the base potato salad I ever had), the chicken-less and the ribs. The reason why I gave this place a 4 star was because the seating arrangement we were given was on the Patio by the bar and we had to squeeze through another table to get to where we assigned. thank goodness for those open windows on the Patio because without them, we can be trapped if there were a fire or something, but with the open windows we can easily jump over. hee hee. I will deifnitely come back here for BBQ when I am in SD. Gotta bring the family here to try it out. PROS: -Delicious food -Reasonably priced CONS: -not enough seating. Very crowded. -Need more restrooms. There are only two stalls in the women restrooms.

oooh the ribs are very good.  tangy bbq sauce. onion rings the size of  your head. and plenty of sides to choose from we had the potato salad and fries.  i'd come here again just for the baby back ribs thats all you need.  full rack is huge, half rack would be enough for me.

Love their food. Prices are a bit steep. Ask for sauce on the side! They drench everything in their BBQ sauce which tastes good in small amounts but overwhelming when they over do it (which is almost 100% of the time). Lines are crazy sometimes which sucks. And they aren't open on Mondays! Sad Panda.

First discovered it in '97 and the wait was around 30 min when they were in their old space, disappointed to learn that they now have a much, much larger place and the wait is just as long if not longer.  Just recently tried the food and the bbq here is fantastic, can go pound for pound and probably beat the nyc bbq renaissance that is happening.  Not only are the ribs good, the side dishes are so addictive.

I have finally had Phils! Why I have waited two years to experience it's deliciousness, I do not know. We walked in literally right before the rush thankfully. Got a full order or ribs, with beans, coleslaw and fries and proceeded to pig out. I'm not a big rib eater so my expertise is limited. The meat was tender and fell off the bone, they were graciously smothered in sauce and...great now my mouth is watering. The beans were good, honey tasting but not anything too exciting. I do not really care for coleslaw so I'm not going to comment on that. I loved the fries, nice and crispy in the golden delicious way, not the over cooked way. The staff was helpful and nice and there is lots of seating-when it isn't completely packed, which I have heard it is anytime after 5 and at lunch. I went with a veteran Phil's patron so he straight up ordered without letting me so much as look at the menu-but I will most assuredly be back to try more.

Went down to SD for a few days so we yelped for places to eat.  Came here around 9 pm on a tues night and there was no line.  Too bad we weren't that hungry so I only got the half rack of baby back ribs n the fiancée had the el toro (tri-tip) sandwich.  Love the sauce, it's just a bit spicy and finger licking good.  The meat was perfectly cooked!  The tri-tip was excellent..tender n juicy.  Too bad we're so far away or else I'd def go back!

I just really enjoyed the whole experience.  Visiting with locals in line to the super friendly and helpful staff.  Thanks to other reviews I knew there would be a wait so I left the kids in the car with hubby watching a dvd while I waited in line getting tips from the locals and perusing the menu.  We ordered a variety of items just about everything on the menu and we were all very satisfied.  The tri tip sandwich was overflowing with meat.  The beef ribs were the most tender I have ever had.  The sides were large and yummy.  The large onion rings fed all 7 of us and were huge and delicious.  I thought  the prices were very reasonable and the atmosphere charming.  I am sure my experience was enhanced by reading reviews and knowing a little of what to expect.  They asked the size of our party while we waited in line and since it was kind of big they had a table ready and reserved for us.  We can't wait to visit San Diego again just for this restaurant.

Phil's is pretty much the best bbq place i've been to in San Diego.  The lines do get a bit long during peak hours, but its definitely worth it.  I usually go for the quarter rib dinner with baby back ribs.  The macaroni salad I'd say is their best side.

The ribs were delicious!!! I shared a full rack with my girlfriend but they were so good I could have eaten the full on my own! My two sides were fries and macaroni salad. The fries were soggy when I got them hence the 4 stars as opposed to 5 stars. The macaroni salad was very good highly recommend getting those. When we got there the line was RIDICULOUSLY long. We got there a bit after 8 but I have a feeling the line is like that most of the day and everyday. I'm not sure if others have figured this out but the best way to beat the line is to ORDER OVER THE PHONE!!!!!!! We literally parked in the lot, went in and grabbed a menu, called them up from our cars after deciding what we wanted then walked in 10 minutes later and walked out with our food almost right away. You could probably look for a table after grabbing the food but its soo busy it was hard so we grabbed the food and sat at a bench in the same plaza and chowed down. Overall great ribs and reasonable price for bbq. Remember to order over the phone to beat the crowd!!!!

AMAZING!  I was daunted by the huge line and since this was my first time at Phil's, I almost left to find another place to eat.  But I was outvoted 3-1 to stay so we got in line [I think it was about 30+ minute wait.]  And then we finally got inside and I must say, it was totally worth the wait!  We got the beef ribs, the baby back ribs, and the chick-less dinner [basically chicken minus the bones].  We doubled up on coleslaw [which I loved] and also got fries and corn on the cob.  I must say the BBQ sauce is amazing and now I can understand why they would sell it by the bottle--I dipped everything in that sauce.  My husband says the beef ribs are better than the baby back but I would recommend first time visitors to just try everything!  Portions are huge [good for sharing] and it was pretty reasonably priced for the quality.  I'm always on the hunt for a good BBQ place and Phil's has made it onto my list of top 5.

if you are in the mood for heavenly bbq, this is it. if i can't have rudy's in texas, then i will take this. the food is fantastic. the line can be VERY long, but it does move quickly & they have their system which works pretty efficiently. if you are in the mood to be waited on, this is not the place. you need to have a little energy to stand in the line & brave the crowd. but you won't be disappointed when you taste the food. the baby back ribs are AWESOME!!

Overall 3.5 stars on the food.  I think this place was way over-hyped for me.  4.5 stars and reviewed over 1500 times..i was expecting some the best!!  Based on the reviews,  my husband and i each ordered a full rack of baby back AND the beef ribs.  we also ordered the onion rings which were delish! clearly...way too much food even for good eaters like us!   the beef ribs came w/5 giant ribs w/a lot of meat.  i'd say each beef rib contained between 4-6 oz of meat.  the beef was a little fatty and chewy, but tasty.  i didn't like how 2 of my 5 ribs were burned....the entire rib was black!   the baby back had to be my fave, but they also burned a few of those too and drenched it in sauce.  for a BBQ place that got 4.5 stars, i'd expect to be able to eat all of the ribs on my plate! overall, i'd come back again, order less food (1 full rack of baby back, 1 half rack of baby back and small onion rings), and skip out on the beef ribs.  oh and i'd order sauce on the side too.

Yes, the food wad good but the service was awful! After waiting for about an hour outside my group and i were without a table for well over 15 minutes after we had already ordered our food. It was embarrasing to just be standing around with our food with nowhere to sit! We finally got a table but were not offered a thing for our inconvenience. I would have thought maybe a percentage off the bill or at least a complimentary side or drink...nothing! Needless to say we will not be returning here regardless of all the hype...

i really like phils and can see why theres such a big hype over it. as soon as i went in, the greeter started telling me jokes, which weren't very friendly but i laughed to be polite and started joking back with her. then she hooked me and my sister up with free drinks. the baby back ribs are reallly good and they give you so many! the fries tasted normal, but the macaroni salad was really good. i usually dont like macaroni salad, but the ones from here is good for some reason. another time i tried a grilled chicken sandwich, but its pretty hard to eat because the chicken is so big and bumpy. the waiter was a nice grandpa who was so friendly and cute! i also really liked the seating arrangements and spaciousness of the restaurant. also, its good how customers pay while ordering food so people, especially college students, dont have to ask for separate checks.

It was my first time here, and OMG, it is seriously worth the one hour wait. My boyfriend and I got the 1. Best of Both:  baby back rib ( 4bones) and the chickless (6 pieces) dinner along with 2 sides: macaroni salad and potato salad for $11.95. - Baby back ribs are DEFINITELY THE best, hands down. don't even get anything else. JUST the baby back ribs is all you need. - We had trouble deciding between the chicken with the bones, or the chicken without it. but our friendly order taker recommended the chick-less. So that's what we ended up with. Personally, i didn't like it at all because it was seriously dry. They were like gigantic bbq chicken nuggets, but dry on the inside. so eh. i wouldnt get this again. - macaroni salad: probably one of the best macaroni salads I've ever had. the flavor is not TOO strong, and not drowned in sauce, and it came in cute looking pasta, not the regular macaroni. -potato salad, there's nothing much special about the potato salad except the fact that it came in largely diced red potatoes. 2.We thought it was not enough, so we also got the tickler for $6.45. It included 3 sides ( 2 onion rings, cole slaw and french fries) along with a beefy rib ( 1 bones) - beefy rib: it was a GIANT bone, don't think its a little small slab of beef folks. It's one big beef with the bone attached to it. Although this was good, it is in no comparison to the baby back ribs ( which is the best!) in my opinion. -onion rings: They were okay, maybe because they weren't as fresh, so the crunch wasnt really there anymore. - cole slaw: I'm not a fan of cole slaw AT ALL. but boy, phil's cole slaw changed my mind. The lettuce was so crunchy and light, so I really liked it. 3. The worker in our area was EXCEPTIONALLY hard working. Like you'd see him constantly cleaning the tables, and running around to get things for the guests. He was so friendly ! Usually at busy places like these, you would expect unfriendliness because they're so tired of serving people. but BOY! he was so energetic, so i helped him wipe the table a bit so it wasnt so messy, he was too nice! And when we were waiting in line, the lady who tells us when to go up to the cashier, was SUPER nice and funny too. She was really talkative, but in a friendly and fun way. Overall, I had a pretty good experience at phil's and is DEFINITELY looking forward to coming back here again(: highly recommended !

Great BBQ! The tri tip sandwhich & the pulled pork sandwhich were the best. We also got the baby back ribs & chicken also good. The onion rings were good beer batter but needed seasoning. The beans & coleslaw needed some seasoning too. The lines are crazy long but you can call ahead for takeout. You have to order, seat yourself, & pick up your own food keeps costs down but inconveinent to say the least. The paper liners on the trays shred up when cutting your sandwhich & they don't have sharp knives so ask for plates. The food was worth the trouble & affordable. Next time we'll do takeout!!

I don't understand all the rave reviews! The food was a bit below average, the pork ribs dry, the beef ribs charred beyond recognition and so extremely fatty that we didn't even finish them.

Phil's has been my favorite for ribs since I was first introduced to them. The meat is perfect every time and the sauce is amazing. On top of the great food, the owner is great guy who cares about his customers and his employees. They have catered some of our parties back in the and the owner himself would stop in to make sure everything is going well. Thank you Phil for making the best BBQ in town.

Went here on Saturday night.  There was a line but it moved fast, and soon we placed our order at the counter, seated ourselves and shortly they buzzed a little pager for us to come pick up our dinners.  We got the rib and chicklets combo for $11, which included four or five pork ribs and some nice barbecued chicken, as well as barbecue beans and fries (or other sides, if you like).  I was verrrrrry happy with my meal.  My brother had said Phil's was the best in San Diego, and he wasn't kidding.  I'll be back.

We were almost afraid to try Phil's at the new location since we had enjoyed getting 'down and dirty' - at least to our elbows - at the Hillcrest hole-in-the-wall.  The new spot is sooo much better!  From the time wonderful, warm Rhonda, the hostess, greeted us, it was just a trip!  We ordered the Brougham and El Toro sands, which we had always enjoyed, plus a large coleslaw and large onion rings with beer batter.  Although there was a LOT of food, we managed to eat every mouthwatering morsel except the bottom of the bun - c'mon, there's a limit here.  The noisy ambiance and appropriate music was great and everyone working there from Rhonda to the guy who took our order to the busers was cheerful and friendly.  No wonder it's incredibly busy - but don't let the lines fool you; they move fast and it is most definitely worth any wait you might encounter.  One caveat: Do NOT come here if you're on a diet because you may pledge yourself to portion control but self-control goes out the window as soon as you smell that yummy aroma permeating the whole place.

Wow, this is some good BBQ! Ribs and chicken are delicious. Service was fast. The whole experience was very memorable, I recommend this restaurant to BBQ fans!! If you're visiting San Diego, don't leave until you've eaten here!

The BBQ chicken was fabulous, and the portions were generous. The sauce is deceptively simple, but addictive. The macaroni was also amazing - its interesting, cool flavor goes very well with the BBQ sauce used. The atmosphere is very laid-back, and the service was friendly, even late at night.

If I had to walk the green mile, baby back ribs would be my last meal. Phil's bbq is way overrated. If you want to know what quality ribs taste like try baby blue ribs or the ribs at smokehouse in burbank. They don't try to cover poor quality meat with sauce.

My first time at Phil's and I was very impressed.  Yes, there was a wait to get in, but it was worth it!  We stood in line smelling all that BBQ goodness and couldn't wait to get in.  I had the half rack of baby back ribs with fries and macaroni salad (check out my photo...you won't have to read the rest of this review!).  The meat falls off the bone and the sauce is so tasty!  The sides were good (I really liked the macaroni salad and I got to try the corn on the cob and cole slaw...it's all good!).  I was also impressed with how the place was run...it was really busy, but everyone was having a good time.  The employees were friendly and did not seemed haried by the rush.  We got a table quickly once we were inside.  Since you serve yourself, you get the best service you can muster.  Drink station with everything you could want (I recommend the organic black ice tea).  There are even sinks at the exit to wash up before you go.  I left very happy and satisified.  I will definitely be back!!

i love this place! sometimes the wait is long...but to think about its not so bad.  they have a sign in the line that gives an approximate time. i think it was like 20+ minutes, so i timed it and it was less!   food is awesome!  i always take out of towners here to eat.  the last time i went i was asked to switch tables, and for our trouble was offered free onion rings. basically good food and good service!

I get my food togo and that even takes a little time..They do give you a pager though. I highly suggest Phils!

Must have BBQ! The wait was an amazing 1 hr 45 mins, and it was worth it. We ordered the Broham pulled pork sandwich and the El Toro tri tip sandwich, along with some fries. Both sandwiches were perfectly smoked and the bbq they provide was tantalizing, I'll be making another trip there.

I would probably live off of Phil's BBQ everyday if I could! I am definitely not a fan of any kind of barbecue, actually not a meat type of girl at all BUT Phils is an exception! As a lot of Yelpers have mentioned before me, you definitely want to go during off peak hours which would probably be anywhere between 2:00PM - 5:00PM or just go really late at around 9:30PM unless you don't mind waiting one hour! it's always at least a 40 minute wait.....but it is truly worth it. I normally get the quarter rack with two sides. With each entree, we are allowed either two small sides or one large side, but how am I supposed to choose only one or two if ALL of the sides are just so good? I always narrow it down to either the potato salad, cole slaw, or fries. If you haven't tried it already, definitely try it at least once! It is also great for families with kids, groups of teenagers, or anyone who just wants to sit at the bar and watch a game. This place can accommodate to anyone, so try it!

If you visit San Diego - you have to go to Phil's.  If you don't, you're either stupid or a vegetarian.  If Vegetarian, try the onion rings!  Heheh... just kidding ...  I remember when there was a wait just to put in a to-go order.  Not sure if it's still that way - but if you're short on time - do take out.  EVERY TIME I go to San Diego - I visit Phil.  one of these days I'd like to meet him and thank him for a bit of heaven on earth.  Last visit I brought home a bottle of sauce and rub.... I'm afraid to open them - not sure why ... kind of like not wanting your kids to grow up... or maybe I'm afraid what I do with them won't measure up to what Phil does with them?  Staff are fantastic .... Food great and plentiful.  Go!  ENJOY!  Diet tomorrow - but enjoy Phil's today.

For the ribs they are the best I have had at a restaurant. My favorite are the ones I buy from Costco and BBQ myself but when you do it yourself you can fine tune the flavors and save some dough if you have the time.  I appreciate that the potato salad and macaroni salad are not heavy on onion. I would say there isn't onion but just this weekend I swear I could taste something. My wife loves the heavy use of dill in the potato salad.  The onion rings are generous in portion. I usually get take out here because the patience to wait in that long line which is generally 100+ deep on weekends. I remember going to the Hillcrest location and not seeing lines this big and it was a smaller place. Popularity must be WAY up since those days.  For takeout the sides could be larger (with exception to the rings). The whoopie pies for dessert are guilty delicious. The staff seems to enjoy working here which adds to the experience. This is my go to BBQ joint, it's a shame I can only enjoy it for takeout. If you are feeding a family with ribs in mind bring $$$. I'm not a fan of pulled pork or the sandwiches of most places. My review is a reflection of the ribs and sides.

After having heard about Phil's for what seemed like years, my friends and I trekked down to San Diego one fine sunny day during finals week for this deliciousness, because we're down like that. Instead of waiting in the hour long line, we decided to wait in the separate to-go line and take out the food and planned to eat inside the car, true college style. But it was late and it was dark. So all four of us just plopped down on the sidewalk in front of our car and feasted away. We all ordered the baby back rib half dinner with two sides. The first rib was heavenly, the meat, the sauce, the sides, and all. But while gnawing on my second or third to last rib, I realized: baby back ribs are just baby back ribs, nothing more and nothing less. I'm sure there'll be times in the future when I'll be craving the sweet meaty tangy-ness of Phil's like none other but for now, let's just say that I'm glad I waited only ten minutes for the food.

Phil's has great BBQ worth the calories.  If you don't mind standing in a line outside the door for 45 minutes and then having to find your own seat after ordering and paying - then Phil's is a 5.  I've eaten here three times and will only do take out now because I'm just not a stand in line heard mentality kind of gal.  That being said, the food does make the wait worthwhile and people wait for a reason.  The prices are reasonable for a rib house and the atmosphere is friendly.  For me it is take out only!!!

Most people LOVE Phil's BBQ.  I have a friend that insists on going to Phil's every time they come back to San Diego from Washington.  The atmosphere is fun and it a great group environment, but it is not as exceptional as all my friends tell me.  Honestly, I love my grandma's BBQ ribs much better than Phil's.  I'd go there for the social experience, but the food is nothing to write home about.

Wow! Believe all the hype when you hear it! This place is mouthwatering GOOD. The wait was decent for a Wednesday at 7pm.  Patio seating was awesome, but limited of course. The service was surprisingly exceptional considering you don't really have a waiter since you order your food at the counter. Someone checked up on us frequently and the busboy came and cleared our table right after we were finished as well. 5 stars! Will tell everyone about this place.

Be prepared to wait in line for an hour for dinner on a weekend.  This was our first visit to phils and the wait was much worth the food!  We loved the beef ribs but no average person should be eating more than two of these.  The babyback ribs were also amazing.  We would highly recommend the onion rings and mac salad for ur side.  The BBQ beans and fries were also good and the corn and Cole slaw decent.  We would definitely come back to phils next time we're in SD

Baby Back Ribs were initially sweet, but the spice slowly draws you in and creates a great balance. Fall off the bone tender and had a great char. Coleslaw was very good, fries not so good. I wish they offered sweet potato. Aprrox 35min wait in line, but plenty of inside seating and friendly service. I've had BBQ in Kansas City, Memphis, Texas and this would hold its own. Overall, this is our fav in SoCal.

I found out about this place back in May 09. I can honestly say that I have come back at least about 30 times ever since. That is a lot. And there is a a reason why. That reason is because Phil's BBQ is the best bbq in San Diego, and it is the best I have ever had! Hands down. I had never been a fan of ribs, it just didn't appeal to me. I have had ribs in several places and it just never did it for me. I LOVE bbq sauce though, I really do. But coming to Phil's and trying their ribs, has made me a ribs connoisseur. I now LOVE ribs, and so far, Phil's is my favorite place to go for a finger-licking good BBQ. Their ribs are just so meaty and ever so tender. Fall of the bone goodness! But it's not just the ribs, EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS GOOD! They have some super delicious burgers and sandwiches, I personally recommend their BBQ Cheeseburger, it is just burger heaven and always so fresh since they don't make them 'til you order it. Their baked beans have a little touch of spiciness to them which only makes it better, their fries are something different, they are not great but they are good, but it is not your typical fries you will enjoy them. Their chicken is also delicious and very well cooked in my opinion. I have not even tried half their menu(but I do plan to ;D) since it is so vast, but any combination will satisfy you. When it comes to their prices, some people might say it is a little pricey, that's what I thought at first, but when you actually get your food, it is worth it. They serve you heaps of food. You really do get what you pay for, believe me. I work at Sea World and the restaurant I work in sells a "full rack of ribs" for almost $18(which is around the same price for Phil's full rib dinner). That platter comes with fries and steamed veggies, But their portions are puny. The ribs are average when fresh, when reheated they are just shameful. Comparing their "full rack" to Phil's full rack is just an embarrassment. Phil's comes out on top by a mile. Take my word for it, you WILL leave here wanting to come back!

so everyone one around me was always RAVING about phil's bbq and how amazing it was. i went with high expectations and unfortunately had to wait 2 hours until we got seated. it was the first weekend that it was open after being closed for three weeks, so im sure that contributed to it. this place brought back old memories of growing up in tx and eating ribs, so i was pretty excited. i ordered the half slab of baby back ribs with cole slaw and beans. the baby back ribs just slid off the bone and were very soft, which i liked. what i didnt like too much was the sauce. it was good with a sweet taste offset with a tangy-ness, but it was just TOO much sauce for me. as for the beans, i liked. they were sweet but not too sweet, and the coleslaw was good too but lacked a little flavor for me. im thinking of getting the macaroni pasta next time. that looks really good. the service was really good. the waiters were really friendly and were there to refill your drinks and get whatever else that was needed, so i liked that. another one little downer was the sodas! i dont know if all the sodas were like this but my diet coke was flat! :( maybe next time i'll have a 5 star experience, but for my first time i would give this place a 4. i would not wait another 2 hours to eat here. maybe 1 but 2 is a bit much.

Phil's is by far one of my favorite restaurants in San Diego! It is our number one place to take guests when they come into town. I am not usually a huge barbeque beef person and I love their ribs! The best I have every had. And yes the line is incredibly long if you do not get there before six but it is well worth it. I promise you will not be disappointed. It has a very fun atmosphere as well which makes it that much better. We seriously crave it at least once a week.

Phil's doesn't really need another review because there by far the best BBQ place in San Diego. No one else compares. There chickless chicken is my favorite and the sauce is very unique. The lines are always long but if you love it and want it you will wait. First thing I wanted after Lent was Phil's! Fast, Great Service, and outstanding food!

the food is probably one of the best BBQ places i been to.   the line is too long and if you are done eating you need to leave otherwise they will ask you to leave,  i wanted to chat w/ the GF after my dinner but they said if you are done eating you gotta dip....  i wasn't too happy with that...  the only reason they have this many stars is the food.  otherwise the service is terrible and its not really a "clean" place.  just a tip for the future to you people is order the food before you arrive,  so you can just pay and eat.

I am from out of town and found Phil's to be not only good food but a friendly place with the staff more than willing to help. In most of the restarants in the area service is not a stong suit of any. At Phils even though you seat yourself they make you at least feel welcome. This is not the best BBQ I have  ever had but it is in the top 3 or 4 I have eaten in and I have had some really good BBQ in KC and Saint louis, There is enough on the menu that all should be able to find something they like. The long lines are fast moving and also a good indication that the food is good.

The food at Phil's is great. The baby back ribs blow everyone else out of the park. The prices are a little high so I don't go too much. The only problem I have ever encountered happened tonight when I went there for dinner. The line was long so my friends and I decided to just eat at the bar. The bartender (Kristina) immediately had a bad attitude. She checked my id for a beer and threw it back at me. Gave me and my friends' lots of sarcasm. Other than the bad service from the bartender the place is great.

Phil's BBQ is so good! It's hard to decide what to get here because everything's delicious. Love their BBQ sauce. I usually go for the beef or baby back ribs. As for sides, Phil's has the best baked beans ever! And a large side of fries is REALLY large. Whatever you get, you can't go wrong.

Disclaimer: Lived in Virginia for 4 years and while it's not the Deep South, they still have a barbeque reputation.  Having said that, Phil's is okay barbeque.  In my opinion, it's not as good a chain as say, Dave's BBQ for the following 3 reasons: cafeteria-style dining area, super-ridiculously-long lines and pricing.  The first two speak for themselves, but calling in ahead does make the wait dwindle to 5-10 minutes from arrival to picking up your food.  As far as pricing goes, even to-go is about 25-30 dollars for dinner for two (ribs, sides and no drinks or dessert).  For the length of the line and the dining area, we should be paying about 15-20 dollars for two people.  I am of the bbq-sauce-is-too-tangy opinion, too.  After all of that, I still go back from time to time (calling ahead, first).  The call of bbq is too strong to ignore.

The best BBQ in SoCal! Originally being from the Midwest, I know BBQ, and this reminds me of back home. I have tried numerous BBQ places all over and hands down, this place is the best. The service is just as good as the food. The staff is extremely friendly and very fast. I probably haven't had better customer service at a restaurant. My wife and I always split the Broham Sandwich and the Rib-less Dinner with a side of fries and beans or coleslaw. You have to try these. All the sides are awesome, especially their fries, sounds boring, but they compliment any meal very well. The Colossal Onion Rings are pretty good too. It is closed on Mondays and it is always busy. Be ready to stand in line for awhile, especially on weekends, if you get there between 6 and probably 9 pm. The line usually moves pretty fast though. If you are hungry for BBQ, this is the place to go, no matter matter how far you have to drive.

I really don't know what their secret is, but the meat comes off the bone easily. I would never go anywhere else for BBQ ribs... Thanks for spoiling me, Phil.

Their Baby Back Ribs are AWESOME....but when it comes to everything else, they are just average.  Yes I said it....average.  Their Bro'Ham sandwich (pulled pork sandwich) is really not that good.  But I also lived in Texas for a year and have seen how good pulled pork can be.  The ribs though are definitely worth it.  The line can be impossibly long (though its no fault of Phil's so I won't take any stars away for that.)  Try and order it to go, you will get your food much quicker.   The sides are decent and the chicken can be good too.  Go there for the ribs, and if you have never had a pulled pork sandwich, try theirs....but if you are a BBQ aficionado, then stick to the BBRs.

Best BBQ in San Diego (perhaps anywhere, but I have not tried all the BBQ places everywhere, while I have tried them all in SD) their specialty are the ribs (both pork and beef) but everything in amazing here. You might have recently seen this place on the travel channels Man Vs. Food. There is always a line around the door (don't worry it moves fast) but the people are there for a reason and the wait is well worth it. 5 stars, no questions asked.

Just a totally delicious & fun experience both times I have been there.  Awesome price if you have a smaller appetite and you get the "Tickler"  I really love the fries and coleslaw & the ribs fall off the bone just as they should.  Initially thought sauce was too sweet but it grows on you fast and its great when it gets kinda mixed up with your fries and ketchup & coleslaw.  Nice and happy servers. They pay attention to quality and details and that is why they have the longest lines in SD.  I'm not a line person so I only go on off hours.

If you're from San Diego, you know Phils.  It's a local legend, and for good reason.  I'm a BBQ junkie, and in a city that has a surprising number of good BBQ places, Phils is the best.  Now, I must acknowledge, it's not smoked, but instead grilled with liquid smoke.  BBQ purists have a (justified) problem with this, but in my mind, it comes down to how it tastes, and Phils is simply delicious.  I normally go with the baby-back ribs, which are fall-off-the-bone tender, with a great rub and a great sauce.  I've had their beef ribs, which are super tasty as well.  If I'm there for lunch, I'll usually get the Broham, their pulled pork sandwich (although I get it without slaw).  My friends have had the tritip sandwich as well the the BBQ chicken, both to rave reviews.  In terms of sides, their fries are excellent, their baked beans are very good, and their onion rings are some of the best I've had (pro tip: put a couple onion rings on your sandwiches, it pushes them from great to outstanding).   The one problem with Phils: the lines.  Phils has a justifiably great reputation, and that's led to some significant lines, with waits usually between 20 and 40 minutes, and as much as an hour during peak times.   It's usually worth it, but be forewarned.

Southern expert here.....it ain't nothing like the taste of the South. If you're looking for a southern bbq experience you won't find it here. They do try to go out of their way to be nice to you, though....but, even that failed to impress as we were repeatedly interrupted during our meal with them trying to take our plates away!! They were in such a hurry to get us out so they could get more in. & No, we weren't taking a long time - they started this Shortly after we got our food! No, we didn't go close to closing time - they had a few hours before that. I got my extra bbq sauce that I paid for almost taken away, my spoon did get taken away so I had to get up and go get one before my food got cold, then they took my baked beans away! Get your hands off my food!! The baby back ribs had so much fat on them I barely got any meat between the fat and the black crust everywhere. I was given a chicken without any skin! (Yes, I ordered it with the bone-in) I had to plead my case for another one. You have to order your food at a counter and are told to come back to get it when the buzzer they give you goes off. However, when we went to get it we were told we weren't 'Allowed' to carry more than two plates! We tried and they wouldn't have it. They INSISTED they would carry them to the table regardless that we said we'll be fine taking them ourselves ----why tell us to come get em' in the first place, just wasting more of our dinner tallk time??? Both the pork and the chicken doesn't taste like high-quality meat, just bbq'd black crust with sauce to kill the taste. This place is definitely overrated...it boils down to it being a fan favorite in SD because it is virtually the only place to get BBQ. Cost is too much for what you get ($17.50 for a meal)....or should I say, get taken away. 1 star for trying, another because it's edible.

Hate to say it, but I was SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED with Phil's.  I had heard so many wonderful reviews...well talk about a build up...because it definitely didn't meet my expectations.  I am a native San Diegan (yes we do exist :)), so I can't claim to be an expert in good BBQ, but with a degree if Food Science, I should be able to know what good food tastes like.  Ok, I'm being a little harsh, but I honestly was disappointed with everything I ordered.  To start, the BBQ sauce was gross...it tasted like vinegar, so even though the chicken and ribs were cooked well...they were ruined by that gross sauce.  The beans and the coleslaw weren't bad, but they weren't great either.  And the biggest disappointment of all....they don't serve any of the best BBQ sides:  hush puppies, cornbread, sweet potato fries, or sweet tea.  The best place I've found in San Diego is Joey's Smokin BBQ in North County.  If you like a sweet BBQ sauce, yummy sides, and perfectly cooked pulled pork, you'll love Joey's.

I was in LA and a friend recommended that I try Phils, over in San Diego.  In a race against the clock, I sped over there from LA, barely making it before they closed at 9:40.  We ordered the baby back Half Rib Dinner and the Beef Ribs Dinner, also got onion rings.    The ribs, I must say are the most tender I have ever tasted.  The meat is literally falling off the bones, not sure if they are cutting the tendon on the bone such that it does that, but the meat literally pulls off the bone intact, leaving you with a big chunk of meat and a clean bone.  The portions are huge and I quickly found out that we ordered too much food.  The baby back ribs, tasted good and were tender, but I didn't quite like the sauce on it.  The beef ribs were my favorite, tender, and the sauce was right, but the meat was a little fatty.  The onion rings are very large and good as well, very very crunchy, first time I had it that crunchy.  Like one other reviewer said, I couldn't eat too many, as they were very greasy and oily, but yet still good.  Overall, if you are looking for ribs, Phils would be the place.

best bbq you'll ever eat (unless you haven't been to texas, LOL) everything here is freaking delicious! prices are very reasonable as well. i get the baby back rib and chicken combo because it has a little bit of everything to try. macaroni salad is awesome, coleslaw is good, fries get soggy easily, and the onion rings are A MUST! el toro is really good too but i kinda get sick of it easily cause there's so much meat and bbq. its really good but heavy so you'll get full quick. everybody there is SUPER nice and friendly. the line is always out the door and around the corner but the most i've ever waited was about 40 minutes so it's not that bad. plus, the employees there feed you fries while you're waiting so there's really nothing to complain about. my piece of advice is to order to go. there's no wait for that, you come, pay for it, pick it up and you're done. plus you have the comfort of eating at home. but if you do decide to dine-in, tables are a bit hard to save. they also have a table with to-go boxes, bags, forks, napkins, everything you need to bring home food.

This must be the best place for BBQ in San Diego, but overall, if you've traveled around the country, this place is over-rated.  I must mention I ordered a full rack of baby rack ribs (true carnivores will say these are better then beef ribs) and it was a large portion, but the sauce was mediocre and the ribs were not as soft as other's ive had in the past.  Their ribs scored a 4/5 to me....Other places such as Rocklands in MD or Dinosaur BBQ in saracuse are better IMO.  One issue I had with this place is their limited menu.  It seems to only focus on Chicken and Ribs.  True BBQ places should have beef brisket and Sausage too.  So minus 1 star for them lacking in options.  Second, they dont even have Mac And Cheese....For some people, including myself, this is ones favorite side dish with a delicious BBQ meal.  I opted with their macaroni salad (amazing) and BBQ beans (decent).  So minus another star.  Overall this place is solid, but over-hyped due to its long standing history in San Diego.  If i was around the area i would visit again, but not worth the travel if it is not in my route.

This place is the perfect example of over-hyped. After being told by a few people that I have to check this place out, and reading loads of positive reviews, I figured it was worth a try. Being from Las Vegas, we have Lucille's which is unbelievably good BBQ in every sense. After arriving and waiting approx one hour in line, we finally got to the elusive front counter only to take a number and find our own seat. It is kind of a do-it-yourself approach to seating, which was weird. We got the food. The ribs were smoked, and had great potential of being delicious if they used a better sauce. The sauce they used was more like Kraft BBQ sauce. The fries were plain, and nothing to write home about. The coleslaw was the same. The best thing on my plate was the corn-on-the cob, and I savored it. I guess if you like a packed-out place, and candied BBQ sauce that tastes like it came out of a store-bought bottle, then this is your place. Is it me, or is San Diego is starved for decent BBQ?

I can't believe I forgot to write a review of Phil's while I was out in SD this past February. I believe we went on a Wednesday night around 8pm or so. The line was around the building but I was told that is not as bad as it could be. We actually made a beeline for the bar area and staked out some stools and lucked into a couple of folks leaving about 5 minutes into our wait. The bartender was friendly and promptly took our beer order and gave us menus after wiping the bar area down. I had the BBQ Broham (pulled pork sandwich with slaw) and a small order of onion rings. The sandwich was superb and the rings were fantastic. For a couple people to eat and a few beers the tab was about $30-$35 which I felt was very reasonable. My suggestion is not to wait in the line and try and check out the bar first to see if you can swoop in on some seats. Otherwise, a wait under an hour would be worth it in my opinion. I definitely will try and go back on my next visit.

let's just say i have been hearing about this place for the past year, and since i didnt make it  here on my last SD trip i made sure i went on my second trip..my friend who lives in SD loves this place...we planned our day around hitting up Phil's for dinner..after having brunch and going to the zoo we hit up a dessert place in order to prepare for an expected wait here...apparently its THAT good....when we arrive in the parking lot we can clearly see a line, uh oh...but being that we expected there to be a line we went anyway..we get to the line and i swear i felt like i was at disneyland! the line wrapped!! LUCKILY we were that hungry and we ended up talking to the people with us in line as well as the waiter/worker who was tending the line...oh they also have someone walking around the lines offering samples of their fries!..after about an hour wait we were ready to order at the front of the line...my friend and i ended up ordering corn, onion rings, a full bbq pork ribs and the bbq chicken/beef combo...after you order you find a free table to sit..the food comes really fast literally 5-10 minutes and i whole order was done!..man oh man..the bbq pork ribs were soft and falling off the bone..the beef ribs were huge! with eating just one piece of enormous bbq beef rib, I felt like i was fred flinstone eating in bedrock! and the onion rings...super fresh and perfectly battered and fried to a crisp! definitely worth a try if you are ever in the SD area...oh did i mention i bought 3 bottles of BBQ sauce and a container of their dry rub? just in time to bring it home for a superbowl sunday bbq and everyone loves the dry rub and bbq sauce!

Should be 2.5 stars but since most San Diegans get butt hurt when I talk down on their beloved bbq joint, I'll round up.  This place is definitely hyped and NOT worth any wait over 30 minutes on a weekend and any wait on a weekday.  I had the tri-tip sandwich since it was recommended by some frequent customers waiting in line with me and the girl taking my order.  I also assumed since tri-tip gained its popularity first in California, it would be a good choice.  I was so wrong.  Dry and drenched in sauce.  It kind of tasted like they carved the tri-tip and to heat it up, threw it under a broiler.  Then, to make up for the dryness, they just threw a load of sauce on top.  If I am ever forced to go back, I will probably give the ribs a try.  Someone else at our table ordered those and they did look very moist and tender.  So the 3 stars is a bit generous in my book, but since the others at the table seemed happy with their selection (most got the ribs), I will postpone a bad rating until I've given some other items a try.

been coming here ever since they use to be in mission hills on goldfinch. im so glad they moved to a bigger joint! i gladly make the drive (and theres a target nearby-oh i love target...ok back to phils bbq). the line looks atrocious but its not so bad. if it wraps around the corner, id say around 20-30 minutes. for some reason, even though its hella crowded, seating is never an issue, large or small party. i guess peeps just chow down on the ribs and then bounce? its too loud to have a conversation in there so i wouldnt recommend this place for a first date (and also, rib sauce all up in your grill aint sexy ladies). we always get the ribs/chickless platter which consists of 3 ribs, 3 bonelss pieces of white meat chicken and either two little sides or one large side. if you arent that hungry, you can easily share that one platter. they have a wash station on the way out which is nice when the little wipes dont cut it. BEST ribs in SD imo. oh and the baked beans, mac salad and onion rings? cant leave w/o having some of those babies! its the whole bbq experience at phil's~finga' lickin' gooooooood...

One word. Disappointing. A few other words. Still the best ribs in the San Diego area (depressing). After reading all these great reviews and seeing the lines wrapped around the corner of the building everytime I drove by, I had to try this place sooner or later. First of all this is a reivew of their ribs only, I did not try other dishes on Phil's menu. I love BBQ ribs and have tried many in the area from Tony Romas (Ugh) to ones way out in Poway and ribs from around the nation in Boston, and in South and North Carolina. I have also attended a few rib cook-offs including the Best of the West in Reno, NV. So I have tasted my fair share of ribs and had some amazing ribs at competitions and in the South. Given the Yelp hype, and have tasted some award winning ribs from around the US, I had high expectations. Phil's disappoints as their ribs are not BBQ, but grilled. Yeah the ribs are moist and fall of the bone tender, but there is no smake flavor nor nice pink color to the meat you would get from slow smoke BBQ. That being said, their sauce is one of the best I have had and the reason for 3-stars instead of 2. Their sauce is probably the reason thier ribs taste decent given the lack of flavor from the cooking process (grilling versus smoking). The ribs themselves are fairly large so you won't be disappointed by puny ribs that barely fill you up. Prices are reasonable and on par with what you would pay at other rib joints. I'll probably end up going back to Phil's and given them a second chance and try other menu items, but Phil's certainly does not deserve the high praise it gets nor the enormous wait to get in. Unfortunately, when you offer a decent produce in a mediocre market, you get people rushing in and praising it so highly.

I heard and read a lot of good things of Phil's BBQ in sunny San Diego from friends and online reviews so I had to find this place and check it out. So me and my friends drove here not knowing really exactly where the place and just had an Idea where it might be but we really did not need any directions at all because the Aroma of BBQ smelled so good the it took us there without the need of MapQuest. The place was packed this usually means that It's a good sign so we couldn't Wait to get some food but we had to Wait because there was a long line that took about thirty minutes before we can get some food! The wait was worth it only because I didn't eat breakfast or anything that day not even a Poptart (eww) so it was about one o clock and hungry as hell. I had the combo of grilled chicken with a baked potato and some ribs. The baked potato taste like how a baked potato should taste like no complain about that, Chicken was small and a little dry but good, the ribs were good, definitely can comeback for those and I also had some of my friends onion rings which I should've ordered myself because they were really good and would steal some off his plate when he went to the restroom,get some napkins, get a refill Etc. Overall the place is packed which I really liked because it felt alive and this was a place to be in SD for foodies at least and the food was good but not up to the hype people bring it up too but very good nonetheless. Service was pretty attentive especially since it was busy but there probably used to it.

Phil's BBQ has become a San Diego institution.  I love barbecue and like many San Diegans, I thoroughly enjoy eating at Phil's.  The food is consistently excellent -- these are probably the best ribs I've ever had -- and the vibe is good (it just feels like a good place to be on a weeknight or weekend) but two things keep me from visiting more often: first, it's expensive.  The full rib dinner is around $19, and truthfully, because I am a big eater and savor BBQ, I almost always want seconds, which is a problem considering my small budget (and the cost of BBQ). Second, the lines here are insane.  I've come here several times before with my parents and another time with a friend and just left immediately once we saw the length of the line.  The line length certainly validates Phil's BBQ as being a great restaurant, but I'm usually not down to wait 50 minutes for some ribs.  I suppose it's best to plan your visit ahead of time -- e.g., during off-peak hours -- or you'll be waiting in BBQ purgatory for awhile.

Like some, I don't see what the big deal is about this place. #1? I don't think so. Only came here for the second time because it was my friend's birthday and he loves this place. First time I got half a chicken, and believe me, it was half a chicken. My brother had the rest of my leftovers and claimed he didn't feel so good. Second time I went for something smaller, so I got a bbq chicken sandwich (not a big fan of ribs). The server warned me it would take about 15 minutes and I said I'll wait. So I wait while all my friends are enjoying their plates. About 20 minutes pass and my buzzer still didn't ring. So my friend, the birthday boy, goes inside and checks it out. Turns out they didn't even get my order. Really? They brought out complimentary onion rings but I had already lost my appetite. My sandwich was dry and the caesar salad tasted foul. They say third times the charm but I don't think I'll give it another shot. Sorry.

Wow what a disappointment. This place seem like a great bbq joint but what it turned out to be was a big waste of money. I first walk in with a long line of people. After about twenty minutes of waiting I got up to the cashier and saw the menu and asked a couple of questions. I ordered the ribs, el toro(brisket sandwich), bbq beans, fries and bbq burger. I also tried to order sweet potato fries and corn bread but they dont serve it here at PHILS. What bbq joint do you know that doesnt serve corn bread and sweet potato fries? After another fifteen minutes of waiting I got my food and was excited to chow down. What I got was burnt ribs, dry brisket drenched in bbq sauce and a some what tasteless burger. After just one rib and 1/3 of the brisket I was done. My wife couldnt even finish her burger because it was so tasteless. The beens were just beens with brown sugar and the fries were just fries. I've been to a lot of bbq joints and this was probably one of the worst ones. The price was way over what it should have been. I'll never eat here again unless I'm dieing for some burnt a** meat and over priced food. Oh and good luck finding parking after 4pm.

Phil's BBQ definitely has some good BBQ but is somewhat overrated. The BBQ itself is very good, though not great. Their onion rings are just ok, though not the best I've ever had. They taste more like 2 different items rather than two flavors that are complementing each other. They also need a better selection of sides. The location sucks.  If you have a new car, don't take it. Ask someone else to drive if you can. Why? Because the parking lot is so crammed that you are bound to get a ding or two. The 1hr30min+ wait also sucks. It probably would of been 1hr if people didn't keep cutting in line (Yes, the seating is more like a fast food restaurant than a sit down restaurant). Overall, going to this place was somewhat of a disappointment. Maybe I expected a bit too much but who wouldn't when you have to wait so long just to get your food. I probably will be going back, though not when the wait is as long. The wait is just not worth it since there are better restaurants in SD that will actually allow you to write your name and go have fun rather than wait in line (not fun).

Some of the best BBQ in San Diego.  The onion rings are killer and made fresh.  The ribs are the best thing on the menu, and I even like the side dishes.  Beans and macaroni salad are the way to go.  The "ribless" pork was a bit dry and stringy, so I stick with the ribs.  My friends swear by the sandwiches, and my wife loves the chicken.  The sauce has a nice little back ground kick to it.  If you are looking for a quiet place to have dinner, then go somewhere else.  There is always a line.  Oh yeah, they are closed on Monday's so don't be fooled if you pull up outside and there is no line to get in.  The true secret to Phil's is to call ahead.  There is a separate line for call ahead orders, so you are in and out in a few minutes.  When I have a craving for BBQ, i call up Phil's.  Aside from the crowds, the main draw back is that they do not have brisket.  I guess I'll have to get that elsewhere.

Ok, first let me let everyone know that i am from Dallas Texas so my expectations for good BBQ are pretty high. I have had phils on several occasions because it was catered at a annual party so the two times that i have had it it was not at the restraunt but through their catering service my experience with their catering service mad it not necessary to try the restraunt. First thing great coleslaw beans and macaroni salad i have no complaints about any of that stuff. The chicken is ok it was kinda dry and very little BBQ flavor tasted more like roasted chicken than anything else. The pulled pork is good but could have more flavor as a pork dish should have a very distinct taste and flavors. Ribs were tough and most certainly not falling off the bone. The rolls taste like the ones you get from the plastic bag at the grocery store. This does not make phils bad in my mind but their BBQ sauce does! It is way to sweet and has a cherry base which resembles the stuff put on deserts. When i say sweet i mean really sweet making the stomach sick sweet. Their are not many places that i have fond which have good barbecue int eh San Diego area which is sad but there is one place off clairemont mesa blvd called "Abbeys" which is pretty darn good (and they got fried okra if you've never heard of that then no wonder you think phils is good BBQ)
