This should be a quintessential pitstop whenever one visits the city by the bay, inarguably one of my favorite bakeries of all time.  For owner Chad Robertson, baking bread is beyond an obsession.  From keeping meticulous time tables for dough temperature, baking times, and oven settings to taking care of his yeast starter as though it was one of his beloved children...his passion for bread is displayed with freshness and quality on a consistent basis.  It has been said in numerous reviews that the quality of his breads and croissants remind French expats of their childhood, and this sentiment is no doubt supported by the fact that he spent a year in France working in old school bakeries mastering classic techniques.  His wife Elisabeth offers insight with her discernable palate highlighting various local ingredients, and when you combine the two elements together, one truly arrives with a match made in heaven.   Some notable must-tries: 1) The country loaf bread- rustic in appearance with a dark brown exterior on the verge of being burnt and an interior with beautifully irregular nooks and crannies, this is what separates Tartine's bread from the competition adding a complexity of texture and flavor that is rarely imitated and therefore almost never duplicated.   2) Double pain au chocolate- my gold standard for the heights a chocolate croissant can ascend towards.  Perfect balance of dense pieces of Valrhona chocolate encased in seemingly infinite layers of pastry laminated with butter, the shattering sensation one experiences is not only the effect of the pastry in one's mouth but also of one's mind in terms of breaking down all notions of how a croissant should taste like. 3) Morning Bun- a perennial favorite on the SF 7x7 big eat list, this sweet creation has achieved iconic status, and while it is not my personal favorite, I can definitely attest the accolades are well-deserved.  If you have the opportunity to sample one freshly turned over from the oven, biting into the morning bun is like sampling a sophisticated crepes suzette dessert in a humble cinnamon roll-like pastry.  Croissant dough interlaced with cinnamon, sugar and a lingering finish of orange zest, as one breaks off each decadent piece in between licking every last granule off one's fingers,  rest assured one hopes the tightly packed spiral of indulgence has no end. 4) Ham and cheese croissant-  Same principles of the pain au chocolate but substituting Niman Ranch ham and gruyere cheese, this savory counterpart is as good or better depending on one's personal preference. During my numerous trips here, I can't seem to get past these favorites, but I hope to someday try the chocolate banana cream tart or their seasonal bread pudding, which have also been listed in several other reviews.  For one traveling without a car, take the BART(subway) to the 16th and Mission St. stop and from there it is a few blocks further on foot.

This is one of my wife's favorite bakeries. As for me, well, I have to be in the mood for it. Their bread pudding portions are huge but make sure they heat it up since cold bread pudding doesn't taste as good.

Best in class for what it is, but not really my thing. My first experience with Tartine was when a friend brought a country loaf to a dinner party. It was definitely the culinary highlight of the evening. The second time was in the bakery itself. I waited in line for ~10 minutes and got a double pain au chocolate. My friend ordered a morning bun. Both were amazing, especially the soft interiors. But I don't like waiting in line or eating indulgent carbs so I probably won't be back too soon.

There was a line, but it moves fairly quickly - even with people busy checking yelp on their smartphones for what to order. I had the bread pudding with apples and berries: soft, buttery, and full of flavor without being overly sweet or soggy. Hubby had the open faced croque monsieur with ham and cheese. The texture was perfect - crunchy crust - with a nice blend of flavors from the ham, cheese and sun-dried tomatoes. I also had the iced americano (decaf, since I'm pregnant) and it was the best decaf espresso I've tasted in a while. Definitely will be back again to try some of their other offerings!

I feel honored just having the privilege of writing this review. This is my bakery Mecca and I'm happy to say I had the pleasure of enjoying breakfast among colleagues recently. After acquiring the cookbook and practicing my own baking at home, Tartine lives up to every single bit of infamy there is. The shop is so much smaller than I anticipated and they seem to be bursting at the seems from kitchen to dining room. The addition of tables on the outside is a really nice touch. Staff was ultra friendly and helped me find what I was in the mood for. On to the food. Everything I dreamed it would be and how nice that is. Ham and cheese croissant. If you've ever seen the process of making croissants, you'll immediate appreciate these. Crunchy, wonderful strata, buttery flavor, salty ham, strong cheese. Total heaven. Lemon tart: Light, sweet, custardy, and great crust. I'd get it again in a hearbeat. Croque Monsieur: The coup de gras. The Omega of bread items. On the infamous country bread and hosting wonderful cheese, rich egg was, tomatoes. It was pure heaven. So rich, so cruchy. The crumb on the bread alone is worthy of love-speak. I wash, and still am, in absolute and complete awe. Tartine is awe-inspiring, indeed.  I am honored to make this my first review and look forward to making many more trips in the future. Thank you so much to Chad and the team here. You've inspired me all the way in Charlotte, NC and I can't wait to continue my own baking! I'll be back every single time I'm in San Francisco.

Do yourself a favor, drive yourself the extra mile or two from the city and grab a pastry (in the morning/early afternoon) or a very large loaf of sourdough (after 4:30PM). You won't regret either decision. I can't remember the last time I've had a crossaint with that many flaky layers on the outside while remaining completely moist and delicious on the inside. That sourdough? Well, be there at 4:30 sharp to beat that line for THE crustiest, chewiest, HOT loaf of sourdough bread. I don't know how they expect people to make it home with a whole loaf of bread for their family. At least the loaf is huge so your family will get half of it by the time you're willing to share it. But don't worry about having too much, it stays chewy and moist for days afterwards and the crustiness comes right back with a quick toast. (You could also ask for a half loaf but that's not as much fun).

For the longest time, I drive by and can never figure out what this place is called because there's no sign! The only thing I do see is a bajillion people standing by the door or those that sit outside on a week day enjoying their yummies, and you can't help but wonder if people work! So I finally got to be one of those people, came super early on a Monday to see what they're all about. Not too bad for 9:00 and the line goes really fast, so know what you want beforehand. If you want to eat Banana Cream Pie/Tart....FYI They supposedly don't make that on Mondays!! WHY NOT!??! *sad face* Fine. So, we ordered a latte, morning bun, an eclair, a lemon tart and a cup of bread pudding. Bread pudding never was my thing, so I don't know if I'm hating but I just don't like it, way too sweet for me. The eclair was OK, but I think I would rather have cream puffs more. The lemon tart was delicious though; I love it! But what is with the cream on top? It has no flavor. The latte came in a bowl, so it was super cute. The morning buns were delicious. I love the outside seating because the inside was too cramped. Other than that, things are pretty expensive here and plan on spending at least $4 on one item. I will definitely be back for the banana cream pie and the muesli one day!

Heresy, I know but after working in the baked goods industry for some time I'd like to think that I have more than the average layman's understanding of pastries and bread...  then again, I was told on two separate occasions by different baking instructors that I was the worst pupil they had ever encountered so tender my review with some skepticism, dear readers. Perhaps it's the East Asian influence in my upbringing, but it's very hard for me to suffer inefficiency...  and when I actively choose to suffer through this at food service establishments, it's because there's something that's so mind bogglingly delicious that I have no choice but to deal with it.  Sort of like Katz Deli in NYC and their arcane ticket/line system. When corazon and I arrived, the line was only 10 deep.  Reading other accounts of crowds reminiscent of Visigoth hordes routinely queuing up on the weekend, I - perhaps mistakenly - thought that we were going to get our selection and find some sort of reasonable seating accommodations.  Imagine my consternation when instead we waited in line for 20 minutes until our order was filled.  Cue another 15 minutes of waiting for our stuff while we ambled through the small seating area not succeeding in finding tables open. When we finally just gave up and sidled over to the stand up bar, I admittedly found the quiche, morning bun and lemon tart to be tasty.  But were they really worth 35 minutes of waiting plus dealing with the insane crowd?  And therein lies the rub...

I am a bakery aficionado, and this place is tops. The bread is legendary, but if you can't make it to the afternoon bread line then you can still try it in a sandwhich. I love their ham and gruyere panini - it's HUGE! Feeds two people easy. As for pastries, everything I've had has been sublime. Love the morning bun for its crisp, buttery, orange sugar goodness and the lemon tart is to die for. Seating is limited as other mentioned and expect a line any time of day. Kind of dirty looking inside but I don't mind - the quality of the food here is excellent.

Nope. I know this opinion I'm about to spew out here ain't the popular variety - so be it. But I really consider my fatty fat gluttonous palate to KNOW what's up in the indulgence realm. PROOF: I got.... Morning bun Pain au chocolate Croissant Gruyere bread puff thingy (ugh) Friand I really gave this place a whirl!!! When I used to live in SF the line was as it is described here in other reviews. When I used to live in SF I worked so weekends I sure as hell wasn't waiting in line for food because that's just NOT HOW I ROLL! It's not. I don't GET that. That herd like behavior. I will eat like a cow but not graze like one. So anyways, quelle surprise! I'm sorta job-less and haunting my old hood and I can waltz in, no line, at like 11am on Monday or whenever and yeah... I just don't think any one thing I got was that good. I've been to Paris and shit. But St. Tropez area has the best pastries. Just sayin! These were oversized, sort of dry and chewy baked goods. AMERICAN STYLE. With the exception of the Friand, which said it was like a bite sized 'vanilla chocolate' thing and it was just a dry chocolate covered brownie. I kept burping up the Gruyere bread as I huffed and puffed, hungover as fuck to the tourists club. It was gross. My fault though. Maybe the giant crazy sandwiches were amazing... Maybe the delectable looking cakes are the way to go... I don't know! I just don't know. La Boulange has sorta better pastries! I'm just kinda like, meh, but it's not meh it just WOULD be meh if you were to wait in that line! I'm left scratching my head. And not being able to fit in my pants. Lousy combo.

Dear Tartine, I don't know if I've had a croissant as good as the ones I purchased from you since I've been in France. If only I had know just how amazing these would be I would have purchased more. One chocolate croissant, one ham and cheese and a brownie. All unreal in taste. Perfectly flaky and delicious. If I had a private plane I'd be back ALL. THE. TIME.

Morning bun. You are the most aptly named baked good. Your name holds bountiful rays of sunshine and hope. You sweet dough wipes away the tears from the eyes of the heartbroken. Your sugary coat silences the whiny babes and grumpy youth. Your perfect texture erases from memory the couple's angry fight from last night. Your buttery delectableness unites the weekend brunchies and weekday munchies. Your mere existence offers a home for those in need of comfort. You are the miracle worker, the medicine bun, the secret antidote for all things happy. My oh my, are you delicious.

Tartine Bakery makes so many delicious things for both the savory and sweet tooth. A great place to eat a meal and enjoy some delicious dessert but I usually come for one item and one item alone: The coconut cream tart! Probably my favorite sweet treat in the world and now after writing this review I'm thinking that I'll change my last meal on my profile to this ;)

Good, but not wait in line for an hour good. Came here for brunch with a few friends, and we must have done something to deserve massive karma points the night before, because we were blessed with good luck throughout the day. 1. Amazing, unfoggy morning weather 2. Parking spot right outside of the restaurant 3. NO LINE when we got there (however the line slowly grew throughout our meal) Shared a few items with a friend. Croque monsieur with veggies - 4 stars - my only gripe is that our croque monsier wasn't very warm when we got it. However, the mushrooms we had on our open faced sandwich were delicious. Keep in mind, this is less a croque monsieur and more a pizza on bread. Still good though! Almond and sheep cheese sandwich - 4 stars - tasted like a almond butter and sheep cheese grilled sandwich (which makes sense... it's essentially what it was). This sandwich was good, but a little on the heavier side Side salad - 2 stars - pass on this one. A couple pieces of lettuce tossed in a lemon vinagrette. The lettuce wasn't very fresh and the vinagrette wasn't very exciting. Chocolate and hazelnut tart - 5 stars - I love, LOVE hazelnuts (nutella or fererro rocher anybody?), and chocolate tarts are one of my favorite desserts (I don't like dessert). This tart was definitely the marriage of my favorite dessert items. The hazelnuts added texture and a nuttiness that all chocolate tarts should have. Yum!! Don't know if I'll be back, because I hate waiting in lines, but definitely had a great experience here!!

If you don't have to wait in line here, this place is amazing. I used a delivery service to get some Tartine and it was dope. I would not eat one of their eclairs while lying down though, cause it spilled all over me and I had to take a shower. The best pastry they have IMO is their breakfast morning roll, which is a flakey muffin-like pastry that is rolled in sugar. It is delicious.

Another late to the party review.. ...was standing in line this past sunday before they opened (only 4 folks deep at 8:30am) and thought to myself .. " i need to yelp this place after at least 10 yrs of consistent enjoyment).   I mentioned to my wife how I was much thinner before I started coming here, but never looked back.   No one can touch the quality of their Morning Buns, and believe me... I have tried to find an equal closer to home.   It's easy for the two of us pastry fans to drop at least $50-60 bucks a visit ....  and worth every bite (I mean buck).

EVERYTHING!  There. That is what is good here! =) Seriously though, everything is delicious here. I have tried almost everything here over the past several years and have not once had anything I disliked. My favorites are the coconut cream and banana cream tarts, the chocolate and ham & cheese croissants, fresh baked bread, and buche de noel (only available during Christmas). All disappear from my kitchen and fridge faster than a blink of an eye! When you bite into the cream tarts, you will find a sweet surprise of a chocolate lined crust with a drop of caramel in the center. Absolutely sinful! The breads are only available after 4pm, so plan ahead and call to reserve one if you are afraid to head home without one. If you are visiting, remember to grab a few pre-packed chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies, orange macaroons (the coconut kind), or spiced nuts for your loved ones back home. The place can get touristy on the weekends, but I find that most leave by mid-afternoon.  The communal tables are very warm and friendly, so don't feel afraid to chat up your neighbor about the amazing treats here when you visit!

Between 3 1/2 and 4 stars. There are some star items that'll have me coming back just for those like the chocolate croissant an tres leches. But because the service was a hit and miss, gets a big meeeeh. Ive been here twice. Service was really nice the first time (busy; stood in line for 15 mins) but the second time was very meh, very disappointing(the beginning of a small rush). Best chocolate croissant ever!! Quality chocolate, nice flaky crust. And huge!! Bread pudding...not memorable. Tres leches cake slice. Not your typical insofar it's not sopping wet but very very yummy. Coconut is not very strong. But the cream so delicious. I'd have it again.   Chocolate hazelnut tart. Not very heavy, a little cakey. But anything chocolate I'm a fan. And the hazelnuts on top are tasty with their lightly roasted selves. Morning bun. Light orange taste with cinnamon sugar. My favorite is the flaky parts of it which is only some of it. The manfriend ate the rest of it.

The first time I came here it was in the morning and the line was so long, out the door. Gah! I came here Saturday night at like 6 and the line was still long and out the door! Double gah! Yummy pastries and bread. Morning bun is good - light on the inside and flaky on the outside and not too sweet. Ask them to warm it up for you if it's been sitting there for awhile. I love the seating, communal tables. I will come back and stand in line again (gah!) to try your cakes and your hot sammies!

I don't remember where I saw Tartine featured, but I knew I had to try it. Everything looks absolutely delicious from the pictures - and pleasantly, everything was! I ordered a chocolate and hazelnut tart, along with a couple of other fruit-based tarts. They looked picture perfect, and certainly tasted the part. Nothing was too sweet. All the textures were just right, complimenting each other just as they intended. The crumbly bits weren't too buttery but just rich enough to accompany any bits made of berries and gooey sugars. The chocolate was rich, but not overwhelming. Everything was just right - and promptly devoured by my friends and I. Inside the place, sure, seating is limited. I know they had a selection of coffee and other drinks to go with their tarts and breads, but that'll be for next time. Worth your time for sure.

The pastries are easily worth 5 stars, but the wait  is awful. Moreover, the long lines are artificially created! How are there only 2-3 employees filling orders? They can get the line moving a lot faster by hiring extra people. It's not like they don't have the space. It felt like a nightclub that lets you foolishly stand outside to form a long line to impress passersby.

This place is very small! It has sparse decorations and only about 20 seats. So if you get here at the wrong time, there's a line out the door. I would also recommend getting your order to go if you're claustrophobic, because with all of the people, it gets very cramped. I came here for the Double Pain au Chocolat because it was featured on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate (I'm a total geek, I know). Their chocolate chip cookies were also featured in a recent article from Food & Wine Magazine. So of course, I ended up ordering both. The Double Pain au Chocolat is basically a warm, chocolate filled croissant with a very flaky crust - and I mean VERY FLAKY. I should have gotten a knife and fork because it ended up being really messy trying to eat it on the go. But it was pretty tasty, the chocolate filling was bittersweet, and I think it would have been complimented by a sweeter crust, but that's just me. However, you should definitely get a drink to go with it because it'll leave you thirsty. I saved the chocolate chip cookie for later (because who could really eat all that chocolate at once?) and ohmigosh. It was everything that a crunchy chocolate chip cookie should be. The chocolate chunks were well-blended into the batter, so they baked perfectly into the cookie. There was also oatmeal in it, but not enough to make it an oatmeal cookie, and walnuts as well. So good! I would have given this place 4 stars if it wasn't for the cashier. She was kind of rude and seemed put-off, like she didn't want to be there and taking my money was such a hassle for her.

I was afraid Tartine wouldn't live up to its reputation, but it really really did. The line can go out the door but it moves pretty fast.. And you need that time to decide what to get anyway! Good luck getting a seat though, they're high commodity. You may do well just taking your treats to Dolores Park if it's not too cold out. Decided on a gougere (cheese puff) and chocolate croissant... a little savory and a little sweet, you know? Both were just perfect, delicate and rich and satisfying. My brother doesn't like croissants, or chocolate, and he loved that croissant. Also tried a couple sandwiches -- turkey and sopressata. Turkey was kinda boring but I'd get the sopressata again any freaking day. Sammy's were huge too. Coffee and mocha were meh. Wanna try the banana cream and bread pudding next time!

Sunday morning, the line is outside the door, my friend and I waited about 15min until we were able to order. The line is long ,but goes by really fast. I've been wanting to taste the bread pudding from here, I have read good things about it from the yelp reviews. Ordered: bread pudding, blueberry scone, & cheese kiche. Sad to say, I was disappointed with the bread pudding, it was really eggy. I have had way better egg pudding than this.Not from a bakery though, but Mexican homemade bread pudding. Nothing beats that. Blueberry scone was so good though. I loved it. It had a great texture and it was not too sweet but just right. Kiche.OMG. I loved the kiche. I wish I ordered another one. it was sooo good. Just make sure that when you get to the counter that you know what you want, bc the workers here are really fast and they don't want to wait around for someone who is undecided. How do I know this, my friend is so indecisive that she was just standing there all confuse. If you like having pastries for breakfast ,than this is definitely the place to come. I like having eggs, sausage, and hash browns for breakfast that's why I am giving this place 3 STARS ,but for their pastries for sure 4 STARS.

Meal: Snack Rationale: Tartine is famous or something. I'm not sure. Whatever the case, my boyfriend said WE MUST GO HERE NOW so we went there now. Food: I bet their bread is great - and I saw them baking it when I walked through the room with the oven to get to the bathroom - but I wanted fat and sugar. So we settled on a croissant, a hazelnut chocolate tart, and a frangipane tart. The croissant was flakier and airier than any croissant I've ever had. It very nearly melted in my mouth. The chocolate hazelnut tart was very good, too, and was exactly as one might expect it to taste. The frangipane tart was great, although I'm a big sucker for fruit and almond paste. It really wouldn't have been hard for Tartine to win me over, but our selection left me wanting for nothing. Except more. Service/Atmosphere: Tartine is on the smallish side. We scarfed down our goodies standing at a counter by the window and watching people walk around in the drizzle. I bet there is a line at times. As I mentioned before, it's possible to observe the bread being baked on your way to the bathroom. Conclusion: Part of me feels like for every famous bakery there's an equally great one undiscovered down the street, where there are no lines and the prices are lower. Until I find that bakery, though, I might endure a line to buy a sack of Tartine's croissants. And, of course, I'd have to go back to try the bread. And maybe even some of their prepared savoury foods.

I dragged my family members here after they had taken me all over the city to their requested places. They were like, "Why are we going to a bakery out here?" but after I fed them coffee and cake, they nodded in agreement. This place makes some good stuff. We had the tres leches, a coconut passion fruit bavarian (?), a savory muffin and some hazelnut thing my mom wanted. All devoured.

I don't know...I'm torn over this review because I had high expectations after reading all the fantastic reviews of tartine. Perhaps the things I wanted to try weren't available or not being served that day. My friend and I ended up settling on this chocolate hazelnut tart and devils chocolate cake. I think it wasn't as fresh or good because we came later in the day around 7pm, an hour before closing. It was crazy packed but we got lucky with some seats. The chocolate hazelnut tart wasn't too bad. It was rich and the hazelnuts added to the flavor and crunch. I enjoyed the devils chocolate cake but I wish it was softer or moist. It was really hard and I've had better. I also tried the carrot cake and just didnt enjoy it as it was also hard and lacked flavor. Maybe next time I'll have to come earlier to try the goods.

The line moves a lot faster than it looks, I swear.  I heard a lot of things about the morning bun, but the morning bun was seriously.. just OK. The double pan au chocolat was delicious and there really was double the amount of chocolate than ones that i've had in the past, but the real star was the lemon tart.  Zesty and citrusy in a buttery crust with freshly whipped cream? It was to die for.

Tartine is wonderful - the lemon cream, banana cream pie, and coconut tarts are divine. The lemon bars were good too. I wasn't impressed with the famed devil's food cake, though. The bakery has everything you could hope for - cakes, bars, tarts, cookies, croissants, and fresh breads. Whatever your craving, make sure you get there early in the day (they sell out often) and allow enough time to stand in line. Oh, and don't ask for decaf coffee - the staff was really rude when I made such a request!

So here's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to rent an apartment across the street from this place, and train a telescope on their kitchen.  I will wait and watch for the chocolate croissants to go into the oven, at which time I will cross the street and get in line.  If the croissants aren't out by the time I get to the register, I will pre-order, and stand patiently by until they are.  Pity the poor people in line behind me, but I suppose I *could* leave a few on the tray... The warm chocolate croissant is a mind-blowing experience. Major kudos to this bastion of butter for accommodating our Vegan friends with a carrot cake/bread that looked out of this world.

I ALWAYS come here when I visit San Francisco for their croissants. I think they have a limit to how many you can buy. It's that popular!! Everyone likes the morning buns, but I didn't think it was that special. Parking is hard to find (I usually walk two blocks after I park) and there is almost always a line, but they move pretty fast. Plus, you have distraction with the yummy-looking cakes, cookies, etc. I always meant to try the other stuff, but I'm only here about once a year, so I just play it safe and stick to the croissants. My Japanese clients told me about this place, who saw it in a guidebook recommending the croissants. So even the Japanese give this place two thumbs up! That says something!

Oh my gosh. This place was amazing. Seriously with that banana cream tart?? I died and went to heaven. The quiche and shortbread cookies are great too. Even if the line goes down the street on a Saturday morning, it actually moves relatively quickly. I was surprised at how fast I got served based on the line I stood in (maybe 10-15 minutes is all).

Love love LOVE this place. It never gets old. They are so good at what they do, and everything here is reliably delicious and amazing. I go out of my way just to eat a croissant with jam - seriously one of the best croissants I've ever had. Some of my other favorites include their giant cookie, banana cream pie, fruit tart, and morning bun. But their croissant is definitely the must-have. If you go for lunch, they have great sandwiches as well baked on their housemade bread, so you know they're going to be delicious. They are SUPER filling though, so come hungry!

What? Their "real food" is good, and not just their desserts? *Mind Blown* Everyone knows about their cakes and their tarts. Yes, their banana cream tart was amazing. Everyone also knows about their croissants. Their chocolate croissant is yummy, and a freshly made regular croissant for breakfast totally changed my life. Even my French coworker gave his approval on that one. But how many people come here to eat a full meal? Well, I just did the other day. Their croque monseiur was great. And their pressed sandwiches? Wow. Their bread is SO good, and they use super fresh ingredients, so makes the sandwich amaze-balls. Not only is it amaze-balls, but the portion size is huge, as well! So after eating most of the pressed sandwich, half a croque monseiur, some bites of the chocolate croissant, and half a banana cream tart, I walked out of there feeling rather disgusting. .....It's okay. Sometimes, disgusting is worth it.

Ahhh, the legendary Tartine. What tales I have heard about your culinary delights! The mythical tarts, the epic sandwiches, the visionary cakes! Your hallowed entryway rings with the sound of a thousand hungry San Franciscans seeking bread. OK, for serious, the stuff here is good. Not mind-blowing (like Bouchon in Las Vegas...."droool*), but very, very good. Like, "get me to eat stuff I don't normally like and actually like it" good. Case in point: the bread pudding. I hate bread. I especially hate soggy bread. Why would I ever seek out (and pay!) for a dish that involves eating soggy bread? Answer: I wouldn't. And yet, when my friend ordered this and I tried it, I was floored. It was sweet...and tasty....and didn't make me want to retch! Hallelujah! The coconut passion fruit Bavarian cake was good in theory, but bad in execution. Not sweet enough. The friand was a tad dry but tasty. I really liked the chocolate tea cake (especially since I got such a nice, thick slice), but I couldn't really taste any tea in it. And finally, the chocolate hazelnut tart was pretty much made for me, as I adore anything chocolate + hazelnut. Light, crumbly shell, fantastic cake-like filling. Mmmmm!

This place is absolutely delicious, but it is also 100% over-rated. They are able to charge whatever they want because there is constantly a line outside the door. It is, however, delicious. They do wonderfully moist and flaky croissants and their bread pudding was sweet and tasty. Go here if you want to wait in an amusement-park-style line and over-pay for wonderful sweetness. Otherwise, head downtown and try Tout Sweet in Macy's.

Needless to say, the pastries here are ridiculously amazing and easily some of the best I've had in the city. My favorites: pain au chocolat, banana creme tart, chocolate tart, morning bun, croque monsieur. Be sure to get there EARLY as the line builds rain or shine. If it's 10am on a hangover Sunday and you think it's a genius idea to hit up Tartine, just go straight to McDonalds for breakfast cuz you ain't getting into Tartine anytime soon.

Came here at 11:20AM; the timing is important because sandwiches are not available until 11:30AM! PARKING Okay, so while driving around to find parking (which was a bit difficult), we saw that there was a crazy line out the door. After we found parking a few streets over, we walked over to see most of the line had disappeared. Parking was 2 hour parking, parallel parking... circled around a few times :/ LINES It seems, the lines move fairly fast, but the line gets long and short fairly quickly. There's always people in line though. I think we were there for about 1 hour and throughout the whole time, the line always had at least 5-7 people. Keep this in mind! FOOD I skipped the pastries, which is the first section. Then the next section, had some other breads. Finally, I got to the cashier and ordered the Spicy Turkey sandwich and a mocha. Total came out to like 19.xx. Collectively, we got these: ----Spicy Turkey $13.75 - I got this and it enjoyed it. The bread is ridiculously thick though. Could have used less bread. The pesto was very unpronounced. Overall, it was a good sandwich, but not great. ----Sopressata, fontina, brocolli rabe pesto sandwich $13.50 - There was minor differences between this one and the spicy turkey. The differences were that the pesto tasted more green... or healthy? more brocolli-ish. The meat was a bit saltier, but still, too much bread. ----Mocha $4.00 - Very standard mocha in a large cup with no handle. I asked for a saucer instead. ----Pain au chocolat (bread of chocolate) - I didn't try this, but my friend said it's super super super good. Highly recommended. ----Gougere (cheese puff) - I tried this one and enjoyed it as a very basic snacking bread with cheese. I initially only wanted a bite, but the simplicity was just super refreshing and I wanted more. ----Pickled Carrots - so the sandwich plates come with delicious pickled carrots. I really liked them. They were a bit sour, with a hint of spicy. Pairs well with the sandwiches. The prices are a bit expensive, and pastries are not my thing. It was definitely a good experience, but I'm not sure if this is my kind of thing. The sandwiches take 15-20 minutes, and no sooner; they tell you that upon ordering to set your expectations. You can skip the line, if all you want is a drink. It's cash only, and there's a coffee bar on the right hand side. SEATING: Seating is super competitive and you'll have to be a hawk. Watching when people are almost done, you need to approach them and ask if you can have their seat when they're done. Multiple people will do the approach, so you gotta be quick and early. You have to be aggressive to get the seat. There is one large table for community seating. BATHROOM: When you go to the bathroom (it's a single unisex bathroom), you'll pass by the baking area. The bathroom is very clean. They have white lillies, and a really cool light above the sink. SERVICE: There really isn't much service. The guy comes out to clean the tables fairly often, and they do bring the food to you if you're eating in.

This place is so cute! You get in line to order and pay for your food. Then you have the option of eating indoors, outdoors or taking it to-go.

Try to get in here early because the line will suddenly and without warning be out the door in the blink of an eye. Came here for a quick breakfast and got the Ham and Cheese Croissant.  Quality cheese really brings out the flavor of the ham.  All of that, wrapped in a blanket of flakey carbs.  What's not to like? The Quiche looks like it'd be the most amazing thing in the world, but it's just so-so. Grab a Dark Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding to-go and treat yourself later in the day.  Just beware, sometimes it's not ready till later in the day.

I can't help but compare any bakery/dessert type place with Extraordinary Desserts in San Diego. So, I think that's why I thought Tartine's was overrated. The pastries didn't look that appealing and the Frangipane Tart I had was overly sweet. Made me a lil sick. Could've been partly my mood though.

I haven't written a review for Tartine despite how many times I've enjoyed their pastries, but after today's gorging I thought I should show some appreciation for my favorite bakery. If only it were closer and more accessible...but perhaps I would have diabetes or coronary issues if that were the case. The other drawback is that it's hard to be int he city long enough to take advantage of getting best pick for pastries but also stick around to get a loaf of their fame bread which I have not yet had a chance to try since it only comes out in the late afternoon. Sigh. Anywho, things I've tried and my thoughts: - Banana cream tart: my #1 favorite thing here. A nice crispy delicious crust thanks to the chocolate shell that keeps it from getting soggy, combined with drizzled caramel, layers of bananas, pastry cream, and whipped cream, and topped with chocolate shavings. I think it used to be $6 something and today it's now $7, which my sound steep but is worth the price for the effort that goes into it. I made this recipe following Tartine's cookbook and boy it was a lot of effort as everything down to the caramel sauce is made from scratch. I'll gladly pay the $7. - Lemon meringue tart: They had this once but I have yet to see it again...almost as delicious as the banana cream tart and the toasted meringue was so good paired with the lemon. It's basically their lemon cream tart with the meringue, so if you can't get it the lemon cream tart is good too. It seemed like a seasonal special item because usually they only have the lemon meringue cake...I will have to try a slice of that some day. - Croissants - any kind, plain or otherwise...chocolate...almond...delicious. It's really best to eat the day of...even without toasting. Seems pricey, but I know the work that goes into making croissants and would probably not make the effort in my home kitchen when Tartine's is so good. This is not your Costco's croissant. - Chocolate eclair: a good valhrona chocolate eclair. My hubby loves getting this every time. He loves the ganache like chocolate, and it has a nice vanilla-y filling. - Morning buns: I don't quite get why people were crazy over these the first time I had them. I think it's because they taste better hot and fresh. SO take yours home and toast it lightly. Just as good as their croissants with a orange-y cinnamon bun flair. If you've never had one it's like the child of a croissant and cinnamon bun. - Gougeres: Delicious esp. if you love bread and cheese, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price because I feel like I could try my hand at these at home. - Chocolate hazelnut tart: My husband loves all things chocolate so we tried this once. A solid choice and delicious but nothing that stood out compared to my other aforementioned favorites. Same goes for the frangipane tart...I'd go for the almond croissant instead as an alternative for that. - Lemon bar: I judge lemon bars by the integrity of their crust first and foremost. It can't be soggy, and it can't be flavorless or taste like flour. This is neither and has a nice thick golden brown shortbread crust with a crispy buttery flavor. The lemon curd is delicious, tart and sweet but not overly. Doesn't blow the mind but it is everything I would look for in a lemon bar. And oh how I do love lemon bars. Maybe some day I will get through every item on the menu... :)

Phenomenal Bread Pudding, and I don't even like Bread Pudding. I also really love their gougère, "Jambon Royale & Gruyère" Hot-Pressed Sandwich (Niman Ranch cured and smoked ham with Dijon on country bread), and "Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian Rectangle" (Lime-moistened genoise with passion fruit Bavarian.

3.5 stars!! Came here for lunch with my husband on a Friday afternoon and surprised to see there was no line. The bakery/café is very small and has limited seating. Luckily it wasn't busy and we were able to find a small table inside. We ordered: Prosciutto & Provolone Sandwich - Very very good, love the bread. Simple and delicious! Jambon Royale & Gruyère Sandwich - too much mustard! The Dijon mustard was very spicy and overpowered everything in the sandwich. It was like eating a spoonful of horseradish... Morning bun - wow! Best morning bun I ever had! Chocolate Croissant - It's huge! Very tasty, not too sweet. Frangipane Tart - it was alright. I thought it was on the dry side. Overall the pastries and sandwiches were good but a bit pricey IMO. Parking is also very difficult in the area. I would come back to try some other pastries if I was in the neighborhood but I wouldn't make a special trip just to come here.

Wow, this place does have amazing treats. Just a note I took from our wait time, from just past the bench outside the door to the left in the line to the first bite of food was 32 minutes. This was on a Sunday afternoon maybe around 1-2. I was certainly not impressed by all the treats, so I'll give you my rankings of what I ate. And by the way, I'm a huge baked goods and dessert aficionado. I always go out of my way to eat these for every meal rather than "real food".  I would eat 1-5 again. 1) Lemon tart 2) Cookie 3) Chocolate hazelnut tart 4) Berry scone 5) White cookie thing 6) Eclair 7) Morning bun 8) Bread pudding

When life gives you lemons, you open a bakery and make every possible thing you can with them. I'm a sucker for citrus, and this place screams it. Try everything if you can. But if you can't (i.e. don't live in SF), then make sure you at least try their lemon tarts. Their Banana Cream Tart is their most popular item, but I wanted something more citrus-y and less creamy. And that's exactly what I got! Thick slice with a hefty height factor. Ratio of lemon crust to lemon filling = 1:2.5 = perfect. Perfect amount of sweetness (not overly sweet), and the best part was it was very tart. If I want a lemon tart then dangit I want to taste the sour lemon! Nomnom. Be ready for a wait though!

Holy mother of chocolate croissants.... Yes...if you go here on the weekend there will be a long line. And if you don't wait you will kick yourself for it later. We went during the week around 10am and the line maybe took ten minutes to get through. The chocolate croissants had just come out of the oven and it was quite possibly one of the most wonderful things I've ever eaten. Seriously...I didn't know that dough was possible of being that flaky and light but in no way dry. I'm starting to salivate just thinking about it now. Everything else behind the counter looks fantastic. If you are going for a regular loaf of bread, those don't come out until 4:30 in the afternoon.

I had been to this place a couple of years ago, but I had forgotten just how good those morning buns are. Sugary, flaky, buttery, melt in your mouth goodness with a hint of orange, they are just impossible to beat in the morning or anytime. The best part is the middle that is so chewy and delicious because of the carmelized sugar on top. Yum yum yum is all I can say as this place has that bun down to a science. We also tried the almond croissant which was also good, but the morning bun is by far one of the best things I have ever eaten for breakfast. In addition, my friend mentioned that the coffee was good as well. Overall, if you are in the city, definitely go out of your way to hit this place up--you won't regret it.

Best almond croissant ever. Though customer service was pretty cold, I love to see people coming in and out all morning. I think this place is understaffed for the success that they have, so don't expect too much, just enjoy the awesome pastries!

You know a place is good when people are willing to wait in line in the cold and not leave to go elsewhere. Because there is no elsewhere. Tartine is definitely a place you must check out.  Their MORNING BUNS are amazing and have a hint of citrus.  Another item that's a must try is the CROQUE MONSIEUR...but with HAM and not TURKEY.  I got lucky today and as i was about to order the turkey since they ran out of ham, a new batch of ham sandwiches came out, and i quickly switched.  Good choice.   Also I judge a place by how good their CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS are.  The ones here are definitely amazing.  All their pastries have a great flaky outside and great taste inside. And those people complaining about the coffee...there's Ritual within walking distance and Philz a little further down!  To maximize my food exploring, i will not get my coffee fro a bakery...rather i'll get it from somewhere that specializes in coffee.  And this place definitely pulls through in terms of mastering what they are known for...pastries/baked goods.

I have a love/hate relationship with Tartine Bakery. I would give it 3.75 stars I love most everything that they bake with the one exception of the Coconut cream pie. Their lemon bars are to die for, their banana cream pie is exquisite, their savory items even turn me on. I just hate the lines, the frenetic pushing of everyone, the prowling predatory manor in which patrons peruse for seating...it really is anarchy at it's finest. I also don't like that the place is not so clean: cobwebs,used coffee cups and plates strewn all over the place. I actually , with my out of town guests , ate in my car....cleaner, less frenetic, and actually more enjoyable. My only advice is to get there at 10 when they open because by 10:30 the lines and place look like my pictures I took. Alas the problems of success.

The baked goods are truly delicious but a bit overpriced. You will pay for the hype but I still recommend trying their pastries. There is going to be a line in the morning and during lunch, so go in late afternoon if you want to avoid the wait. I had the pain au jambon, which is a ham croissant sandwich. This savory pastry is made with tasty niman ranch smoked ham in a fresh buttery croissant with a little gruyere cheese. So flaky and delicious. A must-have. I also tried the Frangipane tart which was a great complement to the pain au jambon. It's a sweet pastry with almond cream filling and topped with dried fruit. I want to try their sandwiches next because I heard their bread is bomb.

I've been here a couple times, probably my 5th or 6th time before writing this review. Every time I've visited Tartine, I've always been satisfied. The place is always packed, with a small line winding outside. Their pastries and baked goods are solid orders. I've tried a decent amount of their selection, most recently their eclairs and brioche pudding (again, as always). Their eclairs were really good - solid layer of chocolate on top, with a light, semi-viscous custard filing. So delightful to eat. The brioche pudding was really good, considering I've ordered it every time I've visited Tartine. The brioche adds to the sweetness of  the pudding, also resulting a lovely spongy texture. The fruit (esp the cranberries) atop the pudding add a contracting tart flavor to the whole thing. All in all, just a solid place to visit, whether for lunch or just to grab a dessert. :)

I go for Chad Robertson's bread... I'd buy his book to make my own, but the ambience is rather attractive sandwiched by Valencia and the Park you'll find Tartine Bakery bustling with people.  The crossants are amazing, but often too large for my appetite.  The coffee leads a little to be desired.  Generally, you should know the NYTimes foodie, Mark Bitman, never visits SF without stopping here.

I had a free afternoon to wander the city so I decided to go visit the Mission and maybe make a stop by Dolores Park for some people watching. On my way, I decided to check out Tartine because I've heard such good things about it! At about 2pm, all the tables were full of people chatting with their drinks or even their lunch. I decided to grab one of their famous Banana Cream Tarts to-go as a snack in the park. For $7, I got myself a mini Banana Cream Tart that was anything but mini. Once I opened up my to-go box in the park, I knew I had quite a feat ahead of me. Topped with large chocolate shavings was a giant heap of whipped cream. It was light and fluffy, but wayyy too much whipped cream. At first I was a bit disappointed, but then I got down to the bananas. The bananas mixed with the cream and then the whipped cream as I lifted it up out of the tart was perfection. As I made my way down towards the bottom I discovered a layer of caramel that just added to the flavor. I almost didn't even eat the crust until I saw that it had a layer of dark chocolate coating the inside. I figured I got that far, I might as well go all the way and devour the crust, too. It was a nice flaky crust that fell apart in your mouth with each bite. Maybe the banana cream overpowered the crust, but I felt it didn't even have that buttery taste I'm used to from pasty crusts. I think if I were to do it again (oh, and I would!), I'd skip the whipped cream and go straight for the bananas, cream, and caramel, leaving the chocolate coated crust aside. I also hear their morning buns are pretty bomb. I guess I'll have to leave that for my next trip to the Mission!

I give 5 stars for the morning bun and the taste of the other desserts and breads, but detract a star since it's always such effort (long line) to get the food.  I've even been on a tuesday at noon and had to wait in line.  My wife and I walk our dogs by on a regular basis and if the line is short we'll get in line to get something just because there's no line.

I've been to many French bakeries in the Bay Area, tasted many excellent pastries and many atrocious ones as well (ahem...Costco monster croissants). Although I've lived in San Francisco for over 20 years, it wasn't until today that I stepped through the doors of Tartine. I sampled the morning bun, the gougere, and the ham croissant. Everything was incredibly flaky. I heard the crunch of autumn leaves in every bite, and I was convered in shards of pastry flakes when I finally finished eating. This is how it should be! If it doesn't crunch and flake, it deserves to be in the trash. Costco is a waste of butter and flour. Tartine's prices are double that of most French bakeries I've been to, where croissants are usually $2-3. At Tartine, the morning bun was almost $4, and the ham croissant was $5.50. However, it is a pretty generously sized pastry, and it does taste two times better than in other bakeries so the price is somewhat justified.

"Say bye to Auntie, she's going to visit bread" That's what my brother told my 4 yr old niece in Chinese when I left his place in Chino, to drive 6 hrs to Tartine on my most recent trip to LA. I found a promo video for the Tartine Bread cookbook a couple of years ago and thought this is exactly how I feel about bread, I have to go there. http://vimeo.com/14354661 I drove up from Chino early one Saturday morning, got there an hour before the bread came out of the oven. I ordered a morning bun and latte and waited patiently. I had read about their morning bun in Monocle magazine. #8 on their 50 things to improve your life, and it didn't disappoint. It had layers and a bread like texture similar to a croissant but the cinnamon swirls of a cinnamon bun with a hint of orange. Definitely worth a try! And the latte was perfectly prepared. Then I got back in line for bread. The line was just out the door and it's probably not something you want to be doing every weekend for bread but there were many locals that said they'll pop in line when they pass by or when they're planning a special meal. By the time I left the line up was around the block. I brought 4 different loaves of bread, walnut, sesame, oat, and their traditional loaf. I took the still warm loaves to a friend's place and the upon first bite I'd say it wasn't as good as I was expecting, maybe I had built it up too much in my head but it was almost too sour and wet? It did have a wonderful chewy texture that you don't get from modern over processed bread and was still one of the best store bought breads I've ever had. However in the days to come the bread mellowed a bit in sourness, and kept and toasted amazingly well. I brought it back with me to LA the following day, flew with it to Vancouver a few days later and it was still delicious. I kept it in a ziplock bag. I had to eat some of it first as the loaves are pretty big and wouldn't fit in a bag whole. I've never seen a bread keep so well. And as far as grilled cheeses go, it makes the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had. I also loved all the bread lovers that I got to chat with in line and while seated. It was like a meeting place for bread lovers. Overall, if I lived in SF I probably wouldn't go to Tartine every weekend, but I would make the trip and wait each time I visit SF tho I may just get it take away to avoid the crowds.

Tartine has a cookbook & is a neighborhood favorite. But for someone who lives out of the way, it's not a must Go-to place. Its creme pie are yummy and different, because the base is a flaky pastry, rather than flaky dough & the filling is organic. So it's yummy and different. The cakes are eye-rape worthy & delicious - but forgettable. The pastries taste unique & special, but don't expect "french pastry" authenticity. Overall, great neighborhood bakery for all your special occasion & bread needs. But not necessary to waste gas & drive 30miles to just eat here. (Great if it's part of a SF day trip)

If this were Paris, Tartine might be a serviceable neighborhood bakery (with the caveat that nobody would go there, because only a fool would pay $4 for a croissant in Paris.)  Alas, we're in San Francisco, and there are few retailers of decent pastries, let alone any in the hipster capital of the universe, where free time and cash vastly exceeds the supply of common sense.  So, Tartine it is. That said, I still can't get behind an establishment where I feel as though every purchase comes with a complimentary punch in the face, whether for the (lack of) service, the prices (hello, $4 croissant), or -- not least of all -- the other customers, who have apparently been driven mad from hunger during the half-hour wait, and have turned to Lord of the Flies for etiquette lessons (who jumps a line of 30+ people to "hold" a table for their party of three bobo friends?  Who *does* that?) The bottom line is that Tartine always leaves me disappointed and a little sad for humanity.  No pastry is worth that.

Oh Tartine. Everything they say is true. So, so good. I've never stayed to eat because it is always so busy and the super hipsters intimidate  me, but it well worth the crowd to get a piece of this place. Historically I would get the lemon tarte, but having moved back from France I was desperate to find a decent croissante. I got the pain au chocolat this week. It was darn tasty, let me tell you! Was it like my experience in France? 4/5 stars on that, but very, very close. And considering this is the U.S. with American ingredients, darn good. The bottom line: You'll be sorry if you don't wait in line and get some food here.

If you ever want to go here on a weekend, get there EARLY. By 9 a.m. there's a line out the door and around the block for their loaves of fresh-baked bread and savory pastries. I'm a fan of their Croque Madame. It's small (a one-slice wonder) but it's rich enough to be seriously filling. They also have one of the best chais in town.

You KNOW this place is good when you live in New York and 4 of your friends independently recommend Tartine when you ask for recommendations on where to eat in SF. The Frangipane Croissant was wonderful... crackly, flakey, light pastry was like pillow on the inside. LOVE the added almond slivers in the filling. The double pan au chocolate was rich and not too sweet and yes, they do bake their croissants to a dark brown crust, but that what makes it crackle! I would've enjoyed the bread pudding (made light and not too dense with brioche, yum!) but they put a ton of fresh cranberries in for the thanksgiving season. A little too tart for me, but hey! The line for take out reached from the register at the back of the restaurant  to the front of the door and took about 15 minutes. Tip: Get it with a cup of tea and head over to Dolores Park for a brunch or snack under the sun.

This review is bittersweet because I'm just visiting San Francisco and am trying to come to terms that I will have to leave Tartine behind in a few days. This place is a revelation. The ham and cheese croissant is enormous, and extremely filling and gratifying. I've eaten one for breakfast and lasted all the way to dinner. The atmosphere is equal parts adorable and snobby (or "hipster") but whatever, it works. Not a great place to linger, but an excellent place to get delicious and satisfying pastries. I absolutely need a chocolate tart before I leave. It's so hard to say goodbye, Tartine!

Tartine Bakery hardly needs another review. The bread here might be the best anywhere outside of Europe. The sweets are excellent too. And, so is the quiche. It's also a cozy fun place to sit down. The downsides are that it's super packed and loud with enormous lines in the morning and the employees are often snooty mission hipsters who act like space cadets and are unpleasant to deal with. The sweet time to visit is in the evening. Now that's a hot tip for my fellow yelpers. Don't make me regret sharing it!

I only managed to come here once before moving out of the city. Super sad, because I wish I could come here every weekend. We did it up good for our one and only time here: We tried the prosciutto and provolone sandwich, chocolate croissant , the famous morning bun (the last one! we could barely contain our excitement), hot chocolate, a latte, and an aranciata. Some tips: the sandwich was 3 halves, so plan accordingly! You don't have to stand in the super long line for something from the espresso bar, but it's cash only. The seating is the usual: always full up, but it's not unusual to stalk someone for their soon-to-be-vacated seats. Love it, and I recommend you go there, even if the line is out the door and it's freezing.

Meh! That's the short version. We should have listened to our hosts who warned us the hyperbole was unfounded but we didn't.  Here's my self important long version. For a fairly famous bakery with multiple published cookbooks, it feels as though there should be more substance here. Generally if something has a lot of acclaim or renown, the reason for those accolades can be easily seen whether one appreciates them personally or not. We never felt that. I've only eaten at a handful of bakeries in San Francisco, yet I'm fairly certain that they're are dozens, likely hundreds of similar establishments That are equally good or better in the city. I'd put money on it, at least a crisp new twenty dollar bill. They're noted for their breads and for their pastries here. Not sure why. They're certainly serviceable, some things were even tasty but nothing we nibbled on here made a memory that lasted longer than a few minutes out the door. Not sure how that qualifies for a book deal, much less a second one. The books look lovely, to be honest I almost bought one before I ever set foot in the bakery. Glad I saved my money. We opted for whichever pastries they server behind the glass recommended. We split a sandwich. We sat wondering what all the hooplah was about, wondering why people were lining up for something so mundane. A few weeks later, and one prematurely deleted note later, the only memorable thing I can recall was a nicely done Orange Morning Bun. It was quite delightful, not as good as the Salt's Cure version here in LA, but worth trying. If there isn't a line.

Came here about one hour before its closing time. Not much of the pie is available. Tried the seasonal fruit pie with almond. It is fruity, yet with crunchy almond pieces, it mixed together wonderful. Consider the last hour before store closing the pie is still fresh and tasty as it was just baked, I think this bakery is worth for second visit and try others.

I can understand why Tartine always has a line out the door. I came here initially for the morning bun since it's been on the 7x7 list for years. It's a delicious morning bun, but the real star for me is the banana cream tart which is the best pastry (of any kind) that I have ever had. I still want to try the frangipane croissant since I'm an almond fiend but it's been sold out every time that I've visited.

I recently visited Tartine Bakery, under the impression that I was about to eat one of the best croissants in the Bay Area. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The croissant seemed to have a puffy inside, lacking in crispiness. Sure, I was happy to find that it was plenty buttery, but it seemed like a nice piece of bread. Fortunately, this disappointment was mitigated when I gave it another opportunity five seconds later - we had also purchased a loaf of bread, which ended up being the best bread I've had lately. It had much taste, slightly sour on the inside, soft, and very crunchy and crispy crusts. It was wonderful. Needless to say, I feel a bit of cognitive dissonance now, because I really do want to like this place and we ended up waiting maybe 20 minutes, so not too long for this place, but the croissants were blatantly lackluster - maybe it was a bad day for them. I'd really like to try another, but for the price, I'm not really sure, because it may or may not be another poor croissant experience. The bread ended up being an excellent investment, and it's awesome, because they make limited number of these per day, on a given day and at a certain time they release them. They happened to sell them when we were there. I'm thankful that we waited and gave it a try, because the surrounding area did not seem too promising. There's too much sketchy business in the area. Food: 3.5/5. Bread was superb, while croissants lacked finesse. Service: 3/5. Atmosphere: 4/5. Quaint. Value: 2/5. Expensive.

I'm generally not a dessert person (I would rather order another appetizer than dessert) but this place could eventually make me a convert. Awhile back, my friend brought a banana cream tart back to the south bay which I got to try. I was impressed by how good it was and surprised by how much I liked it. So when I finally visited this place for the first time, I was looking to get myself some more of that banana cream tart. Sadly, they had run out of those for the day. :( I had to settle for the coconut cream tart which turned out pretty good and was comparable to the banana version. I would definitely come back here and try to get my hands on one of those again.

I ordered a sopressata and broccoli rabe sandwich. It came with 3 half sandwiches which didn't expect but it was flavorful and each bite kept me wanting more. I also tried a bite of their turkey sandwich which was pleasantly peppery. Their latte was pretty good as well.  After lunch, I got a little carried away with ordering the pastries that were displayed in the glass case. Everything looked so great that I couldn't decide on what to get and now I have enough pastries to last me through the whole week.

Don't go here! It's so overrated! Go somewhere else people! ... Are they gone yet? Oh good, now I can enjoy this place all by myself. Tartine is so incredibly legit. We stood in a fairly fast-moving line on a Saturday afternoon to get the goods - morning buns, a chocolate-hazelnut tart, and the bread pudding. The morning buns were like croissant-dough sprinkled with sugar and in the center, gooey caramel goodness. And that bread pudding - so rich, eggy, and moist, topped with fruit compote. All were superb, and there were so many more items that I would want to return to try: quiche, lemon bars, scones, and on and on. This is a deserving foodie destination spot.

Umm but instead you can witness interesting things while you wait in a 15-20 min line (normal for a weekend) for unforgettable bake goods! While in line I saw a huge tree branch in front of the store almost crush a car, a human statue pass by acting like a tourist, and met really excited tourists from NYC. Then finally it was my turn! I got my favorite things~ morning buns, almond & cocoa nib rocher, and a croque monsieur! The banana cream tart is okay and the authentic green iced tea was too bitter for me. But other things people have recommended to me that I will try next time is their  bread budding and the tres leche cake!

Highlights of this meal: - Bread pudding - Latte - Hot chocolate - Pastrami sandwich with gruyere and horseradish - The tiny, pickled spicy carrots :P Drawbacks of this meal: - Trying to find indoor seating (together) for 8 people Funniest moment of this meal: - Waiter mistaking our comforter (meant for picnicking in Dolores park) for a bum's blanket, picking it up with gloves, making a disgusted face, stuffing it in a garbage bag, and almost throwing it away

BEST CROISSANT EVER!!! If only they shipping option so I can have it here in SD!!! FOOD: MMmMmM Butter CrOISSANT the best I've had. Crispy and Flaky on the outside and oh so soft and flavor in the inside and it's HUGE! $3.50 for a Croissant that really filled me up. If we weren't on a schedule to travel I would have spend more time there to try the quiches and other bake goods. AMBIANCE: causal, simple chic with high ceiling. There were a line leading up to the register where you order and pay, then you can find your own seating. I believe I also see booze. I can totally see it as my Weekend chilaxing kinda place. SERVICE: We just order to go so all the service we got was from the guy that get the bread for us and the girl at the register lol, But were nice and friendly. PRICE: A little pricey in compare to other bakery, but the quality of the food is so good that I think it's totally worth it! I CAN"T wait to come back to SF just for Tartine!

When you're going through a break-up, you are totally allowed to eat as many sweets as you want. No questions asked. No judgements...right? Right. My best friend wanted to grab some pastries and thought there was no better opportunity, than my wanting to eat my feelings, to splurge a bit and go to Tartine. This wasn't my first time having pastries from Tartine, but it was my first time actually going into their bakery. On a Tuesday afternoon, there was absolutely no wait...SCORE! Normally, there is a huge line out the door for days so this was such a "treat". I've already had their banana cream tart, which they are famously known for, so I wanted to try something else. Their fresh fruit tart immediately caught my eye so I ordered that. It was made with blackberries, which were extremely fresh and juicy, and the cream was really sweet and light. The perfect cure for a broken heart. I've had pastries from many different local bakeries in the city, but Tartine has that "certain something" that keeps you coming back for more. It truly is a gem in the heart of the Mission.

Go here for the pastry, not the sandwiches. The bread pudding tastes great but the sandwiches are rather oily. Really no place to sit here so plan to get your goodies to go. Very famous place so the line is out the door and generally 1 block out.

Enjoyed the food and the atmosphere but not the lines. Actually, we got there around 3 PM, so the line for food wasn't that intimidating. It snaked around half the store but moved quick. What I'm complaining about is the single bathroom in the back, which had a shorter yet longer-wait line for it. Those girls in front of me were taking their sweeeeeet time. After reading Yelp reviews, I had my mind set on a morning bun. But the downside of arriving at 3 PM is that they'll probably run out of their most popular item. I asked the lady for a time estimate of depletion, and she said they usually run out around 1 - 1:30 PM. In its place I ordered the BREAD PUDDING in a cup for $4, total was $4.34. The bread pudding (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) was pretty good. But it was burnt on top! Is that normal? In any case, I discovered that bread pudding wasn't my favorite dessert item because of its texture--it's incredibly mushy for my tastes (I guess it really is a bread-pudding, but to me it was like eating sweetly soggy bread with a burnt top, which clashed even more). By nature, the bread was very moist, and the seasonal fruit of cinnamon apples were sweet, perhaps too sweet given the sweetness of the bread. This was my first time eating bread pudding, and although I don't like it, I figured that this would be the best place for me to have tried it. My friends ordered the TRES LECHES CAKE slice, which was subtly sweet! It's soaked in 3 types of milk, which surprisingly gave it a slight coffee undertone. It too is very mushy but not so much as the bread pudding. I loved the layers of the cake, especially the top layer. They also ordered the LEMON MERINGUE CAKE slice, which had too much of both extremes: sharply sweet and sour. I enjoyed the moistness of it though, along with the cream on top. Aside from the bakery items, we experienced the ordeal of some crazy ladies who demanded that my friend to save their spots at the table while they stood in line... No thanks. I will more likely than not drag another friend to come back with me so as to give the morning bun, ham and cheese croissant, and the banana cream tart fair shots!

The Tartine hype is a bit out of control. I instinctively already want to three-star this place and just leave my review at that. On any given day, there's going to be a line. Sometimes, especially on weekends, it's out the door and snakes around the block. There's a communal table, super pricey baked goods, and Dolores Park is a mere block away - basically, everything is very hipster-bougie (it IS the gentrified side of the Mission, after all). However, marked-up prices and crowds be damned, almost everything here is really delicious. Their famous banana cream tart is delightful, their breads are freshly baked and the scent saliva inducing. And that freaking morning bun. BEST morning bun of my life. It is worth fighting wars over. A light, crispy orange glaze on its exterior, and a buttery soft fluffy interior. The morning bun is the perfect, long-lasting fairytale marriage of a cinnamon bun and a croissant. The hype, lines, and prices are two stars. The products themselves are more or less four stars. The morning bun? Like, six stars. Well, there you have it.

Excellent lemon tart. Giant sandwiches that are toasted and deliciously greasy, like the best, most expensive grilled cheese you'll ever have (OK not most expensive, but $12 for a cheese sandwich is def on the pricey side). I wanted to try the banana cream tart but they were sold out by 3pm on a Saturday. Not a fan of the 20-min line and then the 20-min wait for our sandwiches, don't come here if you're in a hurry.

Tartine is amazing on so many levels. Of course the pastries are great - as is well known. But they aren't that expensive. What prevents it from being a five star experience is the insufferable lines. Maybe going here first thing in the morning on a weekday - or mid afternoon? - might avoid that, but so far I've had no luck. Would it be that hard for them to have a window stall for 2 or 3 items? Or a cash only line or something that would allow for a quicker egress/ingress? Second, the coffee is just above average: but in this day coffee is now screamingly good. Tartine's coffee is a weak sister in this day and age of Starbucks and in a city with amazing coffee (from Blue Bottle to Philz) around every corner.

The almond tart is AMAZING! It's a pretty busy place, but the pastries are really good. I definitely recommend the Quiche, its really warm and tasty for the cold SF mornings. I was kind of sad that they didn't have certain items on their menu served until a certain time (because we came super early), but the experience was very toasty :)

Tartine is famous for good reason, and I knew I had to try the morning bun when I went. The line was out the door, but the wait was short, and it was while standing by the pastry case waiting to order that i had my big internal dilemma: "WAIT, those savory pastries look SO GOOD. But I have to get the morning bun..." Naturally, I got both. After scarfing them down standing on the sidewalk, I have to say that the morning bun is half-overrated (half, because the chewy inside is SUPERB, but the outside of mine was too crunchy and the orange glaze gave it the consistency of a candy), but the savory pastry (the grougere) I got was fantastic, light and flavorful. Savory: the secret of doing Tartine right.

Lemme preface this by saying that I carried hugeee expectations for Tartine. Like almost unsurmountable. I was so excited to eat here that I dragged the bf here early on a Sunday because we had lunch plans but I wanted to fit in a quick breakfast. We waited in line for about 20 minutes before it was time for us to order. We split a bowl of bread pudding, but felt it would be a shame to wait so long for only that, so we also got some morning buns and a chocolate croissant to go. After all that waiting and hype, I tried their famous bread pudding and it was...just okay. I think it would do better with a creme based sauce instead of the caramel sauce that it came with, and it would also be more delicious with almost any other fruit than what we had, which was apples I think (berries and/or peaches would've made it phenomenal). The texture is what I like in a bread pudding -- light and airy, which is often hard to find in most places -- but it wasn't as good as M. Henry's in Chicago. I ate my morning bun the following day and that was just okay too. It was good and all, but also super buttery and did not taste like it was worth the calories. Overall, Tartine may just not be my style. I like interesting desserts with some flair, while Tartine specializes in classics (hence their banana cream pie and lemon bars). While their classic offerings are solid, I still don't understand the hype.

I live across the street and the smells come wafting out in the mornings, tempting me with every intense morsel. The croissants are to die for (and weigh about 2 lbs. each), the daily bread pudding is always melt in your mouth, the gougeres are light and fluffy but full of complex flavors...I could go on and on. The line out front will tell you that people take this place very seriously. At least...when it comes to bakeries. Just go early, and go often and you'll be a happy person.

Food: 3 Decor: 4 Service: 4 Came here around 10am Sunday and waited about 15 min in line. Ordered the pain au chocolat, morning bun, and bread pudding. Bread pudding was pretty good, although it was a bit more eggy than I anticipated, and I think berries would have been better than apple. I had the morning bun the next evening after toasting it up again, but it wasn't nearly as good as it would have been fresh.

The coffee is good, but it's maybe 75th percentile in the mission, where the bar is really high. The breakfast pastries here, amazing. The ham+cheese croissant is just fantastic. Most pastries are more-browned on the outside than you might expect, but the insides are cooked properly. It's a preference thing. Usually quite a line, though.

Tartine Bakery no longer serves Chai Tea Lattes due to reasons unknown. SADNESS! I loved having a big cup of spicy tea milk with pastries in the morning. I was feeling down about it, but things quickly rebounded. I ordered one eclair togo thinking I was too full to order more. WRONG. It was my first time having their eclair and it's the best damn thing they serve. Morning Bun, Gougere, double pain au chocolat...you're OLD NEWS. The pastry was baked to perfection. It still held it's shape and texture. There's nothing worse than mushy, wet pastry. The semi-bittersweet chocolate coating was so yummy and balanced out the sweetness of the custard. The eclair was filled with a beautiful vanilla bean custard (see photo). I was licking it off my fingers...with ZERO SHAME. Get the eclair. Delicious! http://www.yelp.com/user…

BEST... BUTTERY... BIG... CROISSANTS... EVER. 'Nuff said. lol.. I kid. But their croissants are hands-down the best damn baked good I have ever scarfed down so quickly. So buttery... So flaky and HUGE! If you want the best croissant in San Francisco (and quite possibly EVER), then stop reading this review and get your butt over to Tartine. The croissants sell out towards late afternoon so it's best to get there in the morning. The line is always out the door and around the building and for good reasons. The display of their oh-so charming breakfast goodies makes you feel like a kid in a candy store. Staring into the glass, you'll find yourself drooling all over. You've got your cakes, your tarts, your fruits, your muffins, bread puddings, a variety of freshly baked breads, quiches... The list goes on. I have also tried their Lemon Tarts (I always grab one when I can), Banana Cream, Lemon Bar... And a few more that I can't really remember. But I ALWAYS... ALWAYS grab a croissant if I can. It is absolutely CRUCIAL. The seating inside gets a little cramped so get there early if you'd like to eat on location! I need to make my way over there again to try some of their sandwiches and other desserts. I'm sure I'll fall in love with everything there. Definitely a gem worth checking out in the city.

By far, my favorite place in the city for meeting up with friends for coffee and baked goods.  The croque monsieur is large enough to share and oh-so-filling, that you'll be glad you did. The croissants are perfect, buttery goodness.  Tartine is also the perfect place to pick up dessert for dinner with friends.  The lemon meringue cake is fantastic -so tangy and delicious.  Don't let the line scare you.  It's worth the wait.  The dining area gets full.  The larger tables are shared so scoot on over and let someone else sit with you!

MMMMMMM carbs. Tartine really knows what they're doing when it comes to sandwiches and baked goods! My favorite sandwich is the prosciutto and provolone, and their bread alone is SOOOO good. All of the pastries are great, and they have a wide selection. My only complaints are the long wait and the customer service. The line is always terribly long, which kind of deters me from going there, especially if I'm just looking for a sandwich. The staff kind of has an attitude, but I guess that's to be expected when you're in the mission?

The bread is the highlight here - it's available fresh at 4:30 pm daily, and is excellent.  The tarts are also good, particularly the lemon and the banana cream.  Since the sandwiches are made using their homemade bread, I'm a fan of these as well, though they're fairly pricey at $12 a pop and involve a 20-minute wait.  Everything else - their pastries, pies, and pudding - are definitively mediocre.

I'd like to give the customer service one star and their morning bun six. If you can get past all the assholes with attitude behind the counter, you'll find getting up and standing in line at 7:20 is worth it once you bite into a warm buttery morning bun with a tinge of orange. I'd suggest also indulging in a flakey almond croissant and the daily fluffy flavor packed quiche. Don't bother with the cookies. But be prepared for the too cool for school attitude behind all the counters from the whole staff. It's a lot to take so early in the morning.

Always my first stop the morning after I arrive in San Francisco. I get there early and try to be like among the first few in line to get a table and usually end up chatting with interesting people. Everything I have tried at Tartine is great but my favorite is the fresh and hot bread pudding with seasonal fruit. Their morning bun is the best I have had (second best is from the baker at the Alameda Farmers Market on Sat mornings).

Many of the pastries here are above average, but I can't say there is anything destination worthy about this bakery - there are numerous shops in the city that offer much better tarts, cakes/entremets, and pastries for the same prices. The morning bun is great when its fresh when you get there, otherwise it's nothing special, and simply not worth getting. Aside from their banana cream tart, the rest of their selection is fairly standard and unremarkable - their croissants tend to be overbaked on the outside, sometimes to the point of being almost burnt. Their interpretation of Tres Leches cake left much to be desired - the cake wasn't very moist (How can Tres Leches not be?) despite being soaked. Despite having such stellar bread, their Croque Monsieur was fairly disappointing. Served as a tartine (of course), the sandwich seemed to lack cohesion as the ratios of each ingredients were off - as such, all the components on the plate were off balance and didn't come together during a single bite. For the most part, this San Francisco "institution" doesn't seem to live up to all its hype.

I may naturally be biased towards cutesy cafes, but I think this place truly deserves the 5 star rating! Although it required a trek to the Mission (basically a part of SF where it's kinda ghetto and where there isn't much to do), a loooong wait in line, and was difficult to find seating in the tiny space... IT WAS WORTH IT. Here's what we ordered: *Lemon tart - so smooth and silky! I've never quite had anything like this before! They were able to cut the tartness from the lemon with just a little bit of smooth cream, which allowed the perfect crust to really stand on its own. Superb! *Banana cream tart - what??? How?! How is this SOOO good??!!?! I don't think I can ever eat a banana cream tart anywhere else again. First, the cream is super subtle and perfectly whipped. Second, they use dark chocolate shavings, which give you just the right amount of chocolate, while allowing the fresh bananas to really stand out. They add a bit of caramel into the tart, which also really enhances the banana flavor, but doesn't overpower the overall flavor. Everything blends together so perfectly and surprisingly, the tart isn't all that sweet, which I'm a huge fan of! Seriously, a true symphony in my mouth. But I digress... *Ham Quiche - yum!!! If you haven't figured it out already, their crust is just superb here. Makes sense, considering they specialize in bread! I absolutely loved this because they had TONS of thin layers of flaky crust all throughout the quiche. The flavors were also really good and rustic. You can't really go wrong with this! *Jambon Royale & Gruyère sandwich - I guess we were on a ham roll because we decided to order this sandwich w/ smoked ham and dijon on country bread. At first, I really thought it was plain and overpriced (think $13-14!), but it was well worth it. Once again, their bread blew me away. So crusty and flavorful! The portion size was also really generous. Even though this was good, I would probably still try to stick to the sweets and the quiche because I feel like you'll be able to save more room to try some of their other goodies, considering how thick this sandwich is! *Coffee - ummm, SUPER GOOD. We ordered lattes, which came served in cool bowls, with no handles! A bit hard to hold, but I definitely appreciate the refined concept. Wow, wow, wow. I really wanted to try pretty much EVERYTHING at Tartine, considering their display cases are sooooo amazing. Unfortunately, I just couldn't make enough room in my tummy for everything! But I hope to be back someday soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)

Came here many times.. Most of their pastries were average. For some reason their mocha is serve in a huge cup, pastries are in huge slices, but really tiny mini cup of cappuccino, not a complain, just curious. Some of the things I remembered: Lemon Meringue Cake - tasty the first three bites, a bit too rich for me, I would prefer if the proportion of the lemon cream to cake is lower, the slice is huge I can only eat 1/3 slice each time. (Again my cup of mini tiny cappuccino, tasty though) Gougere (spelling not sure) - The texture is very "unique," I like the taste not a real fan of the texture. Open face sandwich with cheese and ham - pretty tasty, but again too big for me to finish in one sitting. Peach Crumble - It's alright, I can finish about 1/3. I like their cappuccino, aromatic, full body, smooth, but a bit bitter and it's tiny. Not sure why this place is rated so high, I come here mainly because my friend always ended up taking me here if it is too early for dinner. I rate this place average. Parking - Alright Service - Counter Seats - Alright

I've been tartinized. I've heard so many good things about this place that I had to come and try it for myself. This is definitely one of the best pastries I've ever had. I walked in thinking I was going to buy one piece of pastry, but instead walked out with four. Got there right when it opened at 7:30 am on a Thursday and there was already a line in front of the shop. Decor is simple and sweet: quaint. Perfect for a good cup of coffee and breakfast. Bought two regular croissants, one lemon almond tea cake, and a buttermilk scone with currants. Everything was delicious: fresh out of the oven, buttery and light to the touch, and fragrant. I'm a big fan of currants and when I took a bite out of the scone, it was like a perfect biscuit with currants. The croissants were very buttery and light. Per the recommendation of one of the employees, the lemon almond tea cake was one of the best combinations I've had. I've never been a big fan of lemon cake, but this one really hit the spot. Needless to say, I didn't get to save very much to share with the family when I got home. My co-workers and I tore through the batch. Bon appetite!

I was really excited for this place after reading so many positive reviews and just seeing all the delicious photos being posted. Came at a good time - around 2-3pm so there was virtually no line. Parking was okay. I'm thinking at this point that I'm pretty damn lucky and today is my day! I spoke too soon.   Tartine was a big fail. Over rated. Over priced. Ordered the: 1) Devils Food Cake - this was very rich and would have been good if it was fresh, but it wasn't moist at all.  Kind of a bit dry.  Definitely not worth the price. I think I could have gotten better from Safeway. Now that is pretty sad! 2) Banana cream -  this was okay.  It was good, but it wasn't amazing. Sorry, I just expect a lot from a place that has 4 stars after thousands of reviews :(  The crust part was good and so was the cream, but overall, it's not something that I would crave. 3) Bread Pudding - HA HA HA. alright. 4) Ham and Cheese Croissant - This was the best croissant that I've ever had.  From the flake crust to it's flavor. I was really pleased with this purchase out of the 4. So I tried 4 things and I only like one after factoring in cost, hype, and actual taste.  Everything came out to be about $26 bucks which is a LOT for just pastries. Would I come here again? Maybe for the croissant, but I honestly, probably never will again just because it's over hyped, over priced, and I may not be as lucky next time and have to wait in line for just "ok" pastries.

This is one of my favorite french bakeries of all time! I love everything in this store. I was deeply surprised to see the imense number of reviews for this place and the last time that I was in SF, my friend just wanted me to see the place but we unable to order anything as the line was out the door! This second visit to SF, I wanted to check out the bakery again. So this second time, we came during the week and in the afternoon (before people got out of work). There was still a line but it wasn't out the door, so I figured that I could give it a try. My friend circled around for parking for 30 minutes and we eventually gave up trying to find parking. I suggested that she parked in the loading zone and I run in to pick up some stuff that looked good. When I got in, everything looked good. I couldn't help myself but bought 5 items for us two girls. I bought two tartines, both of which wre amaaaaaazinnngggg. AMAZING!! I can't wait to come back here on my next trip!

If I could sum up my Tartine experience in one word I would, but I know you guys want to know more. So for your sake and my want to relive Tartine, I will write a full review ;) Parking took forever, but YES, it is worth it because you can walk over to Bi-Rite as well :) The line was almost out the door by the time we got there. My mum was eyeing a table like a hawk 'ready to pounce cos that's the only way to get things done. I lined up and got the items everyone was raving about: morning bun and banana cream tart. I was at the register when my mum insisted (with much force ) on trying the croque monsieur. They heated up the sandwich and brought it to our table shortly. Morning bun was alright..it wasn't warm and gooey so I was a tad disappointed but I saw the potential on how it was a Tartine regular's staple. Spicy turkey croque monsieur-I'm glad they heated it up! Bread was soft, not too spicy, and there was a generous amount of turkey and sundried tomatoes. I don't remember what else was on it, but it's worth a try. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… And the best for last: Banana cream tart. WOW. Amazing. MAGNIFICENT. From the chocolate shavings to the salted caramel hidden under the mass expanse of delicious light cream....I've been craving ever since I left. PLEASE get this and tell me you feel the same way as I did after that tart entered my mouth. Maybe I'm over exaggerating--but just get it regardless :) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Mum and bf ordered a latte. Great coffee and I'm not a coffee drinker because I like that sickeningly sweet with gallons of milk. So why does my opinion matter? Because I just know it's great coffee. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… My goal is to recreate the banana cream tart and relive those tasty bites of heaven. http://www.yelp.com/biz_…

I am in LOVE with the HAM + GRUYERE CROISSANT. It's not like your usual bakeries where pastries have been sitting out for hours. The ones at Tartine are still warm and fresh out of the oven at the time of purchase! I also tried the MORNING BUN since everyone raves about it so much, but I'm not a huge fan of it. Yeah, yeah, boo me if you want, but it tasted like a orange-flavored cinnamon twist. I don't particularly enjoy citrus flavored pastries. I ordered a SOY LATTE and it was pretty average. I love the giant saucer it was served in. People-watching was fun as we ate at the tables outside. Water is self-serve behind the cashier. I want to return to try the OLIVE + GRUYERE LOAF and the CROQUE MONSIEUR!

Wonderful bakery that has lots of good things to choose from. However, they are pricey, so get your wallet ready. Since it was my first time, I figured, why not try everything they are known for? I ordered a 6 inch chocolate souffle cake 2 chocolate friands (chocolate dipped triangle cookies) 2 chocolate chip cookies 1 morning bun total was $52.00 Everything was delicious! I would definitely return.

After basically being sugar and all-things-tasty deprived for 12 weeks, I decided to overindulge this past weekend and break my Tartine cherry. Initially, seeing the line was disheartening, mainly because I was doing the potty dance after enjoying some nice bottomless mimosas at 9am in the morning (quick tip: they got a bathroom!). But the line moves quickly and it's honestly worth the wait.  I ordered myself up a banana cream tart, a mixed berry bread pudding, and a coconut macaroon. I wish I could go into detail about what my taste buds experienced but I blacked out from the sugar high. I take it that I really liked what I got.

Tartine has the most fantastic banana cream tart. Seriously, to die for. Thick, flakey crust topped with a layer of chocolate, salted caramel, fresh bananas and delicious cream. Divine. Large selection of delicious baked goods. If you're in the mood for something savory they also have sandwiches. They are hearty, large and could easily be shared between two people. I've had the prosciutto/provolone and was satisfied, yet unimpressed. Long line that moves quickly. Good amount of seating but they are busy all of the time so you may have to wait. Long wait for sandwiches, approx 20 minutes when I went. I'll be back for you, banana cream tart.

I can't believe I've never gone here before after traveling to SF for years. Doh!! This was my first food stop this time, and OMG...mind blown. The line wasn't too bad at around 11a on a Thursday. Found seats easily too. The line pretty much stretched to the door the entire time we were there but it moved fast. I could literally smell the pastries half a block away - not exaggerating. It was so hard to decide. A lot of people ordered the croque monsieur and morning bun. I really wanted to try a croissant though. The person working recommended the ham and gruyere croissant over the croque for a first-timer. I'm so glad cos the croissant was so freaking amazing. I've been on the hunt for the best croissants for awhile (mostly in SoCal where I'm from though), and I think Tartine takes the top spot (or at least ties for it). It was so tender and fluffy, perfectly sweet and buttery, über flaky, and had substance too it. Not too much of any one trait. Just perfect. The morning bun was so so good too. Also fluffy and moist in the middle while being chewy, sweet, flaky and citrusy of the outside. Wow. I really wanted to buy more items, but I knew I just consumed an ish-load of butter. I MUST return for the croque monsieur and gougere...and I'll probably make the jump now and buy the cookbook. It's been on my list. ;)

Omg, so so so busy! There is always a long line out the door, even when I showed up at a auspicious after-lunch hour on a weekday. Atmosphere inside is very warm feeling because of all the wood furniture around! It is the kind of place where you buy a pastry/drink and then you pick to sit wherever you want (except there is rarely enough seats). Had the morning bun, which is a small/medium sized circle shaped pastry, glazed with sugar and some kind of orangey flavor. That orangey flavored glaze was my favorite part - I don't know if my experience was different since it was no longer morning and it is probable that the bun started out warm (meaning the glaze would be more liquidy), but it was still so delicious! I love how the orangey parts were chewy like candy, and how it was this dark smokey flavor. It was messy to eat though - definitely make sure you have napkins. I was still finding traces of sugar around my lips an hour later...how embarassing haha!

Ok I know I am going to get slammed for this, but it's a bakery. Pure and simple. I know people will be like, OMG it's amazing. But let's get this straight., while I know there is a difference between good baked goods and bad baked goods, subtle differences are not worth the ranting and raving. We came in, we ordered their signature dishes and sat down with them. I liked the morning bun. I mean the bread itself was fluffy, full of sweet flavor, a little too much in my opinion. Ok moved on to the bread pudding after that. Ok sweetness wise right on. Texture though, was a little off for me. I know it's totally subjective but I mean the fresh bread made it kind of overly soggy. The ham and cheese croissant I really liked. It was fresh which is I guess what I wasn't expecting given that most places will serve it, well after sitting there for a bit. I just don't get it though. A line that wraps around the block, a tight space to sit in and a bill that comes to about $25 pretax for 3 items (Thanks V I owe ya), nah I think I can find much better.

I've been eating here for so many years but, I figure why not be review # 3645? Went back yesterday and had our selection of Spicy Turkey Croque Monsieur, Soppresata-Fontina-Broccoli Rabe-Pesto-Panini, Orange flavored Morning Buns and the Chocolate Hazelnut Tart to top off our meal. No, we didn't finish even 30% of it all, but, the point is to treat our palates (haven't you learned?) Spent a few minutes trying to convince a family of 4 to stick out the short line for a culinary treat they should not pass up - and they did, and they had happy smiles on their faces, and I left feeling like in some culinary way, I paid it forward :) Once, we did manage to buy a fresh loaf of country bread, right at the 5:00 mark - but also managed to put a $475 surcharge on it as we misread the verbose street parking signs and got our car towed. The bread was even more scrumptious for it! Didn't try the banana cream tart until a couple months ago...it's replaced my lemon meringue cake go-to! The chocolate lining over the buttery crust is a delectable surprise!

Came here for their morning bun and bread pudding... Every place I get bread pudding it's different, so I really don't know how to compare it. I've had very dense bread pudding where the bread has soaked up all the liquid and it's just crazy (not my cup of tea), I've also had very flaky bread pudding and the creamy stuff is just swirled in (my favorite so far.. you can find it at Muka), and the one here is just strange. There's chunks of bread, then like eggy/custardy parts that weren't incorporated/soaked by the bread, and random fruits swirled in. Tbh, not my style... maybe I'm just a serial eater so I want it to be fully incorporated, but the very different textures were just weird... and it was like this both times I tried it. Go to Muka for their breadpudding! Morning bun was also interesting... I like the hint of orange and cinammon, really flaky, but also kind of dense. In all, though, I wouldn't come back... I'd save that money and go get some desserts! :D

Tartine's grilled cheese sandwiches are absolutely perfect. The bread is beautiful, crispy and chewy with crust toasted deep brown. The flavor is dark and rich. The pecorino and almond sandwich is especially decadent--stuffed with sharp sheep's cheese and almonds chopped fine and marinated in olive oil, sage and lemon to savory perfection. If you have the time and are lucky enough to have a seat at a table (it's pretty seriously crowded on weekends), you could spend a lovely thirty minutes eating a third of this sandwich--it is so large and so rich that it is easily shared and best enjoyed slowly. As you wait in line you can watch the bakers at work dusting cakes with cocoa or filling croissants with cream.

Yes, some of their baked items are special.  If you've got loads of time to wait in line, and you don't care how much the tab is at the register, this may be the place for you.  Even after a long wait, you'll probably get as much attitude as service from their staff. Unless going to the "in" place is how you define yourself, don't waste your time & money here.  There are plenty of great and near-great bakeries in SF where you can go without breaking the bank, or taking the morning off to wait in line.

Whenever I go to the Mission, we usually end up stopping by Tartine, especially if it's around 5 to try to pick up the bread straight out of the oven! I think it's my favorite thing they have here over their pastries and such, including the infamous morning bun. I just wish the bread was more readily available, and not just offered around 5 PMish. There's usually always a line around the block, but it doesn't take too long. Parking is of course a pain in the major butt sometimes, as it's located in the heart of mission.

I did not think this place was anything special. Maybe it was an off day? Came in the afternoon around 2 on a random Wednesday, there was barely a wait. The place smells amazing, like BUTTAry goodness. I opted for the Banana Cream Tart. It was 4'' in diameter for $7. When you dig into this, my fork couldn't even get through the flaky crust. I had to eat the banana and cream part first out of the "tart bowl" and then use my hands to break apart the crust and eat it separately. The crust was definitely overcooked, almost a bitter burnt taste and way too stiff. The experience I had eating this was nothing that I expected.. My friends got the Morning Bun and Bread Pudding, which was recommended by other Yelpers. Morning Bun was probably the best, but it was nothing extremely special. I thought it was a bit too overbaked as well, but I can see why everyone loves this item if it was prepared properly. The Bread Pudding was horrible. My friend ended up throwing it away before finishing it! It was a curdled blob of hot mess. Would not recommend this.

CROQUE MONSIEUR. Never before have I had such a perfect union of thick chewy bread, ham, bubbly gruyere cheese, and fresh ripe tomatoes. The perfect combination of flavors and textures; I could brunch the hell out of this thing every day for the next year. The other pastries were really good too, and they have some killer fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. But the Monsieur reigns supreme. I really hope I get to eat here again someday.

DEE-LISH-OUS Stopped by on a Wednesday afternoon, around 3pm, with a welcome break from the long weekend lines. I had just eaten so I'll just have to stop by again to try a sandwich. What I did get to try! The morning buns are fantastical, even better warmed up at home. I understand why these are always the first to go on the weekend. The banana cream tart was heavenly! With a thick crust with some chocolate layered on along with come caramel sauce in the tart itself. Everything YUM. Overall I think the morning bun was more worth the calorie intake but I what would I know? I ate almost everything I bought in one sitting. With my water to balance my diet, of course. I have to say just the smell of the bakery is enough for a 5 star rating. Maybe overrated for you if you don't order the right items? Thank god I got the inside track from my sister! So ready to try the rest of this delicious menu! Eat up!

It's so far the best pastry I've ever tried in the States. Be prepared to wait for 20 - 30 mins outside and not be able to get a sit. They only serve sandwiches from 11.30am but they are SOOOO good. The size is pretty big, so you have to share it. The banana pie is crazily awesome as well!

Okay, I did it.  I've been wanting to go here ever since I started my foray into artisan bread-baking.  I had a free weekend in the Bay Area, so I tagged along with a couple of my Coast Guard shipmates into San Francisco and I dragged them to this place.  We had a hell of a time finding a place to park.  In fact, we parked about a mile away in Castro, walked back to Tartine, and stood in line for about 15 minutes.  My shipmates grew steadily more skeptical of the place until we got inside to see the gorgeous cakes, pastries, and breads on display. What I really wanted was one of their famous country loaves, but the timing didn't work out as we were there a couple of hours before they sell them.  However, I did see the bakers plop the risen dough out of the baskets onto the conveyor belt.  Anyway, I was going to order one of there pressed sandwiches, but after they told me it would take 20 minutes, I aborted that plan.  Instead, I got a lemon meringue cake slice, a cocoa nib meringue, and a turkey & tomato croque monsieur, which was on a slice of the bread I was after.  Since there was not an empty seat to be found, we walked to the nearby park and sat in the grass. The croque monsieur was fantastic, though the fact that I was famished probably had something to do with that.  The lemon meringue cake slice was good, but not as good as I thought it was going to be.  Same for the cocoa nib meringue.   I gave Tartine 4 stars because of the quality of their baked goods and because I agree with Chad Robertson's take on food, despite the fact that he's horning in on what would be my niche if I was a professional baker: Scandinavian breads.  I'm not going 5 stars because I'm not sure the wait is entirely worth it and the menu is fairly pricey.

Based on reading these reviews before going to Tartine, I determined 3 things: 1. The line will be long. 2. The food will be expensive. 3. It will be f**king delicious. All of these assumptions were dead-on and I'm glad we made the stop. The bread in our sandwiches was some of the best I've ever had. Ever. The coconut cream pie and banana cream pies we ordered were amazing in every aspect. Wow. Just, wow.

Wow. Where do I even begin with Tartine? Everything I've had here is amazing. My favorites are the croque monsieur, pain au jambon, and chocolate hazelnut tart. I've also had their almond and sheeps milk sandwich, chocolate oatmeal cookie, and morning bun which were also very good. I can't wait to go back. Seriously the best bakery I have ever been to. Only thing that bothers me a bit is the location, how small their place is, and how disgusting they keep their bathrooms. It's extremely rare to actually get a seat in this place. I don't really mind because I go there for the food but it is a bit annoying.

I love bakeries, and everyone seems to loove Tartine, but  I was disappointed. Everything is pretty expensive, the baked goods are a weird combo of overly sweet elements paired with flavorless ones, and the shop itself was crowded and uncomfortable. It definitely seems like a place to go if you're looking for a "scene" (servers that don't smile, cuffed jeans, all the giant wrap-around scaves in the city in one place) but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. Arizmendi, whose offerings are, i think, deceptively simpler-seeming, turns out baked goods at significantly lower prices and high quality.

If you have never been, treat yourself to a trip to Tartine, and you'll feel special! Our favorites are bread pudding in the winter and fruit bavarian in the summer. But everything else we have tried has been delightful: chocolate hazelnut tart, morning bun, coconut creme cake, lemon meringue cake, gougeres and all sandwiches! The service has always been good despite the long line: I never felt being rushed to make a decision. Last time I was there, I forgot to take my change from the espresso bar, and a few days later I got a gift certificate in the mail!   Parking can be a bit tricky, but we usually manage to find a spot on Dolores near the park.

Pastrami sandwich is big enough for two.  It's worth the wait. The desserts are also amazing if you have room.  For me it's either or. Only downside is seating isn't the most comfortable but you're there to eat, right?

// LOCATION // Short walk away from Bi-Rite Creamery and Dolores Park // SERVICE // Curt and not too friendly from my experiences there. You wait in a massive line (it moves fairly quickly) and have to pick quickly when you get up the pastry windows. // FOOD //     + Morning Bun: Iconic Tartine Bakery item that is featured on the 7x7 List. Soft, flaky, sweet, and delish.

Absolutely, bar none, Tartine is the most out-of-this-world bakery in San Francisco, possibly along the entire North American West coast.  I have had the pleasure and privilege to sup on baked goods in Paris and Brussels and so can write from first-hand experience that you will be hard pressed to find a bakery that even approaches the quality being practiced at Tartine. In fact, I would run 5 miles to smell the rubber laid by the truck that delivers Tartine's refined baked goods. But you didn't need to read this review to learn that, did you?

I did not know about Tartine Baker till recently when I was entertaining an out of town guest who had heard raving reviews about the bakery. Thats how we found our way to the Bakery and a week later I saw a big book ode to the bakery at Williams Sonoma. Back to bakery - the wait was close to 45 mins which can feel wayyy longer when you are all cold and braving the city winds. It wait was long perhaps cause it was close to 5 pm , time for their straight out of the oven bread . The pastries are deletable however bit pricey , and with the long wait ,the equation just not add up. I am not going back anytime soon !

okay, the line was long but it moves quickly. very quickly. We were in before we even knew what was happening. I put CP at a table while I went up to order. Two coffees, one morning bun, one croissant. Plus a banana tart to go. If you get a coffee you get a mug and are directed to the corner to fill your cup. Be aware you have to push through people still in line. It can get dangerous. The morning bun was recommended to me by multiple publications and many yelp friends. I liked it but it's not my normal thing. It was very soft with a good sugary crisp on the outside, a little citrusy. It's tasty for sure but it wasn't as good as the warmed butter croissant. There must have been a pound of butter per croissant in this recipe. It was so warm and soft and buttery. Like a little breakfast blanket. I thought about laying it out and taking a nap in it, all wrapped up in its luxury. Don't try to relax in this environment. The bakery is small and packed. Hectic. But the community tables are nice. We gave the tart a go a few hours later and it wasn't nearly as good as it looked. I could have skipped that.

Superb croissant. The chocolate eclair, however, would have been immediately discarded by anyone in France. The pastry was heavy and doughy, the dark chocolate topping too bitter, and the size obscene by French standards. A friend ordered a triple espresso. Thus ensued an elaborate conversation with the cashier, who explained that they could make only double espressos, but she run it up as two double espressos, one of which would be 1/2 caffeine and 1/2 decaf. Either the pressure in the machine was low or the grounds were tamped too tightly because the end result was almost no liquid (for four shots!) and a very bitter taste. Rated by my friend as inferior to Dunkin' Donuts, Starbucks, and McDonald's. Conclusion: people in San Francisco will line up just because there is a line (like the former Soviet Union).

Don't understand all the fuzz about this place. Tiny, not very clean, not clear what to order, no diet coke. Cakes seem good but didn't taste any. We took a gougère (good) a piece of quiche (OK, way too salty and missed some egg inside) and some spicy turkey hot pressed sandwich (not so good, way too spicy and tasteless and veryheavy... and for 13$!). The morning bun at the end was by far the best thing I've had in this bakery. I didn't find the place super clean, food on the ground, no cleaning of the table when it's empty ;  It's an OK place but really not something else... And 32$ for all of that, I find it very expensive!

My wife and I went to Tartine Bakery today. We waited in line for about 20 minutes. The Morning Bun was pretty good and the bread pudding was just okay (we're not bread pudding fans apparently). The Banana Cream Tart and Coconut Cream Tart both looked good, but were very pricey at $7 each. I want to give them 3.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't allow 1/2 stars. (Overall Grade: B-)

Tartine Bakery is so lovely!   I got the banana cream tart and a glass of pinot noir. I was a happy girl :) It was pretty packed when I got there (a little before 5pm).  I waited about 15-20 minutes to order and analyzed this delicious piece of goodness.  The cream was light and not too sweet, but the banana and chocolate at the bottom had the perfect texture and sweetness.  Chocolate sprinkled around gave it a nice touch. There are only a few seats and few more outside, but you can walk to Dolores Park to enjoy your baked goodies.  Great place to catchup with friends!

I ordered the hazelnut chocolate tart with a hot chocolate. Chocolate overload?? Nah. We managed to snag a table where we could devour our treats. My friend tried the fruit tart. It was tasty as well. Great selection of goodies. The sandwiches and other foods looked amazing also. Will be back.

I have a love/hate relationship with this place.  They have THE BEST almond croissants in the city.  I hate their long lines, pretentious staff and high prices.  What's worse is that they only make one batch of almond croissants and they often run out by 10am.  You're open for many more hours, so why not make more?  So sometimes, I'm in line for 40 minutes and I still won't get that almond croissant by the time I'm at the front of the line, because they've sold out within that 40 minute period that I was waiting in line.  Yes, highly frustrating.

Another visit to Tartine and this time I tried some items I hadn't had before: Tres Leches - I was actually pretty unimpressed with this.  Tres Leches is supposed to be a rich, extremely moist cake and this was more like a good-tasting French-style cake.  I actually do have to give them points for making it their own thing...they took a known item and added a French spin on it.  I think if you're a fan of Tres Leches, you may not like this cake, but would appreciate the creativity.   Even though it's not a typical Tres Leches cake, it's still good. Devil's Food Cake - Fantastic!  A great, perfectly textured dark chocolate cake with caramel and chocolate ganache...this was excellent and had the perfect amount of sweetness. Chocolate Pudding - A fantastic, chocolatey pudding that is rich and creamy.   Tartine does a fantastic job with almost all their items...there's almost always a line out the door, but it's worth the wait.

I *really* want to give this bakery a higher review, but I have to be a honest Yelper... 1) Bread pudding with seasonal fruits - 4 out of 5 stars. I had to wait about 10 minutes but it was well worth it. This was the only dish that I truly liked! It was warm and comforting, and the tangy fruits really complimented the sweetness of the syrupy bread pudding. 2) Morning bug - 2 out of 5 stars. When the server handed it to me, I noticed that it wasn't warm... and since I had a whole bowl of bread pudding, I decided to take both buns to-go. Unfortunately when I finally had a chance to take a bite, it was way too hard, not soft/moist/warm. So I re-toasted it for about 2-3 minutes... didn't help =( The bun left an aftertaste of heavy/bitter butter and orange zest. Would not order this again. 3) Croque Monsieur - 3 out of 5 stars. It just didn't taste special to me. Again, it was served cold. 4) Chocolate eclair - 3 out of 5 stars. Again, nothing special/different from this eclair. 5) Lime passionfruit bavarian - 3 out of 5. The coconut flakes were chewy, and the cake was a little too sour for me. 6) Chocolate cake - 4 of out 5. The cake was moist and very chocolate-y, I would order this again. Overall, it was a great first-time experience. Try to go early (i.e. 9-10am on Saturdays) to avoid the lines and to get a seat at the table. This place gets crazy packed!!

One of the shortcomings of turning into an adult in America is that you are slowly weaned off of sleep.  First the periodic day-time naps go.  Then we start going to school full day, and afternoon naps are out of the question.  Before you know it, you're a full-blown adult and can barely even get 5 hours at night.  Time ceases to hang around in extra quantities, schedules fill up, and sleep takes a blow to the stomach. Speaking of stomachs... The days when there are moments available for even just 15 minutes of nap time are precious. So if you foresee one in your future, my advice is to make it count. Head to Tartine for breakfast, and find yourself in a pastry dreamland.  The buttery croissant with its flaky golden shell is ambrosial, and the morning bun has been touched with citrus and cinnamon sugar to die for.  The lemon bar, arguably my favorite dessert, makes a better morning-time snack than you'd readily believe, and the almond croissant is the perfect little sister to the traditional plain. If savory is your game, by all means order a gougere. The ball of gruyere and pepper is pure heaven. Stand at the little side bar and sip your coffee and love your pastries. Love all of them. Enjoy it. Because when you're done, you're really done. You haven't the choice but to make your way to the nearest bed, and whether fantasy-induced or whether by pure calorie overload, seize those 15 minutes, squeeze your pillow tight, (slip into your elastic-waisted pants, of course), and dream pure love for Tartine Bakery.

You know what they say. About assumptions: http://www.urbandictiona… About Tartine Bakery: http://www.7x7.com/recip… Eight plus years since moving to the city and I'd yet to have this legendary bun. It was Burning Man weekend. Lines should be short. Today is the day. Assumed wrong about the line. Over 20 people deep. Probably many of us with the same incorrect strategy. Let the waiting game begin. Assumed right about the bun. Wow. Orange and cinnamon were mind blowing. Consistent but not overpowering. Gooey. Sweet. Intoxicating smell. Amazing taste. Worth every minute in line. Later that evening I indulged in a shortbread cookie and oatmeal currant cookie. I'd share more but my mind was still thinking about the morning bun. Espresso bar is a nice touch. Skim milk if you ask. Back to my morning bun. Assume you'll wait. Assume the payoff will be one of the best things you've ever had.

Horrendous line, but the baked goods are so delicious and expensive! Thank goodness I don't live nearby this place, otherwise I would gain lots of weight from the buttery goodness. We ordered the frangipane croissant which had lots of almond flavors, and the small bread pudding. The croissant was a huge size. It's way too big for someone to finish on their own. As with the bread pudding, it was sweet, buttery, and had fruits. Yum. The set up of the place needs to be improved so there isn't congestion at the cash register.

Crystal J. put it perfectly when she noted the line, the reviews, and the obvious pie heaven that Tartine serves up daily. Do not be discouraged by the number of people, just be patient and get excited like a little kid at Disney World waiting to ride Splash Mountain. I saw sandwiches the size of my head from the back of the line and had I been more hungry, I'm sure I would have had one for three meals and still wanted more. Sadly, my trip to Tartine only yielded a quiche for an afternoon snack with a friend. As I dreamt (still dream) about the pesto coated bread and ginormous desserts, I thought about returning before I left the city but our paths sadly never passed. When I return to SF, however, this will be my first stop. Please, someone, go each a sandwich in my honor.

I can see how the morning bun continuously makes it on the 7x7 Big Eats list. It is literally drool-worthy. Even the mere sight of it makes my mouth water...yum! (http://www.yelp.com/user…) My friend Matt-e C. was sweet enough to wait in line at Tartine one Saturday and bring me some treats, including the morning bun. I was super excited to try it since I could never bring myself to wake up early enough to stand in line for it. =P I couldn't wait to get my hands on it and the first bite was like heaven. Buttery, sweet, doughy, sticky goodness. I ate that baby up in a quick minute! We also sampled the pain au jambon and gougere (http://www.yelp.com/user…). I loved the pain au jambon with the salty ham/cheese combo plus flaky pastry around it. The gougere was the most bland out of all 3 and I wasn't really feeling the herby taste but it probably would have been better warmed up. I can't wait to return for more baked goodies next time!

We tried the Morning Bun and the Double Pain Au Chocolat, which seem to be two of the most popular things to get based on the 7x7 guide and the thousands of Yelp reviews. They were definitely delicious, but I don't think they're worth all the hype they are getting. Luckily my wife is super thick skinned, and she went inside while I got on the back of the insanely long line, and sold them some story about how we forgot to order something, so they just hooked her right up with our two pastries and we didn't have to wait at all. Awesome. I probably would subtract a star from this review if I had to wait forever for these pastries, but all in all, they were very good.

I took gingin, my pug to Dolores Park to see Hunky Jesus. Afterwards, since we were in the neighborhood, we dropped by Tartine's for some sweets. There's a big ole sign in the window that says: NO DOGS, so I left little gin tied outside. As I entered the belly of the bakery, I could hear and see people cooing and taking pictures of her. She is a smashed face beauty if I do say so myself. Upon exiting with a bagful of goodies, I found gingin still sitting outside, but for some reason, she was sitting there with a two year old. The little girl LOVED gin, and was busy petting and kissing her. Apparently, the parents of this little girl had so much faith in gingin, a strange pug they had never met, they decided to make her the babysitter as they picked out pastries. Yep, Tartine is so good, you'll leave your two year old child out on the sidewalk under the watchful eye of a pug you've never met. BTW, mon petite carlin is awesome with kids, in fact, if the employees at Tartine were as awesome as she is, I might have given the bakery five stars. Sadly, they are not. Also, for being such a fabulous French bakery, their coffee bar sucks. Everything else is amazing.

Got in the long line on a beautiful weekend day, and waited from 11:45AM until about 12:25 until I finally got to the counter to place my order. My favorite is the lemon cream tart followed by the banana cream tart. I ordered a Frangipane Tart as well, and I thought it was terrible, and I usually like almond pastries. They also had a raspberry cream tart that was very "meh." I also asked for a ham croque monsieur, but they only had a turkey one left. I thought that was fine enough, and I waited an absurd amount of time for them to heat it up. They also put in complementary pickled carrots in the to-go container, which caused my croque monsieur to become very soggy as it soaked up all the excess pickle juices. It was very unpleasant. Maybe I'll come back again, but most likely not. Don't get me wrong, if someone offered a free tart to me, I'd eat it in a heartbeat.

tartine is what it is: maybe overpriced and definitely over crowded. but don't be rude and try to get a seat while your friend is in line down the street- by the time you actually make your purchase someone will have cleared out- that is the way of the universe unless you suffer from elitism and think you deserve a table more than anyone else - especially people holding their treats while you are still in line. OH and don't try to order bread or pastries from the barista because they can't and they won't and it will only make them grumpy and you will look like a jerk. chocolate rules and if you obey the rules you will be deliciously happy. otherwise you will look like everyone else suffering from entitlement in SF and you will probably be told that the chocolate cake you want is not available by the slice

Yeah see that line out the door and 3,500+ Yelp reviews? There's a reason for that. I was initially disgruntled by the line, but came back later in the day and found out what time it was in the Mission: it was banana cream pie time.   That pie was the BEST THING I EVER ATE. If I could fuck this pie and then marry it and then divorce it when it cheated on me with all you SF foodie sluts and then sue it for child support money just to keep it in my life, I would do that. So waiting in line for twenty minutes really doesn't seem so bad after all. Morning bun, coconut cream pie and ham and cheese croissant are all deserving of high marks. A +++

Banana cream tart here is probably the best dessert I've ever had. Flaky crust + chocolate to keep the crust from getting soggy + salted caramel sauce + bananas + cream with vanilla beans + whipped cream + chocolate shavings = soooo good. My mouth is watering just thinking about it ...... mmmmmm. I'm not a huge fan of the morning buns here, though. I prefer the normal cinnamon sugar morning buns without orange glaze. I've also tried the frangipane tart (seemed a bit dry to me) and the lemon bar (yum. I like when lemon baked goods are tart and not overly sweet, and this lemon bar was definitely tart enough for me.) I'm sure a lot of the other pastries here are delicious but I haven't really tried many other things after discovering the banana cream tart :)

As the Star says Meh. I've experienced better. For being such a famous SF bakery I was very surprised with my experience here. Walked in long line (to be expected) finally get to front someone greets me then disappears. Waited for about 5 minutes before someone came back to help me. Asked for some cake slices but they said that the cakes were to be sold whole and a slice was not available (for any of their cakes). Got a chocolate chip cookie that was not moist and not special in any way shape or form. Then got the bread pudding, per the employees recommendation. It was perhaps the eggiest soggiest bread pudding I have ever had. And it was watery towards the bottom which was gross.   Lastly asked for the pound cakes one of each, chocolate was by far the best but even that was something that I was expecting more from. Spent about $17.00 total getting stuff to try and I was really let down by all of it. I would defin. say this is a place that has been over-hyped and might have been good at one point but it was really just Meh in my honest opinion.

I finally decided to try it out yesterday morning around 1030 am. Even on a weekday there was a line of about 30 people. The line moves slow and takes forever. Inside the seating is very limited and you almost always have to share a table with other people which is no problem for me. Some of the tarts and pastries are delicious but nothing out of this world. The coffee is so-so. In my honest opinion, this bakery is over-rated. The crowd is very hip and polite. Try it once or twice, but nothing extraordinary. I hear its even worse on weekends. I am better off going to a local coffee shop. Have a nice day.

I've never been treated so poorly by anyone in the service industry. Ever. Now I realize at a culinary institution like Tartine, you are bound to be served by some snotty staff. But the woman who served me was the absolute worst! My boyfriend and I ordered 3 breakfast sweets to share. Since we were splitting them I asked that the pastries be cut in half prior to being boxed up. A very reasonable request given that these treats were $8+ apiece and it would take less than 2 seconds to cut all 3. Uber-Snotty Tartine Staff Lady (USTSL): "There are plastic knives over there" (vaguely points behind me) Me: "Oh, I'd prefer they be cut with a real knife. Plastic won't be effective." (C'mon, the crusts on the tarts alone are thick and crispy). USTSL: "Yeah. Listen, I'm going to serve these to you as-is and you can do with them what you want." (Throws them into a box and quickly moves onto the next customer before we could even respond). Both my boyfriend and I were totally shocked. I'm dead serious when I say that the angriest I've ever seen my boyfriend was over this trip to Tartine.

I died and went to heaven the day I went to Tartine for breakfast. Went with some coworkers one Friday morning at around 9:30am. Of course there's a line out the door and we have to wait for 25 minutes. This is SF, where people apparently don't work on Fridays. At least the line gave us some time to figure out what to order. Morning bun, clearly. Chocolate croissant, clearly. We also decided on the ham/cheese croissant, veggie croque monsieur (based on what the table we passed by in line had ordered, thanks guys!), and a banana cream pie. Yeah, that was breakfast for four. We weren't indulging or anything... Morning bun ($3.25): ON. POINT. That's pretty much all there is to say. Citrus glaze with sugar sprinkled on top. Perfect combination of crunchy and soft, it melts in your mouth. Chocolate croissant (~$4): Also delish. Surprisingly, it wasn't my favorite (and chocolate croissants usually are). Ham/Cheese croissant (~$4): I liked this second to the croque monsieur, although the two aren't that comparable considering the CM is like a meal in itself...the croissant rocked. The ham and cheese combination balanced nicely, and I didn't feel like I was eating something super-heavy. Vegetable croque monsieur (~$8): This item made me extremely happy. The bread is delicious. The vegetables are delicious (mushrooms, asparagus, and others I can't remember). The cheese is perfect. Everything comes together to create this wonderful open-faced sandwich. The coffee is Four Barrel which is an added bonus! We managed to snag a table outside but your best bet is to get it to-go and eat at Dolores or take it home (if you can last that long). Be prepared for a long wait. But know that it's WORTH IT. This place is famous for a reason :)

Things I've tried at Tartine were their banana cream pie and berry torte. The first was divine! Fresh, fresh bananas, creamy vanilla custard, crunchy yet soft crust, just the right amount of whipped cream, finished off with chocolate shavings. SO GOOD! The berry torte was delicious as well. This did not disappoint. Sweet, but sour berries, mixed in the cake batter, topped with a streusel and finished off with a dusting of powdered sugar. Mmmm! This was a rather large/heavy torte.

This is the stuff that dreams are made of. Well, my carb dreams, anyway. It's always a stop (and sometimes multiples are in order) when I'm in town. As you're rushed through the inevitable line, don't wonder what that bowl of fruit is -- I shall tell you. It's their bread pudding. And it is not to be missed. Heavy on the egg and milk, it's perfectly porridgey. Add in some strawberries and it's amazing for breakfast on a foggy day. The gougere is a lovely, cheesey, chivey, popover, with a strong egg vibe. Eat it warm. The frangipani croissant is an almond croissant -- which I love like no other thing -- with frangipani jam in it. It just made it sweeter, which to me was unnecessary, but loving all the rest, I can't fault them. The coffee is good, and free refills on drop are offered. I'm rating this in generous SF-style, as the terrible atmosphere and service almost every time I am here makes it super unpleasant. It's the type of food you want to sit and enjoy, cafe style for a few minutes. But even if you snag a seat, the line snakes around the store and the glares of death from other patrons make for an un-relaxing experience. And the overworked employees rarely crack a smile or have the patience to answer questions. Take it to go and enjoy.

I absolutely enjoyed Tartine. I ordered the shiitake mushroom croque monsieur, a slice of coconut passion fruit bavarian cake, and iced tea. The line was a bit long (as it went out the door), but it moved quickly and is worth the wait. Grabbing a table might be hard. We were there on a Sunday afternoon.   The croque monsieur was perfectly executed. The mushrooms were probably sauteed and then coated with glorious, glorious gruyere cheese. The bread it lied on top of was beautifully toasted. The cake itself was light and airy while the cream had a slight tartness (from the passion fruit) that contrasted well with the large shavings of coconut. As mentioned, since it was really busy (and hard to relax when around a lot of movement and lines of people), we took our food to-go and ate outside at Dolores Park. You might want to do the same if you too aren't a fan of people hovering over you while you eat! :)

It definitely lived up to the hype, if that's what you wanted to know. My friend and I waited about 30 minutes so by the time I got to the front of the line I was FAMISHED and ordered a ham & cheese croissant, a normal croissant, AND a morning bun. The morning bun was on the sweet side and it was mehs to be honest. I could've lived without it. What I loved most was the ham & cheese croissant.. ahhhh my mouth is watering at the thought.. It was perfectly flakey and soft with fragrant cheesy aroma in every bite.. mm.. this is a must-try. I wish I could've tried other items on the menu but unfortunately, this is a rather expensive bakery and it just wasn't worth dropping more money for bread. I definitely wouldn't wait in line every day for tartine, even for that delectable ham & cheese croissant.

No banana cream pie when I went. I honestly feel they could try to be better with the way the line works and be quicker. Their deserts are great, but the long line due to they way they run their service just isn't working. The morning bread is the best thing on their menu I think and the bread pudding was really good too. The chocolate tart was a bit of a miss and no banana cream pie made me so so sad.

After we went here, we spent the rest of the time trying to go back, but were never successful with our time. Oh well, maybe another visit? Some food was amazing, and some was so-so. After visiting Seattle's Bakery Nouveau so much (and loving it), I was comparing the two. The chocolate croissant here was not as good, but still yummy enough that I polished it off. The croque monsieur was barely edible for me, but I don't like sourdough, and this was super sour bread! The frangipane...oh man. Soooo good! If you told me I would prefer an almond/fruit tart to a chocolate croissant, I would have said you're crazy, but it was that good!!!! The morning bun was also good, but not my favorite. If you like orange marmalade a lot, then you will like it more than I did. The bread pudding looked kind of gross by the time we opened the container, but it was also yummy. The fruit was really fresh and the pudding nice and custardy. We definitely want to go back and check out more of the treats (chocolate cake!) and return for some of the favorites (frangipane!). If the line seems long, don't worry, it will move quickly! (Faster than we could make up our minds!)

My rating is purely based on how freaking delicious the pastry that I had there was. If i wanted to be more difficult, I'd dock points for the service. The service was terrible, as I was told by my cousin who did the ordering (I got our seats while she ordered). It wasn't one, but two people who serviced her who treated her poorly. There's no real excuse for bad service, but I'm going to make it a little easy and just rate based on the food selection. I have to admit that I made my order selection based on how beautiful the lemon tart looked while I was in line. The perfect crust lining, and beautiful football shaped whipped creme atop the lemon filling was a delight to my eyes. I had to have it, and so I did. The lemon tart was easily one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had. The crust was amazing, the lemon filling the perfect amount of tartness, and the whipped creme a perfect blend of light. We also had the tres leche cake which was delicious as well. It wasn't exactly my taste, with the textures all wet and soft, but I did enjoy it, and I'm sure others would too!

Holy balls. This place, another great recommendation by my LA friend, is amazing. I love the atmosphere, love all the goods here, and the friendly people. I was able to sit down on a Wednesday afternoon here and enjoy a chocolate hazelnut tart and a citron green tea. YUM!!!!! I've never had such a rich and flavorful tart before. Maybe it's because I underestimate my own city and I don't go out searching for the best food of LA, but this place... OMG. I want a Tartine in LA. Please. I also tried the chocolate rye cookie or something, which they rang up as a macaroon (0.70 instead of 1.25) and that was so delicious I came back for more to bring home to LA in their pretty little box with their pretty sticker on top of the box (and at which point they rang me up correctly) as well as a banana cream tart for the aforementioned friend, who, despite the horrific LA traffic, came all the way to where I was to pick up her gift and later emailed me to thank me. I guess she liked it a lot. I didn't get to have their banana cream tart this time, because I was so full from my half pan of pizza lunch at Delfina already, but I can't wait to have some next time I visit. Ever since this place, I'm not afraid to sit alone at a cafe merely to enjoy the atmosphere and savor the food. I'm really glad I was able to make it to Tartine's twice this time. This place ranks #1 in my SF trip. Baked goods are pricey, yes, but so worth every penny.

This place is always packed! Totally worth the wait.   What I tried: lemon tart with fresh unsweetened cream ($6) spicy sopressata sandwich with fontina and broccoli rabe pesto ($13) coconut macaroons ($.75) The sandwich was so freakin' yummy and huge! Cut into 3 even pieces this sandwich is enough for 2, probably 3 people.  A few more slices of the salami would have been nice, too. The lemon tart was was just that; tart.  Each bite with some crust and the fresh cream was just perfect.   Dolores Park is only a block away, so after indulging in all that buttery and sugary greatness, hit up the park to burn some of it off :)

My friends recommended we stop here for dessert after lunch at nearby Luna Park. It was a good decision! We took a banana cream tart ($7) to-go and later ate it with Peet's Coffee. DELICIOUS! Great to share between two people. We thought the banana cream was just going to be, well, cream, but there were also good sized chunks of real banana mixed into the banana cream. Also, the tart pastry was lined with a layer of dark chocolate, which sent me to a dreamy food heaven. Wow, loved the chocolate! Recommended! I know I'll be back. Perhaps I'll try a famous morning bun for breakfast next time.

Found myself in the city nearby Tartine and figured might as well make my special city trip worthwhile and try it out.  This place is fascinating. I got here around 12:30 PM on a Friday.  Lucky me, there wasn't much of a line.  Unluckily, though, no almond croissants or ham and cheese croissants left.  Bummer. That said, there was plenty of other stuff for me to choose from.  I decided to get a frangipane tart topped with what appears to be a blackberry/boysenberry type topping, a large serving of the bread pudding with a berry topping, and morning buns. Everything was delicious.  The pastry dough in the pastries was super flaky.  The morning buns in particular are great.  Nice, slightly crispy and flaky exterior topped with some granulated sugar.  The inside is much softer, like a good cinnamon roll.  And there was a hint of orange to brighten it up. Truth be told, I wasn't paying attention to what anything cost since I was in awe of this place.  But now that I think about it, it was $21 total for everything.  Not bad, but as I think back on it, seems a bit pricey.  But I'm not really complaining because everything was fantastic.  Would love to come back and try some of the stuff I missed and maybe a sandwich or something.

Tartine is one of the spots I always like to bring friends from out of town -- it's very charming, sits on a great block (Delfina, Bi-Rite AND Dolores Park all in a row), and is mildly famous in foodie circles. The bakery is a little on the pricey side, but I know they make an effort to use local, organic ingredients when possible, so I don't mind paying an upcharge for that. Everything I've had has been memorable. My favorite things (in order of deliciousness): 1. The morning bun. Believe the hype. Flaky and delicious but not too sweet. I didn't think I'd be into the orange flavor, but it was awesome. 2. The open-faced mushroom sandwich (it has a French name, but I can't remember what it is) -- the mushrooms were earthy and the cheese wasn't overwhelming. Yum. 3. Bread pudding -- this came with seasonal (late summer) berries. Not too sweet, very fresh. 4. Ham and gruyere croissant -- unfortunately, I wasn't a huge fan of Tartine's croissants. They were too buttery for me. Really rich. I know some people are huge fans, though. 5. Chocolate croissant -- this was great, but so rich! I couldn't have more than a few bites, but those couple of bites were great. Coffee (both espresso drinks and drip) is very good. Parking can be a nightmare, and of course, there's that crazy line every weekend morning. I've also made stops on weekdays, too, and the line was minimal. OH! And I can't forget the most pleasant surprise of all. The staff behind the counter have always been pleasant and smiling. That's seriously impressive given how hectic their jobs are!

In contrast, the interior is pillowey soft yet provides a great chewy mouthfeel. The bread is quite good, the 2 previous failed attempts made this last venture that much sweeter with the taste of success! Overall Thoughts Great bread, great size, price is on the higher side ($8.25 a loaf) but well worth a try if you ever get the chance.

Nothing to add from my previous reviews but this was the first time we went to Tartine right when they opened. We got there at about maybe 7:46 a.m. and there were already about 15 people ahead of us so the line wasn't too bad and seating was readily available. The thing is that they don't have their full offerings ready to go at 8 a.m. For example, my cousins from Australia were visiting so I wanted them to try everything! But they didn't have the small individual banana chocolate cream tart ready (they said it would be ready later in the day). I wanted to save room for Bi-Rite so I ordered for 4 of us: 1) 2 Ham & Cheese Croissants 2) 2 Chocolate croissants 3) 1 Morning Bun (I still think this is okay but not amazing....but if they served it warm then it would be a whole other thing and probably phenomenal). 4) Vegetable quiche (again...I'm never amazingly wowed by their quiche. Just think they're OK). I got lemon cream tarts and an almond frangipane tart to go. Another good experience at Tartine but perhaps my hyping up the place to my out of town guests also made me feel the food was a bit less magical than I had imagined.

If Tartine was a baseball team, they'd be in the World Series every year.  Seriously, they *knockwood* are always perfect!  We finally got a chance to buy the much-vaunted white and wheat boules.  I surrender.  Even Acme must doff the cap (no disrespect to Acme!).  This is the bread you spend $K to go to Europe to find... and often don't.  The textures of the inner and outer layers alone are enough to provoke waxing on waxing.  The aroma while still warm... be still my beating fat cells!  The flavors - complex, delicate, malty, roasty, you fantasize you can taste the dirt the wheat grew in.  Oh my condolences to those with gluten allergies.  Tartine makes the old saying "bread is life" true. We actually went twice yesterday - morning run for ham/cheese croissant, blueberry muffin and croque monsieur.  ooh lah lah.   And then a whimsical drive-by after a day in Napa/Yountville.  Don't drive if you can help it especially when the weather's nice. See you in line!

Very busy, so get there well before you want to eat. Eat alone and savour every bite, or go with a bread-loving friend (it's a busy, buzzy little place and going as part of a bigger group could be stressful). I had the veggie quiche and the summer fruit bread pudding, both of which were delicious.

Every year, around Christmas I get a hankering for gingerbread.  Tartine's  European-style Glazed Soft Gingerbread square is about as good as it gets.  At $4.50 a pop, it ain't cheap--but I could never replicate this at home (I don't have enough spices on hand to even attempt it).  So, in the spirit of the season I'll just get in line & dig deep in my pockets to buy another slice:}

I typically go to La Farine for morning buns because it's closer to my hood, however I've got to admit that Tartine is well worth the extra cost for the extra flavor. I don't go here often enough, which is probably why I love it so much when I do get to visit. The line is long.. this spot is good for going in your leisure time, not necessarily when you're in a mad rush before work. Enjoy!

I drove to SF from SJ and parked in the Tenderloin District.  I started to walk to Tartine at 8:15am and arrived at 8:59am.  Keep in mind that this place opens at 9am on Sundays and seriously I was already behind 50+ people.  "OMFG" was playing repeatedly in my head. If you want a table, you have to be among the first 10 customers or else you will be enjoying your yummies on the curb like "Trambrolay" did.  Of course w/ the hour long drive, the almost 45 minute walk w/ a stroller, the workout to Insanity I did prior to leaving the house can only do justice if I get more than 2 pastries.. it was already decided.  And to think whilst in line I wanted to stop by Dyanamo Donuts, too.   What I got for myself and ate it all in the same day.  Again, a consolation... I intended to do hours of walking in the city before the ball game AND after the ball game.   - chocolate / hazelnut tart (this will be on my dessert bar at my wedding because it is AWESOME; I can't justify this anymore than that.. sorry) - tres leches cake (did you know that Tartine Bakery and this very cake was crowned numero tres for the nation's yummiest yummy?) - chocolate eclair (another item at my wedding because the freaking pastry was dense and the custard was silky smooth and a touch of sweet) - gougere (like a croissant) I wanted the chocolate devil's cake but I refrained... I refrained. Now I understand why this place is packed every single damn day.   Was it worth the wait?  Oh eff yes. Did I mention I want these yummies at my wedding?

The most perfect bakery on the planet. I daydream about opening my own bakery, and Tartine is what it'd look like if I did. (But with more cat pictures, let's be honest.) Everything is in the open, and from my place in line, I could see croissants at rest on a workbench. I read in their cookbook that they bake in real-time, which is just amazing. The morning bun and quiche I had were simply perfect. The long line is worth the wait, and it was surprisingly easy to snag a couple of seats.

A good friend was kind enough to surprise me with a delicious Morning Bun one gloomy SF morning, and boy, did I enjoy it! I wish I was able to warm it up a bit before eating it, but it was good nonetheless. I don't know how much it cost, so this review is solely based on taste and texture. It's got a decent amount of sugar sprinkled onto it - maybe that's what makes it so good - but the bread itself is quite artfully crafted. Overall the bread is just delicious and fun to peel off and eat.

Rushed over here on a Sunday morning with two of my girlfriends for some deliciousness before a Golden Gate Park music concert. There were about 15 people ahead of us so we just waited patiently and gazed at everyone else's pastries for about half an hour. I went a bit overboard and ordered the chocolate croissant, 2 almond croissants, banana creme pie, bread pudding and a latte. My girlfriends both ordered the Croque Monsieur and latte + OJ. Honestly, I only liked the croissants. OK, I LOVED the croissants. The chocolate croissant had a chewy and flaky consistency with a good smear of rich chocolate down the center. It was the best croissant I've ever had. The banana creme pie and bread pudding weren't any where close to spectacular though. Marie Calendar's banana pie and Universal Cafe/Town Hall's bread puddings are much tastier. At least now I know better and will only order the croissants. Seating was a nightmare. You basically have to stand over others like a hawk and swoop in as soon as they move an inch towards the exit. That's SF for ya, 4 stars for amazing croissants!

I'm not sure why I haven't written a review on here before but I have been here multiple times by now. This place is my standard in which I try to gauge everything I bake to compare to them (I am aware it is a high standard). I have tried many things at this place and here are a few of my favorite items: - Lemon Tart (full of lemon flavor but not too sweet so it has a nice tarty flavor to it) - Morning Buns (it's like a cinnamon roll but with croissant dough and an orange glaze. nice and flaky with generous amounts of cinnamon sugar on it) - Banana Creme Pie (Has nice chunks of banana in it with a great chocolaty crust to add to everything) - Country Loaf of Bread (Come at 4:30 pm when the bread is fresh and you will not  be disappointed. Keep in mind it's still bread so don't expect anything but good tasting bread) They are on the pricier side of their desserts but if you build such a rep like they have, it's understandable why they charge their prices. The constant line out of the door speaks for itself.

I can see why there's always a line wrapped around the block. Its a very small bakery with limited seating. But by the looks of it everyone is buying and leaving. I went all the way their to try their famous chocolate croissant, which by the way is my favorite, but they were sold out! This is about 2pm in the afternoon, guess they are really that good. So I opted to try the banana cream tart... This was heaven! The tart itself had a delicious crust, flaky too with a layer of chocolate at the bottom. The cream on top was not too sweet at all, or the custard and real slices of banana inside. I was truly in heaven, and I'm not a sweets fan at all. I will give that extra star, the next time I'm SF to try this chocolate croissant..

I know the lines are INSANELY long and the entrance is often annoyingly blocked by double-wide strollers, but DAMN the banana cream tarts are DELICIOUS! I would say incomparable, and I was a professional baker in my not so recent past. So I know these things. Really. Fantastic. Not too sweet, no artificial flavors, just smooth creamy custard and fresh bananas atop a crisp and flaky pastry crust, topped with very lightly sweetened whipped cream and expertly thin shaved dark chocolate. Wow. A definite must try. Go try them!! They live up to the hype.

I was showing a friend around town and she wanted to grab some pastries so I took her here. Tartine is usually pretty busy every time they're open but it's okay because we had some time to look over the display case to decide on what we wanted. She chose to get the lemon tart and I chose to get a tres leches cake slice. The lemon tart was almost $7 if I remember correctly and the tres leches slice was $5.50. The tres leches cake slice is really big so I feel that the size suits the price. The quality was great in the way that they actually let the cake soak up all the milk! I've gone to so many places and tried so many different tres leches cakes that weren't soaked up properly so I REALLY appreciate that Tartine made it right. For a side note, the tres leches cake has a bit of a coconut taste so maybe if you don't like coconut, you might not like this cake as much as I do but I don't see the harm in trying it out, you know? It was really good. My friend really liked her lemon tart too but I think she was put off by the price a little. Love Tartine. I wish I could get pastries from here all the time.

My parents love this place, so whenever they visit me, we have to go.  I almost always order the banana cream tart, which I do love very much. I'm also another fan of their morning buns. Most things tend to be pretty rich--they obviously believe in their butter and melted cheese here. Since I tend to like a lighter approach, flaky and flavorful without leaving greasy stains on my fingers and with the fruit flavors more forward, there are other bakeries I prefer in the city. But my dad honestly cannot go a day here without visiting them for their bread pudding or tarts, while my mom adores their almond croissants. If the people who worked there were not so cold or if they had a more relaxing ambience, I'd give them another star. Definitely not a place to linger and have a leisurely conversation, though the outside tables are good on a warm day for people watching, if that's your thing. Honestly, though, I don't understand why people stand in line so long there? Crazy.

You know those commercials where the sexy, skinny supermodels slowly eat an ice cream bar or a juicy hamburger? That's what I feel like whenever I eat the banana cream tart. Except, there's no "sexy" way to eat this thing. One bite in and already the tip of your nose has a dollop of whipped cream, your shirt has flakes of pastry crumbs, and you're trying hard to keep the tart from breaking in two. But once you're back in business, OH THE ORGASMIC DELICIOUSNESS of it all begins to set in. Also worthy of a near-orgasmic adventure: the double pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant). It's on par (if not rivals) some of the best stuff I've had in France. Yes, seriously. It's almost unfair just how GOOD these things are, and most definitely worthy of the obscene amount of people that wait in line for 'em and other amazing treats.

I ordered the morning bun, banana cream tart, and bread pudding.  Maybe it was an off day for me, I came in here with high expectations.  I just ate dim sum before coming here, which isn't the best idea.  So my palette might have been messed up.  I felt like it wasn't anything special.  But I am definitely going to give this place a try again, will update when I do.

My review stands nearly 100% on the bread alone. The pastries are fantastic...but the bread...it's the stuff legends written about. Chad's commitment to breadmaking as an art form is evident...I have not been able to find the combination of a perfectly thick crust, perfect acidity and purity of flour anywhere but Tartine. Whomever mills their flour deserves an award. I bought a couple of loaves. Took them home. 3 days passed. I cut into a loaf that had not been opened...the integrity of the crust kept the moisture inside, and the bread, while not as perfect as when it came out of the oven, was delicious. Try doing that with any other "artisan" bread from another place, and in 3 days, you will have a brick, even unfit for toast. I would like to thank Chad for showing the world what bread our ancestors ate, and what it is supposed to be. There so much garbage posing as great bread in the world, Tartine's loaves are just superior in every way.

GOOD. GRIEF. I will never be able to eat a ham and cheese croissant without comparing it to the perfection of the Tartine version. It was perfect. Nice and buttery, perfectly salty from the ham and the cheese, warm and a little gooey. Even writing about it is making me sad because I want to eat one right now. Sigh. Also the best antidote to a hangover I've ever had. I felt immediately better upon scarfing that flaky, delicious, pastry down. Everything else was amazing as well--the chocolate croissant, the morning bun (oh emz--lightly sweet with a touch of orange), the ganache tarts. I can't talk about it anymore. I'm getting too sad that I don't have them in front of me. I'd walked by before during a previous trip to SF but kept going due to the intimidating line. This last time I did not let that deter me. I was dead set on getting a box of pastries to take in the car for our ride down the Pacific Coast Highway to LA. Best decision I've made in some time. We went on a Friday morning and the line was still out the door but the line moved relatively quickly and the staff was incredibly helpful (even as I hemmed and hawed over what to get). The space is relatively small so eating in seems like it might be tough but for takeout it was perfect. I drooled over all the cases as I got closer and walked out with two boxes of stuff (a big box of pastries and a small box of sweet treats). Totally worth the wait and the (somewhat high) price for those delicious morsels. I'm already looking into getting my friend out in SF to overnight me some croissants. I'm jonesing, y'all!

The wait caused so much suspense. I was really upset when the almond croissant that I ordered was burnt. It was so hectic in there and I got it to go and when I sat down in the park, I pulled out my almond croissant and I couldn't eat it, it was so burnt. Things get burnt all the time, just don't put them out for sale. I won't be excited to come back.

Tartine doesn't need another review to convey how good it is.  They have amazing looking pastries and I want to try each and every one of them at one point.  This is the kind of place where people wait half an hour for a small bite. Its crowded, but its worth the wait if you're with good company.  Anything you get will be more than satisfactory.  Cheers!

Yippee!  Finally got to taste the zesty orange morning bun. I've been here for other delightful baked goods, but never the morning bun. We had lunch up the block, and strolled over around 12:30pm.  Walked right in, looked over, and Eureka!  Morning buns! We got the last emptied table for two near the front door. Ordered the morning bun with a cup of coffee.  Coffee carafe located in the corner and you fill your own cup.  Free coffee refills too. Listed in the 7x7 SF magazine 100 things to try 2012 list, I totally agree.  Buttery, sweet, flaky, it was scrumptious.   Previously I've raved about Starter Bakery's kouign amann French pastry, but now this morning bun has taken the trophy.  I could eat one of these every day.

I've made two stops to Tartine's. The first time, we came on a Saturday around 5pm, since that's when we heard they have fresh bread. However, there was a huge line out the door, so I would advise not coming at this time. Especially since by the time we got to the front, they had sold out of most of their bread, and had few pastries left. I ended up buying a frangipane tart and a half loaf of sesame bread. The frangipane tart was great! It's made of berries with a flaky crust and almonds on top. The bread has a really hard crust, and as I dont typically like the crust, I wasn't that fond of the bread. The second time I came by was around 1pm, and I bought a morning bun. It has a slight lemon taste to it, and they cover it with a course sugar. It's messy to eat, but pretty good. Of everything I tried, I was most impressed with the frangipane tart. I'd still come back to try an eclair, and their olive bread. But the only thing I would get again would be the tart.

Normally i wouldn't spend $20 on pastries, but when you're on vacation throwing $20 bills everywhere seems normal. There was line out the door when we arrived but it moved quickly enough. Unfortunately they were out of plain croissants but we still walked away with an almond one, a morning bun, quiche, a couple coconut macarons, and two coffees. We scarfed it all down and enjoyed every second of it.

If you want to be in the door when they open, arrive 20 minutes before they open. At 8:40 on Sunday, we were number 9 in line. At 8:45, over 10 people at joined the line, in just 5 minutes. At 9, they opened up and we were inside and ordering soon after. The morning buns are delicious and really moreish. The almond croissant was the only disappointment, it had been baked too long or on too high a heat and was really crunch and not that soft and nice. The lemon square was tart and so delicious and rich. The banana cream park is really nice and the walnut brownie, I am yet to try. Pity I live 8 hours drive away, but will definitely be back if I am back in Frisco. For photos, I wrote about my visit here http://jenhowes.wordpres…

Okay, so let me just start by saying that I used to always come here. In fact quite regularly. But I haven't been here in about three years because the line is just too damn long. There were always lines, but never like it is now . I blame this on Yelp. In fact, I think Yelp has really ruined a lot of good things for me. With that said, their chocolate chip cookie is divine. Thin, crispy, and chewy. For $2 (probably more now), it's not cheap, but it's well worth it. Their other sweets are usually pretty good, some are just meh. I recently had a couple of their cakes at a friends house, and the chocolate one was ridiculously heavy. I mean, like one bite of it and I needed coffee or tea. I finished around half a small slice before I had to stop. It was good, just too rich and heavy. The savory stuff is pretty decent. Their croques and sandwiches, I don't think I've ever disliked one. Sadly, my relationship with Tartine is over. Life is too short to be spending much of it in lines. Thanks a lot, yelp...

*sigh* The thought of Tartine Bakery just brings a pleasantly warm feeling over me... Similar to that which the San Francisco sun brings me mid-day, perhaps while i'm out in Dolores Park, Tartine Bakery treats in hand... This amazing corner bakery is humble. Authentic. Connected to it's roots. Real. Homey. Comforting. Bare bone. When walking into Tartine Bakery, the baked goods are front and center. Yea, there is a coffee bar in the right/back corner, but once your section of the line creeps in through the doorway --- it's all about the goods... I've had the Morning Bun and the croissant (no chocolate ones were available for devouring on the day of my visit :() ... and unfortunately nothing else yet... The Morning Bun... Zesty... Sugar covered (in a churro-esque kinda way.) Soft. Moist. Still warm when I had it. Was magical... These are the kinda treats that stay with you... That make you long for that corner, no matter where this journey we call life may take you... The Croissant... Warm to the touch... Shatteringly flaky... The individual layers could be seen when cut in half... It was like an architectural work of art... A baked good put together by the hands of an amazing craftsman... But, approachable.... You see this croissant, and what you don't feel, is that sense of delicate-ness (and I mean this in the most positive of senses...) It begs to be enjoyed... Again and again... My cousin and I got lattes for there, and they were served in splendid mugs... We sat by the coffee bar as it was actually a bit full, even on a Friday morning... I grabbed the mug with two hands, and the warmth of the latte pulled me in for a sip... It was as if I was hugging the mug, and the latte just hugged me right back... A landmark of the San Francisco food scene at it's absolute finest...

I love Tartine. I can proudly say this is the BEST bakery in San Francisco. Everything here is good and worth all the calories. I feel good every time I devour their buttery and flaky croissants. My other favorites include frangipane, chocolate cake, morning buns, bread pudding, croque monsieur, banana cream pie, etc. And the list goes on and on. The only downside is the line. I typically hate to wait for my food, so if the line is over 15-20 mins, I would rather come back later. The line gets very long on the weekends, so make sure you get here early to beat the crowd.

The croque monsieur and bread pudding were amazing. Well worth the line-up. I will be going back for these 2 items again and again. Everyone raves about the morning bun but I thought it was nothing special. My boyfriend is an eclair connoisseur. He really eats eclairs at every opportunity and most of the time he's disappointed. However, tartine got it just right! I don't drink coffee but my boyfriend does. Even though it's four barrel he said it was not very good.  I thought $2.50 for a basic coffee is a bit pricy.

I poo-pooed Tartine for the longest time because there was so much hype surrounding it and the line that seems to always be curving around the block. But after moving into the neighborhood just a few blocks away and giving it more of a chance to shine through the hype, I have come around. Their ham and cheese croissant is TO DIE FOR, a very special pastry. Other pastries I have had there are also quite good, especially the pound cake. But the croissants... oh, the croissants, so fantastically delicious! Just don't expect to be able to snag a table, as it's virtually always packed; take your pastries home or to the park to savor.

The breakfast bun is honestly amazing here.  I'm a big fan of hearty heavy desserts and sweets, so I'm more of a cinnamon bun person but once I heard that Tartine was know for their morning bun I had to get it.   Crispy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside.  Sugary but still a little tangy from the orange zest on top.  A perfect breakfast for someone with a sweet tooth, but also for someone that isn't obsessed with sweets because it's so light.   My boyfriend got the croissant with the ham and he picked out the ham and said it taste better without it.   Also, the line here is a bit ridiculous.  We had to wait in line for about 30 minutes on a Tuesday just to order our breakfast. But that didn't really make a difference to me, crowds= good food.  I would happily wait in that line again to get myself another morning bun.

Food: Excellent.  If I was just writing a review on the food, I would give this place 5 stars.  My husband and I are obsessed with their croissants.  The are little drops of heavenly buttery, flaky goodness.  I can't have a croissant without comparing it to Tartine.  The morning buns are pretty good as well.  They have a slight hint of orange and cinnamon which blends so well.  Don't even get me started on the shortbread cookies...yum! Service: The people working there are just not friendly.  Our product is good, so deal with us, is the attitude given almost everything I walk into the store.  All of my orders have been to -go.  I'm not even in the store more then 10 minutes.  Don't forget customers and word of month grow your business.  Just a thought, but maybe you should be a little nicer.

Since the day my colleague recommended this place, I could not wait to give it a swirl. We finally had the chance to drop by on a Saturday afternoon. Needless to say, parking is a pain in the neck; we spent 20min just trying to find a parking space on the street. We were taken aback to see a long line just outside the bakery and it took us 30 minutes of wait time to enter this place. The bakery goods looked so enticing and the aroma was so tintillating that I almost passed out in glory. We finally decided to order a  Banana Cream Pie and it was magically delicious! I enjoyed every bit of the cripsy crust, bananas and the cream. Apart from being a bit on the pricey end, I LOVE this place and would definitely like to return to try more of their bakery goods.

I don't know of anyone who hates this place. This place is outstanding and amazing! not sure where to begin! Their bread pudding is incredibly amazing! they use seasonal fruits and give you the biggest proportions, and its hard to consume every last bite because it's sooooo filling. The food is great and some of their foods are priced on the high side but all worth it. Definately worth the money, and definately one of the best bakeries i have ever been to. If you like FREE FOOD, go to Tartine 30 minutes before closing, order some food, and wait until after they've closed and they'll  give you something for free!

So I am definitely singing a different tune... Maybe the hipsters got to me and made me a bitter Betty, but my eyes have been opened... My sister came into town and I thought she would really enjoy Tartine.  Now given my negative Nelly review before, you would think I would not come back for more... but the name says a lot and has won the hearts of many a foodie, so I figured it was time to bring the family.  We found a space just down the street on a Saturday morning at 9am.  Waited in line and took a gander at the menu before ordering. Croissant with gruyere and ham won my ass over.  :)  It was delicious.  Granted, the croissant was dark (I didn't say burnt) and buttery delicious... but it was just such a delicious and hearty breakfast to go with my cup of coffee (courtesy of Four Barrel).  My husband and sister were won over by the morning bun, which I am still not in love with. BUT as if the croissant wasn't enough, the tres leches cake really made me swoon!  There was some television program on a few months ago that featured Tartine as one of the best bakeries in the states and they talked a great deal about this tres leches cake.  Now, I LOVE tres leches and never have it enough... so after watching her detailed process, my curiosity got going and I knew I had to order a slice.  It was DELICIOUS.  Light, sweet, and perfect.  Pure perfection in a dessert.  Can't say much more.  If they have it available by the slice, BUY IT!   A coffee, morning bun, croissant with ham and gruyere, along with the slice of tres leches did put us around the $18 dollar mark... but this time I felt it was worth the experience. Go early.  Go with an open mind.  And go with an appreciation for food and you shouldn't be disappointed. P.S.  I could totally go for a slice of cake right now or any time of day.  Delicious...

I didn't get why people raved about the morning bun (it doesn't look that appetizing) but I figured I should at least try it once so I got it and it ended up being much tastier than expected.  I'm interested in trying their croissants next time.  Those looked delectable. My friend and I were severely disappointed they didn't have the banana cream pie/cake thing (apparently they don't make it on Mondays).  Instead we got the lemon tart which I thought was GREAT but my friend thought it was too lemon-y.   Must come back here (on any other day but a Monday).

San Franciscans love to wait in lines for good grub! Let's face it, regardless of the time of day or day of week you come to Tartine, be prepared to wait. BUT, the light at the end of the tunnel is... pretty much everything on their menu! So far, I've tried their Spicy Turkey hot pressed sandwich, Banana Cream Tart, Croissant, Chocolate Walnut cookie drop, and their giant chocolate chip cookie (I think it's about 6" in diameter). Here are my thoughts: Spicy Turkey sandwich - They say it takes about 20 minutes to serve upon ordering, but I remembered mine arriving in about half that time. It's served with a pickled carrot which I really didn't care for (it's a carrot that tastes like a pickle... meh), but the turkey sandwich is beyond fantastic. Spicy turkey topped with cracked pepper, provolone cheese love, spread with delish pesto in between buttery toast. The sandwich comes in 3 halves, so it's easy to share with another person. Banana Cream Tart - Fresh banana slices hidden inside a flaky pastry that's spread lightly with caramel and dark chocolate, and finally, topped with a huge dollop of lightly sweetened cream. The sweetest part of this dessert was definitely the filling inside that's mixed with the sliced bananas. Be careful, the tart is tough to break apart with your fork because the dark chocolate layered inside is hardened so you gotta use your hands sometimes. I loved this dessert; just sweet enough not to spike a diabetic's blood sugar ;) Croissant - Buttery, flaky, definitely not for the calorie-conscious (then again, you probably shouldn't come to Tartine if you are). To be honest, I'm not a great judge of croissants, for I don't eat them that often, but this one was delicious and leans on their  more affordable side of the menu. Chocolate Walnut cookie drop - Kind of tasted like a mixture of a cookie and brownie. On their cheaper side of the menu, and worth trying if you are a chocoholic like me. Giant chocolate chip cookie - Expensive, and definitely for sharing. It's a lighter cookie, for it's super thin, and can almost pass off as a wafer. Again, for the Tartine first-timers, be prepared to WAIT. But as many other Yelpers have mentioned, it's completely worth it. Better to take public transportation if you don't live in the Mission, because street parking is nearly impossible to find.

The items I wanted to try were not available when I came here. I guess I should've come in the morning. I didn't want to walk out empty handed, so I decided to try the rocher (meringue cookie) with cocoa nibs. Not to be crass, but my friend said it look like dried poop. The rocher was chewy and airy with a crispy exterior. Interesting texture, but I didn't really care for it. I will have to pay another visit in order to experience the wonderfulness of Tartine.

The food here gets 5 stars. They lost a star (or two) on service. This food and goodies at this French-style bakery surpasses anything I've experienced in Paris. We tried many items including the bread pudding (that day with raspberries and nectarines), the Croque Monsieur (nothing short of amazing), brownies, a couple different tarts, etc. Every item brought superlatives to our lips. There's no denying this is simply amazing, rapturous bakery. It's a given that this place is tiny and popular - you are going to wait in a line, usually a long one, and you aren't likely to find a seat. Also be forewarned that the place is expensive. The service was split. The two red-haired women were accommodating and sweet but outside of those two we were treated as if they were doing us some kind of favor. One was so bitchy that my children commented on it. The woman at the register pretty much snapped at us and when they left an item off our order they were quick to blame us and seek additional payment. Everyone in our party of six independently brought up the poor attitude of the service.

Tartine captures many of the ups and Debbie Downers of eating out in SF. The food: Everything is delicious! The almond croissant is life-changing! There's orange zest in the morning buns! This quiche is incredible! I love Tartine! Buuuuuuut ... it took me thirty minutes to get inside! Everything costs double what you expect it should! The almond croissant is over four bones! This quiche costs 38 clams! Debbie Downer. Wah-wuuuuuuuuh. The people: Hey, these people are pretty and hip and cool! That girl's tattoo is great! Why don't plain white shirts look like that on me?! We could totally be friends! I love Tartine! Buuuuuuuut ... is that mustache really necessary? Did I just get attitude from bangswoman! Seriously, why don't plain white shirts look like that on me?

I can't sit down! Those fools aren't even eating anymore! Even the outside seating is taken! And it's so cold outside! It's 8 a.m. in San Francisco! Debbie Downer. Wah-wuuuuuuuuuh.

I got here around 8am one Thursday morning to buy pastries to deliver to some of my friends who work in the city. Since it was early and a weekday, there wasn't much of line. I got about 15 pastries of a few varieties, but only personally got to try the morning bun and frangipane croissant. The morning bun lived up to expectations. The pastry was flaky on the outer layers, but soft inside. The orange and cinnamon also came together well to make the flavor interesting instead of just plainly sweet. The frangipane croissant was pretty big. More importantly, it was DELICIOUS. I have no idea what goes into the almond paste thing, but it was so addictive. I think I actually liked this better than the morning bun. I would give this place 5 stars if the girl serving me hadn't looked so annoyed when I asked her if I could have a few paper bags for the pastries (I got mine in a huge box cos there were so many, but since I was bringing it to people at various locations I thought having small bags would be helpful). Maybe it was a little troublesome, but there were no more than 3 people behind me in line, so I didn't think it was so bad... ): I still love this place though, and will come again, even if it means waking up super early to avoid the long wait in line!

**Review is strictly based on the coffee/service** My friend and I decided to make use of a nice sunny day to take our dogs for a playdate at Dolores Park. Being the adults who needed some extra boost in energy, we wanted to drop by Tartine Bakery to get some iced Blue Bottle coffee. My friend goes inside to order our drinks while I wait outside with the pups and when she comes out with coffees in hand, we walk towards the park. As I look at the drink, I notice I can see some milk particles floating around in the drink and asked my friend what milk was used. She said the iced coffees were already pre-made and they weren't even cold when given to her (she had to ask for more ice to be put in). Seriously, WTF - the coffee wasn't even fresh?! Dare I say, I actually tried the coffee and when I drank it, it tasted SOUR. I could barely taste any coffee - it just tasted like sour liquid. The sourness was definitely indicative of spoiled milk. After the first couple sips, I had to throw it away. It just wasn't drinkable and later my stomach actually started to hurt. Coffee isn't that hard to make, Tartine. Please get it together before you poison someone.

We got here on a Sunday morning, about 5 mins before Tartine opened and there was a line wrapped along the sidewalk.  We weren't overly concerned since we were just trying to pick up some pastries to go.  The line went fairly quickly and we spent the time oogling the pastries and trying to decide what to get. We decided on the Banana Cream Tart, the Lemon Tart, a morning bun and the croque monsieur with ham and asparagus.  I also got a hot chocolate for myself.   The banana cream tart was wonderfully light and not overly sweet.  The lemon tart was tangy and tasty but denser than the banana tart.  The morning bun was pretty good but was cold.  When we got back to our room, I popped it in the microwave for a few seconds and it was AMAZING.   The croque monsieur was yummy as well.  I loved the hearty and crusty bread with the bechamel sauce. The hot chocolate was not really something I enjoyed.  But I would definitely come back to try other pastries if I'm ever in SF again!

Went on a Saturday around noon or so, and the line was out the door however it did move fast. I ordered the lemon tart, macaroon, oatmeal cookie, a croissant, morning bun, and a macchiato. (I did not consume everything in one day lol). Everything was delicious.

I got the morning bun. These were pretty good. Flaky and lightly sprinkled with sugar on top. It was also glazed with some citrus fruit which made it even more delicious. The prices are a bit too strong though. I would go and try other things another time.

In terms of tastiness, my morning bun was good. It had the mild complexity of orange zest and cinnamon sugar and flakiness of buttery goodness. Points for you. Although, Tartine has managed to gain another review about the customer service issue and snobbiness. I've worked in the food industry before and understand that shitty customers can ruin your day or even permanently jade your outlook on even bothering with good customer service. But really guys. We patronize your store and we support your paycheck. A little common courtesy and kindness would be appreciated. Or even an acknowledgement that I exist I suppose?

Screw you Tartine and your ridiculously popular and delicious bread.  I got there at freaking 4:45 and it was already sold out and I had to get the "not as popular" buckwheat bread which is freaking fantastic!  If this is the "not as popular" bread how amazing must the country bread be?!?!?!  I. Can't. Stop. Thinking. About. You.  Even the puppy goes CRAZY for the bread like it's crack.  The only other time the dog has been this cracked out on food is the foie gras dog biscuits at Bouchon Bakery (yes, the pup is spoiled).  He went all crazy and did ALL of his tricks (shake hands, spin, orbits around me, sits, lays down, runs to the rug, cleans up his toys) just for one small bite of this bread. This bread is crack.

As a SF native, I feel like a poser having never had anything at Tartine. I've been to every other place on that gourmet corridor (Delfina Pizzeria, Delfina Restaurant, Bi-Rite), but not Tartine.   Now that I've had Tartine, turns out... I wasn't missing out on anything at all.   I tried the morning bun, banana cream tart, and frangipanne croissant. I seriously don't see the big deal. It's not that they're bad, but I expected fireworks to shoot out of my head with Tartine having been listed on 7x7's list every year. And these pastries were EXPENSIVE! I'm used to overpriced things in SF, but 4 pastries for $19 is absolutely absurd.

I like this place. I want to love it... but in all honesty, I don't think it's good enough. I know, I just broke a lot of people's hearts. Listen, your morning bun is good, but not amazing. Nothing I've tried, including the croissants, the sandwiches, the bread pudding, the fromage blanc bavarian, the banana cream tart, the shortbread, the friand, the rocher... (I've tried a lot) has made me love this place. There is one item I do love though, and that's the Summer Fruit Bavarian. That shit's the bomb, but it only comes during the summer. Maybe if it came year-round, I could give this place 4.5 stars, but honestly, it costs way too much! I think Tartine's a good place; don't get me wrong. I just don't think it's as amazing as people (and lines) make it out to be.

Why 5 stars?  Because it's consistently the best breakfast I've ever had.   ---   ---   --- Nearly two years removed from my first experience, Tartine proves to have the best Ham-n-Cheese croissant ever created.  I'd put it up against any croissant I've ever tried...and even things I haven't tried.  What's up France?  We've got you beat at your own game! As was the case in the summer of 2010, I enjoyed said croissant, along with a banana tart.  I went to Tartine twice on this trip and found out the hard way that the tarts are not ready until around 9am.  I was sure to go back the next day a little later on in the morning.   I tried the latte and the cappuccino.  Both were super.  It's very impressive to watch them pour the latte in the form of some kind of flower/tree.  I know a lot of places are doing that, but I'm easily impressed.  As many others have noted, make sure to bring some cold hard cash if you want to get caffeinated up, as the coffee bar is cash only.   I will go to Tartine Bakery every single time that I visit San Francisco, without exception.  I can't wait for my next trip.

I've heard really good things about Tartine; in particular, the breakfast pastries. So, I stopped by Tartine on my way to the Bart Station one Saturday. It was around noon and there was a line---There is almost always a line when I pass by this place. I was behind maybe 10 -15 people and waited for about 30-40 minutes. However, when I reached the counter and looked at the food, my impatience was taken over by excitement. I bought a morning bun and a scone to go. I didn't plan on finding any seating but I can tell you that finding seats is difficult. There are many small tables but the turnover rate is slower than other places. The morning bun was perfect. It was just lightly sweetened with this citrus glaze. The scone was just as good, nice and doughy, but still light. I need to go pack for the croissants.

I'm a French guy who love good croissants, so I went to this famous bakery to see if it was really as good as popular. First, the wait is really long, it's super crowded so it's stressful, any change (like heating up the croissant) takes forever, and in the end, the croissant was ultra heavy and fat - absolutely not refined. I really think I prefer eating a croissant at Starbucks (and trust me, I'm very picky when it comes to croissants). A little bit disappointing. PS: In French, "tartine" is how we call toasts with butter and jam :)

The Main squeeze (so corny) went out with a friend for lunch & brought home some Morning buns.  I had mind before the night was even over.  The bun was crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, & not too sweet.  I really liked the orange flavor which was subtle but just enough to add a new layer of flavor to the whole thing.

I absolutely love the croquet monsieur sandwiches served with picked carrots. The ham sandwich is super good, but I have to admit they aren't shy with the mustard and it made my eyes water a little.

For starters: we split a warm bread pudding with fresh fruit Lunch: Spicy Turkey - Peppered turkey breast, provolone, broccoli rabe pesto - this thing is huge and pretty tasty. Drinks: Iced Green Tea - free refills but you have to bring your glass to them to fill it up Dessert: cafe mocha There isn't a lot of seating available inside but we got there just before noon and found a table.  There is outdoor seating which is great in the summer, but not so much during winter. Don't forget to bus your own table =) Lunch for two = $50

To call an establishment my favorite bakery in the world is quite a statement, I know, but believe me, I am not exaggerating. I have been to an obscene number of bakeries throughout my life and this one tops them all. While I do have a favorite American Bakery, French Bakery, etc, Tartine is my favorite bakery overall. During my first and unfortunately my only visit thus far, I sampled about 8 different items with the help of my family. The croissant, morning bun, and chocolate croissant were the best breakfast pastries I have ever had in my life! A hot and frothy cappuccino went perfectly with these treats. The whole wheat bread was absolutely amazing. It was chewy and hearty on the inside and had the perfect amount of crunch on the outside. Bread like this puts grocery store bread to absolute shame. The lemon cream tart is, what a surprise, the best lemon tart I have ever had. It might sound ridiculous that I am calling all of these things my favorite, but I stress that I am not exaggerating. I also tried the éclair, lemon meringue cake rectangle, devil's food cake round, and tres leches cake round. Needless to say everything was to die for. I am considering moving to San Francisco, right around the corner from Tartine, just so I have the option of eating there whenever I please. That my friends, is my dream in life. Tartine is a small business, and I am all about small businesses, especially in large cities where things tend to get swallowed up by the hustle and bustle of big business and traffic. Small eateries are the gems of a town. They add a unique flair to a busy street.

I finally got to tried the famous TARTINE! When we walked in around 3pm, it was packed!!! Good thing we found seats outside! I got the bread pudding and chai latte and my friend got the chocolate tart and latte. Okay- Bread pudding, I definitely liked my bread pudding with more bread texture than pudding. It is a bit too soggy for my taste, but nevertheless, the fruits were baked perfectly! Chai latte- definitely has enough spices, so thumbs up!! Chocolate tart- she loves it because it wasn't too sweet, and apparently the chocolate taste wasn't that apparent. Latte- She said it was one of the best latte she had in her life because usually when latte goes cold, it has a bad aftertaste, but this one still tasted well after it became cold!! I definitely can't wait to come back here and try the different desserts!!! Especially the famous morning bun that everyone seems to rave about!!

Oh, Tartine, how I hate your lines, and how they rouse me from my lazy Sunday mornings just so I can beat the crush of people! For that, you have my eternal ire, but really, it's only because I'm out here much less often than I'd like! I still remember my first time, where a friend and I ordered ~$75 worth of small pastries, taking bites out of almost all of them. These included their vegetarian quiche ($4.25), bread pudding ($3.50), banana cream tart ($6.50), pain au chocolate croissant ($4.25), frangipane croissant ($4.25), morning bun ($3.75), and a smattering of things to go. My most recent visit this past weekend included a subset of these, as well as a frangipane tart, to try something new. All things considered, their frangipane croissants are easily the winner of the bunch, with almost all the others vying for a close second. And considering I don't even like bread pudding, that's probably quite a feat they've accomplished here. The only things I'd really pass on are their coffee drinks, and their frangipane tarts, since the fruit completely overpowers the pastry. A few things to keep in mind: their banana cream tarts aren't what you would normally expect when thinking of banana cream pies, and are instead much lighter; prices may be a bit high, but their pastries are massive - one would be wise to split them up into several portions; they don't open until 9am on Sundays, but don't be surprised to see a long line even before doors open; and seating can be a bit tough to find sometimes, but don't be afraid to share a table!

As a visitor to SF, I was tempted out of my morning slumber by a coworker who wanted to take me to Tartine. He'd had "the best breakfast of his life" there recently, he said. Thus, he had vowed to make a pilgrimage from SoMa to the Mission every day for a cup of their coffee and something sweet to go. Though I've heard about Tartine's long lines, we showed up at 7:30 and strolled right up to the register. After seeing a gentleman hunched over a steaming brioche bread pudding piled high with peaches, I had to go for a cup. I grabbed a morning bun too, out of sheer gluttony and a desire to share it later. I also ordered a latte for purely scientific purposes: my coworker had assured me it was excellent. And it all was! Excellent, I mean. The latte was so big, it was practically served in a bowl, and the brioche bread pudding was so rich and sweet, it kept me full past lunchtime. But was it worth the morning trek from downtown? One long, crowded MUNI ride later, I had to wonder. I think if you're in the 'hood, visiting Tartine (along with Bi-Rite Grocery and Bi-Rite Creamery) is a great idea. But you can't really swing an all-organic baguette without hitting someplace delicious in SF; Tartine is simply a standout among them. So though my coworker's going back a third time today, one lovely breakfast at Tartine was enough for me.

OMG. the croissants are so big, and flakey and buttery and fluffy, with just the right amount of chew and crisp to them. yes, there is a line out the door, but it usually moves quickly. however, getting a table may be another issue. hopefully, other patrons will be courteous enough to finish their goods in a timely manner so that others can also indulge in their gluttony while sitting down. i got the ham and cheese croissant. my bf for the chocolate croissant. i hear there are many many other great things to eat, like tarts. dont bother with the brioche bread pudding. you'll be so disinterested in that pudding after your first bite of the croissants. you have to go. and buy extra for the rest of the day. and then, walk around the corner to wash down all that sugary buttery deliciousness with a scoop of bi-rite ice cream.

I've been going to this place since it opened, well before there was a line. Yes the baked goods are good, but on balance I think it only deserves one star.  Why? 1.  It's filthy.  They act like they are doing you a huge favor to bus a table. I'm amazed the Heath Department hasn't stepped in.   2.  The service is horrible.  There's a reason they have a long line, and it has little to do with popularity.  They just don't care.  That starts with the owners and trickles down.  Don't believe me?  Note that they have two cash registers.  The next time you wait 45 minutes observe whether the second one is in use.   3.  It's horribly over-priced.  You can get breakfast pastries for 40% less within half a block. Tartine is for suckers.  Line up and be one of them.

Tartine, you're no longer a unicorn to me! I've passed, discussed, and planned to come numerous times, but the dreaded line out the door and packed tables had deterred me all these years. A friend and I made plans to FINALLY taste the treats. Verdict: + Almond Croissant- SO goood, huge, flakey, filled with good yumminess, slightly more toasty on the bottom than preferred, but ... I still ate it ;) ++ Gougère- I could eat you ALL DAY LONG. Crisp on the outside, chewy, airy inside + Orange cinnamon morning bun- WIN, huge, chunks of refreshing flavor, crispy ++ Bread pudding- Delightful, light, perfectly sweet, love the seasonal fruit ++ Banana Cream Tart- YUM, after breaking into this one, I didn't want to stop. The layer of chocolate on the inside coating the crust was brilliant! We skipped out of the crowded bakery and headed to the sunny park. Bliss :)

Chocolate croissants. Do it. Now. Best you'll find on this side of the Atlantic, and that's a promise. Last time I was there, I was buying them for the office and literally bought every one they had.

Fresh cream, fresh banana, dark chocolate, crunch crust!!! Perfecto!!!! I savored the moment I devoured this pie. It was huge and I did not think I would finish it but I did.

This is the best croissant I have ever had in my life. No joke. It is the perfect blend of crispy flaky texture with a soft chewy bite. You have to try it. I also got the chocolate chip oatmeal cookie, and usually I don't like hard, thin, crunchy cookies, but this is the first cookie that won me over. The crunchy texture along with the chocolate chip and oatmeal flavor really was perfect and i thought I would never admit this, but i think i taste better crunchy then soft. Overall: Must -Go Bakery, I just need to go back to try the amazing other treats they have there.

I will not wait 45 mins for bunch. I'm not in NYC where's there's a wait for everything and I don't believe that this place is so much more superior than others to warrant such a wait. SF has many more local eats that aren't crowded with tourists. So why did I give it 4 stars? Banana cream pie. That is the only reason. Although good, everything else here is a bit over priced. The whipped cream feels like eating a rich wonder cloud. The crust is a perfectly crunchy and the bananas just taste perfect with the cream. If you go, get the pie! Tip: Go early in the day or they will run out. Happened to me twice. Third time was the charm.

While going through photos, The Man just showed me one he took when we were at Tartine last week and I just kind of made a pathetic sad sound because I know that I won't get to go back there for ages. Which, while good for my waistline, is bad for my heart. Or soul. It's probably good for my heart actually. The Gougere was from another planet, so cheesy and soft, he ordered one, but I nearly ate it all and vowed to learn how to make them (Tartine has a cookbook yo!). The eclair we ordered was hands down, like, by miles, the best eclair I've ever put in my mouth. The vanilla custard was full of black specs of vanilla bean and tasted like pure comfort food heaven (I'm a sucker for a good custard). The chocolate on that sucker was perfect. It was full, dark, and the perfect balance of sweet and dark. OMG, I want another one NOW. We had just been to Four Barrel Coffee that morning and weren't impressed with it, and when I found out that's what they served at Tartine, I was disappointed but hopeful that a better barista might make a difference. Unfortunately, I'm just not a fan of Four Barrel. But that's totally OK because I am so not there for the coffee. Tartine will be a go to destination on any future trips to the bay area because I am 100% down with that shiznat.

I arrived late Friday afternoon to see a small line at the door.  It moved fairly quickly, but I had enough time to study the bakery case. Items are displayed beautifully. I selected a banana cream tart and a couple of chocolate chip cookies. The only bread available was a walnut loaf so I ordered that.  Service was pretty efficient. Cafe itself was crowded with no seats available...I wouldn't eat there since tables are smooshed together and this appears to be the type of place where people meet and hover.  I don't have the patience for that.  I can't enjoy a pastry with people literally looking over my shoulder. Chocolate chip cookies were thin, crispy, and huge (about 7 in. diameter).  I shared the cookie with my sister who did not like the slightly overbaked taste.  I actually liked that aspect of the cookie. Banana cream tart had a bright banana flavor.  Husband and mom had a taste and both said that they did not prefer the bitter chocolate shavings on the tart.  Being naturally contrary again, I actually enjoyed the pairing of chocolate and banana. Walnut bread was a large country style loaf - freshly baked with a wonderful aroma and crunchy, dense crust.  Would be wonderful sliced and buttered or for  grilled cheese sandwiches. Highly recommended. All in all, first experience at Tartine was fine.  Total for all was about $20, so any future indulging on my part would have to be carefully considered.

I tried 4 things and the best by far is the bread pudding. I got a cup but should have for the bowl. I am spelling this completely wrong but The franjappan was my second favorite. You don't see almond and blueberry together often and the flavor is moist deliciousness.  we had 1 Red Roobious tea which was normal but served nicely. I went on a Tuesdat 2pm.  There were 7 people in line at the time.  I was able to get a table for two and put a baby strioller at the end.  I doubt I would be able to do that here at any other time.  I was happy it worked out!

Tartine!! OMG YOU ARE SOO GOOD. I had the bread pudding with strawberries on it in a cup (they have 2 sizes this is the smaller one and they also rotate thru fruits.) I would recommend splitting food here just so you can try all the different baked goods and even entrees (sandwiches). The bread pudding is amazing and they make it so it is a sweet custard like taste. Not too soggy though. The croquet monsiers looked AMAZINGGGGG there but we got croissants and while there are maybe 4 different types I prefer savory over sweet so I tried the ham and cheese one. It was a perfectly well baked croissant and inside of it was spiral of ham and cheese. Great portions and great for eating in general. They had a decent amt of drinks and I got the ice coffee which was very good. Then I also the spicy turkey sandwich while my friend had the meat/cheese one below that. Mine was amazing!! It comes in 3 portions (big portions with the famous and amazing bread) and then also comes with a pickled carrot. You order all your food and then these sandwiches are brought to you...our took about 20 mins since it was very crowded there. My sandwich had the perfect speckles of pepper for a kick and then the turkey and the spinach were a great combination. The bread is by far the most perfect bread (to be toasted) and while you may spend the rest of your life at the gym and the rest of the day in a food coma. This place is def worth it. I can't wait to try all the other sandwiches and some of the cakes The service was amazing the woman working by the register was super nice in giving me a takeaway cart and helping me bus all my random dishes so I could pack it away neatly

As we near the 10th anniversary of the opening of this wonderful Mission district establishment, let us take a brief stroll down memory lane and remember how Tartine became what it is today. Pastry power couple and coowners, Elisabeth Prueitt and Chad Robertson, left their Point Reyes neighborhood back in '02 where they first planted their roots at Bay Village Bakery and took over the 18th and Guerrero space.  Little did they know they were at the forefront of a croissant revolution. It was during the beginning of this decade when the Dolores Park area was reinventing itself, after the successful renovations of Bi-Rite Market and the unprecedented success of the Italian eatery Delfina were both occurring.  This neighborhood was truly preparing itself for a major facelift. The couples' first book, "Tartine", was critically acclaimed as a success in '06 (which happens to be available for perusing while having brunch at Zazie) which was quickly followed with James Beard award nominations for the both of them.  Victory finally came in '08. Chef Robertson's 2nd book, "Tartine Bread", goes into more detail around his infamous recipe for country bread, taking root from his culinary training first in New York and then abroad in France. Today, people from all over the Bay Area, let alone the country, seem to willingly wait for the amazing croissants or croque monsieurs, a true piece de resistance.

Arrived for my first visit around 8:45am on a Tuesday morning. We found a table easily although by the time we left at 10:15am there was a line practically out the door. Although not a full-on breakfast place we definitely left stuffed. We shared a small bread pudding and a large muesli. Definitely should have ordered the small as the muesli was huge and mixed with filling full-fat yogurt. Once we added on two bags of cookies, a latte and an apple juice we were at a $40 breakfast.   But it's ok because it was delish!

When I was a kid, I heard stories of how people in Russia would have to wait in long lines, just to buy simple things like bread and milk. It was unimaginable to me, what a sorry place, they had no choice but to stand out in the bitter cold for hours, just for a loaf of bread. So I have to laugh at myself and my self imposed capitalist counterpoint --waiting on a freezing Sunday morning for 45 minutes (i'm sorry, but the line does NOT move that fast) --for fancy pastries and butter laden pressed sandwiches. We live in a land of ludicrous plenty --how many other amazing bakeries are there? (Mission Beach Cafe and Delessio, to name a few in the hood)... --But there I willingly stood, with dozens of other suckers, waiting for my chance at a chocolate eclair. The wait wasn't so bad, because my husband just got me a new ipod nano and downloaded Dan Savage's podcast, so I had plenty to keep me entertained before my friend came. And I weathered the cold, because I was wearing my nice puffy north face down jacket (I may look ridiculous but I'm warm and you are not so shut up). But the problem with waiting in the cold for 45 minutes is two fold. One, you start thinking, this food better be damn good. I mean, I could've finished my croissant and be back in bed had I gone to Mission Beach Cafe. And is it so much better? ehhhrrrrmmmm.... It's definitely worth a 15 minute wait. But 45? Really? The second problem with the wait is that you can't just buy one cookie after waiting that long. You have to maximize the investment you made. For me, that meant buying gougeres, and a morning bun, and chocolate hazelnut tart, and a scone, and soppresata pesto pressed sandwich, and bread pudding, and a ham and cheese croissant. Do you see why this is a problem? Add in the tea and it was a 50 dollar expenditure. Of course I didn't eat it all in one setting or all by myself, but honestly, it's ridiculous. Which brings us to WHY it's ridiculous --the food itself is soooo rich. I literally ate a third of my sandwich, that was it. Because in addition to the soppressata, cheese, and pesto, the sandwich was pressed and grilled with butter (or maybe olive oil?  hope, hope?) so that it was crisp. The whole thing was just a brick of varying kinds of delicious fats. Note that I am not saying it's not delicious, it is. But it's SO heavy. And isn't it kind of cheating, like putting bacon on everything is just a shortcut to guarantee popularity?  In fact, the main saving grace on that plate was the spicy pickled carrot, which is a mark of genius, to balance the richness. So yes, Tartine is delicious. But when you see the line going past the front of their building, past the front of their kitchen, and past the house next to that, you really might want to remember those poor babushkas in Russia. Or your poor arteries. It's a great place, but maybe just a few times a year.

First, I was flabbergasted by the line that ran out the door and far down the side of the building at 10 am.  Second, I was shocked by the huge tubs of butter I watched them mixing through the store window.  However, once I took my first bite of their morning bun, it all made sense. That morning bun is fantastic.  Hints of orange swimming amidst bites of the crispy exterior alternating with the plush and soft insides, all equally delightful and delicious.  This is one of the most delicious, decadent pastries I have ever enjoyed. The chocolate croissant is also amazingly flaky (certainly in no small part to aforementioned tubs of butter), with tremendously generous amounts of Valrhona chocolate, more than I have ever seen in a chocolate croissant in a very long time. The croque monsieur was an afterthought, but a delicious surprise.  Cheese, asparagus, bread, spicy turkey - I told myself I was only going to have one bite (who could eat more after a morning bun AND a chocolate croissant?), but I couldn't help but go back for bite after bite until the croque monsieur was no more.

Everyone already knows about the bread pudding being awesome.  It's true and I have tried it.  However, what you need to also know is that their bread is REAL good.  They hide them in the back, so get a loft to enjoy at home.   This place will not change your life, sof if the wait is too long, just try another time.  It will make your enjoyment level much better! The restroom is really fancy for a bakery.

As you can probably judge by Tartine's large number of Yelp reviews, it's a popular place (and that's an understatement). Be prepared for the line to go out the door (and the seating inside to be crowded), but luckily, the line moves fairly quickly. Things I've tried on several occasions: - bread pudding: dense, thick, and creamy; they add a fair amount of berries, which is a nice touch - morning buns: for all the good things I had heard about the morning buns, they were slightly disappointing. They were described by a friend as a cinnamon bun except without the sticky cinnamon - indeed, mine came out rather dry and wasn't as delectable as hoped. - walnut drop cookies: excellent! think of them as chocolate bliss compacted in a small bite. - brownies: also wonderfully chocolate-y The bakery is also a little pricey, but it's definitely worth trying if you're passing by Dolores Park/Mission area!

Perfection! I loved the space, the communal tables, the conversation, and the food. I cannot say enough! The first visit I had the quiche ( amazingly fluffy, the best I have ever had) when I had my first bite I had to find someone to express my pleasure to, being alone, I was thankful for the friendly guy seated across from me! I also had the almond croissant. Oh whAt I would give for one now...and every morning! Two days later, I was back for the ham and cheese croissant, bread pudding and a morning bun. Next visit to San Francisco, it will be the coconut tart for sure!!!

3,299 reviews weren't quite enough, so I decided to be the 3,300th person to affirm that yes, Tartine is a very special place indeed.   Yes.  Everything, absolutely everything, is absolutely perfect.   And, when I die, I hope that wherever I end up is catered by Tartine's because I know I will want a slice of their purest most chocolate-gasmic chocolate fudge cake I've ever tasted!   Pricey?  Hell yes!  But so, so worth it!

Yes, it's good.  Yes, you should make the journey and wait in the space mountain line.  But, don't expect the people on the other side of the counter to be as excited about the experience as you.  They are not.   Enjoy the Pain au Chocolate early when it comes out of the oven and the chocolate is still supple.  The bread pudding can be amazing or just really good but it's worth it, too.  There are some rare days when they use the left over pain au chocolate with bananas and caramel for the bread pudding.  That's the best of the best (Eric Roberts couldn't touch it).

Advice to first timers to Tartine: Try to come here before 1pm if you want their best goods, and before 10am if you want to guarantee it.  That pretty much means their morning bun (dyam that orange zest!!!), croissants (butter HEAVEN), coconut or banana creme pie, quiche, or bread pudding (I dont' love their bread puddings, but my aunt does), and gougeres.  I love these things so much I bought Elizabeth's cookbook to learn how to make the croissants, and of course I got the bread book when it came out (one of my favorite reads of all time!). And don't you ever, ever, go the few days before a major holiday (ie Thanksgiving or Christmas).  They will run out of everything they have that is good, which means you're left with those weird friande things or their hazelnut torte, or mexican wedding cakes which are good, but not  what Tartine is worth the journey for.  Then you'll get all grumpy you paid like 7 dollars for something that's not what you wanted and a medicore latte, on top of that obnoxious hipster service (i'm just kidding, most of the girls there are very sweet).  They won't even have country bread, which is usually sold out a week before the holidays.  They might have their croques left, but let's face it, their croques aren't that awesome, you'd probably rather have an entire loaf of that country bread or their pressed sandwiches. Shout out to their pressed sandwiches.  I always get the one with the rapini and sopressata.  *drools thinking about it* Oh and one more thing, if you don't know about their country bread, you gotta call in and reserve a loaf 72 hours before hand.  Or come around 4:45 day of, get your ass in line, and make sure that you are one of the first ones there as soon as it comes out of the oven.  IT'S SOOOOO worth it, because the deliciousness of the bread decreases exponentially the longer you wait to put it in your mouth.  trust.

(I had only been to Tartine before for a croissant & cappuccino and the like.) My mother had passed & given her slice of cake to me. She wanted it back after trying a bite. I reluctantly obliged. haha And I asked for seconds too! There will be no usual leftovers when it comes to this cake as there are so often with your run of the mill cakes. I would love to eat a huge slice right about now. :-) I love passion fruit!

My husband and I finally paid a visit to Tartine this weekend. I have to say I am torn on 3 stars or 4. We arrived a little after 4:30 on Saturday and there was already a line out the door. I immediately jumped out of the car to jump on line and my husband was on a mission to find parking. I would say it took about 20-25 minutes to make my way up to the counter and for my husband to find parking. After waiting in line and wanting to try Tartine for months we decided to order a variety of items. We ordered the following: ~1 Small Frangipane Tart : It was a flaky pastry filled with boysenberries, almond paste and citrus flavors. Delicious with a cup of coffee or a tea! ~1 Bostock (Recommendation from the girl helping us): Toasted slice of brioche bread filled/stuffed with almond paste, orange jam, topped with sliced almonds and powered sugar. Also great with a cup of coffee or tea. ~Brownies (3 per bag): We decided they were more like thick squares of fudge topped with walnut halves. Overall,, the pastries were very good, brownies not worth the $8. Now for the bread.... Each day they have 3-4 breads to choose from. All large, rustic loaves. ~Country Bread: Large rectangle shaped loaf. Warm right out of the oven and crusty. We were thrown off how strong the sour was. We would prefer less sour or no sour at all. Makes a great grilled cheese! ~Walnut Bread: Also a large, rectangle shaped loaf. Same as the country bread with walnuts. We felt like it was missing something but we plan to try making french toast with it. ~Sesame: Large, round loaf, top covered with sesames and inside also included sesames. Were looking forward to heating some up for dinner or perhaps for breakfast. Less sour taste compared to the country. ~We also ordered a wheat but they were apparently out already. Breads are $8.25 for country & $8.75 for all others. The long line, timing of bread ready and parking makes us lean more towards 3 stars oppose to 4. Our total bill was $68 for 6 loaves of bread (bought a few for family), 2 pastries and a bag of brownies. Not expecting to walk out spending that much! Another reason why I vote it a 3.

This is my second time visiting SF and I was so keen on eating the baked goods at Tartine again. I had its morning bun previously ... And it was so unforgettable! I took my family here to celebrate Mothers' Day. The line at 3pm was quite insane but it moved really quickly. Also, we managed to snag a table as most people were taking the baked goods away. They didn't have any morning buns left ... Nor banana cream tart ... Which was slightly sad :( Ordered: (1) croissant (one of the best croissants eaten in my life - comparable to the Parisienne standard), (2) croque monsieur with ham (I highly recommend this ... 3 layers of ham, long beans and cheese on top of perfectly baked baguette), (3) brioche bread pudding (Ahhhhh ... My sister and I were very awed by its moderate sweetness, softly baked fruit toppings and tender custard!) and (4) frangipane tart (the almond nuts were so crunchy)! Tartine, please open up a brunch in New York, New York!

So basically at the Napa bridal shower last weekend, all we talked about were food and running. And after 10 years of not having run a single mile, I've begun to take up running. This is how persuasive my friends are. Similarly, we decided to hit up all the places they talked about on our way back down from Napa. A bunch of us are from LA, so it's not like we knew when we would get another chance to go on a foodventure in SF. Though we had just finished brunch at the Girl and the Fig in Sonoma, we were determined to hunt down the famed bread pudding and morning roll from Tartine. We happened to hit jackpot when we realized that Bi-Rite was just a block down, so clearly, we ended up hitting both one right after the other. The line was long at Tartine, but thanks to Yelp, we were reassured that the line would be fast and we'd be ordering in no time. Yelp stayed true, but boy, I wish someone would have warned up about the snippy lady that helped us (again, with the snippy San Franciscan remarks but hey, you know it's true). She had short black hair and the only one without a smile on her face. Since it was our first time, we asked about the morning rolls and she brusquely told us those were sold out hours ago and made us feel like we were asking her to pull a unicorn out of her ass. Then, I asked about the bread pudding because we didn't have time to stay and eat so we wanted to make sure we could get it to-go and it'd still be as great as people claimed. She gave us the, yeah, are you guys idiots and have never taken a thing to-go before look, and then she disappeared. What? But I wasn't finished ordering! So basically, another, much more pleasant, lady came to finish my order and then I was off. What a strange experience. I could deal with the snippy servers, but what really made me want to return were the amazing lemon poppyseed almond pound cake and the delicious strawberry bread pudding. Oh, and of course, I didn't get a chance to try the morning buns so that was enough reason to return. The poppyseed almond pound cake was the best I've ever had. It was extremely moist without being overbearingly sweet. Usually cakes that are too moist are drenched in syrup or something, but this was pure heaven. I could eat this every day for the rest of my life. It was THAT good. This is the only time I've felt bad for people that are allergic to nuts. The bread pudding was also exquisite. Even the day after, it was still one of the best bread puddings I've ever had. I can only imagine what it's like to have it fresh and served the way it's supposed to be served. Because we're nosy and observant people, we noticed this lady in front of us buying just one thing: the gougere. She waited in this darn line just for this small round bread?! It must be good. So, we asked her about it and she told us it's a cheesy hollow bread with lots of thyme. All I needed to hear was cheesy and it was in our bag. The gougere does have a strong thyme flavor, but it pairs well with the gruyere cheese. It's not overwhelmingly cheesy, but it is a nice savory snack to indulge in. Lastly, I also got a slice of the coconut passion fruit bavarian cake, the most expensive ($5.50) but the least enjoyable. The passion fruit was way too sour, and the coconut shreds were too hard. It was a strange combination that I wish I had decided against. Overall, if you're going to open up a French bakery, you better learn a few tricks from Tartine; they've done it right.

There is not one single thing I've tried from the Tartine Bakery which is not individually conceived/conceptualized/considered.   **Tartine Bakery = TB** Baking is a science.  In the TB forum each and every recipe appears to be individually reviewed and placed before a panel for reassessment and brainstorming.   The old world recipes seem to undergo something akin to genetic restructuring.  Their base ingredients are compared to what they lend to the overall composition, then reconsidered, reviewed for modern day equivalencies, redeveloped and reformulated.  The idea with these "refreshed" recipes is that we are to be given a hint of what they used to be to encourage flashes of "childhood memories just before we're overwhelmed with the "in-your-face" pleasure of what they've become.  It's as if 100's of years of experimentation has been performed helping each "so good it should be on the endangered species list" delight grow into a scientifically engineered. "more perfect" version of itself.  The intent of all this work?  That each days offerings are the best that ever was or ever will be.   My initial contact with TB happened like most great scientific successes happen.  By accident.  One day WE (JimmyV + MikeQ = WE) found ourselves tired and all buss-up.  In our exhausted, close to delirious state WE opted for a bus to our next destination and headed to the bus stop by TB.  In those days I was much heavier and mobility was a harsh challenge at best.  Also a harsh challenge was propping my large okole on those thin metal planks called seats at the bus stop!  Within 5-minutes I was over it.  I got up, waddled across the street and plopped my okole down at one of their tables.  I grabbed a dirty coffee cup from another empty table along with it's menu.   To casually assert my right to be at the table, I pretended I'd just had coffee and was now looking for a "sweet tidbit of tawdry deliciousness" to follow it with.  I perused the menu slowly as if looking for an old friend's obituary.  Then with all the drama i could muster, I sighed loudly, flipped the menu over and slapped it down on the table telling those around me through actions, "the only thing I would possibly ever eat is not on their menu".  Then, I saw a short statement in bold print on the back of the menu: "WE ADD $$$ TO ALL TABS SO WE CAN PROVIDE OUR WORKER'S WITH HEALTH INSURANCE"   Without even trying their "tender morsels of moist tempting goodness" they had me right then and there. Their idea on how to address the health care needs of their employees is based on the concept that good folk will help other good folk if given the chance.  Of course in the process their stomachs will be liquored with "so good it will strike you dumb" items.  TB banked on the soundness of their product and the nature of the good folk who would buy it.  Without exception they'd surcharge each customer's purchase.  Customers would be told upfront so they'd have a chance to go somewhere else if they disagreed.  Monthly that money would pay their health care premium. In my mind at the time of that visit, TB achieved what millions of dollars, ton's of worthless rhetoric and an arrogant group of over-paid politicians couldn't.  Their people had a need and they had to come up with a way to take care of that need.  In return, their people would take care of them through loyalty, trust and an excellent work product. I grabbed JimmyV's hand, marched right up to the line......well, down the street and around the corner to the beginning of the line, placed him in it and marched back to my table to sit and wait.  When he got to the door I joined him and WE stepped inside together.  It was like Christmas morning.  I unwrapped a package with a savory delight tucked deep inside of layers of ham and cheese tissue paper, pulled a small crunchy nougat of heavenly joy from my stocking, giggled and danced around happily with childish abandon as the lady behind the counter opened the back door to show me the cake that Santa had built for me.  I fell asleep that night clutching my favorite macaroon in one hand, chocolate smudges on my face from the cake and a piece of ham stuck to my t-shirt where it remained when it fell off the croque monsieur.   That first visit turned me into a child again.  When I go back now I stand there in the line and remember it.  See, your first Christmas remembered is a fantasy come true  You were too young to understand reality so it's a fantasy that has lived on in you.  For me, TB will always remain that way, a child's fantasy that lives on in me.  It's too perfect to be real.  Yes, TB uses science to create their products not elves.  But it is a science that transcends reality and becomes a fantasy fixated in your mind.  Just like that first Christmas remembered when you danced with childish abandon.

Food coma!  Lol!  This place is amazing!!!   I was so excited to try this place and during my 24 hour trip to san francisco I made sure to have my cousin bring me here.  I kept picking things out that I wanted to try.  Mostly cookies.  I tried the coconut creme tart and it was soo good.  Cookies were delicious!  I took a few home with me.  Ended up ordering the cheese sandwich and it was delicious!   It's a very large sandwich so if you can't eat that much like me then it might be a good idea to share.  Coffee was delicious as well!  Definitely a place to stop at while in the bay area!

I took my sister to Tartine for lunch the other day, I'd never been before but had heard about it, and was constantly walking past the front door when the line would wrap around the corner of the street. We were lucky and missed the lunch crowed, whew.  She ordered the spicy turkey sandwich, which was good but not really spicy.  I had the pastrami sandwich, which was spicy and delicious.  Neither of us finished our sandwich because they were gigantic!  Seriously the largest sandwich I've ever had, we ate the leftovers for breakfast the next morning.  So if you're going to lunch, consider splitting a sandwich.

YUMMMMMMMMMM!!! The bread is so delicious. You have to come promptly at 4:30pm when the bread comes out if you want your pick of walnut, plain or olive. Since we got here at 6pm, we only had plain (country) as an option. However, it was still delicious. A huge loaf for ~$8. We asked the cashier what cheese we should get the bread. She wasn't very helpful, but did try to pitch the "Tartine" book since it has 100 recipes or something. We also got the eclair which was pretty darn good. I want to come back for the banana cream tart. Apparently, a lot things sell out quickly so come early!

Stopped in at Tartine after having Ike's and Bi-Rite since I was with a group of visiting friends and we were determined to have the creme de le creme that SF had to offer... so despite being stuffed, we had to stop and at least grab a few goodies to-go. The selection is pretty extensive, but I was here to try their morning buns - which they luckily still had in stock. The wait at ~1pm was out the door and probably 10-15 minutes long. The line was tightly packed up along the walls of the small interior and overall it was like being in a can of packed sardines... I would probably avoid ever dining in here due to how cramped everything is, unless it was a nice day and I could nab the 1 or 2 tables they have outside. The morning bun ($3.75) is quite large and the orange zest in there gives it a nice "wake-up its morning!" kick; however Tartine's morning buns also have an [overly] sticky and syrupy quality to them that I didn't care for as much. Maybe I shouldn't have heated it up in microwave? but I think I personally prefer the clean and crispy, fluffy morning buns from La Farine in Berkeley... but overall, this was a delicious and solid offering from Tartine I'm not sure if Tartine is quite "BEST BAKERY" ever title worthy if you ask me, but I'll probably stop by again since I frequent SF quite more often than Berkeley now-a-days... plus I'd like to try and see if their bread pudding and banana cream tart are worth the hype and Food Networks' claims of Tartine producing "The Best Thing I've Ever Ate".

Too much hype to live up to. The deserts here were of the same quality you would find at any decent bakery. I bought the bread also and the crust looks amazing but the bread itself was too sour for our tastes.

French and proud of our bread, i can say that Tartine bakery is one of the only bakeries in SF and the US that have figure out the secret that makes the bread so good, that people actually wait in line to get their bread; just like in France!

We were here around 10:30am on a Friday morning with the pleasant hum of street construction right past the front door. The line was about a 10-15 minute wait (maybe 6 people standing outside of the store itself). Not as bad as it looks! My friend and I shared the following (listed from least to most favorite) Croque Monsieur - You have a choice of ham, turkey, or mushrooms. They were out of turkey so we got ham (although in retrospect the mushrooms looked really tasty). It's basically an open faced toasted sandwich with butter, ham, sun-dried tomatoes, and cheese. I don't think there was enough cheese to actually justify calling it essentially a grilled cheese. The best part was the bread (which I'm guessing is made there). It was like a rich wheat bread with a soft inside and hard crust with lots of oats. Besides the bread, the second best part was the funky tiny pickled carrot that comes with it. My friend who hates carrots, gobbled it up. It doesn't taste like a carrot, but has the same texture with a hint of spices. Conclusion: Not worth your time/money unless you need a savory morning pick-me-up. Morning Bun - At first my friend described this as the love child of the cinnamon roll and croissant. As we were eating it though, it was more like a croissant pregnant with a cinnamon roll. The outside is relatively hard with clearly defined flakes (like a croissant) and the middle is like the middle of a cinnamon roll. It has a hint of citrus and is glazed on the outside. It was just okay--a little too hard for me and a little too sweet. It was the kind of sweet you sort of find sticking to your teeth as you're chewing. Banana Cream Tart - THE BEST. Period. A hard, flaky crust topped which chocolate and a caramel sauce. The filling is mostly banana and whipped cream--which was not even close to how interesting the crust was. The total was about $22 for all three. Overall, Tartine is the type of bakery that focuses on quality ingredients with care and attention to every pastry. The only thing I don't care for too much is that they seem to be the type of bakery focused on a distinct contrast between hard and soft (think turning the oven to a really high temperature so you get that crunchy crust ---that you can barely even get a plastic knife through). I'm more of just a softie.

I had my first Tartine encounter today; and it lived up to every good word that's been written here. My friends and I jumped on the Muni and headed to the world famous bakery for breakfast on our last morning in the city by the bay. I had lots of images in my mind from all the food porn I've seen in the Tartine coffee table books. I was delighted to see it looks just as beautiful in person. I resisted the urge to press my face up against the glass and softly weep.   There's nothing I love on this planet in quite the way I love a hot ham and cheese croissants, and this has to be the patron saint of hot ham and cheese croissants. It was so flaky, not greasy, the cheese was warm but not totally melted and the ham just a tiny bit crispy. Every bite was perfect as I took my time with each flaky layer. The latte was also great, and I especially love that it is $4 even. It was warm enough to sit outside, I met the nicest couple and their two little greyhounds, discovered that this particular block of Guerrero happens to also be the mecca of darling (and adorably dressed) children, and to top it off, I had lovely company! What a perfect start to the last day of a wonderful visit. It's a good life guys. Croissants from Tartine certainly don't hurt. xo

I always wanted to try Tartine's for the longest. Bought here by an amazing short video and Yelper friend ( http://vimeo.com/14354661 ). We came here during the morning and there was still a long line on this rainy day. So the line eventual started to move like waiting for coffee at Starbucks. First time coming, I went straight for their very popular Morning Bun ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ). The morning bun is a very sweet, flaky, and simple pastry that goes really well with their house coffee. The next time I went was during the afternoon and I bought a whole huge loaf of their famous bread ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ). It was still hot off of the oven and the aromas drove me crazy. I really want to just bite the whole loaf of bread. I do have to say this type of bread is something you would want to eat freshly baked. ----- + Pro: I dont think you can go wrong with anything here! - Con: Premium prices \( ^,^)/ Overall: Famous little bakery, that definitely deserved its title.

The happiness that you will undoubtedly experience upon making first acquaintance with a ham and cheese croissant from Tartine Bakery can be absurdly compared to a number of rites of passage through life.  I could compare it to the day that I finally received my high school diploma except that never happened.  I could compare it to the day that I lost my virginity but when I really think about that night, I'm quite sure the memories are less about happiness and more about relief (and ultimately regret).  I could compare it to my first love but can you think of a word that rhymes with ostrich and reminds you of dogs?  Actually, come to think of it, thank God for subsequent loves, post-virginity experiences, and higher education!  Rites of passage in life can totally suck.   In any event, all of these experiences have nary a tangential relationship to the aforementioned ham and cheese croissant.  What beckons you to this treat?  Think crisp and buttery layers of flaky crust with perfect slices of Niman Ranch ham accompanied by tender husks of gruyere cheese.  The treat shatters pre-existing notions concerning the relative amount of enjoyment one can receive by ordering what generally amounts to a rather unsatisfying breakfast.   So you are a vegetarian?  Try the bread pudding and I dare you to forsake logic and claim it fails to satisfy your culinary desires.  In the incredibly unlikely event that does occur, maybe you should move on to the morning buns.  If you still don't like your food, just shoot yourself.  You don't deserve to live if you can't appreciate anything.   Tartine is one of those rare gifts from the culinary Gods.  Go forward, plan on a good wait, and enjoy the opportunity to eat at one of the nation's best bakeries.

Since there are over a thousand of reviews, I'll give a short cut of my comments: Saturday A.M Line: Long...45 minutes Morning bun: Perfect bun with a hint of tanginess Banana Cream Tart: Delicious! Comparable to my favorite cafe in LA (Urth). Bread Pudding: Eh, didn't really care for it after the first bite. Shady on the strawberries. Quiche: Hearty. One of the best of eaten.

I really want to give Tartine awesome stars.  The bread is good, the croissants are great (but the croissants at Cafe Aquarius in Emeryville are actually better), but the lines and the service...they just s.u.c.k. And it's not even that they are actively obnoxious or snotty.  They just...don't care.  I stood in line, next to pay, looking at my bread in the corner while the two cashiers had a conversation about their skin or something that ended with "and it's been two and a half weeks!" I agree, it felt like 2.5 weeks while I was waiting for you two silly bitches to finish your conversation when you stand next to each other for HOURS.   And it wasn't just this one time.  Every time I'm in there, no one gives a shit.  Yes, the food is good, but if I could figure out any other place that they sell it, I'd go there just to avoid the freaking attitude. Please, go back to Whole Foods and use your attitude there.

I finally had a chance to come by - I am not usually a fan of breakfast baked goods so I never really felt like going out of my way to come here. However, since I had some time to spare in SF before heading home I decided to drop by. I ordered: - Morning Bun - nice and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Seriously the best I've ever had (and this was at 4pm on a Friday) - Coconut Creme Pie - the two pies I shared w/ the BF in 3 days because they were both so filling. The creme is amazing and not too sweet. - Banana Creme Pie - I thought I would prefer the coconut pie over the banana since I love anything coconut, but i LOVED this. The banana creme has vanilla beans inside it. Both pies were amazing but I love the banana one. - Croque Monsieur with Ham - didn't try it but the BF loved it. Tartine will make anyone into a fanatic. I recommend going at odd hours because when I came there was no line. Parking was a pain so my BF just idled somewhere with the car while I bought the pastries.

Everything about this place is delicious. I cannot get enough of the gougère breakfast pastry (cheesy, savory goodness). In fact, I kind of see it as a more of a 'breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in-between meal pastry.' I recently tried the Brioche Bread Pudding with raspberries (classic and caramel-y), the Lemon Tart (tangy & creamy), a toasted croissant (buttery, fresh, & crispy/flakey, but super moist and rich on the inside), and the Bavarian Fruit and cream cake. Great espresso, too. Don't let the line discourage you. The place is small and packed most of the time. It may feel as if you are expected to order without having perused the entirety of the display case. You really can't go wrong though. Everything that I have ever ordered here has been incredibly flavorful. Some outdoor seating is accompanied by fantastic people watching.

I came with a mission- to order a Banana Cream Tart and a Morning Bun to-go. When I got there, they were sold out of the Morning Buns [it was approx. 3pm] :(. So, I just got the former and we also ordered the Coconut Cream Tart. IMO, the Coconut Cream Tart was better than the Banana Cream Tart. I think it just depends on preference though. Apparently, I like coconut more.. because each time I took a bite of the Coconut, I felt a tingling sensation surge through my body and I smiled. I was giddy yet calm at the same time.. LE SIGH. Water is self-serve behind the counter. Morning Bun & Passionfruit Lime Bavarian Cake- I'm comin' to get you next timeee! GET IN MY BELLLLLEYYYY!!! :D

woo hoo! 300th review!  I guess there is no better bakery to review that serves up some delicious carbs straight from the oven. mmm! i have been dying to come here so it was definite must -come this trip!  I love how everything is displayed and you just point with a huge smile on your face and nod like you don't speak English. The sticky buns were delicious, esp when toasted the same/next day.  the Gruyere gougere was SO GOOD.  It might have something to do with the fact that i love gruyere and freshly ground black pepper... but man this totally hit the spot.  I could imagine how tasty this would be fresh out of the oven.. it'd be heaven in yo mouth that's for sure! I ordered the quiche as well, but it was mediocre.  I wish it was warm., but it wasn't heated up.. i wonder if they heat em up for you?  i probably should of asked, but the morning bun was looking too delicious.  I couldn't wait to sit down and grub with my iced latte.. because yes, the weather was gorgeously sunny and warm in SF this weekend :) w h a t   i   d i g bread, bread, carbs, bread, bread next time....

I followed yelp recommendations and had the banana cream tart. Everything about this dessert was great, until I hit the crust. The crust was lined with a layer of dark chocolate that simply masked the flavor of the banana cream pie. Don't get me wrong, I love chocolate but the chocolate overpowered the remaining flavors in the dessert =[

I went here during the week for lunch and ordered a banana cream tart, a sandwich, 2 cookies and a drink. The total was like $25. I think that was a bit much for how extremely "self service" this place is. Water?? Get it yourself. Napkins? Over there. Silverware, Salt & Pepper, straw?? You know what you need to do.

There is always an outrageously long line wrapping around the side of the bldg on weekends, but for good reason.  This place's wares are totally worth the wait. I had an open-faced breakfast sandwich with ham and gruyere with asparagus.  It was served with pickled carrots.  Every bite was delicious and savory. For a dessert, my friend and I shared a double pain au chocolat.  It was perfect for sharing: the chamber containing the filling was split between two halves equally.

I would have given this place 4 stars, had it not been for the prices. Maybe i'm just cheap, but I bristle at ponying up $14 bucks for a sando. Tartine by all accounts, is tasty. The shop is a smorgasboard of wonderful smells & mixed company. The decor is warm & homely. Nice to sit outside on the sidewalk seating when weather permits, and the location is fabulous. Right next to Dolores park! I ordered the spicy turkey pesto ($13.50 + tax), one of their warm press sandwich options. It was delicious though i certainly did not taste any 'spicy'. The bread was a bit oily but it held its crunch. The pesto was generous, the turkey was not. Could have used another couple slices to hold up to the thickness of the bread. Came with an interesting little in-house pickled carrot. I also purchased some pastries to bring home to my husband. Buttermilk scone w/currant - $4+--yum! crumbly inside, great crunch on the outside with sprinkled sugar crystals. Croissant - $3.95 --buttery & filling. regular iced tea (no refills) $3 in a small stingy glass. *sigh*

In love with Tartine! Even being aware of the line I decided to give it a try and loved it. You will have to wait a little bit to make your order, will wait a bit more to find a place to seat (in case you want to stick around) and will wait a few more minutes to get your food, but believe me, all the waiting is worth it. Their sandwiches are amazing, with super fresh bread and other ingredients. Their tarts, croissants and pastries also look great. Since their sandwiches are pretty big you can share one with a friend to have more room for the "desert time" since this is heaven for pastry lovers. PS: I've been to Tartine during the week when the line is not that scary...

This bakery sells the prettiest desserts I have ever laid eyes on. I first tried their banana cream tart, and then returned a couple days later to try their lemon cream tart. I couldn't help it. It was calling my name. The banana cream tart was very good, but the puff pastry crust knocks it down to a 4/5 for me. The Hillstone Restaurant Group's banana cream pie still reigns supreme in my opinion. The lemon tart on the other hand is absolutely divine.

Prepare to line up, but it is all worth it! Afterall, long line mean high product turnover rate, which means you will always get the fresher baked goods! And indeed, everything at Tartine is fresh and delicious! My personal favorite: Lemon Tart--Creamy, rich, sweet and a little tart. Perfect with a cup of tea. Fresh fruit cake with balvarian cream--my good friend get me this cake on my birthday all the time, and I just love it! It's so fresh and light, and the sweetness come solely from the fresh berries...a total guilt free treat! Quiche--They have their daily and seasonal flavor, one with meat and one vegetarian. They're filled with flavors and not overly salty at all. I also tried their fresh loaf of olive bread. Wow, you have to come early for them or pre-order their bread because it's fresh out of the oven and they get sold out fast.

We saw a random guy sitting on a bench eating the most divine looking panini. He told us it was wild mushrooms. So we waited in line.. It went quickly and we were ready to order, but we didn't see the mushroom panini! Boo.. We had our heart set on it.. But chose the pastrami.. As we were about to order, my boyfriend asked if they had the wild mushroom panini, and she said "we sure do!" Each hot panini takes about 20 minutes and they give you a letter (not number, a letter).. We chose to take our panini to go, but we soon realized that by the time our panini was ready, a table would open up! We could have saved a box.. Now we know! Patience is a virtue.

Now that I've been here three times, I need to add a Reminder to my iPhone: double down on the quiche. Yes, it's expensive, but it's almost perfect. I've only had one sandwich here, but I'd take points off for the bread to meat ratio -- there is way too much bread. I'm told by a girl who likes bread pudding that the bread pudding is good.

Wake up. EARLY, mind you. None of this "I'll roll out of bed at noon" business. Make your way to Tartine. Whatever it takes. BART/Muni/bike. RUN, don't walk. Get a morning bun. Inhale its aroma. Warm your hands with its fresh-from-the-oven toastiness. Tear off a small bit and slowly savor the flavor, the texture. Mmmmmm. THEN STUFF YOUR FACE! That is all. No morning gets any better than one with a Tartine morning bun.

Since the last time I was here I developed a milk allergy, so that has actually drastically changed what I could eat from this place! I embraced this opportunity and tried new things...and wasn't disappointed! This place must funnel through thousands of people every day. It's amazing that the food still tastes good. Be ready for it to take a while and to be a little bit chaotic. I actually realized this time around that a lot of their stuff is just soaked in cream or doused in creme fraiche, so if you're like my bf who I have accustomed to drinking soy or almond milk all the time you may not feel so hot afterwards if you order the bread pudding or other such creamy items. There are some things, though, that are delicious without weighing you down. The lemon bar is pretty good, but what stands out is the crust, which steers away from overdone shortbread. The wedding cookies are excellent, bursting in showers of sweet (though they are so sweet that your teeth might hurt a little!) I also ordered the pastrami sandwich, my first non-sweet item from Tartine. Would have been better with the cheese, but was pretty good--the meat was flavorful. You have been forewarned...this sandwich is HUGE! It comes with a cute little pickled carrot to finish it off. Best eaten when warm! Overall my second Tartine experience was pretty great and, in spite of the hype, Tartine still lives up to its reputation.

The banana cream tart is all MINE! =D I came here during the week in the afternoon with my husband. There were plenty of banana cream tarts to go around. =) This banana cream tart is better than any pie version you'll ever get. The tart crust is flaky and the bottom is layered with caramel and chocolate before having bananas, cream and chocolate shavings piled on top. The best part of the whole thing is the caramel surprise in the crust. I also tried the lemon cream tart. It looks beautiful. Definitely good for people who love tart desserts. It was a initial shock to my taste buds, but it's very refreshing. The best discovery of the day was their morning bun. It's in the shape of a muffin but it tastes like a croissant wrapped with cinnamon sugar. SO. GOOD. Thank goodness I don't live nearby this place.

Now I finally understand the buzz around this place! The wait was only about 10 minutes on a sunny Saturday afternoon, definitely worth it for the delicious baked goods and sandwiches. - Loved the sopressata pressed sandwich, where the slightly bitter and spicy broccoli rabe made it amazing. A little bread-heavy in proportion, but hey they're known for their freshly baked bread - Brioche bread pudding was very good and not too expensive either. I'll be warming up the leftovers - Morning buns were satisfying, though I would have expected a little more sticky yumminess to them (maybe because they were 5 hours old??) But glad to cross it off my 7x7 big eat list - Four Barrel coffee was, interesting. Nothing beats Blue Bottle Yes it's a little pricey, but you're in the Mission foodie area and the stuff is great quality. I still can't decide whether I like Bouchon or Tartine better - but both are top notch. Really enjoyed sitting at a table outside and people watching too. I didn't encounter the rude staff that some people complained about - they were pleasant girls, albeit efficient.

I don't understand why a perfectly good dessert place would be closed at 7 or 8pm every night.   Maybe it's so they can save energy to fight the weekend morning crowds in search of the morning bun.  It's a small space, but on a weeknight, snagging a table isn't as challenging. I was disappointed that their espresso machine was broken, as I really wanted some dark coffee to go with my dessert tonight. A part of me needed something savory, so I tried the giant gougere, mostly hollow (as it should be) but with a thin layer of peppery cheese.  I imagine it would have been much better warm, but it satisfied my salt craving. As for sweets, the chocolate pudding was smooth, not overly sweet, and pretty addictive.  It's easy to put spoonfuls of it into your mouth mindlessly.  The devil's cake was kind of your classic layered chocolate cake - pretty dense, not overly sweet, definitely needing some coffee to go with it.  I'm usually not a big lemon person, but the lemon cream tart was actually pretty good - very smooth with just the right amount of a pastry shell crust, not too tangy. There were lots of other tempting items in the case.  Brownies and cookies are on the more expensive side, but other cakes and breads are more average in price.  I can't wait for the banana cream tart with chocolate and caramel this weekend (thin crust, generous amount of bananas, relatively light cream...)!

dang this place is expensive! the three items i got were delicious but still not really sure if it's worth the price tag. the morning bun, as everyone says, is the perfect combo of flaky, soft, and crunchy. i thought it tasted even better after a few hours when the cinnamon on top became slightly caramelized and the crunchy parts became even more crunchy the almond lemon tea cake was delicate and tasty but $4.5 for a pound cake sized slice is kinda ridic the lemon tart was super delicious- sometimes when you eat a lemon bar or pastry, it tends to have a weird aftertaste which usually means that its artificial flavoring. but this tart did not have that aftertaste at all- tasted super fresh and legit! and the crust was really good. so glad that there was no line when we went in the middle of a weekday afternoon whoo

Morning BUN, I love you.  I strongly dislike waking up in the morning usually, but when I visit Jennie, Clayton, Zoe and Keo in SF...I love waking up to have some pastries from Tartine Bakery!!!  It's 100% worth the hilly walk to get here and worth the long wait even :)   The morning bun sparkles with glittery sugar crystal glaze and has a soft fluffy bread on the inside with so many layers of yummy glazes! YUM! perfect with coffee :)

Tartine was one of the places that the interwebs basically forced me to try while I was in SF last year for a visit and we were not disappointed. We got there well before opening to beat the rush and get a table and were delighted to see them squeezing the juice while we were waiting and watch the final prep for opening. In my opinion, you know for sure that you've found a winner when your expectations were instantly raised after your first bite of their food and Tartine did that for my girlfriend and I. We had 2 different croissants (chocolate and the ham and cheese), a ham quiche, croque monsieur and fresh squeezed orange juice. Everything was fantastic and we walked away completely stuffed to the gills because we could not stop eating. So rich and satisfying I would 100% recommend people make the effort come to Tartine and change your expectations like we did!

One of the best bakeries in the United States. Entering Tartine is the equivalent of entering a cathedral dedicated to baking. The theme this SF weekend has been waiting in line. At night, I was in line at Mitchell's for gourmet ice cream and in the morning I was in line for former baked goods. Experience gave me the same feeling as Bouchon Bakery but it's more accessible. Get the morning roll! Heavenly combination of butter, sugar, & flour. Croque Monsieur was solid too. Not to mention the bread pudding with seasonal fruit and double chocolate croissant. Secret is you don't need to wait in the long line for a latte. Grab your latte then join the deluge in the bakery line.

I came here after seeing it on the Best Thing I Ever Ate on the Food Network channel. They suggested the morning bun so we ordered that to try. It was good but it wasn't amazing. I came back here before I left to the airport for my flight home to grab some morning buns for my bf's sister. They only had two left so we grabbed the last two and some orange juice. Wasn't amazing but it was good enough to come back to bring something home for the bf's sister.

Every time I come to San Francisco I always stop by for at least 1 of their sweet pastries.  It's always fresh and consistently delicious.  Their CROISSANTS are the best I've had in Northern California and their PASSION FRUIT LIME BAVARIAN CAKE is my favorite cake there.  I've had their: CROISSANT 5/5 CHOCOLATE CROISSANT 5/5 MORNING BUN 4/5 PASSION FRUIT LIME BAVARIAN CAKE 5/5 COCONUT CREAM PIE 4/5 MEXICAN WEDDING COOKIE 5/5 CHOCOLATE CAKE 4/5 FRESH FRUIT ALMOND CAKE 3/5 BREAD PUDDING 3/5 If you like sour dough, then you'd really like their country bread.  I'm not a big fan of sour but I can appreciate a well baked loaf.  A full sized loaf is over a foot long. The only thing that sucks about coming here is trying to find parking and a place to sit so I can scoff all the goodies I bought.

I LOVE their baked goods, whih are among the best I've had at a bakery in the US, but I hate their insanely high prices and rude, oblivious, patronizing service. Just because hipsters look cool doesn't mean they'll be good employees. Don't bother to ask the typical counterstaff here for anything like ingredients or math beyond making change, badly, because they'll make you feel like an idiot when they clearly don't know the most basic details about their products. I think I know more than most of them do by this point.

Ham and cheese croissants are unmatched anywhere. My French boyfriend and also my French sister-in-law say that these croissants are as good or better then any they've had in France--ever. Other favorites: walnut bread sold at the end of the day, gougere, bread puddings, any of the cookies. Yes, seating isn't great. Yes, sometimes there's a line. But the pastries are beyond. Best of the US and beyond. Not to be missed.

I finally went to Tartine after years of hearing about it from friends.  And Wow! The morning bun was good in so many ways- it was flaky, moist, crunchy, I could taste the butter, the glaze had a very distinct orange zest that set the flavor off.  The lemon almond pound cake had the most amazing texture- I have never had such a good pound cake.  Tartine clearly knows their business in the baking department.  If you like baked goods, you really do owe it to yourself to get over to Tartine. One star off because the coffee is absolutely miserable.  It doesn't even taste like coffee.  I would have brought it back and asked for a refund if that had been convenient in any way.  If anyone actually reads this review #3,500 (just a guess on the number) take my word for it and get a coffee somewhere else.  There are plenty of wonderful places nearby.  Nowhere, however, will you find baked goods equal to Tartine's.

Omg hot pressed sandwich was bomb! Prosciutto and provolone with some arugula. Bread is amazing! Rustic, chewy, crunchy!!! Came out warm and delicious! It was $13 but big portion. Came with spicy pickled carrot stick...felt like bugs bunny but it hit the spot! I wanted another sandwich but was too full..needed room for dessert too. Morning buns are amazing..crunchy, buttery, flaky, chewy from apricot glaze on top. Best almond croissant I've had thus far. Croque monsieur is delicious..mostly due to the bread. Brownies are good but expensive..$10 for 3. Coffee is only so so but love drinking lattes out of a bowl!! I always somehow spend over $30 here..I can get carried away.

Tartine! YOU GO, GIRL. I've never written an update 2 weeks after a first review, but Tartine has redeemed itself since so I felt it was only right.  I've been back to Tartine 3 more times in the last 14 days, and am currently making a dental appointment as we speak.  Jenny Craig tomorrow. Chocolate Pudding: This ain't Bill Cosby stuff.  It's hardcore Richard Pryor curse yo mama out pudding. Friand (Valrhona chocolate bite topped w/ganache):  Half Brownie half mini-cupcake like consistency. For $2, I thought it was a bit steep for the size. Double Chocolate Tea Cake:  Exactly what you want in a dessert pound cake: thickly cut, dense in taste and moist in texture. Gougere:  Gruyere/Black Pepper/Fresh Thyme bread roll.  Pillowy, very peppery, crispy crust, egg like interior.  Good for breakfast. Coconut Cream Tart:  Wide cut coconut shavings toasted on top of coconut cream heaven in a flaky tart crust lined w/chocolate and caramel.  This time the crust was easily breakable.  My friend and I inhaled this tart in minutes.  Afterwards, my friend had some coconut cream on the side of his mouth, and I almost went for it, that's how good it was.  This tart alone redeemed my sad banana tart experience, easy. I will be back for more.

***I had a much better experience at Tartine on this visit and the two breakfast pastries I bought (double pain au chocolat, orange morning bun) were two of the best pastries I have ever had*** Tartine did not have the item (orange morning bun) I was looking for during my first visit and I had to settle for something I would typically never order.  I got there a little earlier this time and I had a much better selection to choose from and I opted for two breakfast pastries. The first item I had was their double pain au chocolat.  This chocolate croissant had a great brown outside color and was incredibly flaky, crispy and rich.  There was definitely a heavy amount of butter used in this croissant.  There was also a good amount of chocolate and the chocolate had a great rich flavor.  There are a lot of average and not fresh chocolate croissants out there (Panera) as well as a few good ones (Bouchon Bakery).  The one at Tartine is exceptional. I also had the orange morning bun and this was very good and actually much more my style when it comes to a breakfast pastry.  The orange morning bun was nicely sticky and had a great crisp outside as well as a soft inside.  The pastry pulled apart very nicely.  It was also evenly flavored with a good (but not too much) amount of sugar and cinnamon.  The center also had a bright mix of sweet and tart with the use of sharp orange peel.  It was the kind of perfect balance of crispy, soft, sticky, sweet, fresh, and tart that I will remember for a long time. Service was good and quick.  The line was pretty long, but it moved quickly.  While the service was good, the packed nature of this place as well as the need to get people in and out might mean that (like Yountville's Bouchon Bakery) you might not get the very personable service you could get at a less-flocked-to local bakery. Prices are high at Tartine, but the prices are mostly similar to what I have seen at other high-end bakeries.  At least the pastries here are generous portions. In terms of atmosphere, Tartine has a standard decor though the pastries are nicely and attractively displayed. I enjoyed Tartine a lot more on this visit.  Tartine can put out some good breakfast pastries that can really stand out when compared to other bakeries (even good bakeries).  Tartine is a must visit if you find yourself in San Francisco and you may just walk away having some of the best pastries you have ever had anywhere. Parking is very hard to find in this area since it is a busy area and paid lots seem to be almost non-existent.  You can find parking on streets a little bit east of Tartine.

AMAZING!  AMAZING!  AMAZING! Was it worth the wait in line? (approx. 20-30 minutes) MOST DEFINITELY!!!! Chances are in SF, if you see a long line for food, it's good and this is one of those spots!!! What goodies did I order you might ask? 4" Banana Cream Tart - Fantastic pastry that was so lovely decadent.  Chocolate inside the crust with a banana cream inside and topped with chocolate curls and a nice dollop of whipped cream - DAMN! Turkey Croque Monsieur - Gruyere cheese with sliced turkey and heirloom tomatoes on a long slice of toasted bread!  So good! Bowl of Bread Pudding - The best bread pudding that I've ever had!!!  With freshly sliced seasonal fruits that were at its peak of sweetness! Rochers Meringue - Looks good but I haven't had it yet, it's to-go for me, I'm stuffed! Latte - Nice way to wash it all down and wake you up! Service was amazing and easy going by the likes of Nellie!  She's awesome! I'll come back here to Tartine every time I go to SF! HOLLA!

I finally tried the famous morning bun and it really is as good as everyone says. It has a wonderful orange zest to it and a great layer of caramelized sugar on the outside. The banana cream pie is also amazing!! The crust has a layer of chocolate and caramel goodness that makes it really unique. I don't even usually like banana cream pie and yet I can't stop thinking about Tartine's! It's not cheap at $7 for a 4" or $45 for a 9" but trust me it's worth it!

One of my absolute favorite places to eat in all of San Francisco!  In SF, the quality of a restaurant is easy to judge....just look at how long the line is out the door.  Tartine is a great French Cafe offering some seriously tasty treats.  I have been going here for years and have yet to be disappointed in anything I've ever tried.   FOOD Quiche - 5 out of 5 - The kinds vary from day to day but I've had the ham and cheese along with the spinach and they are both amazing.  My favorite quiche I've ever had.... and I rarely order quiche from anywhere else. Croque Monsieur - 4.5 out of 5 - Open face sandwich with béchamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper and opped with smoked Niman Ranch ham.  Tasty and amazing!  The ham is oh so good and the herbs and the gruyere really bring it together.  On the downside, the bread on the bottom is a little thick and kind of hard to eat with plastic utensils. Eclairs - 5 out of 5 - Best eclairs I've ever had.  Soft outter shell and vanilla custardy goodness on the inside Lemon Meringue Cake - 5 out of 5 - I don't even like Lemon meringue...but my cousin ordered it and I ended up eating half of it. Mocha - 5 out of 5 - Ok, I admit that I am a coffee snob.  The coffee they serve here is truely special!  And this is the best mocha I've had.  I have two favorite cups of coffee in the world.  One, the mocha, is here and the other, Vanilla Latte, is in LA at the Conservatory of Coffee, Tea and Coco.  Often times I swing by and go straight to the coffee bar just for this. OVERALL If you don't mind braving the lines, you are in for something pretty special.

Awful line redeemed by splendid food. Yes it is well worth the wait. And yes the croissants are as good as they get (take it from a Parisian guy). The bread pudding is delicious too. This is the benchmark to all bakeries in the city (and beyond). I simply wished they had a more efficient check-out process (there are too many staffs taking orders and too little manning the register which causes the wait).

Their stuff is good but, in my opinion, not worth the hype/wait. Almond frangipane and their cakes are the best. Croissants are OK. I was going through a bread phase a couple months back back, and decided I MUST try Tartine bread after reading all the hype. I got 3 half loaves, and they all kind of tasted like sourdough, which I found surprising since I don't think other reviews mention this. Good, but I didn't find it as amazing as others seemed to have.

I stopped by Tartine with my friend that I always associate with lovely pastries, so it was a natural choice. The line was completely manageable, so I can't complain. I wanted pretty much everything, but narrowed it down to the banana cream tart and a slice of zucchini bread. The banana cream tart ended up being dinner and while I felt like I wanted to die afterward (mooo), it was great going down. Fortunately, I'm not SO much of a pig that I was able to save the zucchini bread for breakfast a few days later. The only thing I found slightly odd was that the zucchini bread had walnuts. I've never encountered that before.

ahhh Tartine :) Tartine was recommended to us as a must-stop-by-while-you're-in-San-Fran by my boyfriends co-worker. I hadn't even heard of it nor had it come up on any of my Yelp searches for a good bakery. Anyway, we missed it on our first pass because it is an unmarked black building with cars battling for parking on the curbside. Once we finally found parking, there was a line. Yes... a long, long line, and no free tables. Popular is an understatement for this place. My eyes feasted on the goodies behind the glass case while I waited for my turn to order. I settled on the croissant because it just looked so good. Tony chose the Banana Cream Tart. I got to the register, having passed the other goodies I was thinking to switch to, but I had to compose myself from getting a little too excited. We had to enjoy our new pastries in the car, but my croissant was seriously a melody of warm, crunchy, buttery, flaky goodness. It was worth the 3 bucks I shelled out for it. The one bite I got from Tony's tart was light, tasty and perfect as well. I wish I could have sat and stayed to gather the whole ambiance of the place, but what I experienced was good enough to bring me back the next time I'm in town. Or it could have been a blessing in disguise that I didn't get another opportunity to just jump back in line and spend all my money tasting the other pastries!

No bakery fans can ever leave SF without a visit to the esteemed Tartine Bakery. We arrived at 5:15pm and though that wasn't considered prime time for a visit to a bakery, people were standing in line to purchase Tartine Bakery's freshly baked goods. Surely there was a reason why this place won the coveted James Beard Award for Outstanding Pastry Chef. Any pastry chef today who owns their own other bakery take pride in having previously worked at Tartine Bakery. Tartine Bakery specializes in freshly baked bread ranging from rye, sesame, sourdough, etc. Since it was the weekend of Halloween, pumpkin bread was also available. These breads were sold in big loaves and people were buying them whole to bring home. Surely this would be our go-to place for fresh loaves of bread if we lived in SF (but sadly we don't!). A very friendly gentleman overheard my husband and my discussion on what to order and, and then proceeded to recommend us the bread pudding. When he told us that he and his wife drive all the way from Oakland every weekend just to get the bread pudding, we were sold on getting that. It was absolutely perfect and really the best bread pudding I have ever eaten. I am generally not even a fan of bread pudding but Tartine Bakery changed my impression of bread pudding. Topped with raspberries, it was soft and fluffy and not dense. Tartine Bakery made us a little jealous that Chicago does not have a stronger bakery culture. The next time we are flying out to San Francisco, Tartine Bakery will find us there again.

Bread lover's orgasm is what Tartine Bakery is. Absolutely delicious pastries, sandwiches and Francophone baked goods is what this place is about. I had the croissant. It's crispy on outside and heavenly moist on the inside. Not too buttery either. If I can be picky it's a little too crispy on outside, I think it was in the oven couple seconds too long although I thinks this croissant's are one of the best I've had in US. La Duree is my favorite croissant still. The cheese in the quiche is absolutely delicious. I don't know what kind of cheese they use but it seemed to be a little bit stronger then the cheese I've been used to eating in American made quiches. They had a vegetarian quiche and ham and arugula quiche. The crust is pie crust and it was a little burnt but still very good. I'm wondering if the chef's in love because both the croissant and quiche seemed to have been in the oven a little too long. Lines are out the door but it's 15 minutes wait to order. The place is small with about 4 tables inside and 4 outside. If you look inside the kitchen you'll be surprised how many people are working in there. Lovely little place, decor's very minimalist with wooden table and chairs. Definitely go to Tartine Bakery and take out your favorite pastries and bread.

They make a great lemon tart. The crust is buttery and crunchy. When I took my first bite, the lemon made my jaw tingle....just the way I like it! I am a fan. I usually can't eat all of my dessert, but I managed to eat the whole lemon tart and lick some of my container because it was that good. Once I restock on my lactaid I plan on getting their banana cream pie. YUM! I kept hearing this girl behind me talking about a morning bun. I really wished I knew what she was talking about then because I would've ordered one. It sounds amazing, so I have to come back again!! There was a line but it wasn't too bad on a Sunday afternoon. Don't plan on sitting inside because the tables are full. Plus you'd be sitting amongst people who are trying to order and that can be awkward.

If you're reading this review, you probably know the reputation of this bakery. Winner of the '08 James Beard award, this place is the real deal. I am absolutely obsessed with their bread. I would eat it everyday if it wasn't so expensive. Keep in mind that you can't order any bread until after 4 PM. I'm sure their amazing pastries will get you by until 4 PM though! All in all, if you're willing to fight the lines, you will not be disappointed in Tartine.

Outside of Paris, Tartine is still my favorite croissant.  Sweet or savory, they really hit the spot!  Even after consistently eating 2 or 3 per day for a few months, I could continue eating them daily if it weren't so bad for my waistline.   I am docking one star because I've tried a lot of their other pastries, breads and other menu items and I would really only wait in line for the croissants.  Also only 4 stars because sometimes the croissants are overly burnt for my taste.

You know, there's something about organization that really makes a difference when you're talking about getting a bite to eat.  I feel like Tartine Bakery could use some of that.   When you get down to it, no matter how great the baked goods are, they may sour in your mouth after waiting in a line that moves slower than molasses, having people push you out of the way constantly to get to the coffee refill station (in the corner behind the line, really?) or to get to the espresso bar (in the back corner of the dining room).  Not to mention the fact that if you want a pastry, you won't be able to order one when someone behind the counter helps you because you can't even see the whole case at the beginning of the end!   Sigh.  After reading soooo many great reviews, I was super stoked to come here!  I saw the line around the corner and thought (yeeeeah this is gonna be good).  But after waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, and more waiting, all we felt like spending the little money we had left was on a decadent chocolate cake that was far too rich for me.   So this is my advice to yelpers looking to come here.   Read the menu online before you go.   Don't go at lunch time (say after 2:30 you should be good or go super duper early in the morning).   Know what you want, and ask if they have it when you are approached at the beginning of the pastry case.   If the croque monsieur comes out of the oven when you order, even after you order, get that shit.  It's affordable and smaller than their other sandwiches, which may be the small bite you're looking for.

This is the High Temple of Baked Goodness. It's unquestionably one of the best bakeries in the U.S., and I'd argue the world. I tried to find a tastier croissant in Paris and it could not be done. Everything is amazing. Rich seasonal fruit bread pudding. Morning buns, flakey and soft with just a hint of citrus peel. Ham and cheese croissants. Pressed sandwiches with delightful little spicy carrot pickles on the side. Now that they are making coffee with Four Barrel beans instead of insipid Mr. Espresso, their coffee is excellent, too. I also recommend the two Tartine cookbooks - one on pastries and the other on bread. The books are beautiful and their instructions exacting - I found that following their guidance, I can recreate almost all of their baked goods exactly from home. But since I don't have two days to make and bake puff pastry every time I want a croissant, I am happy to let Tartine do the baking much of the time. :) I will say that, on occasion, I have been sold a bottom-burned pastry (usually weekday mornings, when I was rushing to the freeway for work; maybe it's something about the first batch of the day...). This is also, admittedly, the worst place in SF to be vegan. Their fresh bread is delicious and in most cases dairy-free, but the secret to all the tantalizing morning pastries is butter, butter, butter. (Yum, butter.)

Last weekend my bf and I were visiting San Francisco, and we made the pilgrimage to the mecca known as Tartine Bakery. I couldn't wait to get my paws on a ham and cheese croissant and, to my shock and disbelief, the girl behind the counter proclaimed they were all out. I repeat: ALL OUT OF HAM AND CHEESE CROISSANTS. I couldn't believe my ears. You're kidding, right? But I came all the way from Portland... So instead, I settled for a regular croissant, which was still fabulous, a slice of ham quiche, a croque monsieur for my boyfriend, and a 3 pack of brownies to take home. Can we talk about the quiche? It's not something I would normally order, but my friend had suggested I try it. It was so delicious, fluffy and moist, it literally melted in my mouth. It was truly magical.   I wished I had ordered more items, but the line was out the door. You really only get one shot to order, so you better make it count. Next time I visit, they better have those frigging ham and cheese croissants. I will also be sure to order one, maybe two, of everything.

duh. amazing. gorged to pant-splitting proportions and still wanted more. greedily stuff croissants in purse, hoard them and take nibbles throughout the day...drool. musts: croque monsier chocolate croissant, or almond croissant, or both. bread pudding, particuarly if it has plums or berries quiche if you're trying not to kill yourself by overeating, i suppose you could skip the sticky bun, it was no big deal compared to everything else. belive the hype. it really is that good.

Wow. Not really sure what I can add to the reviews that hasn't already been said, but here goes. Bf and I went to Tartine at around 2 on a sunday. The line was out the door. We weren't in a hurry so we decided to wait, IM GLAD WE DID. 20 minutes later we ordered: 1) A slice of dulce de leche cake, 2) a slice of coconut passionfruit bavarian cake, 3) Plain croissant $14 and we are out the door. It was so busy and there was no seating so we decided to walk to Delores Park and eat there. The coconut bavarian was deeeelicious. The cake was super moist and the filling was tart and creamy. The Bf's dulce de leche was fine, not really my style but he loved it. My favorite of all was the croissant. It was heavenly. Buttery, crisp, crunchy, delectable, soft, moist, mmmmmmmmm. Literally the best croissant I've had (although I must admit thats not saying much, as my idea of a croissant is one from Costco) Anywho, great experience, will be back on another day when it wont be so busy! 4 stars.

There's a high correlation between how long I wait in line for baked goods and how much I order.  Well played Tartine, well played. From the morning buns to the double pain au chocolat - this is not the place if you're on the Paleo diet.  My favorite time to come is on a rainy weekday, if I'm lucky enough to get a window seat with my crisp tasting pastry and latte.  Makes a gloomy day wonderful.  While community tables aren't usually my thing, I enjoy sharing a table and the people watching here.   Until next time Tartine...

As much as I'd like to say the place is over-hyped and not worth of the queues, it's easily the best croissant I've had since leaving Europe so I have to suck it up and join the herd on a semi-regular basis to get my fix of buttery goodness.

Finally tried this place on a Sunday morning.  Line long and very crowded inside, we finally found a table to sample our goodies, these are my reviews as follows... Quiche....too much egg it's baked to deep where the filling has the texture of flan,and the crust is overlooked to the point of being burned,could not cut it with knife Bread pudding....again too soggy wish it were a bit crispier on the outside and not so wet Croissant....over baked, I wish it were less crispy and more flaky I wish I cold have liked this place more but I would not go out of my way to come back here anytime soon.  Overall food was too heavy

4 stars for the pastries 3 stars for the food. balance 3.5 stars. Heard about this place and finally got to try it. MORNING BUN ($3.85): - has a marmelade lining within the bun - one of the most raved about items at Tartine Bakery - a bit sweet but didn't quite make my heart stop beating FRANGIPANE CROISSANT ($4.50) - similar to an almond croissant - my friend really enjoyed it and couldn't stop raving about it - croissant was very flaky and with the touch of roasted almonds it's a good combination CHOCOLATE CROISSANT ($4.50) - very good toasted - chocolate melting into the flaky croissant - delicious with an awesome cup of coffee BANANA CREAM TART ($7) - was very excited to try it - the filling was decent but I wished the shell wasn't so hard - I prefer a more flaky crust with a banana pie - probably would NOT order again considering the cost and my indifference to this creation SPICY TURKEY SANDWICH ($13) - Peppered turkey breast, provolone, broccoli rabe pesto - served on thick slices of bread - the sandwich was extremely oily (probably from the pesto) - though it sounds like a great combination, I definitely would rather walk a bit further and get a sandwich from Ike's They also serve picnic boxes if you're playing to head to Dolores Park afterwards. SERVICE: workers were friendly and helpful. The line actually goes relatively quickly since most people are regulars here. There is a separate line for coffee but that is CASH ONLY. I believe you can order coffee at the pastry and food line with a card if you need to. The sandwiches take about 15 minutes so make sure to allot time for that if you're in a rush like we were. I'm not sure how seating goes, but it seemed like you have to find your own seat...so you gotta watch for vacant tables like a hawk. Outdoor and indoor seating available. ENVIRONMENT: tight spacing. hipster-like at last by the way the workers were dressed (no distinct employee uniform) then again I'm not surprised since we're in the Mission District. Very casual ambiance and seems to be the place to go especially if you're going to or coming from Dolores Park. The high-ceilings also make it more classy. Though really it gets super hot in there since it's small and no A/C. Overall, more of a place to grab pastries than anything else. Even then the pastries are a tad bit overpriced. Since I'm not from SF, I wouldn't consider it good enough to be on my SF must-go places but I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it before. Otherwise Tartine Bakery to me is just a "every now and then" type of place and I probably wouldn't crave it.

I had a Lemon Cream Tart. Maybe thats not the thing to have here, it was nothing to write home about. I imagined everything would be amazing like it is at Bouchon Bakery, but it wasn't. Sitting outside was also less then satisfying as well as the overall feel of the place and people behind the counter. It does not appear delicate or delicious like a good bakery should, neither did I feel tempted to indulge and I do not recall it smelled very delicious of baked goods either.

Tartine is one of those places that my wife is dying to visit every time we visit SF. No matter what time we seem to go, there is always a line out the door and no place to sit. However, like magic, no sooner do we order our food than a couple of seats at a communal table or counter open up. Let this be a lesson to you annoying seat-savers out there: just go through the line like everyone else, and everything will work out! Without fail, we always order the morning bun and some type of croque monsieur. Most recently, I had a mushroom croque, but there is no such thing as a bad choice. Not only are the croques themselves good, but the picked carrots served alongside are great as well. We also recently tried the banana creme tart. I'm not a huge banana fan, but I could appreciate where this tart was coming from, and my wife loved it. If you're going to have any sort of sweet breakfast pastry like a morning bun, it'd be a shame to not have a cup of their delicious coffee as well. The lattes come large--I've seen smaller toilet bowls--you can definitely share one if you don't want to make a huge caffeine commitment.

Definitely one of SF's gems. On a sunday morning, at 9:30 am, the line was out the door, and doesn't move too terribly fast. I think a huge part of it is that people want to dine in Tartine, and seating is a bit limited. Only got to try the morning bun and the croissant. The croissant was good, but not great. The crust had a much firmer gluten structure than what I'm used to with other croissants. If you eat it straight, you might not be too impressed with it, but I'm a dipper, so if you dip the croissant in coffee, it's pretty decent. Actually it's kind of awesome, because their drip coffee is really good in that it's west coast style coffee (not over-roasted so you can taste the floral notes in the coffee). I would highly recommend the morning buns though. I don't care if they're sticky, but they're the perfect texture and the hint of orange is really nice. I bought a three pack of brownies to bring home, and they were pretty decent but nothing mind-blowing.

There was so much hype surrounding this place that we knew we had to stop by and try it since we were in SF.  The wait was long, with lines wrapping along the sidewalks of the place.  Once we did get inside and were able to order, I gave my list to the lady who was helping me out: morning bun, ham and cheese croissant, bread pudding, turkey open faced sandwich, carrot cake, and a latte (don't worry, I was sharing this with my husband, hehe).  It was so hectic with so many people inside and the server was not the friendliest of the bunch.  Obviously we were new to this, yet she had this whatever attitude which kinda dampened the experience for me.  We were lucky enough to grab a table and the food was good, but not what I was expecting from all the hype.  Honestly, I think it's a bit overrated but that was my only experience.

There's enough reviews here that I won't bother adding fuel to the flame. It's a great place. Baked goods are simply fantastic. In addition to pastries, they also have very good cakes. The gougère really caught my eye, but unfortunately due to their tres leches cake (delicious) I'll have to wait 'till next time I'm in to try it. It does get quite crowded but the line moves fairly fast. It's not cheap, but for the fame and quality of this place it's probably worth it.

Yes, there is always a line wrapped around the corner outside the bakery.  Is the wait worth it?  YES!  I came with a ground of four and we were lucky enough to get a table.  The place is small and getting a table is like finding free money on the ground (scarce). Their desserts were rich but not drenched in sugar.  You can actually takes all of the different favors.  The eclair had a creamy delightful filling that was not too thick and sugary.  The lemon tart had just the right combination of sweet and sour.   We purchased the cookbook online after visiting the bakery to see if we could re-create some of the magical experience.

Tartine's bread comes out of the oven around 5pm and within an hour its usually within an  hour. Though a loaf of their bread straight out of the oven is number 24 on the list, when I went at 5 o'clock to get some fresh bread, there were no morning buns left... so these two items might have to be done on two different visits. But you might luck out if you go at 5... who knows? So the Morning Bun was heavenly. Their croissants are super super buttery, and because they bake them at a high temperature the outside is super crispy and flaky with a the center still being soft. The orange zest in the filling adds a subtle citrus hint that adds a whole different level of flavor. The only thing that I wish is that the flavor was dispersed a little more. The twisted center is where all the flavor is, but the outside is tastes mainly like a normal croissant- which is still good, don't get me wrong. I also like a lot of sugar on the outside of my morning buns, which this one did not have, but I think it was just an off day because all the photos I see online of the morning buns at Tartine have a good amount of sugar on the outside. I did like however that they used crystal sugar. Morning Bun is $3.85 and is on 7x7 magazine's Big Eat list. There sandwiches also look amazing and I will definitely have to go back and try one of them. The one that most caught my eye was sheep's milk cheese and quince jam.

I was walking north on Guerrero at about noon on a Sunday, just past 19th st, when all of a sudden the delicious siren smell of Tartine's baked goodness monstrosity hit my olfactory like a stampeding elephant on PCP. I had to wait in line, which, luckily for me, was very short (it didn't even extend outside). Morning bun, almond croissant, ham and cheese croissant, cakes, cookies, bread pudding, tarts, breads..everything. is. so. damn. good. It's not even fair. I never even had a chance.

The almond cream/paste in the center was a yum orgy in my mouth and it wouldn't stop even after I begged. ...So I had to eat the whole darn thing. Very sinful though. So many calories I'll have to skip lunch. I haven't tried the bread yet but I"m sure I'll be back to buy some for home.

(See pics) Review #1024. I wish I liked this place more. Have been here a few times and had both the savory and sweet items. All the items were on the fairly rich, sugary and were heavy for my taste. Had frangipane croissant , chocolate slice, lemon meringue cake, quiche, bread pudding, etc. The coffee was too watery to balance the thicker taste. The chocolate soufflé cake looked absolutely decadent, and was very very chocolaty, also was too much for me, though I can imagine people who crave loaded rich ingredients would enjoy Tartine Bakery more. BUT the brioche loaf was almost the best I have had, lightly sweetened with eggy flavor. AND the bread served at Bar Tartine was phenomenal too.

Service is pretty bad, but that doesn't affect my review too much. They FORGOT our Croque Monsieur. Not cool, but we ordered way too many pastries so all is good. The bestie and I got: Frangipane Croissant Tomato and Bacon Quiche Morning Bun Lemon Cream Tart My favorite was def. the quiche! Okay, if you're Chinese, I'm positive that once upon your life, when you were probably little, you helped your mommy beat eggs. Mommy would then put the mixture into a tray and either steam it in the rice cooker or on the stove. Add some soy sauce on top and Wa-la! Steamed eggs! Well, quiche here basically tasted like Chinese steamed eggs without the soy sauce; the texture is light and fluffy! Bits of tomato and bacon on the top, but it was very, very eggy overall. Steamed eggs without the salty soy sauce but the same salty taste...YUM! My next favorite is the Frangipane Croissant. Chopped almonds throughout my croissant! YUMMY! The Morning Bun was whatever...I could have done without it, but it was the beastie favorite. The lemon tart was very light and fluffy! I felt like I was eating air...air that's filled with lemon and cream! YUMMERS! I thought there would be a problem with seating, but it wasn't too bad. If all else fails, Dolores Park is right around the corner. That and Bi-Rite...YUMMILICOIUS!

I was lucky enough to experience this bakery when I visited and I not only dropped some major cash, but also my jaw. This. place. is sinful.   It was a Tuesday morning, but the place was jam packed. There was not a table (or ledge) unclaimed and there was a line to the door. Did I mind? Not after seeing what was in the display. Their treat assortment was taunting me the whole time, and I couldn't decide...I had a really, really hard time. The line moved pretty quickly for its length and the staff were working their butts off, but still had smiles on their faces. There were little menus on the side as we edged to the cashier so I did a quick glance, placing my bet. So I ordered a black coffee and an almond croissant. Can I just say their bread is the most delectable thing I've ever, ever tasted? It melted away in my mouth. I pulled one spiraled piece and unearthed a treasure trove of almond slices. It was covered, filled, bathing in almond and it was the most perfect thing in the world. Their baked goods are easily the greatest I've tasted. Once I polished that off (far too quickly to my extremely disappointed realization) I had to get back in line. I had to get something else. So I got a Lemon Cream Tart for "later"--my excuse so I wasn't guilty.   I was proud I waited until that night to dig in and it was so unapologetically delicious. The lemon cream was soft, tart, sweet, and the crust was flaky, perfect even after sitting in the fridge while the unsweetened cream on top brought this little tart all the way to "I'm moving to San Fran just for this shop".

I don't understand anybody that gives Tartine less than five stars. Before we moved to the Mission from the East Village, Tartine was in our sights because that's all our foodie friends would talk about regarding our new 'hood. For real, they would get this insane look of longing in their eyes and drool would pool into the corners of their mouths as they described the treats and sandwiches. They painted a picture of Tartine thru 80% raw emotion and 20% gasps of want. Needless to say, we went the day we landed and were swept off our feet. The line was long but it moved rather quickly. Or rather, I was thoroughly entertained by starring at other people's desserts and feverishly debating internally what my first legendary meal would be. We had the eclair and the quiche while we waited for our sandwiches to arrive. That eclair tastes as beautiful as it looks, start with the powdered chocolate side! The vanilla creme inside is smooth and cool with tons of aromatic black specks. As for the quiche, well, let's just say after tasting it we bought the cookbook from Dog Eared Books and have now memorized the recipe. After eating those two treats we were full. However, that didn't mean we didn't gobble up that melty fontina, toasty bread, perfect sopressata with broccoli rabe pesto and the tangy carrot pickles that came on the side. We got our pastrami sandwich boxed and had it for dinner. The next time we came in I got the lemon creme tart and it was too sweet for my taste. Thankfully, I also had the bread pudding which was perfect--- the texture was of a custard made in heaven and I also had the chocolate tart. Ummm... I'm fat. The chocolate hazelnut tart was really intense--- perhaps too much chocolate in one sitting for a person who's also had a ton of other desserts. Finally, the most recent time we went there we got the banana creme tart which was fantastique. Shave chocolate, whipped creme, caramelized banana, chocolate coated flaky crust--- it's just everything you've ever wanted from a banana dessert but were afraid to ask. Their wines are really delicious at a great value. I love the rose. Usually when we get invited to dinner parties we bring a box full of eclairs. It's our ultimate dessert friend. Our favorites: Quiche  whole 34 / slice 4.75 Choices change daily, made with crème fraiche, Niman  smoked ham and organic produce. Eclairs  4.95 Filled with vanilla custard, dipped in Valrhona glaze. Banana Cream Tart 4" - 6.50 9" - 40, serves 8 Flaky pastry coated in dark chocolate with caramel, pastry cream, and lightly sweetened cream. Sopressata, Fontina, Brocolli Rabe Pesto  13 Spicy sopressata with Italian Fontina and pesto on country bread.

Family, friends, heck even casual acquaintances know that the quickest way to get me moaning like a cheap hooker is to stick a Banana Cream pie in front of me. After hearing all the hype about Tartine's, you KNOW I had to make a trip to the city and stand in the Disneyland-esque  line to sample their Tart version of this old-school classic. Half an hour's wait (I was told this was average) soon had me huddled over outside on the sidewalk, fervently unwrapping my parcel like a crackhead...and then...OH SWEET RELEASE! After 5 minutes of bakery induced nirvana, I absent-mindedly wiped off the remains of  the two tarts (I thought I was going to have enough self-control to save one for later...silly me!) off my face and made a mental note to thank Tuwie N. for this revelation.

I've seen the long, long line outside of Tartine once or twice. And I've always thought to myself, "What on Earth do they serve that's worth waiting for?" Two word answer comin' at ya: morning bun. It doesn't look that awesome at first glance - just an unassuming cinnamon bun looking baked good. The outside is a little dry and crispy, too. But as you work your way inside the swirl, a explosion of orange, cinnamon and vanilla titillates your taste buds. Also worth trying is the brioche bread pudding. Mine came with nectarines and raspberries on top. Delicious and unlike anything I've ever had before. Yes, I ate two breakfasts. So what? Here's another tip for you - go on a weekday right when they open. You won't have to wait at all AND you'll get your goodies fresh as they come. Without spending hours waiting.

Banana Cream Tart: Taste was defintely elevated, considering this was probably the most well done cream, chunks of banana laced with caramel included.  Pie crust was perfectly flaky and layered with dark chocolate.  Whip cream on top was PERFECTION.   But after I finished it, I still felt a little empty.  Not my stomach of course, but maybe my heart?  The quality of Tartine's pie was great, but instead of making me want more, I began to long for Nation's super cheap banana cream pie, quality which was so much lower yet desirable!

The last time we were up in the city visiting family, wifey's nephew and his wife volunteered to be our local fixer and met us on that one block stretch of 18th St. bound on each end by Bi-Rite Creamery and Tartine Bakery.  The neighborhood reminds me of Disneyland;  out of one line into another... When we arrived in front of the modest corner bakery, there was a line out the door which is typical even at around 530pm in the afternoon.  We made our way soon inside, where we could start to see what all of the excitement was all about... A lot of the croissants these days are of the mass produced variety,  more cushiony cake like and filled with additives and preservatives that are designed to increase shelf life.  Tartine croissants are the real deal and authentic, buttery, flaky and not cakey at all,  the product of layer upon layer of buttery pastry dough that is allowed to rise, brushed over with more butter, and baked to pillowy browned crispy flaky perfection.  I would come to Tartine just for these...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The Gougere with gruyere cheese, black pepper, and fresh thyme is their take on a cheese bread -- pillowy bread rounds.  The gruyere flavor isn't overpowering and the thyme is very subtle...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The Morning Buns with orange cinnamon sugar are a popular favorite, one that was recommended to us by our fixer -- it was definitely sugary sweet, a definite contrast to the croissant and the Gougere, but delightful none-the-less.  Because of its sweetness, I think I would have preferred to enjoy it slightly warmed over a morning cafe au lait...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… My favorite was the croissants, I have a weakness for really buttery flaky croissants.  I would rank these croissants up there with Bouchon Bakery, or Europane in Pasadena... Chew on this:  You want to know more about Tartine Bakery?  Check out the book "Tartine" by co-owners, pastry chef Elisabeth Prueitt and her husband master baker Chad Robertson.  It's a must for any baker's collection... This was only a small sampling of the variety of goods that they carry, they even have some savory items on the menu.  I know that I will be back...

Tartine is the place that made me fall in love with food. I'll never forget the first time I went. It was 2005 and I was a fresh-faced new college grad getting accustomed to life in the Mission and in the working world. At that time, my idea of good pastry was a Pillsbury Funfetti cake. A co-worker took me to Tartine at 2 in the afternoon on a Thursday. The line was as it is today, out the door.  All it took was one bite of the Croque Monsieur, a slice of the devil's food chocolate cake, and a sip of a beautifully crafted latte and it was like an epiphany. Needless to say, I have loved Tartine ever since. Though I rarely make it into the Mission these days, I make a point of stopping by when I am in the area. Tartine is a stand-out bakery and a modern San Francisco classic. For first timers and out-of-towners, be sure to try something savory and something sweet. Care for something classic? Maybe a croissant and chocolate chip cookie fit the bill. Or perhaps something a little more unique?  Why not try the olive bread and the tres leches cake?

This was our first stop from the airport and we were starving!  The line was long, but it went pretty fast.  This was our first time here and we couldn't decide what to order.  We tried the morning bun, chocolate and almond croissant, bread pudding, & the chocolate eclair.  Everything was delicious, but the morning bun was soo amazing.  I loved the hints of citrus and the flakiness of the bun.   I made my hubby go back & buy me another one to save for later.  Oh, Tartine!  I wish you were also located in So. Cal.

I slog it all the way home, which involves BART and the horrible 38L, the only thing keeping me going is knowing that I'll finally have chocolate pie when I get home. Turns out, you gave me disgusting BANANA pie! You can't even keep your pies straight??? Now what am I going to do? I give you a call, and I have to listen to a five minute message about pre-ordering bread three days in advance (BTW, WTF? It's just bread). So all I can do is leave you a teary hormonal message. You are everything that is wrong with hipster Mission. /rant

overpriced pastries and goodies here. tasty? very much so... is it worth it? if youre a fatty like me then heck yea its worth it. came here to pick up some birthday pastries for a friend and decided to grab a few things for myself as well.... breakfast went something like this... heirloom and bacon quiche...warm, crusty, flaky, buttery, creamy, salty, slightly tart, and eggy goodness...so friggin good...could probably eat this for any meal at least once a week... chocolate eclair...well. tasted like a good chocolate eclair. nothing too amazing about it, but was a perfect end to my "breakfast"... coffee was meh, and the cup they gave me kept leaking as well. that was the only fail from this place. wished i could have tried some of the other items, but i didnt want to overspike my insulin level "that" much, so early in the morning...ill be back for the rest of the goodies later tho...

I may not know authentic or or even original, but I know high quality and what I like.  In my humble opinion, Tartine is super special and I've fallen madly in love with it for a number of reasons: 1) There is no sign outside.  You walk up on 18th and Guerrero and see a BOATLOAD of people patiently waiting, As the line snakes outside, you ask yourself, are they giving something away?  Upon further inspection my brother and I discovered that we'd stumbled upon awesomeness by accident. 2) The people watching is incredible, yes, but it's always nice to have a smart phone, reading book, or other diversion, because it does take some time in that line even if it is small such as when I joined it. 3) Listen to the people in front of you if and when they ask questions.  It saved me a ton of time to learn about some of Tartine's offerings ahead of time. 4) Don't be ashamed to keep adding to your order.  My original plan was to get (a) an eclair, (b) one of those chocolate hazelnut tortes that I kept seeing on people's plates during my wait in line, and (c) two macaroons. However, after I'd already ordered my pastries, I tacked on (d) a regular croissant, (e) a ham and cheese croissant, and the piece de resistance... 5) Get a Croque Monsieur.  Do it.  Get it to go so you don't have to arm wrestle for a table.  Like I said, I was in line, pastries in a bag, ready to go, when a FRESH PLATE of CMs was brought out.  I'm pretty sure a big dribble of drool managed to hit my shirt as I sputtered, "Um, can I get one of those to go also?"  I opted for the porcini mushroom variety.  And God said it was good.  And it was. 6) You may be ordering small pieces, but it doesn't come cheap.  I walked out of Tartine $33ish poorer.  I don't regret one cent of that spending at all.  Bro and I devoured the CM on the way to the Palace of Fine Arts, and throughout the week I muscled through the other goods.  Everything was amazing. The hype is real.  This isn't popular for the sake of being popular -- it's much loved because it is GOOD.  I've never been to France and I'm not a cafe kinda gal -- but I love this place.  I can't wait to get back in that long line! (Prudence and a little bit of money-saving prevented me from ordering more...  but don't let that stop YOU!)

Tartine Bakery is both a bakery and a small restaurant. I came around 1:30 on a weekday and they were still packed full of people eating. The line for their pastry wasn't too bad around this time. The layout of their bakery/restaurant is pretty awful as it's not very efficient. The only way to leave is to go through the tables to the exit. Their pastry is DE-LI-CI-OUS! Morning buns should be the staple of what you're buying. They're that good! The outside is nicely baked to a golden brown while the inside is still soft and moist. I also liked their croissants since it was soft, flaky and crunchy. I haven't had their other pastries, but I'll definitely be back for some more.

I hate to admit it, but it took about a year after I moved into the neighboring hood to actually step into Tartine. I had heard rumors about Tartine, I had walked past it about a thousand times, a sometimes I stopped and contemplated actually walking in. But I never did... Until a friend visiting the City, who had read GOOP (oh jesus Goop) had dragged me in their because apparently it was an "IT" place to be/ I'm so glad I walked in. Tartine has the flakiest, most delicious pastries I have ever tasted, croissant that remind my of buying petit pains au chocolat before class when I lived in France;  croque monsieurs that blew me away. And the sandwiches, the sandwiches were amazing. and they have a cookbook! so that you can attempt to try those savory recipes at home.

This place is full of tourists and greatly overrated, With so many good bakeries and restaurants in the Bay Area this place is just okay. The food is good but really not worth jostling for position to try to get a seat while trying to balance your coffee and your slice of overpriced cake while you get shoved around. Hazelnut chocolate torte was bland, the lemon meringue cake was mediocre, and the croque monsieur was good but in Paris it would be a dime a dozen.

My friend was coming from Seattle and she was dying to try this place. We got the morning buns since they were all the raged, an almond filled croissant, and lemon cream tarts. I heard the banana cream tart was good, but they didn't have it that morning. I was there at 8:30am. The morning bun was soft, but I wish it wasn't so sweet. Especially when you got to the middle where the orange glaze is the most concentrated, it was eating a chewy gummy candy. It started to stick to my teeth. The almond croissant was pretty burnt and the lemon tart was just ok. The crust was really sweet and after eating a quarter of it, I felt sick. Try out the espresso bar too. I got the latte and it woke me up. I always get lattes and these were strong, plus it went down smooth.

Yes, of course I had to try this place since I was in SF.  If you're walking from the 16/Mission BART, walk down 16th instead of Mission, unless being accosted every other block and smelling urine is your thang. Knowing we had to catch a flight in 2 hours, and knowing that buying one of EVERYTHING was unrealistic (no matter how tempting) we tried the following: Ham & cheese croissant - buttery and delicious.  Ask them to warm it for you.  We did not, but wish we did. Gougère - decent; nothing to write home about.  Would probably have been better warmed. Chocolate chip & walnut cookie - just to wash down the cheezybreads with something sweet. Prosciutto and Provolone sandwich - came toasted, warm, and in 3 large pieces.  Delightfully tasty, just make sure you have something refreshing to wash it down with. All in all, a positive experience.  Even the wait on a late Sunday morning (around 11:30am) was bearable (about 20 minutes).  Plus the weather cooperated.  Agree with another reviewer that it's best to take your goodies 1 block away to Dolores Park (weather permitting) and make a picnic out of it.

More comfort than frenchy, this is one of those places that if you can't find something to say something superlative about, well, you're probably out of your mind. You should go out of your way to stop by here, in fact, their bread alone is a reason to stop by and probably the one thing that will cause you to rethink some things in your life. Bread's out in the evenings, get some, a bottle of wine and some cheese and birite and you are one happy camper. The croque-monsieurs are as comfort as they get although I partially get them because I love their pickled carrots so much. PRO-TIP: skip the weekend if you can, find a time to go during the mornings on a weekday. If you're crushing a croissant, get some with butter and whatever confiture/jam they have. If you get a loaf of bread fresh, wait a little while for it to settle so it's a little less moist, but I ain't gonna judge you either if you lay out in the park and just pull pieces off in the brown paper bag.

This place is ridiculous! Vincent and I came here on a Sunday morning around 11 am. We had to wait about 30 minutes before we got a chance to order. I admit, I'm a pretty impatient girl. But it smelled SO GOOD and everyone who was inside looked SO HAPPY eating their food. I knew it'd be worth the wait. By the time we got to the register it was 11:30 and they offered sandwiches. We split a Morning Bun which has an sweet orange flavor to it. As you make your way to the middle, it gets softer and softer! Then, Vincent got the ham, and I got the pastrami sandwich. I thought it was really expensive at first because it was about $15 for each sandwich. Dear Buddha was I wrong. This thing came out in 3 pieces! It could have been 2 sandwiches. I was so shocked at the size that I was initially scared to eat it. We only ate 1 piece each out of the 3. In our defense, we were saving room for our next food joint so we didn't want to be super full. That was probably one of the BEST pastrami sandwiches I have ever had. Yes the line is long. Yes the it's super crowded. But it was DELICIOUS and worth the wait!

Playing tour guide the other day, can't NOT bring a self-confessed cake addict (in the form of my friend) to Tartine for an introduction to perfect everything!!! 4PM.. queues avoided? not a chance. Got her excited by exhorting her to go ahead to the cases and peruse, letting the salivary glands start prematurely.... It seemed that everybody who was anybody was ordering their ramekins of bread pudding.... she opted for a rich scone, and I bought some goodies for the freezer, as I have more guests soon to arrive. But, those stinkin tarts, and the beautiful, fluffy small loaves of brioche, the glorious and filling croque-monsieur tartines....I wish I could come weekly.. this place is seriously my Achilles'.

Signs that indicate you are at Tartine (because they are too hipster to actually have a store sign): 1. Looooooong line that rivals that of Bi-Rite 2. Corner of 18th and Guerrero 3. Lots of bread-oriented displays in the windows (huge windows... again, with no sign) The line was long but manageable... I think it took a good ~25 minutes to order. But once inside, the countertop displays were mouthwatering!! Let me break it down for you: -if you're feeling sweet-- the bread pudding was so good. The bread was just soggy enough so that you can really soak in the flavors and textures, but still bread-like enough to not question what you're eating. They even give you small, thin slices of apples that are baked with (I think) cinnamon and they're yummy as well. -if you're feeling savory-- one of the baristas told me that the provolone & prosciutto sandwich was really good, and it was :) it was made with arugula (my favorite), warm melty cheese, and their homemade bread. If you're near Dolores Park and do not feel like enduring the long lines of Bi-Rite, go ahead... knock yourself out with those of Tartine.

Can't deny the food is yummy... best you can get. But the service and attitude of the staff still bites the big one. If you say you're open at a certain time, you should open at that time, especially if you know people arrived early just to avoid the lines. By the way, the long line that develops as soon as the door eventually opens is due to bad service, not because there's a lot of people.

The line outside was quite daunting at first, but we had plenty of time to kill, so decided to give this place a try. The line moved very quickly and we were at the front before we knew it! The boyfriend and I ordered the croque monsieur with wild mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes, served with spicy pickled carrots on the side. The croque monsieur was magical .. the flavors blended so nicely and the bread itself was so soft and buttery. The spicy pickled carrots were .. interesting. Haha. Don't get me wrong, it was good! Within one bite, your taste buds were quickly shocked with flavors of tart and spiciness. It was madness I tell you! Everything else on display looked good as well. Unfortunately, they were out of the famous morning bun when we came ): I plan to come back for that as well as the bread pudding! There is both indoor and outdoor seating, so just be patient and you'll most likely be able to find a place to sit and eat!

Hanging out chillin with some great people at Dolores Park and you feel that craving for something aside from fun in the sun? Head over to Tartine Bakery!  Take a right, go straight and there you go.  That corner bakery with that long line.  First thing's first, don't be a dork and drive here.  Just take the BART, Muni, walk, ferry, anything but drive.  Chances are parking is going to suck! Baked goods of all sort is delicious.  I highly recommend their lemon meringue and their bread pudding!!  Their bread pudding is so good.  I mean some people really might not like the idea of it but Tartine really does it well.  Have that all with a side of coffee or just some hot chocolate on those frosty days and trust you really would enjoy yourself.   If you manage to get a table, that's really awesome.  If not just take it to go or even if the weather permits, take it outside.  Honestly the day is just a little brighter with a bag of goodies from Tartine.

I was at a work party and I was fortunate enough to try Tartine's very own sourdough bread and Banana Cream Pie. Let me start off with the bread...I tried the basic sourdough loaf.  Yes, it was good, but I wouldn't make a trip all the way down here just for that.  The inside was fluffy, outside was crispy, and wasn't too sour.  It was tasty, but ACME bread remains the winner when it comes to the best bread I've ever tasted in my life. Now onto what bumped up this review to 4 stars...THE BANANA CREAM PIE!  omg, everything about this pie made it incredible!  The crust was buttery and flaky...the banana cream was sweet and satisfying..the cream was so light and refreshing..and the bittersweet chocolate shavings just made it the best banana cream pie i have EVER tasted in my life!   Seriously, come here for the banana cream pie..you will LOVE it.

The last time I visited, I had their bread pudding (which I recommend), morning buns, and a few other treats. The quality was good, and they weren't too expensive. I feel like a typical Asian bakery (at least the ones in LA) can top this at half the price. However, for a non-Asian bakery, this was pretty good. The line was a bit long, and it's very difficult to find seating.

We go there whenever I finish a race in San Francisco. When I do a half, we go there together but when I do a full marathon, my husband & daughter go there early to get crossants. Thanks for him, I could try the chocolate crossant but I still favor the almond crossant. My favorite thing is the Rocha...I forgot how it's called. It looks like merigne but much more complex. The line is very long so if you go there with someone else, let them drop you off first to stand in line while they find parking.

I don't know what I was thinking before--I think the problem was that we had ordered the wrong things. The honey and I went back recently and got the ham and cheese croissant, the famous morning bun, and a lemon tart.  All were UH-MAZING.  Anything vaguely croissant-like is to-die-for at Tartine.  And the lemon tart, with the delicate, buttery crust, was the perfect tangy sweet end to our carb-o-riffic brunch. Totally worth the wait.  Totally worth the trek out to the Mission.  YUM.

OK - let me start off by saying that this place is a bit overpriced, however it is worth it! The line will usually be out the door on weekends and parking is epic, but i will do anything to get my hands on their mexican wedding cookies and chocolate crossaints. I would have to say that their chocolate crossaint is #2 in my list of favorite crossaints. A Paris crossaint comes in as #1. The crossaints are buttery, crunchy, and the chocolate is so decadent! yum, yum, yum. The mexican wedding cookies are good, however dont eat them in your car at night cause you will come out covered in white powder and look like a crack addict, like i did. a must stop if you are ever in the mission district!

Oh dear, the banana cream pie really is quite a treat - the flakiness of the crust plus the chocolate is divine.  I've only had it once because every other time I come it's been sold out!  :(  I've had to settle for the coconut cream pie, though that is delicious too - it's the same concept except the filling is different.  It's a whopping $40 for the larger party version though.   The croissants are also flaky, buttery, all that you want in a great croissant.   Parking sucks of course.  And there's often a line around the corner. -_-  And you pay the price of an elite bakery.

Talking about being "over-hyped", this place is it. The bakery here is good but it is not "orgasmic" or worth the wait. The bread here that everyone is drooling over is just basically fresh sourdough bread no better than other places.

There's nothing more to be said for the pastries in this place. Absolutely amazing! Buy why did I give out four stars instead of five? Here's why: 1. Even though the pastries are terrific, they are pretty overpriced. 2. I asked the lady behind the counter which style of the scone it was, she responded by saying "of course French!". While amazed by scones existing in France, I found out the lady gave me a croissant instead. So I corrected her, and she gave me a grumpy look, which made her quite unique among all the smiling and friendly staff.

This place never lets me down. I get so many compliments for bringing Tartine goods at parties. My thing is...share the good stuff. If I'm not bringing a dish made from the heart, then bring something that speaks from the heart. Tartine works for me! There is always a line, but it's a line worth standing in... The staff there are extremely busy, and I would suggest for customers to know what they want before ordering. Avoid asking stupid questions such as, "What's really good here?" or "What would you recommend?" Answer: "BUY THEM ALL! THEIR ALL DELICIOUS!! JUDGE FOR YOURSELF!"

For another snack (actually lunch after clinic one day *don't judge me*) I made my second "repeat" of the trip - this one to Tartine Bakery - a spot where I enjoyed breakfast almost two and a half years prior but vowed to return to in order to experience two items I passed on at that time.  With parking nowhere to be found I did what any logical person would do and stowed my car in a delivery only spot before jogging across the street to thankfully find the line empty and the shelves full.  With the smells of vanilla, cinnamon, and butter wafting into the streets my order was swiftly filled by a pleasant young woman and in less than 5 minutes I was back to my car en route for the SFMoMA where parking was admittedly more plentiful (and more expensive.) Shocked and surprised by the "Free Tuesday" sign at the MoMA I counted my blessings and collected my ticket before making my way to the café where I unbagged and unboxed my bounty to enjoy - first the still warm and oft raved Bostock, an eggy brioche that resembles a portable bread pudding more than it does a simple dessert bread.  Dense and moist with layers of complexity both in terms of flavor and in texture this was perhaps the best item I've tasted to date from Tartine and although I generally do not love citrus the boozy orange notes married perfectly with the smooth frangipane, sliced almonds, and powdered sugar to form a flavor that was at the same time rustic yet refined - the sort of thing that could be enjoyed with or without coffee, with or without preserves, and at any time of the day. Moving next to what may be Tartine's most famous dish; my second selection of the day was a small version of the Banana Cream Tart - a lovely amalgam of creamy banana pudding mixed with slices of whole banana resting in caramel soaked pastry shell and topped with curls of dark chocolate.  While certainly not the world's expert on banana cream pie (or banana pudding) I will simply say that this was the best I've had to date with the crust buttery and flaky (but impossible to cut with Tartine's eco-friendly knives,) the banana cream tempered in its sweetness, and the light hand whipped cream melding perfectly with the dark chocolate - a great selection from a stellar bakery...even if their cookbook remains nearly impossible to navigate in my small apartment kitchen.

Yes fellow Yelpers -- this place really is all it's hyped up to be. There's always a line out the door to get these delicious treats in your posession -- so you know it's gotta be good! I don't get to eat Tartine very often, but when I do, it's like a little slice of heaven. My boss came into work the other day and brought in a pretty little white box and a cute little sticker on it that read "Tartine Bakery". That's how I knew it was going to be a good day. But it was just an ordinary box from Tartine Bakery. Oh no -- inside this box was...FRESH Tartine Barkey. Right of the oven! The morning bun was still warm and was so sinfully delicious. And next to that we had a ham and cheese croissant -- my goodness. Now THAT is a one tasty savory pastry. And let's not forget my good friend, the almost croissant. Yum, yum, and yum. This place is just fabulous. If you live in San Francisco and haven't had Tartine, well...you haven't lived at all.

Not sure what all the fuss is about.  There's a long line, everything's a little pricey, and parking is a b*tch! We had the coconut cream tart, lemon meringue cake, chocolate chip cookie, and croque monsieur. The coconut cream tart had chocolate in the crust, which was different, but the cream part was waaaaay too sweet - like eating pure sugar.  I almost felt sick after eating a few bites.  The lemon meringue was pretty good - VERY lemony - so for those of you who like lemon get this!  The cookie was not worth $2.50.  What is this a bake sale fundraiser?!  Outrageous for a thin cookie that tasted mediocre.   They ran out of bread on by noon on Tuesday so they couldn't make anymore sandwiches...?  Come on guys!  You're a popular bakery and it's not even 1PM after the lunchtime rush yet.  Tartine had a different take on the croque monsieur and instead of a sandwich, it was baked on top of the piece of bread.  It wasn't bad, it just reminded me of Round Table Pizza's flat bread pizzas and I'm pretty sure it wasn't worth my $13 they charged for it even though the website says $9.75. I wanted to try Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian cake too, but it was $6 a slice!  Overall the food is decent and it's nice to grab coffee and a pastry to relax, but it's too overpriced for my wallet and the parking and long line factor doesn't help either.  My experience wasn't horrible, I just don't see what the big deal is.

Heavy is the king's crown.  When you are ichiban in craft breadmaking, peeps can't help but hate.  But please, can't we all just get along . . . break bread per se?   Actually, let's break THIS bread even 'cause it is ridiculous good.  It is next-level, supernatural good.  We got the country bread, and its crunchy crisp crust and tangy chewy crumb sent me to another planet where I ended a century-old martian civil war by serving this bread to the warring martian tribe factions.  They confirmed for me that Chad Robertson is actually not of this universe.  He's just visiting to school this realm on self-made leaven, fermentation control, etc. Note: All the hype about waiting for the bread is na-na.  I walked up at 4:30, waited for 1-2 minutes while other customers got croissants and such, asked for the bread, and got it with not much hold-up at all.  Guess it was just noise.

I can't stand trendy places and yet find myself lurking closer and closer to the dark side each day I spend in the city. Such was the case when I visited Tartine one Saturday night. I know I know why go at night when you can get their tres tres fresh morning buns in the morn right? Well because I live in NOT SF and sleep in on weekends. Anyway. The BF and I ventured here because the devil told us to go. He was chillin' at my house the night before and we kind of hit it off so we went along with his Saturday plans. How tricksy he was though because he convinced us to drive rather than BART to the mission and led us to believe we wouldn't find parking, and only at the moment of shear and utter defeat allowed us a spot. He then led us to a long butt-hole of a long line to a shanty-butt-hole corner bakery called Tartine (though you wouldn't know it lest you had fly eyes). You think he'd lead us to the front at least but alas the devil is a gentleman. We were so scared by the menu since it offered devil's food cake--kryptonite for devils. So we stayed away from that and ordered some blinged out treats: 1 croissant 1 frangipane tart 1 chocolate eclair 1 mex wedding cookie (and a surprise to me because the girl got my order wrong: 1 walnut choco cookie) Total bill: $18. Can I make any of these myself and want to eat it? Probs not. Will I make it now that I've had it? Probs not. The chocolate eclair was the one thing I really wanted since I had it before (I'm a cheater I've been to Tartine times before) along with the croissant (tres tres good) since its a patisserie and croissants are like pastry crack. I sampled other goods just for the heck of it. Frangipane was meh, wedding cookie was overcooked/not melty-in-my-mouthy, and the walnut choco cookie, well, I can definitely make that myself (just gimme some dutch-processed cocoa) so I gave it away to the devil. He burned with joy eating it. But the croissant MMMMMMMMM. The eclair OHHHYEAHHHH. Out of dumb luck my BF just happens to enjoy the caramelized crust of the croissant while I enjoy the succulent inner layers. Can you say match made in not(heaven)?! Anyway, the perfect way to eat a croissant is to peel off layers at a time. Don't be a dummy and bite into it like regular bread. It just tastes better when you tear at it naturally keeping the tender bread fibers in tact. The eclair was scrumptious. It is an unpopular option that this yelp review just made popular (just kidding, please trend-setters stay away). It's friggin amazing and vanilla-bean-ified. We left the dark side shortly after and ate outside since we found a table open with supreme access to fumes of gas from passing cars/motorcycles and onlooking strangers. The devil tried to make a pass at the waitress cleaning up the tables. What a dummy. Till next time, dark side, till next time. I'll get you a $9.50 quiche next time too. Tres tres what?

I FINALLY tried this place again for lunch, and honestly I loved it so much more!  I split a lot of things and was very happy to try them all.  :) banana cream tart - PERFECT for a hot day since the cream is cold.  the cream has a hint of vanilla and is light and not too sweet.  the crust tastes great and is flakey and covered inside with chocolate.  i have sensitive sweet sensors, but this dessert wasn't too anything for me, except delicious.  we were most impressed with the dessert, and i think i'd want to try more of them. croque monseiur - with ham.  it was good! the thyme they add to this really makes it.  great taste overall.  i think i prefer the mushroom over ham, but they were out. spicy turkey sandwich - includes broccoli pesto.  exceptionally tasty and VERY rich with the generous helping of cheese and grilled bread.  everything tastes great.  mildly spicy. proscuitto & provolone - mmm, this is tasty and very different from the turkey.  the proscuitto is great and tasty, and it includes some fresh spinach.  overall, it tasted very gamey (like steak), and i mean this in a good way. my friend also got the iced tea, which had a great layered taste and wasn't too sweet. delicious and rich french-style food all around, and i especially like the tiny, vinegar-drenched carrots.  :) the only complaint i have is that the bread is VERY hard after being grilled, so it hurts your mouth and is sometimes tough to eat on the crust.  but the proportions are big (you get 3 slices for the sandwich).  the bread tastes good in the middle. Mmm, definitely wouldn't mind coming by for lunch again, but not too often, since things tend to get pricey. OH!  And we also came here at 5pm on a Wed, and this is the first time I've ever seen this place not have a line or be jam-packed.  We had our pickings of seating!  :)

Came here the first time with a friend, and boy was i hooked ! The bread pudding is amazing! Super soft and moist, and had an exceptional amount of fruits in there as well. The sandwiches had a different taste than what i normally taste in sandwiches... and that's a good thing! Sadly, it is TOO well-known, for the place is usually packed in the morning, so if you're in a hurry, this place ain't your to-go place.

We came to Tartine before they opened, and already the line was out the door. I'm not going to lie, waiting out in the San Francisco cold with the smell of freshly baked bread and other goodies was torturous. The perfect-looking pastries sitting in the glass case seemed to be mocking us the whole time. There were so many things that we wanted to try--everything looked incredibly rich and tasty. The lemon tart and chocolate eclairs were amazing, but the ham quiche was just okay. They serve some pretty good coffee too. With so many people coming and going, seating is crowded (especially the table by the door). This isn't the kind of leisurely breakfast place/bakery that you can come to and relax, but the pastries are pretty damn good.

3000+ people reviewing can't be wrong, right? Nor can the hordes of them lining up down the street to get into the building. Really, you can't go wrong ordering from the delectable baking case, but here are a few of my favorites. I'm not a big croissant fan, but the crunchy, buttery delectable nature of Tartine's almond croissants has me practically foaming at the mouth. The frangipane cream makes the combination unbeatable. Bread pudding. Always features seasonal fruit, this bread pudding eats more like a custard than it does like a cake. If you're feeling bold, take it home (or down the street to Bi-Rite) and put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Lemon tart. It's amazingly "fresh." One might think I might mean this in the sense of fresh versus stale, but I actually mean, fresh like a piece of fruit you just got off the vine. (I certainly wish all quantities of butter left me feeling that refreshed.) Also to note is that you can keep this tart in the refrigerator for quite some time and the crust remains crunchy. I don't know how they do it but it's pretty freaking amazing. Something to be added is the incredible nature of the Tartine cookbook. I spend so much time talking about this place that a friend of mine gifted me the publication a couple of years ago. Every recipe is a TON of work (like, will take you and a friend an entire day) but the results are stupendous. The Frangipane Tart in particular has been a big hit.

Delicious! Fernando and I went here on two different occasions during our week in San Fran. The bakery selection becomes more limited as you go through the day, so for the best selection stop in early. On our first stop we had the most delicious lemon meringue! It was seriously the best lemon meringue I have ever had. On our second stop we had a seasonal berry cake that was delicious as well. You really can't go wrong here, whatever you get will be amazingly delicious!

It's one of the dessert/bakery staples of San Francisco. TAKE AWAYS: - There really is nothing more to say other than to definitely try their Morning bun. - Brace yourselves, there will be lines. - The seating is pretty hectic, i.e. you probably won't get one. That said, Dolores Park is super nearby, so that's always funsies. Yeah, funsies. Definitely worth a visit. Some might say it's overhyped, but hey, you made the trip already, no?

You really just need to go here for the smells. I'm giving it four stars (probably unfairly) because we walked in while traveling, and they were closing for the day. I explained that we were leaving town the next day (we really were!) and didn't have time to come by in the morning before we had to hit the road. I hoped they would offer to give us SOMETHING (really, anything - I just wanted to try anything), but they seemed like they were in a hurry to get out of there for the day. However, this was almost two years ago. Everything smelled and looked great, though. I've only heard good things about this place.

After passing by so many times and wonder at the line as well as hear people raving about this place, I got to try. It's not bad, don't get me wrong. But it's not exceptional either. Because of the name and reputation I was expecting all the pastries taste exactly like they do in France (I grew up there) but it's really not the case. I would give 3.5 and maybe 4 stars but long line + parking situation + high price bring it down to 3.

First time here this past weekend and picked up a few pastries to take back home to the OC.  The line was out the door - about a 15 minute wait before I was able to order.  Definitely worth the wait. I got the lemon tart, chocolate croissant, bread pudding, and morning bun.  I got my items, headed to the airport and ate it that night.  The first thing I ate was the lemon tart which kinda shifted on the plane, but you know what, it was so damn good.  It was not overly sweet or tart, just perfect.  I ate the whole freaking thing in like 5 minutes...well worth it! The next morning, I popped the morning bun into the toaster oven on a low setting for about 10 minutes and it was nice and perfect.  The orange glaze and the crunchiness was so yummy.  I had morning buns before but these were the best.   I had the bread pudding tonight, but I don't think it was as good if I ate it there or ate it yesterday.  I think the bread soaked up the sauce.  I popped it into the microwave and it tasted good, but could have been better. A definite place I would come back to even though the price was alittle pricier, but well worth it.  The flavors were all there.

Tartine was the place that I had to go in my trip  to SF, and Im glad I did. I read so many reviews about the morning bun, so I had to try it. It really fits the reviews, it's very good, flaky and moist. I also had the chocolate croissant that was delicious, one of the best that I've ever had. I just ordered my book, and I'm excited to make some of their delicious pastries.

You know when you have high expectations of a place because of its reputation and it turns out to be a major letdown? Tartine is that place. I think Tartine's ego has grown a bit too big for its britches. Their indifferent service shows it. No "hello". No welcoming smile. No "how can I help you". No "thanks for coming". Just a silent blank bored unwelcoming stare waiting for you to relay your order. Nice. That's just how I like my customer service. NOT. Tartine has also taught me that a long line doesn't mean shit. I guess nothing draws a crowd like a crowd. And who started the rumor that their morning buns were all that? Newsflash: They're not. Don't waste you're $3.75 on a dull orange-essence-y sugar-coated lead-weight dough blob. (Bovine Bakery takes the cake on morning buns. You might want to try crossing a bridge every now and then if you City folks are inclined to do so.) Also, their double pain au chocolat is nothing out of the norm. Tartine does not live up to the hype, and they did not have me at "hello" (or in their case, "silent blank bored unwelcoming stare waiting for you to relay your order").

This pains me SO much to give 2 stars, but I really can't rate it higher.  I was SO excited to go here, and I just happened to be in the area.  The fatal flaw?  I came like 10 minutes before closing and they were out of pretty much everything.  For that, I do not blame them; that just means they have fresh buns in the morning.  Anyway, we asked the server what was good that was left and she recommended the lemon meringue pie and this chocolate hazelnut tart. I also got a coffee to go with my tart.   The house coffee was good, but expensive.  The tart was really dry and crumbly and overall NOT DELICIOUS.  There were nuts, which I like, but it made it overall really bland.  I honestly did not finish it and i was pretty hungry,.  I also do not like wasting money or food that is overpriced.  The lemon meringue could have come from Safeway.   So yes, very disappointed.  I really would like to come back in the MORNING for their fresh pastries or open-faced sandwiches, and then I can rate it higher.  But as it stands, please DON'T GO AT NIGHT!

I have mixed feelings about this place. The bad - if you make a lot of money then it doesn't really matter, but this place is expensive. Additionally, their items are hit and miss in my opinion. The good - if you find something you like chances are, you'll really like it. I believe they have high quality, but I still question if it's worth the price points. The bonus - way better than something you can get from safeway, and you won't feel ashamed to bring something from here to a holiday party that's for sure. The example - pumpkin pie is $40. My mom almost fainted when I told her how much I paid. She said I should have given her the $40 and she would have made it herself haha. Overall I give it a 3-4 stars depending on your style. If you have a liking for the refined things in life, then this is a winner. If you're finances are somewhat impacted, I say check out other places.

Parking is a ninja! Luckily girlfriend did the right thing. When we got there, she hopped off the car and start to wait in line. Yessss!! There's a friggin line for a bakery store early in the morningggg.. Kinda like Dunkin Donuts, only this one is fancier. Their morning bun is tasty. I don't like their pudding. Rice pudding? It taste too watery for me. Gf love her coffee very much. I think it was french vanilla? But yeah, for me, parking is a huge turn off for this place. Thus 3 stars.

Oh hype monster, you've reared your ugly head with Tartine. Everything I had was good, but I wouldn't say that any one thing was jaw-droppingly amazing. I had their famed morning bun, almond croissant, and banana cream pastry (not at the same time, of course). I'm not sure how I feel about the orange marmalade (i think that's what i tasted) in the center of the morning bun. The banana cream pastry didn't strike a chord with me. I thought the almond pastry was the best thing I had of the three, but nothing I couldn't find in another bakery elsewhere. I just couldn't shake the fact that each one these things had a dense quality to them that made subsequent bites less and less appealing. Well, at least I gave it a try. On the bright side, I will never have to wait in that ridiculous line that snakes along the sidewalk to get into this place.

I had a morning bun and a walnut chocolate drop around 3:00pm last Saturday. Both were good. No doubt about that. The morning bun definitely surpassed the chocolate drop. Good quality, but nothing special as far as cookies go. With regard to the morning bun - I loved the buttery, flakey exterior and the carmelized surgary (orangey?) interior. *BUT* Worth a (minimum) 15-minute just for take-away pastries? Nowhere to sit? Screaming children everywhere (no offense kids/parents, but it is a mood-killer)?? Definitely not worth it. AT 3PM! Isn't that supposed to be a "less crowded" hour? I'd go back to try their sandwiches (the open-face croque monsieur looked fab), but only at the crack of dawn or some time of day I'd be sure I wouldn't have to contend with the mob.

Second time coming here and I was lucky enough to buy the fresh breads. I was so happy when I found out there were still breads when I got there. Than again it was still around 5 p.m. It was so fresh and so tasty! I liked the country style bread more than the walnut though. I bought one whole loaf of walnut bread and a half loaf of the country style since they only had a half left. I am so stoked to make breakfast or lunch tomorrow with the bread.

I spent a dreamy few days cycling through picturesque Provence - and, when I wasn't busy padding my thighs, butt and belly with petite (well, sort of) dejeuner noms and fresh, soft boulangerie goods, I was lamenting the dearth of decent patisseries in America. Then, I experienced Tartine.

I've been hovering between 3 and 4 stars. This is a solid bakery with a huge following and even bigger hype.  The wait, prices, and service ultimately drew my solid 4 stars down to 3ish.  After adding back in some for the whole experience, I still couldn't bring myself to give this place 4 stars for all the wait and all the butter in the savory items... although this is a bakery. :] Things to try: + Coconut Passionfruit Bavarian cake with lime ($5.50/slice) + Croque with ham ($9.75) Things tried: + Banana cream tart (why is the crust so unforgiving that it required a solid knife cut and even then it was a bit too hard to eat?  I would have perhaps liked a croissant or puff pastry crust that was more napoleon-thin.  Also, why is this just cream + fresh banana? Granted, there are lovely thin shavings of dark chocolate on top with powdered sugar... ) + Bread pudding (this was a bit mushy and not firm enough for my liking) Tips: Arrive at non-peak hours if you don't want to wait in line (i.e. after lunch or before dinner).  Parking is a pain, but several surrounding streets always have spots.  Going on a Saturday / Sunday means free all-day parking on those streets.  Do not expect service other than the taking of orders, rushing you through the line, and then having you wait about 15-20 minutes for your order to "warm".  Having part of your party stake out seating is a positive however, if you can split up; this, saves a ton of wait time for a table.  And, there are napkins for those messy (flaky, creamy, and / or buttery) pastries --they're located above the non-disposable silverware at the coffee bar area to the right of the cash registers.

Do not be discouraged by the line out the door, because it moves fast and the pastries here are worth it. I have tried the hazelnut/chocolate tart, fig tart, and the lemon bar (all were phenomenal). My 3-star rating is for the bread pudding. The day that I went, they must have overcooked it, because it had the texture of scrambled eggs and not bread pudding. It also did not look appetizing...but if it tasted good I could forgive its appearance. Unfortunately, it was bland and did not taste like bread pudding. I was even more sad that I paid $6+ dollars for it. Luckily, I had my other treats to stuff my face with...

Same shit, different day. I keep coming back here specifically and ONLY for the food, since the customer service falls somewhere in the range of Shitty to Non-Existent. One attendant in particular is--to put it mildly--a MEGA-BITCH. She clearly hates her job and probably hates anyone that steps in the door, and does nothing but throw pastries in bags and give 'tude. C'mon lady, you do realize where you work, right? Would it kill you to be just a little nice ? If this place weren't so damn buttery and delicious I would drop it out of my rotation much like that woman needs to get dropkicked on her ass.

This is SERIOUS. Please stop the presses, BIG news that this place def has the BEST pastries EVER. If you love flaky you can definitely get flaky here. I have not yet tried pastries that offered something different besides the unique decor of the pastries, something besides those damn cupcakes everyone's obsessed about, and a place that also offers coffee along with the pastries. This place has it ALL and no wonder this place was featured on The Food Network. Funny story. Came close to closing (yes, took me a while to find parking since it's in the Dolores Park area) and I really, really wanted to try the famous Banana Creme Pie which was at least $7, I think. Of course they ran out, was told there was only the cake left for $40. The girl helping me put on her sympathetic face until I said "you know what, gimmie the whole thing!" She replied, "It's $40...." My face lit up and said "YEA! I'm taking it, I'll pay for it!" HAHAHA that's how desperately I wanted to try this damn, famous Banana Creme pie, and OMG it was so, so, flaky - my dream pastry, monstrous pastry. So I'll definitely be trying to feed my friends now with all this left over. Look at my pictures, I'll prove it to you - true story. Reference: http://www.foodnetwork.c…

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the food at Tartine. However, the people who work there can be so rude and arrogant at times. Yes, you might be a little more hip and a tad more cool than I am, but that doesn't mean you can treat me like you are annoyed by my presence. It wouldn't hurt to put a smile on your face and be grateful that customers are paying their hard earned money to eat there. Not to mention the guy with a beard and thick rimmed glasses who works there needs to wash his frickin hands. Yesterday he had enormous amounts of dirt underneath those finger nails. YUCK!  Same guys likes to be stingy on giving out a fair balance of fruit on top of the bread pudding. Come on man! What'sup with that? There is one person who works there. I don't know her name, but she is super sweet and friendly. She has long light hair with cat like eyes. She always gives a fair share of fruit on top of my bread pudding. While waiting in that LONG line, I pray that she is the one who helps me. So in short, Tartine, please train your staff on offering friendly customer service and make that guy wash his hands.

Tartine Bakery has the best version of my all time favorite dessert, bread pudding.  The fruit that goes with the bread pudding is very seasonal.  Peaches in autumn, mango in summer, apples in winter.  Love everything about the bread pudding here. Almost everything I've had here was delicious.  Their sandwiches - amazing.  Quiche special - amazing.  Cakes and pastries - amazing. The only real downside is because of its popularity, it's hard to get a seat at a table.  Be prepared to sit next to your neighbors. This is one of those little cafe/bakeries that I wished was in my neighborhood.  Come out to get a bite to eat and sit outside to watch the people walk along 18th street.

absolutely hands down the best ham/cheese croissant! Oohh mmm Geee  it's so good! it's flakey and buttery, and then you indulge on the savory part of the ham/cheese. From the first bite to the last was either a "hhmmmm" or "yummm". the place fills up fast, so get it to go and enjoy your yummy treat at dolores park. i also had the morning bun and the croque monsieur which were good, but i can't stop thinking about the ham/cheese croissant!

Going to Tartine is like, getting all dressed up to go to a really fancy overpriced dinner where you get stuffed and then whoever paid for it expects you to put out and in reality all you want to do is sleep, take off your spanx, and watch tv for 3 hours while in a food coma. I don't want to date you anymore, Tartine. Its time to drop the facade. Lets just be casual friends, ok? Like once a year friends. Like a, "Hey, happy holidays- did you ever get a job/ your stuff together, you deadbeat? JUST WONDERING! How's your mom? Does she still hate me?"  kind of friends. AKA Frienermies. So then why did I give you 4 stars? ... CUS IM STILL A "once a year" FAN (from afar.)

Definitely quality at Tartine.  The long lines are not deceptive lemming-like lavishized overblown overdrama along an 18th St. corner crying for attention in a city that lacks true food.  Tartine Bakery is the real deal.  The aftertaste of the apple crumb cake is clever...the apple layered in the smooth cake is glued with what tastes like a guava or passion-fruit like spread that makes the walnut flavor pop! Gonna start with 4 stars.  Once I try the quiche, I'll know if Tartine deserves to be among the rare family of five star bakeries on this planet. For now you ask?  My palette was pleasantly puckered amid the plumage of savory flavors. Good job Tartine.  You've awaken the attention of a knoll nosed gnome who rarely takes SFestablishments seriously (NY is still the standard).

I'm sitting here at work enjoying the Morning Bun from Tartine.... ahhh what a perfect way to start work with a bun that screams "Morning". Delicious, flaky, just the right amount of sweetness and chew. I also got the lemon tart. Really wanted the Banana Cream Pie but the lady right in front of me ordered the last one *shake fist*. But the tart was good, not overly sweet or sour with a nice crust. If not for the long lines, I'd want this for breakfast at least 3 times a week.

OVER RATED, OVER PRICED! I was excited about going here, even more so when I got in line and saw all thee amazing pastries! I decided to get the croque monsieur, and a coffee and if that went well I would shout out for the over priced pastries. The croque was very good, but what spoiled my desert sweet tooth was the service at the register....and by an employee outside. I wouldn't go back because of the service alone and the crowd it seems to attract. Food is spoiled to me when customer service is lacking. I don't care how good the food it!

First, this place is best for BREAKFAST! (not for brunch/lunch, hence the name, Tartine BAKERY) If you are pastry lover, this is a MUST GO in SF. I had no qualms gorging my heart out here, and I probably had enough carbs to earn myself a little muffin-top or a set of love-handles. Overall, this place was SO CLOSE TO BEING PERFECT...it's just so popular that the line was long and the place was too crowded! Even though I wanted to enjoy a nice, easy-going Sunday breakfast, I'd have to yell to have a conversation. People would stand around you like hawks waiting for you to leave the table, (it is self-seating). The place had more of a "bar" feel than an actual sit-down, casual breakfast. Ambiance: 2/5...bleh. However, I really can't complain about their food. Morning bun: 5/5!!! The perfect combination of crispy and flaky on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. I could definitely see why all the other yelpers have chosen this as their top pick. Mushroom quiche: 2/5. After tasting the morning bun, the quiche was a disappointment. Objectively, it's still a 3/5, but relative to the morning bun, it failed. I had always thought quiches were supposed to be somewhat warm, but WARNING, quiches at the Tartine Bakery are all served at room temperature. The crust was unfortunately thick, dense, and dry. I would stay away from eating the cardboard crust. Banana Creme tart: 4/5. Just by the smell of it, you'd instantly get sucked into eating it. The thinly shaved cocoa that tops it just melts in your mouth!! And true to its name, this dessert is filled with delicious banana and creme. The creme isn't too sweet that it's unbearable (like many desserts often are), unless you try to eat the entire thing yourself. (Yeah, yeah, my stomach felt pretty greasy and gross afterwards.) Sharing is caring, and this dessert so good, it is definitely MEANT to be shared. Presentation & display: 5/5...just by looking at their display, I wanted EVERYTHING. They do a very good job of appetizing and tempting you with fresh, delicious looking cakes. I was in pastry heaven :)

I've been here many times and must agree that, for SF, the baked goods, especially the croissants, are very good (as opposed to Paris, where Tartine's croissants could be had on every corner).  However, the service and attitude at this place is SO lacking and ungracious and arrogant that as of today it's a no-go for me.  Today I stood at the counter for a full minute watching two young women talk to one another behind the counter without so much as an acknowledgement that customers were standing there waiting to be helped.  The blonde Scandavian milkmaid lookalike actually looked up, saw us, and then turned back to her mate for more scintillating conversation.  Um, hello?  I'm sorry you have to work, and I know idle, callow chatter is more your style, but those bothersome customers at the counter are the reason you get a paycheck.  Does anyone manage this place?

What do an iPhone media event launch, a Harry Potter opening night and the Tartine Bakery have in common? People seem to line up for 'em. Whether you're not into smart-a** phones, not into hairy wizards or not into deliciously succulent, flaky, buttery items found in a patisserie, you have to admit that these attract or matter to people. What do I know, since I only know about antimatter. I have no clue what attracts people to things, but I do know that this bakery or the waft of organic produce, organic flour, sugar, and local eggs..the elements that make up pastries, cakes and tarts, are people magnet. We met here several months ago for a friend's b-day. Picture the Mission/Dolores area of San Francisco, on a weekend, a little before lunch. And you plan to have a surprise b-day brunch for about nine? Here? My friends must have elbowed, hip-checked and mud-wrestled people into submission or something, because when I got there, the queue/lineup wound around the foyer and out into the streets...my friends? They were all seated, enjoying French tarts and scones and coffee, that actually lived up to the hype. Worth the wait in line? Hell yes, since I didn't have to lineup. You can all read. You've all tasted good baked goodies before. Just read their fine menu. Just get here early (like before dawn) to find parking, and just remember two things: bread pudding and avoid the guy outside wearing nothing but tie-wraps.

I don't write much reviews, but man this had to be done... I've been here more than 7 times an everytime I've had great great great food. The bread pudding has to be the best ever, but why you ask did I rate them 3 stars? The worst attitudes I have ever come across!!!! The people that work there never smile, are the snottiest, and just are generally angry. I'm sorry I'm not a hipster too, is this why I don't get an ounce of happiness or thanks out of you??? Just the service and the atmosphere is enough to lose my business, even though the food is beyond 8 stars...

Thanks to Gigi Metz and her GU roommates for introducing me to this place at last year's John Carroll weekend in San Francisco.  I love this place, but beware the parking which is a nightmare to say the least.  The lines all day are a good indicator.  I made it out in the late afternoon so missed the wonderful morning rolls, and egg sandwiches.  I had the banana cream and lemon cream tarts.  They were both fresh and wonderful, but the lemon cream tarts were clearly the best!  I had some chocolate chip cookies with walnut and other nuts that gave it a wonderful taste--on my flights to Maui.  Everything about this place is worth the flight from New York or DC!  I had to rush off as I told the wonderful young ladies taking my order as I said Mahalo--I am off to Maui and the basketball tournament!

I love the banana cream tart!!! Omg it is so delicious. I'm not actually a fan of the flaky crust it comes in but there's a layer of chocolate, caramel, creamy banana filling, and chocolate shavings that makes this one of the best desserts I've tasted. It can be awkward to cut and share but who cares what it looks like when it tastes this good?! The morning buns are also tasty and there's a a slight touch of orange flavor to them.  The pastries all look so pretty behind the glass counter and I want to try their croque monsieur or paninis next. Although I like Tartine, it's quite expensive and I always have a slightly stressful experience coming here because of the long line, unfriendly service, and fierce competition to grab an open seat.

Worth the wait, lives up to the hype. If you have the time, you must stop by tartine. The croissants are so flaky and buttery. The croque Monsieur is so cheesy, tart and delicious. And the bread pudding is not to be missed! Top it off with a filling bowl of mocha and you are good, until walking next door to bi rite.

We decided to only go when there's no line. So, one serendipitous Wednesday morning after sleeping in we went to Tartine no-line Bakery and got ourselves the almond and jambon croissants. And, yum! The cheese and the ham were so delicious. Now, I wouldn't say this place is 5 star amazeballs, but it's definitely up there. As a reviewer mentioned, at the end of the day it's a simple bakery and cafe. If it hadn't received a James Beard award, would it still have the hype? Perhaps. Maybe not as frequent of lines but then again that area seems to be a block of lines (Bi-Rite). Next time, we'll take home some bread and Tartine will get that 5th star. Happy to check our visit off the list and would go back again.

Tartine Bakery, I have been there about 5 times now and maybe I can write one or two things about it now! They have some delicious breads here. I got there at 8 am to try their morning buns and it was worth every step i took to get here! their dessert menu is simple yet nicely prepared and tastes great. their almond croissant was delicious as well; it had a bit of burnt taste which complimented really well with other flavors. I wish their layout were better so more people could sit down and enjoy the food but at the same time, it's not much of a place meant to have people sitted and stay there for long. I can't wait to try their other stuff.

Morning bun? Almond Frangipane? Banana Creme Tart? Spicy Turkey Sandwich? Yes Yes Yes and Yes. Tartine is located one block away from Dolores park. It can be seen from afar usually because there is a line to get inside (but living in San Francisco, we get used to waiting for food). The food is great! This is a great place to come and catch up with a friend or a great place to just eat and relax. Pretty much everything they make here tastes good. To get seats, you kind of have to scout out people that are about to leave while you're in line. It is best to come here with at least one other person so that they could save a seat while you are in line. The seating is limited but people are always coming and leaving. One thing to be aware about is the service here. Most of the time it is good but not always. It's a hit or miss when it comes to service here. But in the end it doesn't matter because the food keeps me coming back...

I really can't believe that I haven't reviewed this place yet! If you want flaky, buttery, melt in your mouth croissants and morning buns... this is your place. This place tends to get uber crowded and expect to wait in a line.  The prices are a bit steep but nothing hits the spot like some good old fashion baked goods.

I love savory stuff more than sweets. But with Tartine Bakery, everything is awesome! They do have their savory sandwiches that I love, such as the Croq Monsieur. But I will forever be a devoted follower of Tartine because of their delectable sweet pastries! Must try: Chocolate Walnut Cookies, Orange-Currant Cookies and Brownies! PS, I have their cookbook already and its pretty accurate and easy to follow, but getting them from the bakery is still different. The best time to go there is during weekday afternoons when you can avoid the long lines and have the chance to find a parking spot in the neighborhood. :)

Yes, the employees are busy as hell and have to work in what is essentially a giant oven all day. ...get over it.  Stop being a nancy.  Just stuff another buttery morsel into your pie hole and stop complaining.

Before I begin, I saved this review for my 100th review. (the crowd goes wild.....yeah) This place will always have a special place in my heart and stomach. Why isn't this place 5 stars? Are you serious?  Tartine and Yelp has strong significance to me because it is because of these two I discovered Yelp and Tartine. About 3 years ago I visited some family in San Francisco. They kept raving about Tartine, so I had to go on the internet and see what all the hype is all about.  I always like to research and find great places. Why go on a hunch when you can read reviews and see what other people are saying. That sounds like a great concept......awww yelp beat me to the punch. I'm not bitter because Yelp is the gateway to food heaven. Okay sorry I'm getting nostalgic.  I googled Tartine and tadaaaaa there was yelp a click away.  After reading I begged my family to take me to Tartine. (Okay I may have said TAKE ME NOW) First thing I must say is......you know you bad a** when you don't even have a big sign.  Its so d** good you gotta know where it is to find it. Ahaaaaa tourist can't find....wait I'm a tourist. Thank goodness I'm not driving. San Fran people know parking is always an issue, near Tartine that is an understatement. Breath relax find a parking spot because its all worth it. I walked in and the menu just looked amazing. I want this and I want that.  I just told my sister in law please order for us. We ordered savory and sweet.  I'll be honest since I didn't order I don't know what my sister in law ordered because it was all a blur. There was morning buns, bread pudding, something with ham and egg, something with chocolate, some coffee, something with fruits.  Okay I'm not going to go and on and on about what to order because honestly everything and I mean everything was pretty dam good. But Cy what if I had to order one thing. Well my answer to that is go find a ATM or bust out your credit card because if you can't go here on a regular basis you need to buy it all. (or at least attempt to). Let your senses be your guide and let Tartine take you to heaven.  Yes expect a line but you need time to figure out what you want to order. And so my journey with yelp began. Thank you Tartine for guiding me to the light! Now look at me today, I have the opportunity to be part of this great experience of YELP.

The morning bun is listed as #8 on the 7x7 Big Eats list, but my faves are the Banana Cream Tarts or Tres Leches cakes. Although I don't follow the list, I agree with most of it, cause a lot of my faves are on there. I just completely disagree with the morning bun being a must try before you die. It's good, but not great. The Banana Cream Tart is one of the most popular items for a reason. Nice, flaky crust brushed with melted chocolate to prevent it from getting soggy. Yummy, creamy vanilla pastry cream and caramel. Fresh, sliced bananas topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate. It's to die for! This bakery is just another reason why us SF'ers are absolutely spoiled! We can go and get Bi-rite down the street for their Salted Caramel (also on the 7x7 list), walk over and stand in line at Tartine's for their delicious treats.. while eating our ice cream ;)

Four stars for the coconut cream pie -- absolutely THE BEST dessert I've purchased. I was not a huge fan of the bread pudding and thought it was a little too egg-y for my taste.  The way they serve their four barrel lattes seems consistent and delicious (baristas seemed trained well!).  One note about the sandwiches: they are too big and too rich, but delicious for a couple of bites. The staff is very friendly.

Tartine, In the morning I get up whenever.  For breakfast I munch dry Fruit Loops while padding about the small living room in my underwear.  I am a slow riser, and sometimes I shamefully take more time than necessary upon waking to finally be committed to stepping out of the house.  It's sad but true, in that my mornings are shameful.   However, there is no shame in being guilty of countless mornings of waking up in a damp puddle of my own drool because thoughts of you happen to be my first penetrating thoughts of the day.  Typically on those days, my heart tends to skip a beat because I've subconsciously, yet somehow deliberately use your tantalizing aromas, savory richness, and polished perfection as an excuse to abandoning whatever I am doing at the moment to have a taste of you. Tartine, I'll admit at first I was a bit disappointed to seeing your doors propped ajar for so many waiting to get allupinthere.  But every-time, you still somehow manage to make me feel like I am the only other person in the room when we are together.  You send chills down my arm as I often find myself scraping my fork for every last spec of your painful pleasure.  I say painful, because a big girl such as myself; just wishes I had you to myself..  But I guess that would be too much of a good thing, and now I understand that all else doesn't matter because your love extends conditionally .  On the condition that whoever is grazed by your pleasant olfactory sensations can't help by fall for you. I cannot eat another inferior confectionary mishap after this..

Tartine has converted me to a liker of bread pudding.  I usually hate bread puddings and anything that is remotely close to soggy bread, but the bread pudding here is almost like flan.  The large size is huge (we shared with 3 people and there were still left overs), so I'd recommend the smaller portion. What I love most about Tartine is that it reminds me of bakeries in Paris.   And, it has nice dog friendly outdoor seating. Yes sandwiches are still too greasy and huge, but whatever, come in for a pastry or quiche, skip the sandwiches.

okay hungry reader, here's the game plan. come to tartine on a sunny morning and eat to your heart's content. during your meal, take a few moments to appreciate how amazing the bread  that makes up your sandwich is. once you're done eating, wobble down the street to ride out your food coma in dolores park. get up after a few hours and grab some bi-rite ice cream or visit the bi-rite market for cold drinks and any snacks if, by some miracle, you're hungry again. MUST HAVES: - banana cream pie - pecorino and crushed almond sandwich HONORABLE MENTIONS: - morning bun (especially if you like that hint of orange flavor in your pastries) - fruit tart - chocolate hazelnut tart - it even has whole toasted hazelnuts on top! don't be too daunted by the line...it moves reasonably quickly. another plus is that the bathroom's surprisingly really clean/nice smelling!

This rating is for their morning bun. It's good, but not AMAZING. Some parts of my morning bun were pretty hard and almost to the point of being burnt. And, certainly not worth waiting in line for. I must say, though, the inside of the bun near the middle was really good. Thus, my average rating! I will come back... for the loaf of bread though. I really want to try it.

Wow there's already 2890 reviews.  I might as well put in my 2cents about the place.  I don't know if the place has super blown me away but I'm going to give it a solid 4 stars. Tartine received the James Beard award about 3 years ago for Outstanding Pastry Chef so by all means I really had to check this place out. I was in the neighborhood and FINALLY went last Saturday.  I had no idea how crazy ridiculous the line was going to be.  It literally went out the door and around the corner.  I wasn't planning on leaving and was determined to order a bunch of stuff. So this is what I got: - coconut creme tart - tres leches - ham croissant - prosciutto & provolone panini sammich All were very good (I shared of course).  My favorite out of the bunch definitely was the coconut creme tart.  If you love coconut with chocolate your tastebuds will thank you.  It was so fresh and coconutty.  The tart part had a coating of chocolate that prevented the flour part from getting soft from the creme.  It was like a barrier but an extremely yummy barrier if that makes any sense.   The tres leches was meh.  I've had better.  The ham croissant was crunchy and flaky but soft inside.  And the panini sammich I ordered was surprisingly big in portions but I'm not sure if it was worth the 13.50 for prosciutto and provolone. It's worth sharing it with someone if you don't have a big appetite.  The dressed arugula inside the sammich however really made all the ingredients mesh very well so it was very tasty.  Btw, I had to wait 20 minutes extra to wait for my hot sammich. The end result was satisfying but be prepared to wait and have patience due to the crowds.  I certainly would go back to try the other items.  Not exactly sure when is the best time of day to go due to its popularity but it's definitely worth checking out.

For the 2 1/2 years I lived in San Francisco, Tartine was on my list. So when I found out I was moving I made Tartine a priority for my last week in the city. The bf and I headed to Tartine early Monday morning thinking there wouldn't be too long of a long but we were wrong! I think we waited in line for about 15-20 minutes which I guess isn't too bad but longer than I would have liked. Well as for the food we got a slice of quiche, the morning bun, banana pudding and a slice of lemon meringue pie! Nothing like sugar overload in the morning! All delicious- my favorite was the bread pudding!

I honestly don't know how anyone can get a loaf of bread here and not give this place 5 stars. I love bread, and I can't think of a loaf that even comes close to this one. This bread is a work of art. The browned crust is a crisp but slightly chewy wrapper around a beautifully airy and complex-flavored interior. Somehow it's sturdy and delicate at the same time - it doesn't collapse under the pressure of a bread knife but it's also not that dense. Jen, who generally uses bread as a butter-delivery mechanism, eats it plain. It freezes and reheats quite nicely as well. I hate waiting in lines for anything, but the bread is worth waiting for. So is the banana cream tart for anyone who is keeping track.

YUMMMMMM. I went here once a couple of weeks ago and I have been craving it lately..I didn't know what the bakery was called until I looked at my past pictures and took a picture of the sign. So happy I found it on here!! I don't really go to (American) bakeries often...I think this was one of my first ones. Since I don't really have much to compare this bakery with, I have to say that the food is SO good! The line was very long but went by very fast. And well worth the wait imo. I got the croque because it looked DELICIOUS. I was originally going to get a sandwich but when I saw this I was like whoooa. Gotta try a piece of THAT. And it was heavenly :))) Also got the banana cream pie which I didn't know it was known for... I just got it because it looked good. And it was delicious as well! I want to come here again soon! I remember looking at the display of food and I wanted to get absolutely everything. This will be my New Years Resolution :D Lastly, there's a park really near this bakery so we decided to eat there, and I suggest you do the same! It's a huge park with a ton of people that are also chilling outside and some random person had a boom box (haha.....) so there was music as well. Great atmosphere to eat such good food..! Oh yeah, some guy wanted to sell us some weed too...sorry buddy.

Purchased a slice of Lemon Bar and a Tres Leches. As I attempt to stay away from dairy, I tried a sliver of cake with my fork and it seemed good but tasted dry. Tres Leches is supposed to be soggy and fall-apart gooey, almost. Or maybe that's just what I'm used to from the Mexican Bakeries I've enjoyed it from in West Chicago. The Lemon Bar was pretty good but I only managed to eat half of it. I LOVE lemon but this was almost a little too overpowering. I might come back for a snack if I'm in the area ever again but to purchase a full cake, I would probably go to a Mex bakery.

I went with my sister and brother & law and my nephew. I went there because of the reviews here in Yelp. My overall experience was disappointing. there was a line, which I didn't mind. The order process was not streamlined. The blond girl with short hair that served the cakes was ok, but not paying much attention. The girl (long blond hair) was really snobby and got annoying by us wanting to divide the bill. We wanted everything separate but she said  with bitchy face, "you have to let me know if you want it separate" But with a mean face. So we paid together. Then, I asked for water and I was literally ignored and sent to the kitchen's glass shelve, Very confusing. We eat: Chocolate Devil Cake- My sister ate this cake and was really disappointed. She mentioned that the ones in Safeway were better. Chocolate Chip Cooke- Not even my nephew that loves cookies, wanted it. Very thin, crispy dried. Carrot Cake- My brother in law said was very dry. I ate Coconut Passion Cake- To be honest, it tasted goo but not the best cake that I have tried. In conclusion, I don't think that I would go back. Not really excited about the place.

Fighting middle of the week blues? Having trouble with getting over hump day? Try having lunch at tartine bakery! It's a guaranteed pick-me-up and will brighten your drab middle-of-the-week mood! My co-worker and I have officially renamed our Wednesday as "tartine day" because of the happiness we felt after enjoying sandwiches, coffee and dessert at Tartine on a sunny Wednesday afternoon. If you are coming here for lunch, be prepared for a 20 minute wait.  Be ready to pounce on any available table you see unless you like to eat while standing up. And lastly, be prepared to enjoy the most delicious croque monsieur you've ever tried in your entire life.

Overpriced. The morning bun is just a flaky muffin covered in sugar crystals. Don't know if I got a bad one or if it's supposed to be like that, but I thought mine was dry and hard around the outside like it was overbaked. Also had the bread pudding, which was waaayyy too eggy except for a few bites around the outside. I thought it was a pudding at first. Still waiting for someone to make a bread pudding that can live up to HB in Chicago. This is DEFINITELY not it.

Oh sweet Lemon Cream tart. You're still in my belly but I miss you already. Wow, talk about splurging on food! I met two friends here for breakfast, and I personally had never been to Tartine before, despite having passed it dozens of times on my way to Bi-Rite. SF rule: if you have to wait in line, you know it's worth it. Even if you don't know what the line is for. About 20-25 minutes in line was well worth the delicacies we got in return. Approx $40 for 3 people, here was our order: Croquet Monsieur - a HUGE crusty portion of bread with sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms and cheese melted atop. This was the only salty dish we ordered, and it seemed to be everyone's favorite. Buttermilk scone - crunchy and light, with raisins in the mix. Frangipane Croissant - Almond paste is my new favorite! The croissant is immense, with toasted almonds on top, only to reveal a rich and creamy center that melts on your tongue. Another unanimous favorite. Bread Pudding - a little more "liquidy" than I would have liked, but the strawberries added a sweet touch. Morning bun - a.k.a. glorified cinnamon bun. Lemon Cream Tart - I could have eaten 3 more. The edible pansy to finish off the look makes the tart resemble a storybook fairytale. Incredibly light, you feel forced to close your eyes to savor every bite. Chocolate Hazelnut Tart - A little dry for my taste, but the flavors are spot on. The tart fell apart quite easily, making it a bit messy.

Everyone and their mama has written a review on this place, which has been a staple in my life the past 2 years.  I was so lucky to live a few blocks away from this treat, *and* have the option of visiting during off hours, thus successfully avoiding the long line. To be completely honest, this is the only cafe which is totally worth the wait in line.  I've tried so many things on their menu, and I can't complain about anything.  In fact, everything is tip top!  I recently started a search for the best chocolate croissant in the bay area, and after frequenting and taste testing around several farmers markets, cafes, mom and pop grocery stores, Tartine wins hands down.  Granted, I don't know what many of their product names are (as some of them are in French), and I don't really care.  Everything is buttery, rich, and somehow tastes healthy.  Oxymoron fo sho.   The next time you see the sun come out in the Mission (which is frequent), go here and get a choc or almond croissant, lemon tart and mocha, and head on over to Dolores Park.  Savor every finger licking rich indulgent bite of your delicacies, and you will come in pure delight.

Everyone has reviewed this place, it's pretty damn good.  Everyone knows it.  But it isn't PERFECT! The cookies - DELICIOUS Eclairs - DELICIOUS Croissants - DELICIOUS Sandwiches - MOSTLY DELICIOUS Croque Monsieur - Not really that good.  This is one of my favorite French dishes, and this is really not how it should be made.  Not recommended.  At all.

I went in yesterday and stocked up on my baked goods since I haven't been in in a few months, I have been on a Tartine high since. I want to just live in their kitchen, I would be 700 lbs. but sooooo happy. Nothing bad ever comes out of the Tartine kitchen, literally. Phenomenal food, and I just can't get enough. My musts when I come in are the Shortbreads, Lemon Bar, and Croque Monsieur. But I obviously don't walk out with just those three, Grougere, Croissants, Chocolate Hazelnut Tart, Rocher, Macaroons, Mexican Wedding Cookies, Brownies are all good as well. I've tried a lot but still have so much more to try here. When I have been in before 90% of the employees have been complete a$$ holes, but yesterday I could not have asked for better customer service. Kind, helpful, sweet, and they even SMILED! Love it. The bakery is small. The line is long. The food is the best.

Parking is crazy. Lines are always long. Food is a little expensive. So why do I like it so much here? I'm a sucker for baked goods, especially good ones! I visited the bakery around 11AM on a Sunday & had to wait for about 30 mins. By the time I reached the front of the line, I was greeted with a heavenly case of beautiful baked goods. I decided on the almond croissant ($3.95) & the croque monsieur with ham ($9.75), while the bf had the buttermilk scone ($3.75), Ham & Cheese croissant ($4.95), & some macaroons ($0.75 ea). Suddenly, we had a carbolicious, sugary, high fat feast on our hands. I really liked how the pastries were all very rich & substantial, not just tons of sugar & cheap dough tossed together. The bread on my open-faced croque monsieur was so thick & toasted to crunchy perfection. The croissants were both very good, how do they get it so crispy, flakey, buttery, & soft like that? Magic I tell you! And everything else was really nice as well. I also love how you can watch the chefs baking through the window while you wait in line. That's where the magic happens! So if you feel like treating yourself, set some time aside to grab a high quality pastry or two at Tartine!

For all my chocolate lovers out there, you ABSOLUTELY MUST try the chocolate croissant. It was the best thing I have ever put into my mouth! Sweet, buttery, warm flaky goodness, with those surprise bites of chocolate that just make your heart sing. Yes, it's that damn good. The only reason I would give it 4 stars is because the baristas, and cashier weren't very friendly, and the hot chocolate (which had a wonderful citrusy hint to it) was just lukewarm and not the temperature it should have been. Other than that, fabulous!

As if Tartine needs my words of praise, but longing for another pain au chocolat prompts me to send a little thanks their way.  I really do not eat grain anymore, I promise, until I go here.  I tell myself that there is more butter and chocolate than flour in the pastry anyway.   The place is a mob scene on most days, but once you try it, you will know why.

I would have never though that this neighborhood bakery would have such a long line of people coming in to buy these wonderful pastries.   The best croissant I've ever had.  The super-buttery, see every layer in the size of your open hand pastry before it disintegrates with every bite you take shows the labor of love the bakers put into their blockbuster product.  Everything else I had here was also excellent, including the croissant au jamon, pain de raisin, lemon bar, and chocolate tea cake.  I was especially impressed with the chocolate tea cake since this decadently rich pound cake looking baked good was perfectly chocolate-y and not at all sickeningly sweet or fatty.  I gobbled the whole slice like there was no tomorrow. The long lines coming in is a true testament to the quality of the product this neighborhood bakery offers.  I highly recommend stopping by here and putting your time into the line to pick up some baked goods and desserts.

Meh. The ham and cheese roll was certainly savory and filling, and the Americano well-made (and -- notably -- both were very reasonably priced), but the flavor did not warrant the long lines that forms here at all hours of the day. I'm sure the goods were baked today, and I understand that food by law of physics/truth etc gets cold, but I was disappointed that the roll was SO cold. Like, almost frozen. After breakfasting here, I walked the one block to Dolores Park and regretted not eating at the Dolores Park Cafe (which had immediate views of the park and seemed a lot more calm and friendly) instead.

Tartine is as awesome as it gets. There's a special place in my heart for French patisseries. This one is cozy, cute, and everything I've had here has been DELICIOUS!! On my second visit to Tartine, I expanded my repertoire and I'm glad I did. Banana cream tart is still king at Tartine, but there are other good choices: Lemon cream tart: sooo beautiful and tasty. The tart is comprised of a tangy lemon custard in a shortbread crust with a quenelle of unsweetened cream and a single flower petal on top. It's balanced, not too sweet and not too tart. I would get this again. Hazelnut chocolate tart: This was good, but would probably be better if the chocolate filling was creamier. I did love how it had a generous portion of whole hazelnuts on it. They aren't skimping on ingredients! Double chocolate croissant: MMM I adore pain au chocolat. This is double the fun, with two chocolate centers in a ginormous flaky pastry. The croissant was light, flaky, and buttery, everything a croissant should be. Banana cream tart: This is a MUST at Tartine. There are tons of whole banana slices, banana cream, and whipped cream atop a flaky pastry crust. I think the crust has gotten a lot better recently! It's not as difficult to break into pieces and it tastes flakier and lighter. My favorite from Tartine! If you are in the Mission Dolores area, you must come to Tartine! It's a great experience and totally worth the wait.

Let me be clear - Tartine's baked goods are as close to perfect as you can get and still be edible objets d'art. Their lines are long (depending on the time of day you go) and their coffee is not the best, but you should do yourself a favor and eat some of their bread, pastries or snacks if you ever have the chance. Trust me, it's worth it. This review and the single star that I am bestowing upon them is entirely due to their awful counter staff, and specifically, one incredibly rude, myopic and unpleasant woman who closed the shop on the night of Wednesday May 4 2011. There is attitude, and there is poor customer service. Attitude, I have no problem with, but being intentionally obnoxious to a customer is unacceptable. Here's a reality check for you, harpy who closed up the bakery that night - you're not really doing your company or yourself any favors by insulting and alienating customers who wander in as you're closing at 7pm and ask you what a good time is to come back for bread. The correct response in that situation is to politely point out that you're closed and to suggest some good times that I can come back the next day. The incorrect response is to say something like "Oh fuck off, I'm too tired and don't have time for this, we're closed, why don't you take your stupid little dog with you and get out." I'm pointing this out because you may have missed a few classes in high school and are probably struggling to make ends meet while feeding your all consuming meth habit and spending what is left on your delightfully mismatched tattoo collection. All of these things contribute to the person you are, so I'll try to say this in the most constructive way possible: you are the most unhelpful person that I have dealt with in a restaurant in San Francisco in five years of living here. Hands down. You win the prize for fucking up any semblance of a reputation that Tartine staff had for me. The best thing you can do for Tartine, yourself and the restaurant industry in general is to get a job where you will have minimal interactions with other humans and can work on becoming a less tired, less obnoxious, and less customer-repelling kind of human being. I suggest you start today. And yes, I will be back for the bread.

I finally tried the infamous morning bun and it is one of those rarities that 100% lives up to the hype. It is delicious. I grabbed one first thing in the morning when the line was not crazy (yet) and it was perfectly baked so not dry or dense. I thought the orange glaze was a great addition that rounded out the cinnamon and sugar. Freakin' awesome.

I had a mixed experience with Tartine as the food was good but the service and organization was way off.  I ordered the morning bun (delicious), bread pudding (my friend loved it but I am not a fan of bread pudding) and the quiche with ham (average).  The wait was about 15 minutes and the seating is limited.  In fact, I would hate to sit inside because its so crowded and busy in there.  The problem is that there was so much disorganization as it pertains to our order and we had to wait about 20 minutes before we were clued in to the fact that something is wrong and our food is not on the way.  The confusion was blamed on a new employee.  Also, customers are asked to bus their own table which I dont mind but please don't make me go inside and squeeze in between people and chairs with a pile of plates and cups.  If you want me to work, please make it easier for me.

There's no better indulgence than a crispy, flaky, hot-out-of-the-oven double pain au chocolate croissant from Tartine -- melts in the mouth, especially if you dunk a corner into their house made chai!  Actually, maybe a toasted slice of their sesame bread with jam or Nutella may be a close runner up.  Or, one of their many other pastries or savories made to perfection.   I'm hooked on this place and have been on a mission to try one of everything - with no disappointments.  Product quality is a major plus.  Here's my overall assessment: Pluses: - Items freshly baked continuously throughout the day - Excellent value ($3.50 world class baked goods) - Warm, social atmosphere - Hip, friendly staff Minuses: - Long lines & wait (during peak times)

Disclaimer: I'm a snooty raised in France, Frenchman that has only tried the morning buns, the croissants, and the croque monsieur here. Seeing as the French national pastime is criticism -- I will commence. Unless you actually live in the city, finding parking here is close to impossible. Chances are though, if you're reading this review and plan to go to Tartine anyways -- you probably need the exercise anyways. Get your walking shoes fattie! The line is long, really long. If I were a local I probably would have known not to stop by here at noon. That was a mistake, I waited almost 45 minutes. Don't plan on eating inside if you're ordered a sandwich. The eating area, line, and waiting to grab a table area are all mixed together crowded and chaotic. I can overlook all of the above for a single star rating because in the end -- its really all about the food right? Well I'm sorry to have to say that the food I have had here is just mediocre at best. The quality here is equivalent to just about any boring, common bakery in France. The only difference is the items here are huge. Enough to fill a "healthy" American appetite. You also pay for the increase in portion size with your wallet.

There's this BANANA CREAM TART at Tartine that my taste buds want to marry (against the watchful parental consent of my Wallet and my Waistline). I guess I will allow them to hang out occassionally, but not every day because I wouldn't want their love to turn into diabetes. ________________ I remember my first time at Tartine. Thank you to the guy behind me in line who told me to get the Banana Cream Tart after watching me drool over everything in the cases and not knowing what to buy. If I had an endless amount of money, I would buy it all, but if I had not tried the Banana Cream Tart that fateful day, I would be a completely different person today.

I really wish they had food when I went here.  They were out of pretty much everything I wanted to try.  Pretty big downer after waiting in line for a while. However, what I did try was excellent.  Their Lemon tart was very good with a very fresh lemon taste and light fluffy whipped cream on top.  Their cheese bread ball thing was also awesome.  I really hope to come back here and find stuff actually available though because I was definitely disappointed with the menu being effectively halved in the early afternoon.

I heard so much about this place and even when discussing while in line at a store, one of the locals ease dropping decided to chime in on how great it is. After that I had to visit this place. When we got there (~10am) the line was out the door and we waited about 20 minutes before it was our turn. The seating is first come first serve, so when you get inside and you are not alone, have your friend(s) grab any open space and you order for everyone. This is what we got and out thoughts Banana Cream Tart - Very good banana flavor, very flaky crust, but I didn't care for the chocolate the covered the bottom of the crust with. I don't like how it created a hard shell on top of the already crispy crust. I think that makes it harder to eat since I have to really stab the tart really hard to break through the chocolate and crust. Frangipane Croissant - The almond filling was very good, but I think I would have liked the Tart a bit more since there would be more almond flavored cream. Morning Bun - Very airy and flaky, not too sweet. Very well prepared. Croque Monsieur - This open faced sandwich with bechamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper topped with ham and asparagus was phenomenal! I would come here just for this. I wish I had not order the other stuff, so I could order another one of these. I think this place is a very solid breakfast place to go. The atmosphere is nice. Their pastries are good, but not spectacular in my opinion. Where they shine is in their usage of their baked goods. The open faced sandwich was great and I  lost count of how many hot pressed and panini style sandwiches I was drooling over as the server walked by with them. I will be coming back here for their sandwiches and maybe a pastry, but definitely for their sandwiches.

Came here to try the pastries for brunch even though I was a big skeptical since I am not a big fan of sweets.  But was I surprised???  There was a line already out of the door, but luckily the line moved really fast. We waited about 30 minutes before we got to the counter. We tried a lot of different pastries and I think overall they were all very good. The best part was they were not super sweet.  They also had some savory pastries in case you get sick of the sweet ones. There was free coffee refill that was really nice.  Definitely want to come here again!

I tried like the plague to avoid waiting in the Tartine line.  I could never imagine that a bakery warranted a 45 minute wait.  And when I finally got a chance to wait around and see, it turns out I was right.  Not worth the wait. My wife got a morning bun which was a basic sticky rolls with a bit of citrus flavor. Decent but not world class.  I got a slice of lemon meringue cake - really good, but not worth the wait. Try, if you can, to get a seat outside.  Some terribly friendly tourists grabbed the chair away from my table while I was situating the dog.  In order to avoid an international kerfuffle I let them have it and my wife and I shared the bench.

Lemon cream tart was an orgasm in my mouth.  Although that was the only thing I got, it was good enough for me to confidently come back to try everything else.  3000+ reviews say it all and this place is definitely not hype. Expect a line and probably no seats as well, but it's ok cause there's a park a few blocks away.  Bring a date (and a few 20 dollar bills cause this place is pricey) and enjoy the day.

The baked goods are good and the coffee decent, but can't help but feel the 'celebrity' status of this place has gone to it's head a little as the service was pretty poor - no one was too happy to see us and the separate coffee serving section didn't seem to make much sense given we had to wait a while for the same server to move over from the baking counter to the coffee section to finish our order. Flavours are good though (I thought the pastry in the banana cream was too hard and not delicate enough but maybe I came on a bad day).

Ohhhhhhhhkay. Let's talk about Tartine for a second. Let's talk about how Tartine makes all your baked goods-related dreams come true. Let's talk about how it doesn't even matter how long the line is, cuz at the end of it is always Tartine. Let's talk about how the morning bun is like sunshine and love rolled up into one perfectly crispy AND chewy carbohydrate with a hint of orange zestiness. Let's further marvel at the existence of a substance that is both perfectly crispy AND chewy, and also involves the word "zestiness." In addition to this said morning "sunshine/love" bun, I have also had the banana cream tart, the lemon tart, the almond croissant, the gougere (pronounced "googly-goo"), and the bread pudding. Everything was good. Everything. Let's talk about how you need to go to Tartine RIGHT NOW.

As far as bakeries go, this one is by far one of the best I have ever been to. The line was out the door, but it moved surprisingly fast and was well worth the wait. The line was actually a blessing in disguise since it allowed time to attempt to narrow down what item(s) I wanted to try. The two items I narrowed it down to were the croissant croissant and veggie quiche. Both were absolutely amazing. I've heard from my other friends that they have yet to get something they don't like. I can't wait to go back and try something new! I did not try their lattes, but I look forward to next time I visit.

Delicious! This is what a bakery is supposed to be like.  Busy, bustling with people sipping coffees and chowing down on Almond Frangipane, Coconut Cream Pies, and croissants that are to die for.   I would take a bag of treats here as a gift ANYDAY. YUM! This place is as good as a European bakery!

For pure excellence of execution in the category of baked goods, Tartine is off the charts.  It's astonishing that it took me so long to get here given it is less than 2 miles from home, and I'm never more than 2 minutes from craving desserts.   I went two consecutive days to maximize the number of different items I tried, and still found myself seriously compromised.  The exquisite Tres Leches Cake was the runaway overall winner - moist, rich, abundantly flavorful, and devilishly decadent.  Whenever you want to momentarily suspend all dietary concerns, I can imagine no better indulgence. Not everything at Tartine is a-ok.  The staff is, by-and-large, indifferent, aloof and impatient.  There's no attempt made to keep the seating area organized or turned over efficiently, and the curious table-signs instruct patrons to clean up after themselves.  For such a small place, having a roving staff person policing the handful of tables wouldn't be a heavy lift, and the tubs of used dishes are hidden behind the line. A major upside of Tartine is the excellent live music performed every other Thursday night from 6 to 8 pm by the local band Gaucho (http://www.myspace.com/g…), a "gypsy jazz" quartet (at least here, in the rather small space) with smooth, mellow melodies and enough of a friendly disposition to (almost) make up for the cranky staff.

I ate at Tartine Bakery while visiting San Francisco. We were visiting a friend in the Mission area and one of my buddy's suggested we try Tartine Bakery. We had just finished eating brunch, but that has never stopped me before. I am always down for good food no matter how stuffed I am. When we arrived there was a decent size line. It took about 15 minutes to get to the counter. But it was worth the wait. The pastries look so delicious. We ended up ordering a coconut cream tart, a lemon cream tart, and a Prosciutto and Provolone Grilled Sandwich. The Prosciutto sandwich was topped with arugula and provolone, served with a pickled carrot. Very Tasty! The tarts were also awesome! Tartine is a great place if you feel like a light meal or you feel like some yummy pastries! Plus, it's walking distance to Bi-Rite Creamery (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…). As a foodie I'm always down to hit up many delicious eateries in a row! =P

I love tartine so much i visited twice today! Tried the croque monsieur for breakfast, with ham, and loved the bread so much i returned at 6 for two loaves of bread. The country white and whole wheat are equally delicious. I ate both with honey, garlic and a fine olive oil from bi-rite. Thanks to these fine establishments i can eat like the 1%, thank you mission pioneers!

If you read nothing else, be warned: Tartine = Alluring Baked Goods with Heinously Outrageous Price Tags Even so, I found myself wide-eyed and pointing at everything signaling the nice guy behind the counter to just bag it all to go, and to also please stop looking at me with such disbelief. I told him (but moreso, myself) I can and will finish twelve pastries in 24 hours. Have faith man, have faith. And I didn't care if I had to give them all the cash in my pocket. I HAD to have what they were selling. Wait a minute, are we in Japan? Oh hold up, no it's much too dirty outside- can't be. *Shrug* One star docked because everything is so alluring but PRICEY!!!!!! $3.75 for a measly morning bun? Excuse me, but I can almost buy TWO In-N-Out burgers for that amount. Holy Cowabungers.

My friend raves about this bakery.  The boyfriend and I stopped by this bakery for breakfast and the lines were out the door and I got lucky with parking. If you don't know what you want, don't worry because you have time to decide. While waiting in line, we could see all these pretty little sweets in the display windows.  I was in the mood for something savory so I decided to go with the quiche.  But I seriously contemplated the morning bun - especially since the line was so long. The quiche was really good (ham and leeks) and there was a subtle hint of an herb that went really well with the ham. Another savory item we tried was the croque monsier.  They are a bakery so the bread that the sandwich was on really good.  It came with a pickled carrot on the side -yum! The downside - its pricey (not sure its worth it) Long lines the girl working the register doesn't care to give good customer service. Not being regulars, they told us the croque monsier will take 20 min to come out - so we asked if it was worth the wait. Her response: if you feel like waiting.  So is that a yes or no? We waited.  It was good.  I think I would have gotten a pastry while we were waiting for the sandwich if the line wasn't so long.

WOW  I totally spent $250 on repeat visits during the first week I found out about this place! The pastries are the best.  I have tried most items and all are very good, though my personal favorites are the bread pudding, the MORNING BUN, and the banana tart. So why just 3 stars?  Because I'm not into hipsters, or people with dirty fingernails handing me my bread.  And yeah, the CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!!!

I guess I'm just not really into pastries as much as the 3000 people who reviewed this joint. I got the Banana Cream Tart and the Morning Bun. While both were good/tasty, they weren't something I'd ever crave or highly recommend to someone. I guess I'm just not the pastry kind of dude. With that said, if you love sweets and bakeries in general, you'll probably really like this place. Try to come at non-peak hours even though the long line can go by relatively quickly.

Holy Heck! This place has a lot of reviews. I doubt I will add much then, but here goes. Came here for lunch on a Friday and the line was out the door as usual. Don't be intimidated though, these guys know what they're doing and it moves fairly quickly. I had the eclair and the Double Pain au Chocolat, which is amazing. Yes it is pricey, but worth every penny. Their seasonal tarts are so yummy and you can totally microwave it later and it tastes just as good! Parking is tough in this area, but I will be back and next time, it will be at 5pm for when they take the bread out of the oven.

ok it's been a while since i was here, but I can understand why the line went for half a block. the croque monsieur was devoured with the quickness--the cappuccino was done by a barrista (including the fun coffee art) and along with the obscene amount of pasties that bought that morning, I have to say we were very happy about making this stop. If i were to stop in this place again I wouldn't mind sitting down for a proper meal here. I think i remember eating the banana cream tart and the lemon tart--to be honest I'm not sure if i was a fan of the texture of the tarts--something about the custard was off... The morning buns were pretty good too =] all in all it was worth waiting to have at as the first meal of the day.

Went here with my wife during one of our trips. Loved it so much we continued to come back every morning until we left San Fran. The quiches were so absolutely fantastic. About the closest you'll get to a food orgasm. I sometimes wonder if I could get away with flying out to San Fran going straight here, picking up some pastries and flying right back before anyone would know I was gone. Very tempting. Their selection is also very good as there are plenty of options to choose from. I understand why some people turn into "dear-in-headlights" at the counter but it is something to deal with as this place is popular and stays pretty busy. If you happen to be in San Francisco, then you have to treat yourself to this place at least once before you go. Personally I think that's torture as you'll have to wait until the next time you come back to savor their delicious treats but hey, if you're into that, se la vie.

This is where to go for a decadent treat or two or three.   Some quick advice: 1. Forget what people say to get (morning buns, whatevs).  Best lemon tart in the whole wide world.  Rich crust, excellent level of tartness which is perfect offset by the sweet cream dollop.  Get this if you are the kind of person that can appreciate those kinds of details. 2. Forget about how much it will cost.  This is a decadent treat. 3. Forget about the line / wait. 4. Remember that it's close to Bi-Rite and Pizzeria Delfina. 5. Remember where you parked, cuz it was probably far away... This is probably my favorite bakery, along with La Farine in Berkeley/Oakland.

I came here on a Saturday afternoon and only had to wait about 15 minutes. I ordered the lemon cream tart, an eclair, the lemon poppy seed pound cake, and a mocha. Everything was extraordinarily delicious (I was about to write something about what in particular was delicious, but truly, everything was. If I could pick two favorites, they would be the eclair and the pound cake). Perhaps a 4.5 star; I really prefer to award 5s based on the experience which, here, was really in and out. But the taste alone deserves it. Kudos.

Walking into Tartine is like walking into the photos of a fancy cookbook.  This place is really cute and enjoyable... if you can catch a seat. Otherwise, you have to grab your goodies to go.   The Trés Leches cake is more of a reinterpretation, so I wouldn't order it with preconceived ideas of how you like your Trés Leches.  The bread pudding is good but not to die for... but to be politically correct, there shouldn't be any baked goodies one should die for.  Ahh.. but yet we all live so dangerously. The prices are pretty high, but they are worthwhile if you can find a seat for decent people watching, while pretending that you are reading your book, while pretending that your conversation is enjoyable, while pretending that coffee really does take hours to finish.  You know who you are!

Teased by my first plain croissant at tartine, I decided to come back again because I wanted to try kinds of croissants. And then I found myself coming back again. And then yet again! So truth be told, Tartine, as much as I wasn't in love with your morning bun, your croissants keep me coming back. Recently, I finally was able to try their double chocolat pain. OMG! It was love at first taste. It was so buttery, huge, flaky. Hands down this is better than the first chocolate croissant I had at Bouchon. The more I come here, the more I believe their croissants are superior to Bouchon's. Yumm! I also had the Frangipane which was equally good and some Gougere. The Gougere, I thought would be heavy and thick. But it was light and similar a pastry puff. Unfilled but interior crusted with cheese and thime. It was delicious! The numerous times that I have been, I've never had trouble with the line when I go during off the busy hours. I usually go early morning or late in afternoon. For more options, I'd go early morning to get more options.

This time, I tried the Banana Cream Tart and it was ammmmaazzzingg!  It had light and fluffy cream topped with chocolate shavings and stuffed with slices of sweet bananas - all floating above a cookie crust.  I am dreaming about it right this moment and I can't wait to go back for more!  This one item made my day.  I had the quiche as well, but I can do without it. They make a delicious latte as well.

I tried the Croque Monsieur and a seasonal tart (chocolate hazelnut) here.  Didn't like it as much as I thought I would - everyone I knew gave me high reviews about Tartine, but the Croque Monsieur wasn't that spectacular and the chocolate hazelnut tart was a big drier than I would've liked. The chocolate was good though. I guess their lemon tart and the banana cream tart are the best items, since I see good Yelp reviews from people who tried those. I wish I could've tried more items here. Also, my professor brought morning buns from Tartine to class the other day, and I tried one. It was good, but it wasn't out-of-the-ordinary or anything. Still couldn't find out what the big deal is. Although I'm not very impressed with the items I tried, I'm still thinking of going back to try other things - mainly to find out what other people are so crazy about.

The last 2 times I've been, I had the most APPALLING customer service.  Once I went close to closing time and when I stepped inside to ask if the cash register was still open, the chick behind the counter bellows at me: "LOOK AT THE SIGN AT THE DOOR.  WE'RE CLOSED."  She didn't see my horrified expression because she promptly turned to continue chit-chatting with her coworker.  Totally uncalled for. I used to not mind the long lines or the waiting for a seat.  Now I'm happy to go down the street to a joint where the employees aren't antagonistic. P.S. I'm giving you 1 star because your giant chocolate croissant is so goddamn delicious and you deserve that much...

I came here upon a friend's recommendation and although I was WAY too full from Ike's and Bi-Rite, I seemed to have had a third stomach for delicious pastries. My friends and I managed to squeeze into the bustling bakery and get in line (that eventually snaked outside the store).  Unfortunately, when we got there, they had run out of their most coveted morning bun. What I got, instead, was their Frangipane Tart, Lemon Cream Tart, and Citron Green Tea. Frangipane Tart: flaky + subtle almond cream = delicious. The sliced almonds on top provided just the right amount of crunch to their flaky pastry. The almond cream in the center of the pastry had the perfect consistency and complemented the bread so well. Lemon Cream Tart: let's just say that I am usually not a fan of lemon cream tart... but Tartine's was DELICIOUS. It is easily the best lemon cream tart I've ever tasted. The tartiness of their lemon cream was excellent and subtle. The zest complemented the slight sweetness of the bread really well. Great combination. Citron Tea: mildly sweetened--not my usual--but it was definitely refreshing and... honest. I don't know how else to explain it! Perfectly crisp. I love the ambiance and the natural lighting. Tartine is encased by large windows that allow for sunlight (and the sunset) to peer through.  The large wooden tables give Tartine a serene, homey feel... which I love. For now, I'd give Tartine four stars even though I want to give them five. I'll have to wait to try their morning buns to decide! :)

Came kind of late in the day, so a lot of the pastries were gone, but I ordered the chocolate pudding and it each bite was soo smooth and silky. Topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings, it is the perfect treat to satisfy that sweet tooth craving. My friend ordered the bread pudding which was also very good and filled with a trifecta of mixed berries and just the right amount of sweetness. Definitely coming back earlier in the day to try the lemon tart though!

I finally had the chance to visit this establishment! I just can't believe I waited as long as I did. This is literally the crown jewel of french pastry in San Francisco!! After standing in a 30-minute line on a Friday morning (which is relatively a short wait from what I hear), I left with the following goodies: - morning bun - chocolate croissant - chocolate chip cookie - bread pudding Every single item was so damn good! The bread pudding was the only item that I've actually tasted better versions of (mine included), but the others were simply delectable -- top notch!! I highly recommend this place for ANY pastry craving and/or need you many have. I also saw full-size cakes and mini desserts in their cases, so they definitely have quite a selection! P.S. Grab the goods and head to Dolores Park just up the street to grub. The establishment is fairly tiny and uber crowded, so dining within is bound to be a frenzied experience.

Yes, the lemon bar looks scrumptious. Get it next time. Yes, the croque monsieur looks delectable. Get it next time. I think you get the point. Everything is great, but the morning bun is to die for, best thing ever, have to eat at least one even if you fly from Minnesota, so good it'll make you want to slap yo mama, lick your lips, eat every crumb, tender, flaky, caramelized, honey, orange, sweet, not to sweet, amazingness in a bun.

Best quiche ever, with a super flaky crust. yum. Then I shared a Lemon Cream Tart with my bff, it was tangy and light. The crust was so yummy. We couldnt help it, so we ordered a banana cream tart. The crust was flaky, and there was a layer of dark chocolate. Then caramel!! Omg, I love caramel. My favorite part was the banana cream. Im not a fan of dark chocolate. The line wasnt so bad, and we found seats. (: We had a delishus time at Tartine, and we'll be back!!

The long wait can be killer, and admittedly a reason to deduct a star (that and the fact that a number of the pastries, etc are not up to par), but overall a great place to eat.  The tarts, puddings, cakes, breads, éclairs (!!!) make for a delicious breakfast and combine that with some delicious coffee, you are set for the day.

I was looking for an exceptionally delicious dessert to bring to my brother for his birthday.  Yelp guided me to Tartine.   It was pretty crowded when I got there.  The line wasn't out the door but it was to the door.  Lucky for me some of their larger items were still there at 4:30 in the  afternoon on a Sunday.  I did have my heart set on the banana cream tart but sadly, they were out.  The runner up was the coconut cream tart!   The pastry crust on the coconut cream tart was so flaky and yummy!!  I can't even think of worthy adjectives for the actually filling.... Anyway, it's beyond scrumptious.  I can't wait to go back and get that banana cream tart!  Everything else in their pastry case looked amazing and the food menu looks good.  I'll be back!

In most American cities, to create a line as long as the one at Tartine, you should post a sign saying "Free Money". In San Francisco that sign should read "artisnal food priced in the upper quadrant of its market segment". This place just isn't better *enough* than other very good places nearby - like Dolores Park Cafe, a short walk away - to justify this sort of wait time and crowded atmosphere, unless you are religiously adherent to the Temple of The Tartine Baking Method. My latest visit there featured the standard-issue 30 minute wait, a very good croissant and good coffee, stressed-out and abrupt service, and ridiculous crowding by American standards. It did not feel welcoming or worth the wait. To reference another review, it really did feel like I had gone on a ride at Disneyland - The Tartine Ride - and I left feeling like I woudn't need to do it again for a long time.

Walking in and being greeted with the sweet bakery smell, you must exercise great restraint from ordering every thing you see (or is that just me?). I love the Double Pan au Chocolat and the Morning Buns.  The Pan au Chocolat is flaky on the outside, soft & moist on the inside, and is filled with rich valrohna chocolate. It's better to come early on a weekday as it gets super busy on the weekends.  But if you want to try one of their loaves of bread, come after 5pm and NOT on a Monday.

Tartine bakery is within walking distance from Dolores Park. There seems to be always a line in front of this place. They must be doing something right if people are willing to wait. The croissant was perfect! I never had one sooo good. The chocolate croissant was good, but the chocolate in it tasted weird in my opinion. The brownie was probably one of the tastiest I've ever had. I could not stop eating it until I finished the whole brownie. I thought the prices were reasonable for some of the most delicious pastries you'll ever have. The bakery is always packed, which I didn't like. good luck finding a seat! I would recommend getting take out, and having breakfast or lunch at the park.

Their baked goods are always high quality and their staff are friendly despite the never ending lines. My only complaint is that they are always out of certain things, and who can blame them for that?! Their stuff is just too good to keep on the shelf!

Oh gentrified Mission, how I hate and love you! Definitely one of the best things to come out of this area in transition is this bakery. Hands down, my favorite bakery of all time. And I've been to a lot of bakeries. If I eat an almost croissant every morning with one of their giant mochas, I'd be a happy gal. I'd also probably be dying of clogged arteries but who can complain about that when you're eating yummy, buttery goodness? My favorites include the bread pudding (especially in the summer when they use seasonal fruit like berries), the quiche, the vanilla tarts, and the chocolate croissants. And their panini's are ridiculous too. I love everything about this place--the people, the food, the half a block wait just to get in. It's one of the few places that actually lived up to its reputation and that I'd be more than willing to wait for. I can't give it 5 stars though because parking is a b**** and it's hard to find a seat inside.

I must warn you, the line is long....very long....so come early. I came here on a cold windy sunday morning, the sky was cloudy, and it was lightly sprinkling. And I hate hate hate the rain. I didnt have an extra coat and the line was long. Once I got into the inside, I ordered their ham and cheese croissant and took a bite out of it, and wow...best croissant I have ever had in my entire life! I was giddy and happy for the rest of the day.

Saturday morning 10AM wait wasn't too bad and I was lucky to find parking around the corner. Waited about 20 minutes and finally got to the window display of goodies. It was a lovely display of pastries. We my list in mind, we started ordering: * Croissant $3.85 (4.5 of 5) Yummy. I really liked how they baked it. It was flaky, layered, and buttery inside, but there was crisp on the outer layer. I didn't really appreciate Bouchon's crossiant, but I really like Tartine's and I would get it again. It is so different from local supermarket. I strongly recommend this one. * Bread Pudding $3.75 (2.5 of 5) It is ok. I would skip this next time. Had fresh fruit and was a little soggy for me. * Open Faced Sandwich $9.75 (3 of 5) on Tartine Country Bread covered with smoked ham, fromage blanc, shitake mushrooms, spicy turkey. Gourmet open face sandwich to fill the stomach, but I can pass it next time.  Maybe it would taste better if they reheat it in the oven when you order it, but $10 was a little pricy for one piece of bread. * Banana Cream Tart $7.00 (5 of 5) A must must must must try. Oh my. The best tart I ever had. Not that sweet and I love the small coating of chocolate layer between the pastry and the cream. And the chocolate shavings on top add an extra texture and flavor to the tart. I even like the tart pastry that holds the cream content. Absolutely wonderful creation, I am not a fan of tarts, but I am a fan of Tartine's Banana Cream Tart! * Morning Bun $3.85 (4 of 5) Tasty especially with a cup of hot tea or hot coffee. It has a cute overflowing muffin shape. And I noticed the outside and the middle tastes different. The outside parts are a little crispier, but the middle is a little moister because it is thicker. I like the middle more. But it is a great piece of pastry. This item is listed on 7X7 2012 100 Top Eats, but I think the Banana Cream Tart is much tastier. Delightful pastry morning selections and I believe it was worth the wait. The banana cream tart is a must try.

When we first got there, there was a line out the door, but we didn't mind waiting since we just had donuts and coffee. When we got in, we decided to order a sandwich and some little desserts that they had. Everything we had was amazingly good, but I have to say that the sandwich was SUPER spicy. I didn't expect it at all, so it was a little unpleasant. It didn't say anything in the description about it being spicy, so I assumed it wasn't. It did say it had horseradish in it, but even after taking the horseradish out, it was spicy. I think they put some kind of spicy dijon mustard in it or something, but man... I couldn't take more than one bite without crying from the heat. Beware of the pastrami sandwich, non-spicy eaters! I could tell though that it was delicious, even though I couldn't eat much of it, and obviously that did not deter me from giving this place 5 stars!  The bread was so fresh and crispy and the pastrami itself was delicious. We had quiche too, which was amazing! YUM! Gotta go back here for some more pastries.

After reading such great reviews about Tartine's, we knew one day, we had to try it out.   Early one morning, around 6AM, my husband decides to get up since we were already jet lagged from our Thailand honeymoon and go out to the city.  He suggests trying Tartine's Bakery.  Insane, I know!  Normally I'm not a morning person, but this was such a great idea.   Tartine's did not disappoint at all!  We were so excited to try this place that we went a lil nuts and got a bunch of goodies.  Chocolate croissants, chocolate tea cake, morning buns, and the works!  Their chocolate croissants were off the chain, just decadent.  My favorite is the chocolate tea cake, yum-o!  Somtimes when my girl from the city comes over to our place, she surprises me with this since we both love it so much!  Thanks Trinh!   You gotta get there early...when we got there, there were already people in line, however, it moved fairly quick!  I'd definitely recommend coming here to get some tasty pastries if you are ever up early or just in the city.  You won't regret it, you will want to come back again and again!   It was a great day for my hubby and I just to unwind and enjoy each other's couple as a newly married couple and grab some sweet treats at Tartine's.

Wow, can't believe this place is almost hitting 3000 reviews. Well, they're particularly know for their Banana Cream Pie and I think it's definitely one of a kind. It hits the foodgasmic level. The banana cream pie has so surprises and I'll give props if you can finish it without making a mess of yourself. Another dessert I'd recommend is the bread pudding, which is absolutely amazing! Besides the bread pudding I had at Flour in Cambridge, this is the 2nd best bread pudding I've ever had. It's super moist, except if you leave it for too long, all the juice could get messy. Overall, it definitely has the wow factor and is worth a try.

My sister doesn't like this place because there's too much butter. There's not such thing as "too much butter." Ugh how are we related? Had the chocolate croissant, morning bun and (drum roll....) pastrami sandwich. OK it's a bit pricey, but the sandwich was big and so sooooooo good. Their bread is awesome, I'll probably be lined up at 5PM trying to get some. Croissant was also good and the morning bun was okay (too orange-y for me). Definitely worth the wait and a try.

I don't know if this place is worth the wait. The first time, we ordered in under 5 mins (a little after 1:00 PM). The second time, we waited in line for over 50 mins. I don't know if any pastry is worth an hour wait. That being said, I really liked the lemon cream tart, which was the only thing I tried. I thought it was awesome. Lemon desserts are my favorite, and I always get them when we go to $$$ restaurants, and Tartine makes a unique, light, mellow, and tasty tart.

Destination: Tartine 400 Miles ETA 6 hours! Go! It was more like 24 hours, as we took the scenic route (they closed by the time we got into the city!) and i patiently waited until the next day to hit my top destination for SF! I originally wanted to go with SF's "Dessert Girl" Patty P.'s plan of doing a triple hit of the Big Eats SF 7X7 List.  5pm fresh bread day 1 (paired with another 7X7 item Brillat Savarian cheese from Bi rite market) , and  morning bun day 2. Patty and Janice C: Your obsession with this Big Eats List has rubbed off on me!  However, i was only able to try the morning bun- which was a delicious treat of sugary orangy cinnamony goodness! I was a little sad i couldn't get there earlier when it would be a bit warmer and softer. The Double Pain Au Chocolate- (recently featured on my fave show The Best Thing I Ever Ate) was super buttery and flaky and luckily not burnt. You definitely get a good amount of bitter sweet chocolate in each bite! I enjoyed it, but i think i would have preferred a less bitter chocolate, even tho i love dark chocolate. Raved about by Daniel L, Diana I and Patty P, i also got the Banana Cream Tart. It was bigger than i imagined and soooo good! The cream and the fresh bananas were perfectly paired with the huge shaved chocolate layers on top. The only thing was the chocolate laden crust was superhard and was difficult to eat on the road. :( Mission Accomplished! A personality test recently told me i love making lists and love crossing them off (verrry true!). This was definitely on the top of my list and will always be a spot to be crossed off every future SF visit!

When I was little, I stuck a bean up my nose.  It was a pinto bean, and it was beige with speckles. See?  There's something that the other 1212 reviews didn't tell you. Tartine's food is awesome and comforting and delicious.  The staff's customer service is questionable at times, but they are all very pretty... I guess it's a trade-off? I love their quiche and their morning buns.  Find a bench outside and share your food.  Make sure to grab some napkins and a fork.  In fact, keep that fork, because walking through the Mission, you might need it to protect you.

After 1377 reviews, THIS ONE is clearly the one that is going to shed some new light on Tartine. I feel like this is the kind of place that should have a movie or sitcom done about it. Have you ever seen Fried Green Tomatoes? You know how the cafe is so stylized? This is the same. The way the people dress is just so perfect, always walking around in rolled up, flour-covered overalls or frilly shirts with flowers pins in their hair. I wish they would just start a food fight. The freshly baked items are crazy delicious - most are even better than many of the ones I've had in Paris. You need to know and love the almond croissants, the morning buns, and the open face croque monsieurs. They definitely deserve all the awards they've received. However, I'm always slightly disappointed with the items in the glass case - a bit pricey for something not that amazing (with the exception of the lemon bars and frangipane berry tarts). Even though they look seductive, I'd stick to the other choices. And, oh my god the bread. Oh. My. God. I get close to tears of joy whenever I think of a loaf of walnut bread. It's crazy crowded but whatever, good things come to people who wait.

Remember that colorful food pyramid on the back of Cheerio's boxes? I really wish it wasn't proven to be a load of rubbish touted by the cereal industry to sell more of their products not fit to be livestock feed no matter how much its fortified... /end rant (for interwebz throwback sake) ... so I could justify eating copious amounts of toe-curlingly awesome carbpackages from Tartine. First, I'd start with a simple meringue to warm up the palate - terrifically whipped egg whites and pleasant amounts of sugar with a satisfying crunch, and no flour filler. Then we'd move onto the two-bite Friands, valrhona chocolate tarts topped with ganache - rich and delicately bitter. Next up, breakfast! The Frangipane croissant, flaky and buttery studded with shaved almonds outside and almond paste in, I wish I had a lifetime supply of these. And for dessert, my current sweet obsession: banana cream pie. I've gotta say, this one was a bummer - dense, hard crust that had to be cut with a knife, a meager portion of bananas and pudding - the best part was the chocolate shavings on top. But no need to end on a bitter note, the vitrine is brimming with delights that are well worth a gander and munch. For best results, skip the interminable weekend queue by playing hooky or popping over for lunch, then snag some goodies for a Dolores Park picnic!

I hate living so close to this place.  Truly hate it. If I had PMS and lived in the Sunset, I'd just eat the five month old Oreo's from my cupboard.  I have PMS in the gourmet food ghetto of the Mission and I have Lemon-moistened genoise layered with caramel and lemon cream.  Topped with torched peaks of meringue. That's if I'm not craving their seasonal bread pudding, lemon or banana cream tarts or Croque Monsieur. Worth the wait.

Such terrible service my friend and I have never experienced! I went in there 2 minutes after they closed and asked if I could buy one of the remaining 5 cakes. This blond woman said no in the rudest way, that I pretty much wrote her off as a horrible person. Then I thought about the fact that I made a special trip there to get a cake for someone from out of town. So I asked someone else working the counter. Who though agreed made me feel guilty about it. Her exact words whine, "Okay, but I have a lot of work to do." Like I was asking her to smuggle drugs. Then the very rude blond woman made a dash back to bitch me out for asking again for a cake. She works in a bakery and she's bitching me out for spending $40 on a cake. Blond woman's name is Leslie. I've never been one to try to use Yelp as a forum to ask for a business to be out of business but in this case lets seriously consider it. Minus the fact that I went out of my way to go there, lets just say I went into a bakery and wanted to buy a cake and I get assaulted for it. Does their management really having nothing to do with this. Could they have not hired at least (1) person that at the very least can do a transaction without a back story. Let alone be vile without doing the transaction. Twice? All signs seem to point that these people are just cashing in on their name and they do not appreciate those that patron them. Your money is better spent elsewhere. Please save yourself the trouble of having your day& night absolutely ruined. You buy sweets to celebrate something small to big and they try really hard to be mean and dash that from you. Update: I called them Tartine to tell them what happened and left a msg. No one has bothered to call me back to just apologize.

I'm a night owl, so waking up early is excruciating for me. The last time I was at Tartine in the late afternoon, they didn't have the ever popular morning bun, which makes sense, since who in their right mind would come here that late and come looking for a morning bun? (only I of course!) So, one REALLY early Monday morning, I somehow managed to sleepwalk to Tartine. There was a short line when I arrived, but I was in and out in 15 minutes. Of course, EVERYTHING looked wonderful (but really pricey) so I had to restrain myself. My goodie bag included: - 2 morning buns - damn you 7 x 7 Magazine! I sacrificed my beauty sleep just so I can cross off #8 on the Big Eats SF list. Boy, these were a thousand times better than Starbuck's version: huge, soft buns topped with a orange-cinnamon sugar, it was a little sticky to the touch but perfect mouthfeel. - Gougere - light pastry dough filled with melted Gruyere. Seasoned with black-pepper and thyme. Gruyere is a cheese I really like and I really, really like this version. - Pain au chocolat - a disappointment. The underside of my croissant was burnt! Not the one to waste any type of pastry, I peeled the burnt part off and enjoyed the rest of the buttery crust. - Frangipane tart - this was sensational.  The light almond cream filling shines, topped with blueberry jam and lots of sliced almonds. An absolute must try, especially for almond lovers. I don't remember if I ate everything in one sitting as all of it was one big carbohydrate blur. I do want to say that after gorging yourself on yummy pastries, operating heavy machinery is not advised.

WARNING!  There is a mean woman working the cash register at Tartine Bakery who is akin to the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld.  She actually had the gall to try and intimidate my friend and I out of buying the additional gougères and croissants that we had ever so politely asked for.  Good thing we didn't stand for this nonsense and walked out of there with what we asked and paid for because stuff this good doesn't come cheap! That being said, I'm not sure why the Soup Nazi woman would be so mean and unhappy in a place like Tartine Bakery, where they're literally in the business of making people fat and happy.  People go bananas over these near perfect French pastries, and rightfully so.  At $3.25 each, their near perfect butter croissants are massive, flaky and when devoured, will make a perfectly flaky mess all over you.  And at an additional $3.25 each, their wonderfully light and cheesy gougères are the best kind of airy popover, so much, that you'll be able to eat about 10.   But at $6.35 each, the Banana Cream Tart is what paid critics (not me) would call ... "A REVELATION..."  You absolutely positively MUST get one of these to share (or not to share), and never you mind that you don't eat anything "banana."  Deceptively non-sweet, this fresh cream topped tart covers several thin layers of banana, a hint of caramel, a thin layer of chocolate, all encased inside the sturdiest, most flaky tart shell you could ever imagine.  This tart is the PRIME example of how something like this doesn't have to be sickeningly sweet, showcasing Tartine Bakery's excellent use of sugar.  In fact, the tart ends up being refreshing - the perfect little thing to eat outside while watching dogs walk their owners around Delores Park. Overall, like any SF landmark eatery, the lines sometimes stretch down the block.   Tag teaming with a friend is definitely appropriate - you wait in line at Tartine Bakery, and your friend holds your spot down the street at Bi Rite Creamery.  Enjoy everything while sitting outside at the Delores Park Café while sipping on an espresso.  Perfect afternoon!

I came up with another grand scheme for a friend and I to cross two more items off of the Big Eat SF List (I'm so glad I found a fellow unemployed Type A personality who will go through this list like it's our job with me). Since Tartine has not one, but TWO items on the list, we planned to go in the morning for the first item (morning bun), then lounge in Dolores Park for a few hours and return for the second (loaf of bread warm from the oven, slathered in cheese from Bi-Rite Market). Yes, my self-appointed "job" is a tough one, but someone's got to do it. The first part of the plan went smoothly, but I failed to realize that Tartine's bread does not come out of the oven until 5 pm, so part two has been postponed for another day. After a strenuous afternoon of lying in the sun, it was important I get home and rest. So now, onto the report. And while I freely admit to being a complete glutton, I promise that the following was not all consumed in just this one breakfast trip... - BIg Eat SF item #17: Morning Bun from Tartine. Buttery, flaky, delicious. The center of a morning bun is always the best part -- gooey and soft, and this one had an amazing caramelized top. I would have liked if some nut topping were involved as well, but no such luck. - Pumpkin Bread: For me, this bread epitomizes the taste of Fall. Spiced, flavorful, baked to perfection. We don't get four full-blown seasons here in San Francisco, and a bite of this pumpkin bread may be the closest you'll get to a "real" Fall. -  Zucchini Bread: Very tasty, but not quite up to par with the pumpkin. I liked the bits of walnut in the bread, but something like this has to be pretty darn amazing for me to choose it over a more gluttonous morning pastry. - Ham Quiche: This one was my friend's pick. I won't say it was bad because I highly doubt it was, but quiche just isn't my thing. Too eggy and cheesy for me. The crust was perfectly flaky and nicely browned. - Gougére: Another savory item, and predictably, not my fave. A giant bun filled with cheese. A must for cheese lovers, a pass for me. - Banana Cream Tart: Ok now we are getting into the real deal. Tarts like this don't just come along every day. Flakey pastry coated in dark chocolate with caramel, pastry cream, and lightly sweetened cream. Chocolate + caramel + banana = WOW. - Tres Leches Cake: This one must have been a seasonal item, as I don't see it on the online menu. My memory is failing me, though I do recall this wasn't your traditional tres leches cake and every time I put my fork down and said "I'm done", I was back within seconds for just one last bite.   - Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian: Always save the best for last. Lime-moistened genoise with passion fruit Bavarian.  Topped with sweetened cream and coconut. I'm about to make a bold statement....I think, that this just may be, the best slice of cake I have ever had. And I don't even particularly care for lime or coconut. There have been more than a few occasions when I've found myself lying in bed late at night thinking about this cake. Like right now. And thus concludes my lengthy review of a place with nearly 2,000 other reviews, and I think I gained about 40 lbs just writing about so many delicious pastries. I am officially exhausted, and in desperate need of more cake.

Who are those crazy people lined up at Tartine Bakery at 8am on a Saturday? A friend who drove across down so his out of town guests could experience the best bakery in the City. A mom who brought her baby girl who knew the word "Tartine" almost as well as she knew the word "Mommy." A guy who was first in line that said, "I am here because my girlfriend LOVES Tartine."***   IT IS. THAT. GOOD. A buttery, doughy, flakey, orangey, sugary, caramel-y Tartine Morning Bun is pure LOVE baby!  It tastes best fresh out of the oven at home and in your PJs.

Tartine Bakery.....at 1935 reviews, do you think that's going to stop me from throwing in my 2 cents? Heccccccck NO! *Just* got over there for the 1st time ever - cause let's face it, sometimes I can be slow on the uptake. Even though it was 9:30 am Good Friday, the line was manageable so I hopped in Smells coming from their ovens are outrageously amazing so I thought I'd be in for a real treat. The line moved pretty quickly to boot so props for great service! Got a smattering.....Brioche Bread Pudding & Buttermilk Scone for me; Morning Bun & Almond Lemon Tea Cake for Sis Scone was dense yet fluffy, moist & buttermilky & had good ratio of currants - took it home & paired it w/ some jam & we were golden!  It was a good scone but didn't blow my socks off As for the Bread Pudding, in my humble opinion, I've had better. I was expecting something sweeter yet this was bland & tasted like soggy bread w/ cooked apples on top - and those were pretty bland too. Now I *know* bread pudding's main ingredient IS soggy bread but it usually doesn't taste like it.  I'm used to something packed down & dense w/ lots of vanilla, cinnamon or *something* to give it a flavorful, cakey texture.   I have to say I much prefer the Bread Pudding from Cafe XO to this bread pudding Sis' assessment: Morning Bun - awesomely delicious! As she was eating it, she was having a flashback to New Orleans Bread Pudding - which is our ultimate pinnacle of Bread Puddings. The top was crispy-chewy texture b/c of the caramelized sugar; the middle has a rich uber-buttery croissant like texture....and only the slightest hint of orange (Too bad I'll never get to try - the orange ruins it for me as I *hate* citrus in my baked goods) Almond Lemon Tea Cake - too sweet for Sis. Seemed to be soaked in a simple syrup which made it wet (as opposed to moist) & a sweet lemonny flavor (as opposed to a tart lemon). Would not get again So overall we think Tartine is A-OK & we'd swing by if we were passing & there was no line, but we wouldn't make a special trip

While I was galloping to Dolores Park, I had to pause to look over at why this little corner shop was so crowded. I looked through the window and saw..desserts? Yes, I have a sweet tooth, I stood in line and waited..for at most 10 minutes and picked out a chocolate croissant for myself. I continued my gallop to Dolores eating my croissant. Just kidding, galloping in San Francisco is not possible. And why did no one tell me I had chocolate all over my face?!

Drinks: I've had both a latte and chai latte here but didn't think anything of them.  The coffee, however, is always fresh and piping hot- even better when you consider the free refills. Food: Like most others, I think the baked goods are absolutely delicious.     Complaint: While the coffee and goodies are top-notch, I don't think that they're worth the (often) 1+ hour wait, especially when you consider that a) it'll probably be raining out, b) once you place your order, there will be no place to sit, c) if there is a place to sit, be prepared to race and deal with snide remarks, and d) don't expect to get any sympathy from the staff because they're not too friendly.

Friends of ours were in town from New Zealand, and Wifey and I wanted to show them some home cooking.  A short trip to BiRite yeilded the few missing ingredients for Wifey's famous pasta.  As I walked up to pay, I passed by BiRite's refrigerator case, glanced at the various cakes, pies, and delictable baked goods housed therein, and said to myself "no, I'll buy dessert at Tartine."  I had just walked past Tartine, and the place was full of people.  No worries.  I paid, and walked the half-block to Tartine. As I entered, I surveyed the scene.  Several tables full of people nibbling on this and sipping on that, talking, laughing.  You know: what people do in restaurants.  I walked up to the bakery case and started thinking through my options.  Nice lemon merrangue there, decent looking chocolate something over there, what size do I need.  You know: what people do when thinking about buying dessert. At about this point, a youngish man appeared behind the case.  I looked up at him and said something like "I'd like..."  I never got to finish.  He looked at me said "we're closed" and then existed through the door behind the bakery case into the kitchen.  Baffled, I turned around, looked at all the diners still enjoying their nibbles, and then looked at my watch: it was 7:02.  On my way out, I checked their hours: they close at 7:00. Now, businesses GET to close.  They GET to have hours.  Far be it from me to try to be the jerk who wanders into a restaurant at five minutes to closing and tries to get a table and order the Baked Alaska (which takes a long time to make). BUT.  Oh, it's a huge but.  In this particular case, the restaurant had 10+ other customers in it.  I was attempting to consumate a counter purchase that would take 2 minutes.  And the employee who I delt with almost could not have been ruder to me. I have seen this before.  It's called Fatal Restaurant Success Syndrome.  It occurs when a place, by virtue of having decent food, becomes popular enough that the people who work there fall under the impression that they can just treat customers like shit.  I can safely say that, in my 6 or so encounters with Tartine, I've never really been treated well.  But it's been acceptable (for SF, at least).  What restaurants seem to forget is that there are A LOT of places that have decent food.  In Tartine's case, I would suggest that there are a NUMBER of bakeries in SF that are at least as good as Tartine.  Acme, for one.  And there are two others who frequently appear at the Ferry Building Farmers' Market whose names slip my mind.  But I will grow much more familiar with them in the future, because I will be frequenting them, not Tartine. The choice, fellow consumers, is yours (ours).  Ever wonder why the service industry in SF is industry minus service?  Service without the smile, you might say?  Here's why: they're used to getting away with it.  They're used to you coming back.  They believe there are no consequences to treating customers like the scum of the earth.  If you think this is appropriate behavior worthy of reward, please: continue to frequent Tartine.  If you believe that, as a customer, you are entitled to a modicum of courtesy and common decency, or if you believe that a business should WANT your business, then you'll join me in never buying anything from Tartine again.

Have you been somewhere surreal only to relive it again? It was again another delicious meeting with Yelper Maybelline C, her husband Marc, and friend Eric. Similar to the previous visit, the line was still out the door for the usual half an hour wait, the venue was still super crowded with no place to sit, and their cakes and pastries were as sexy looking as ever. Thanks to May, our table was flooded with two open face sandwiches that came with buttery semi-firm baguettes where each were separately staked with ham and shitake and savory melted cheese on top. Next, we took it a step further by taking turns to enjoy a lemon meringue tart, banana crème pie, tres leches cake, and two dark chocolate éclairs. I thought the taste of the lemon meringue was off and not as good as the one I had at Emil's. Otherwise, the banana crème pie was absolutely delicious with fresh bananas and soft cream filling bounded by a layer of dark chocolate underneath around the sugary crust for an added dimension to its flavor. The tres leches cake had super intense moisture from the exterior to the core; and the two éclairs were filled with creamy custard to complement the rich semi-bitter chocolate and soft doughy texture from its outer shell. Thank goodness my mama wasn't there to see it. We were so sugary stuffed that left on the table was a coconut crème pie which Eric had to take home. I would love to try their morning bun, pumpkin pie and bread pudding for my future visits. In short, my second visit was filled with many bright spots, but the glaring shortcomings were their messy tables as they did not have anyone to clean them once they became available. Additionally, I thought their espresso drinks and lemon meringue were an aberration at best. Otherwise the opportunity to hang out with everyone in the morning really made it pleasant for me the rest of the day. Thanks to May, 4.5 stars for the overall experience. PS: As a suggestion for the owner, I hope you'll consider making a red velvet cake. I would love to try it.

What's up with this bread? Unfortunately I am still trying to figure it out. The bread is out of the oven at 5:00 p.m., I got to Tartine Bakery around 5:20 and started waiting in line which was already had about 30 people in it.  By the time I got to the counter at 5:45pm, they were sold out of bread and taking reservations for bread at 7:00pm. Reservations for bread?! What kind of bread is this? Why do I need it so bad? I want this bread. So, after waiting 25 minutes - I wasn't satisfied leaving empty handed. I ordered two morning buns, a slice of pumpkin pie and ham croque monsieur sandwich.  I thoroughly enjoyed the morning bun and pumpkin pie desserts, to make up for the sadness and no bread. I'm not giving up, that bread will be MINE!

YUMMMIEEE!! Both items we ordered were equally DELICIOUS!!! 1) Bread pudding with seasonal fruits (raspberry and Nectarine): 4/5 2) Banana cream pie: 4/5 Next time I want to try their tres leche and morning buns. There always a line out the door, but don't be fool, wait in line!!  The wait is definitely less than 30 minutes, and finding a table to eat your sweets didn't seem hard. People are always in and out. After your consumption, walk over to Dolores Park (esp on a sunny day) and people watch/sun bathe!

Remember that beautiful girl in school that you always dreamed about. The one that you worshiped. The one every guy wanted to go out with. There were lines around the block to ask her out. She was the most beautiful girl in the world. And she smelled ohh so delicious. She was gorgeous inside and out...she had a pretty face and a heart of gold. Harps would play when she walked by. She was THE ONE. You remember her, don't you? Of course you do! One day the stars aligned and luck smiled down on you and you finally got her to go out with you. I know you remember when that special day came and you consummated your relationship. At long last, you made love... And she was a cold fish. Tartine is that girl...

Q:  How do I avoid the super long lines that I always hear about??? A:  Take a day off and go when everyone else is at work! Our plan worked!  We arrived around 10:30 am on a Wednesday morning, and there was just a short line inside the bakery.  That gave me just enough time to figure out what I wanted to order.  There were so many things that I wanted to order, but I only ended up with the ham & cheese croissant( http://static1.px.yelp.c… ) and the ham quiche( http://static3.px.yelp.c… ).   I placed my order and sipped on my macchiato( http://static4.px.yelp.c… ) while I waited for my breakfast to be heated up.  My croissant came out first, and it was HUGE!  It was nice and flaky and oh so yummy.  The quiche came out, and WOW.....I knew I had to share it or else I would've had to be rolled out of there.   I also ordered and extra ham & cheese croissant to go, but I should've ordered more!  I saw a lot of people order the bread pudding.  And the desserts looked so damn good!  I'll have to play hookie again and go back to try everything!

Did I just wait 20 minutes in line for a $6.25 banana cream tart??? Let alone on a Sunday morning?? Yup!! That's right! 20 minutes for the best tasting banana cream tart your lips will ever taste!  Is it worth it? Heck yeah! While everyone else was ordering espresso that morning, I ordered the banana cream tart and it was so creamy. The taste of the banana was intense with the most elegant whipped cream and flaky, buttery crust. I've heard this was Julia Child's "go to" bakeries when she was in town. Without a doubt the BEST banana cream tart you'll ever taste!!

As many of you know I have to eat a lot for my job.   To give you a small picture window -- Yesterday I was asked to try meatball sliders, onion dip, green chili enchiladas, grilled chicken and short ribs. To top it off I also was asked to go to some of San Francisco's beloved bakeries to see what's new and hot in the world of baked fat pills. On the drive over I practiced my "Just Say No" to carbs and butter and cream and cheese speech in my head. "No thank you.  I am fat-intolerant." Well, that went out the goddamn window when we got to Tartine, because have you seen their bakery display?  I was just like a former fat kid in a pastry store.  Well, I wasn't like that.  I was exactly that. After ordering a slice of apple tart covered in nougatine streusel, a ramekin of vahlrona chocolate pudding, a cocoa nib rocher and a huckleberry frangopine tart, my partner in fat on fat crime and I decided that would do quite nicely for a mid-afternoon snack. Until we saw the croissants.  God help me.  I can't resist flaky, golden deliciousness. As we "researched", the noises coming from deep within me were out of a horror film.  It was like Jabba the Hutt with a tapeworm.  I was slurping down pudding and chasing it with fluffy bits of croissant and huge bites of apple tart.  One of our other dining companions reached for the rocher.  I growled while I slapped their hand away. Oh, the horror. Such is Tartine.   They say nothing tastes as good as being skinny.  Well guess what, I'm here to tell you that they're full of shit. Being fat at Tartine tastes amazing.

Having planned ahead and stopped at Blue Bottle on the way, we arrived at Tartine with coffee in hand to hold us over during the wait.  It was a Sunday morning, about brunch time, and sure enough the line was snaked out of the bakery, around the corner.  People were in good spirits, and the sun was shining.  Taking our place at the back of the line, we were treated to the tempting smells wafting from the kitchen window.  It was neat to check out their cooking machinery and supplies while we waited.   The staff is efficient, helpful, and friendly, and the line moved along nicely.  It took us about 30 minutes to reach the counter, where we ordered several different things.  My friend and I split a "croque monsieur"  For $9.75, you get: "Open face sandwich with béchamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper. Topped with either smoked Niman Ranch ham or seasonal vegetable."  Very delicious, but not quite enough when split.   One friend got a yummy latte and another had a cup of decaf coffee that tasted very off.  She poured it in the gutter and replaced it with regular brew, and substituted the cream for the milk, not wanting to replicate any of the sour taste from the first cup.  Perhaps it was the cream, but the second cup was spot-on.  The buttermilk scone got good reviews, and I bought a chocolate chip cookie and lemon cream tart to take home.  The next night my husband and I enjoyed both of them -- so good!  The lemon cream was divine, especially topped with the unsweetened cream, and allowed to chill for an hour in the fridge to firm it up after the car ride home (2.5 hours).   In short, I would go back (unless I were in a hurry), and I would order pretty much anything from the menu or pastry shelves, quite certain I'd be happy I did.  So, why 4 rather than 5 stars?  1) Sour coffee is a nasty thing.  2) Seating is too limited.  3) The set-up with the line going out the door and the bathroom being in the kitchen area makes for awkward navigating of the establishment.

Finally we braved the line to scratch off the morning buns off the 7x7 list AND the double pain au chocolat off "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" list.  Was it worth circling around continuously for parking (though we finally ended up w/a spot right in front) & waiting for 20-25 minutes in on/off again rain (luckily it didn't start til I got my pastries & was on my way out)?  Not really.   *Morning bun ($3.75): Liked the orange cinnamon flavor and the slight stickiness, but mine was a little harder than his.  Mine may have been out of the oven for a little longer than his, but I think for the hefty price tag, it should be pretty perfect.  In all honesty though, I think this is the first morning bun I've ever tried.   *Double Pain Au Chocolat ($4.25): Super flakey and lots of rich chocolate.  One of the better chocolate croissants I've had, though I think it's a little too decadent for the morning.   Three morning buns & a double pain au chocolat = $15.50.  Good lord....that could buy me hella tacos in the Mission!  I don't know if I'd go back, but, hey at least I said I've been there & done that!

They say distance makes the heart grow fonder and this is especially true of baked goods. As I search high and low for a morning bun in LA that measures up to Tartine's masterpieces, i long for the days when I can go back to visit and load up on their treats. What I tend to forget, however, is how atrocious the line can be, even years after this place has opened, even on a MONDAY MORNING. So in my love-filled haze, I suggested it as a brunch meetup spot on my last day in SF recently. For some reason I thought we'd sail right in and sit right down on one of the sidewalk tables, but instead, I stood in line for about half an hour, frantically taking orders from everyone else on my cell phone while the others stood outside like creepers waiting to poach a table. No doubt about it, the food was and always will be worth it. The morning bun was as crispy on the outside and soft on the inside as ever with that amazing orange zesty flavor, the frangipane croissant was chock full of sweet almonds, the bread pudding was positively transcendent. But when I go to brunch I like to relax, not worry about where I'm going to sit and how long I have to stand in line. Nevertheless, the crowds at Tartine are a testament to their amazing food and great atmosphere. So until everyone else moves onto the Next Big Thing, I'll just have to wait in line with all of its other adoring fans.

I'll avoid a line like the plague-- I find that many of them just aren't worth it. As such, I've avoided this spot since as long as I, or they, have been around. Not sure who came first. I finally braved it out today-- wasn't really that bad-- and found a nice outdoor seat to enjoy the brisk, blue-skied autumn that SF, and the Mission in particular, is famous for. Wow. Yes. It is worth it. I've lived in Paris for 6 months, and I don't want to sound pretentious, but too late for that I guess. So I think I'm qualified to say that this really is the best bakery I've found outside of France. Their ham and nettle quiche was phenomenal. I guess the only thing that could be better is if it came right out of the oven and onto my plate. Their ham and cheese croissant was beautiful (and crispy.) And let's not fool ourselves-- it takes a lot of butter to do this. But people, butter is good for you... especially compared to the alternatives that so many of the other half-assed bakeries that plague our fine country put into their crappy baked goods. And the latte-- it comes in a soup bowl and you drink it as if it were miso soup. Some might not like it, but then again, those same people are probably voting for Romney. Anyway, sorry to get off the subject, point being this place is a treasure. Now I know all I'm doing here is encouraging a longer line, but hey, that's the latte doing the speaking now. Enjoy.

I have never had such RUDE service anywhere in the neighborhood. The staff and owners at nearby Bi-rite and Faye's have always treated me as a friend and appreciated my business over the years. Not so at Tartine's where apparently customer requests seem to be an interruption for the sometimes well-meaning, but distracted and sometimes simply outright insulting staff. I refuse to go in Tartine again. Workers raking in money for an owner who doesn't care to hold them to any service standard makes them a non-option for me. I now go to Faye's for coffee and ANYWHERE ELSE for food. NO CROISSANT IS WORTH waiting half an hour to have someone roll their eyes because you are bothering them with your order. May the ghost of Carl's Bakery spirit you away. You don't have to go home, but you all need to get the hell up outta here. serious FAIL. Begone!

One day, I was going to Carl's to get a birthday cake and someone had painted it black and turned my nice hometown bakery into a snooty croissant shop.  And I was ripshit.  This city needed another place to buy $5 pastries like we needed more dirty sleeping bags.  And so my personal boycott began.  You can keep your lines and your pensive-looking, fancy-pants croissant shop!  I said GOOD DAY. Today -- many years later-- the Mr. took me here for the first time for my birthday (no gifts, please).  After well over a thousand glowing reviews, I had to try it.  Here's what I learned: 1) It's not black, but a very dark shade of green.   2) They serve sandwiches.  All of which are decadent, several of which are veggie, one of which is a grilled sandwich of pecorino cheese and almonds.  I would eat pecorino and almonds between two odor eaters, but luckily this sandwich uses two buttered and grilled pieces of homemade sourdough bread instead.  And they add lemon zest and sage.  And it was bigger than my head. 3) That freaky little carrot on your plate is actually really tasty.  It's a spicy pickled thing that they just for some reason decided not to trim the little hairs off. 4) Worst feng-shui EVER.  The proximity of the line to the tables creates lots of butts-touching-shoulders awkward encounters. The water is self service, but it's behind the cash register.  And don't order the sandwiches from the girl behind the counter, she's only taking pastry and coffee orders...  And the staff is clean worn out from answering all these stupid questions about the non-intuitive layout and rules.  And the guy who took my order had not said howdy to his shampoo in many moons.  So it was indeed a lot like Paris in there.  But not always in a good way.   5) They left the Carl's logo on the entry way, which is very cool.  RIP, Carl's.

After returning from Prague, I lusted after a bakery  that presented coffee and pastries in the traditional European form. I even considered learning how to bake just so I could open my very own bakery in San Francisco. Little did I know, we already had such an establishment right here in San Francisco. Though not at Prague prices, Tartine satisfies my yearnings for delicious pastries and good coffee (no, I am not saying their coffee is comparable to Czech coffee...no how, no way). I will never complain about the line at Tartine. It is worth it.... every time.

Having stuffed myself to the gills (if I had gills) with Peking duck and fried rice, I was out on the prowl for some mouthwatering desserts that didn't rely on ice-cream or chocolate to compensate for their lack of baking skills. On our way to Schubert's Bakery it occurred to me that I had never once been to the oft-talked-about Tartine Bakery (next door to my favourite pizzeria - Delfina's). So off we headed towards Tartine just a block or two short of parking in front of Schubert's. As seems to be a San Francisco tradition, the line was snaking out the door on to the footpath from the innards of a seemingly hallowed establishment that is obviously too small to accommodate the boisterous belligerent (ok, I kid!) crowd of eager-beavers waiting to sink their enormous incisors into one (or more, if you will) of the baked goodies that await their fate amidst the grind of unforgiving masticators. To cut a meandering story short and just "beat the bush itself" (my Sarah Palin wordsmith moment --- in case you didn't notice), the pastries were not really what I was expecting. They are definitely the coffee-pastry goodies but not the petit-fours / swiss-confectionery type I was hungering for. Oh well ! *shrugs* I went for an Almond Frangipane and a cup of cappuccino. The Frangipane was quite tasty and went very well with the cappuccino, which, while it was really good was not as good as the cuppa I had at Cibo in Sausalito just the weekend prior. I also had a bite of the coconut cream tart from my friend and I found that pretty good too. I'd come back here for a pastry based breakfast, or an evening tea/coffee with friends, but Schubert's is still my go-to for that perfect dessert and petit-fours highs.

[Featured:  Best Thing I Ever Ate (Food Network) - Sweet Tooth Episode] Breakfast at Tartine is an experience that stimulates all five senses.  Don't worry about finding the sign of this place (they don't have one), the aroma of fresh baked pastries will likely find you from a block away.  Give it a whiff and take it all in.  Then there's a warm feeling as you walk in, just before you take sight of the the terrific display case filled with an assortment of beautifully presented cookies, tarts, and pastries.   Too bad I was too early for the Banana Cream Tart.  I read Rodney's review and was eager to sink my teeth into one.  Oh well, something to look forward to for next time.  I ended up with the fruit bread pudding, with a side of morning bun and a cup of coffee.  The bread pudding was delicious!  It just melted in my mouth, plus it had perfect texture and the not-too-sweet taste complemented the fresh tart taste of the fruits quite nicely.  Coffee was excellent too.   I'm falling short of five stars because I was not as impressed with the morning bun (7 x 7 list, #8) as I expected to be.  It was very sugary indeed, but it was hard and not too warm.  It was good though, but not great.   Though I'm not calling Tartine my favorite pastry shop, I was impressed enough to know that I will come back.  They have way too many awesome goodness to ignore.  A solid 4 stars for me.

MY GOD! How do I ever live without having more Tartine? Think I'm kidding? I'm not. I was just on their site trying to figure out how to get Tartine shipped to Miami. Looking over a variety of pastries I was immediately drawn to the croissants and yet somehow a sticky looking bun kept catching my eye. I saw Miriam W excitedly exclaim "Tartine! Tartine! and make a beeline, so I knew these were no ordinary pastries. Miriam W doesn't express glee for anything less than stellar and life altering. I decided to ask for an expert opinion and thankfully Nicole G was nearby and available for guidance she told me everything was amazing but that the sticky, slice of indulgence I had been scoping was perhaps the best known and most loved of all. She also told me its real name 'morning bun'. Little did I know this would be my new 'rosebud', I might be uttering the words 'morning bun' decades from now. Morning Bun, Morning Bun. I looked for a weigh to slice it and found nothing, a little disappointed I took this little confection and thought "Ok, well I'll eat half." Little did I know that there is no 'only eat half' when it comes to Tartine goods. There is only crave and devour. I took one bite and thought to myself "Perfect!" and every next bite just kept cementing Perfect in my mind. Oh, I now understood Nicole and Miriam's joy. I now understood the power, the magnitude of Tartine. However, let me say that although there is a feeling of love at first bite it is not until hours have passed and the craving begins that you understand that first bite has changed you. Now there will always be that longing to satiate the Tartine hunger. Oh believe me it is a blessing and a curse, but one I live with gladly having experienced the sweet, life-altering experience that is Tartine.

Thousands of four- and five-star reviews don't lie. Tartine definitely lives up to all of the hype. I love (almost) everything about this place: the location (it's right next to Dolores Park, Bi-Rite, and Delfina!), the atmosphere (which is bright, cozy, and casual), and of course, the pastries! My favorites are the bread pudding, the shortbread, and the banana cream tart. The morning bun--Tartine's signature--is also very tasty, but definitely not my favorite item on the menu. The strawberry shortcake and double chocolate brownies are also worth a try. You can tell Tartine uses only the freshest ingredients for all of their menu items. No other pastry shop I've been to in SF even comes close. Although the pastries at Tartine are incredible, the sandwiches are less stellar (although still pretty delicious). I tried the Croque Monsieur and the Prosciutto & Provolone. Both were huge and quite satisfying, if not a tad too greasy and salty for my taste. The selection of teas, coffees and other drinks also seemed to be lacking. Regardless, Tartine is your best bet for the highest-quality pastries in the city. I'm definitely a fan and cannot wait to try everything on their pastry menu! Note: Lines get ridiculous between 10-1 on a typical sunny weekend, but don't worry, it's worth the wait.

All I have to say is: What.A.Pain.In.My.Ass I work for an uber cool company -- we like to do cool, thoughtful things for our clients -- because, my company is cool and our clients are even cooler.  This involves creative gift giving.  Which I love doing... because, the only thing which is better than getting a cool, creative gift is giving one. Our whole team is into this, too.  We are a bunch of sassy-ass, creative gift giving ladies. ANYHOW: We happen to have this client.  This uber cool, lovely, fun, amazing client... who loves Tartine pastries.  And, recently we have had the occasion to give this client a gift.  So one of the sassy-ass ladies on my team says, "Hey!  Doesn't Blah-blah client just LOVE LOVE Tartine pastries?" And, the rest of us are all like "Yeah - that's RIGHT!  Blah-blah client DOES love love Tartine pastries!  Let's order them some!!" This is a mission of critical proportion -- it's massively important.  We love to show the love around here... so, we kinda take our gift giving seriously, you know? I am proud that the task falls to me.  Proud.  I LOVE LOVE buying people gifts.  (I think I already might have said that, but it's a point which bears repeating.) Further, I am not a stupid grrl.  I know how things work in this town and I know that Tartine is a little bit of a hoity-toity difficult-to-get-good-service-from-because-they-­are-so-damn-popular-restaurant... I mean, have you SEEN the line around the block for that beeotch on a Sunday morning? So, I go online and do my research.  I discover that they need three to five days for a pre-order.  I look at their menu and consult with the sassy-ass lady sitting across the wall from me to determine which pastry would be a suitable gift for our kick-ass client.  We agree on a yummy-yummy and I place an order via voicemail (which is their POLICY - they don't answer their friggin' phone)... I do this last FRIDAY. I get a call back yesterday stating that the item that I wanted to order is "not in season."  So, I ask them if I can just stop in Tartine and pick up something out of their bakery case & I am told "it depends on what you want." So, I go into panic mode - as this is a mission of utmost importance to my team - and, start creating backup plans, etc... where to get a "Tartine-esque" pastry for my kick-ass client... what to do if there is nothing in the bakery case worthy of the magnitude of coolness which this client epitomizes... I consult with two sassy-ass ladies on my team this morning about the contingency plan which I've created... and, they agree that the whole point was to order from Tartine and that we should just stop by to see what's there... and, that I should call them back and be like "Yo, Tartine peeps, have X amount of pastries ready at X time..." etc. However: TARTINE DOESN'T ANSWER THEIR FRIGGIN' PHONE!!! And, they are uber, uber, UBER slow about returning phone calls - even though it says that they will return a call w/in 24 hours of when you leave a message. I don't care HOW amazing your damn pastries are, people -- there is something which is crucial to having a successful business and it's called CUSTOMER SERVICE. Learn it, live it. Because, you know what?  I'm not the only person who's had this kind of negative experience with Tartine... which says a lot. Your food may be amazing, but your customer service sucks.

Long Story short: cute little bakery with a variety of delectable eats at pretty good prices Long story long: In continuation of my food crawl in and around SF, I had hopped on the BART down to the 16th St and Mission station to check out a few places in that neighborhood.  This place is next to Pizzeria Delfina, which, me being there at 10 AM, was unfortunately not open yet. This place was simplistic and had a little more of a contemporary feel than your run of the mill bakery/coffee shop kind of place.  The tables did seem kind of cramped up together, so you could inadvertently evesdrop on your neighbor.  Not that I would ever do that, I'm just saying. I got in line and within a couple of minutes, I had someone come to help me.  I looked at all of their offerings: breakfast pastries, cookies, small confections, cakes, desserts.  It was so hard to choose.  I eventually got a black currant scone, a morning bun, and a couple of cookies.  I forget exactly how much it came out to, but it wasn't super cheap or terribly expensive either. I walked out and busted out the scone.  It was more on the flaky side, almost like a danish or croissant, but it was really good.  I probably could have had 2 or 3 of these.  I saved my morning bun until later that morning and that was really good as well.  Probably better than the morning bun I had at Crema in Portland.  I had the cookies later that day and they were ok.  Nothing to really write home about. I would definitely come back to try other things.  I can't wait to go back to SF =(

FInally, I made it to Tartine! First time I had their Frangipane Pie was last year when my friend brought this for dessert. I fell in love with it. Its even better if you warm it up in the oven and add a scoop full of vanilla bean ice cream. YUM!! I wanted to try their famous "morning bun" but I got there too late so I ordered the frangipane tart,  banana cream pie and a slice of tres leche. The tres leche was so good and not too sweet, great texture. I plan to come back and brave the long wait for brunch with a friend next time.

ANDY R. HAS NO FEAR. I know that if he ever comes face to face with a pack of rabid wolves, he'd be able to get right past them without a scratch. He is my hero. I imagine Tartine Bakery on a Sunday afternoon is just as scary. Low blood sugar, pissed off because it has already taken them 30 minutes just to find parking, ready to wrestle someone to the ground for the last brownie, crazed sugar fiends file out the door waiting to get their order taken and scarf down their goodies. Thank God Almighty for Andy though, because if not for him, I would have never known what Heaven truly tastes like. As his hot wife sat in the double-parked car with the engine running, Andy walked right to the front of the line and it was a miracle that he got out of the bakery with the goods completely unharmed. What a bad ass, right?! What he transported safely: 1.) Banana Cream Tart -- a flaky pastry crust coated in dark chocolate and caramel and filled with pastry cream and bananas, and then topped with lightly sweetened cream and shaved chocolate. 2.) Coconut Cream Tart -- a flaky pastry coated in dark chocolate and caramel and filled with coconut cream. Topped with lightly sweetened cream and toasted coconut. The best freakin' coconut cream tart I have ever tasted. 3.) Really Rich Scharffen Berger Brownie with walnuts If anyone's able to complete a Mission Impossible task, Andy is your man.

I was compelled to update my review and degrade my rating based on an experience this morning (5/13). The doors to Tartine were open and we walked in eager for a chocolate croissant since there was no line. As I walked in, I heard "we're not open" and I said "what time do you open?" the barely audible response from the 2 girls not paying any attention was "8". "What time is it?" I asked - and got the response "not 8". I asked again what the time was, and got no response. They may have been nominated for  a James Beard Award for best pastry chefs (they didn't win), but they certainly didn't get nominated, NO EVER WILL, for Best Service. I don't care how good your product is, if your service and attitude SUCKS like it does at Tartine, you'll never get another penny from me. If you read my original review, from Day 1 they have had efficiency problems and the service just compounds the negative impression of Tartine. It is too bad because the product is good, but it doesn't matter - the service is a complete turn off. These girls just put stuff in bags and ring it up - this is not brain surgery and I certainly don't see them gracing the covers of Bon Appetit or 7x7 Magazine. Get over yourselves and get a job where no one has to interact with you - ever. ------ORIGINAL REVIEW-------- My biggest issue is the efficiency of Tartine - it doesn't exist. Why can't they streamline the ordering and payment processes? The layout does not work, and the pace is painfully slow. They need some serious business automation and process re-engineering. Maybe then the line wouldn't be so long for so long!

This place is the best, a lot of people around here put it down trying to be too cool for school, but it is good. Tartine is tasteful and they do some things that an uninitiated person may not notice. Europeans like their breads very dark and carmelized and you can tell the owners have worked in Europe because their croissants are very brown on top, they are also made with butter v. shortening and they constantly rotate their offerings. Some fun and traditional items like a French bouche noel at Christmas time let me know they don't take themselves too seriously nor are they trying to reinvent the wheel. Don't hate Tartine because it is beautiful.

God made a bakery, and it was called Tartine.   The banana cream tarte and the croque monsier are TO DIE FOR.  Like sex in your mouth... only not.  Who the EF cares what the food is  made of or how much fat it has, or if the people that work there are surly and condescending and seem irritated with you?  Nothing gets in between me and my favorite baked goods on the freakin' planet!  Oh yeah, the quiche is flippin' wonderful, too! Also note: In my humble opinion, the morning buns are really no big deal and the bread pudding is good in its own right, if you're into the juicy, fruity kind of bread pudding.  Me--I like my bread pudding to be ALL bread, and I laud the praises of Pacific Whey Cafe in Newport as the purveyors of the BEST bread pudding ever.

As a bakery, *****. The tarts are among the best anywhere, with a perfect crust that is neither doughy or crumbly. The cakes are pricey, but still really good a week later (don't ask). I have to remind myself that it's a bakery, not really a cafe. As a cafe, **. Most descriptions of the space and clientele are apt. Fortunately, Biff and Muffy left us a couple seats when their blackberry went off and we got to sit down with our sammitches. Cuties' pressed pastrami was terriffic. My croque monsieur, while tasty, ate a bit too much like a french bread pizza, with the thick slab of country bread underneath. The cafe is more for the "see and be seen" types. I'd rather be seen with a cake box in my lap at Dolores Park. Extra * for playing the entire side two of Stones' "Sticky Fingers" at lunch. "Sister Morphine" could have been written about whoever dosed me with that lemon cream tart.

Like many bakery junkies Tartine has always been on my list and near the top spot as It's pretty much an icon. Out of all my trips to SF I just never made the time to make a stop. Maybe bc I am not a morning person at all and the best time to go to a bakery is well, in the morning. So since that early morning visit will probably never happen, i made a late afternoon stop for whatever treats were left. We arrived after 3:00pm and the cases were still full! This was a huge surprise and a bit of a distraction as I had more choices than I thought I was going to have. Of course I wanted a Morning Bun and of course they didn't have it. Since we were still full from lunch at Ike's and our Bi-Rite ice creams I saved the amazing looking mini pies and fruit tarts for next time. I settled for 2 Mexican Wedding Cookies and was on my way. I didn't even eat one right away bc I was that full. I actually ate in the next morning for breakfast (don't judge) and they were Fantastic! The place is small and cramped and I can see how the line and ordering system could be outrageous and annoying. It is lame to have to order your goods before actually seeing them but they have plenty of pics on yelp and you can browse their menu so if you did a little research before hand you would know what to expect. Mission Morning Buns next time. Can't wait.

Let me sum this review up in one word: crack. For those with ADD you can stop reading here and move on to skimming another review. For everyone else... When it comes to pastry, the words "morning bun" aren't exactly inspirational, but let me just say, I had the pleasure of practically inhaling one of these beauties and it was quite nearly a religious experience. Note: Once you know that I'm not all that big on sweets (hell, I don't even really like chocolate) you really understand the gravity of that statement. The morning bun was just the perfect bit of sweet wearing a crowning glory of crispy caramelized sugar sweet and just the right bit of savory  yeasty dough and the whole thing is rounded out with a hint of citrus that builds to a crescendo as you reach the center and get bits of zest in each bite. I had every intention of being good and eating half but I easily could have put away two they were so divine. If you live in the Bay Area or happen to know someone close enough to bribe, save yourself the flight to Paris and find your way to Tartine.

It's official: I am now Tartine's bitch. I told myself I wasn't going to be Tartine's bitch. I told myself the gougere was not to my liking and that the bread pudding was amazing but not worth the world. But then I tried the almond croissant and the jambon and gruyere croissant. I tried the morning bun and a cup of the strawberry huckleberry bread pudding since those fruits are now in season. After trying so many of the items in the shop and making the Lemon Chiffon tarts more times than I can count (yay for the Tartine cookbook) I can safely say that I am more than willing to be Tartine's bitch. Whether its in the shop or in Dolores Park, it feels so good to be so bad with their rich, buttery pastries.

Well, the Scharffen-Berger (Sharfenburger?  Scharf-effing-burger?) chocolate pudding made me its bitch yesterday.  If Bill Cosby ever tasted this he'd tell Jell-O (Jello?  Gel-Oh?) to go F---- itself with a pudding pop stick. IQ also had some outrageous brioche (bree-oash? brio-shhhh?) bread pudding which I thought was delicious but lacked a sauce to take it over the goal line to sublime (sub-lime?  suh-blime?). So why only three stars?  A) I saw BURNT croissants.  A whole big stack of them.  They not only looked burnt they smelt burnt from the customer side of the counter.  I never saw a burnt croissant in Paris.  Those French bakers would throw themselves into their own ovens before they would put a burnt croissant out where the public could see it (much less purchase and eat it).   And B) despite the sublime tastes here, which I will go back for, the experience itself is depressing.  Food this good deserves time and space to be savored.  The line, the passive aggressive people sitting and reading a paper over the long-since-finished remains of their vittles, the pushy people with no concept of patience or personal space, all detract from the food and take the whole experience of Tartine down two pegs, at least.  They need to find a bigger space that is more appropriately designed to handle the crowds.

It's typically crowded and hopping in this bakery, probably because everything here tastes fresh and delicious (buttery too).   Newbies be warned:  Going through the fast-moving line can be intimidating if you don't know what you want. Chop-chop! Time's a-wasting! I love that they use organic and local ingredients, when possible. The chocolate is high quality, Scharffen Berger brownies and chocolate pudding.  Woo-hoo! I've been meaning to try a hot pressed sandwich, but haven't yet. I have only had chocolate dessert items, coffee, and fresh squeezed juice - yum!

SHUCKS!! I JUST now came out of my wow factor of bliss. I arrived at this glorious sweet house! This unbelievable  place called Tartine has sent me for a spin! Before I get to this place I see a long line that is forming outside of this cafe!  In my head I was like hell no will I stand out side a place just to eat something! What do I find myself doing? I stand in line for about 20mins with some wonderful friends of mine the Wonderful Daniel, and Gorgeous Shannon. My nose fills with rich flavors, of sugar, cream, bread, and coffee bean stick to my nose hairs which stood on end! I maze my way through the crowded spot and find a gold mine of a spot to sit 3 people. If you don't get a place to sit down; there is always sitting outside. My friends show up with several platters of pastries, fresh baked open face sandwich, and the most beautiful bowls of latte I have ever seen. Upon all the raging excitement of eating tarts, tres leche cake, and with my intoxication of sweets I miss grabbing flying napkins and grab thigh! What a first impression I make.... Blame it on the sugarhol I guess.  Tartine Bakery is one of the most enjoyable places to bring a group of friends, talk loud, enjoy wonderful food, look at all of the abstract art on the walls, and get high on sugar and bean! In all this place brings good fortune to those who meet here as I saw nothing, but smiling faces, heard laughter, smelled food, and was enjoy 2 wonderful people! Thanks Tartine!  =)

Never,  never, I repeat NEVER attempt to go here at 11:00 on a Sunday afternoon when  you have a 2:00 flight to catch.   We ordered: Morning Bun- 5 STARS Brioche bread pudding - 3.5 STARS Banana cream tart-  4 STARS Quiche - 3.5 STARS Jambon & Gruyere Sandwich: 4 STARS Prosciutto & Provolone Sandwich: 3.5 STARS =================================== Total: $40 Altogether, it was awesome sampling everything.  The sandwiches (while the bread was too tough for my taste), the BF prefers his breads like that as many others would.  The inside of the sandwich is amazing.  But, I have to say that the only item on the menu that would drive me back here would be the Morning Bun.  The orange zest flavor is really what won me over and stole the spotlight even with a fluffy pastry it sits on. Tips: If you go here alone, go early. Otherwise, have someone else drive you since you'll never find parking. Prepare for an 1 hr wait.

I always find myself stuck in a food rut, albeit delicious, but a food rut just the same. Even if a restaurant has a 50-page menu or showcases a variety of pretty pastries, I am drawn to the same thing over & over again, but today I felt like being adventurous & finally tried something new. My cousin has been telling me for almost a year that she has a gift certificate to Tartine & would I be her companion. I don't know what took me so long, but this morning, the best friend & I picked her up (she lives dangerously close to Tartine) & showed her just how good a pastry can be. They only serve pressed sandwiches after 12 noon, so we split a croque monsieur with ham (the BFF got it with turkey), I got a franglpane croissant (me & my almond paste, i swear, it's a match made in heaven) & my cousin had a double chocolate croissant. The three of us sat, laughed, caught up & enjoyed our carb-rich indulgences. Maybe I should try new things more often because I was very delighted by the new flavors, textures & ingredients today. But most of all, I was delighted by my company (everyone say "awwwww.")

Wow...the hype is true, people.  Nothing but deliciousness!  A friend and I were only able to walk a couple feet into the bakery since there was a line...no surprise there.  Feeling a little bit full from the donut I just ate, I let my friend Kevin do all the ordering while I just ordered a chocolate croissant.  Everything in the case looked delicious and the breads looked so fresh.  We were rung up and then waited for a table; however, it didn't look like any were going to be available anytime soon.  So, we find a table outside with a few rude and unsanitary occupants....pigeons!  My friend shoo-ed them away from the table, pulled up a couple chairs, and we were finally able to indulge. I was a bit annoyed that it was super busy inside that we couldn't find a table and then even more annoyed that we had to sit outside with these overly aggressive pigeons, but all those feelings were swept under the table as soon as I took a bite out of my chocolate croissant.  Buttery, flaky, warm pastry dough filled with dispersed globs of rich, bittersweet chocolate.  I then tried Kevin's banana creme tart, which in all my life, never liked banana creme, but from that moment on, I became a fan.  Lastly, I forked a piece of the croque monsieur and felt like I've opened the gates of heaven.  My taste buds and I were in a state of bliss.  I loved everything I tried. Tartine is a bakery of amazing quality, I will definitely come back here during my next visit in a few months!

Before I even moved to SF, I had at least two people independently recommend this place.   This is the epitome of French pastry, done right.  The place is low in flair, the prices are fair (this amazingness shouldn't be cheap), but often crowded and often sold out of certain items because it is a singular location. This place is real and wonderful.  I'm not a sweets person, but I can't ignore true quality, nor would I ever turn down a pastry from Tartine.

Tartine is delicious for a bakery in the city!  I ordered the lemon meringue, which i may add the slices are huge! I wanted to try the bread pudding also but that will be for my next visit!  The lemon meringue cake was moist and not too sour or sweet... I liked the marshmelloey exterior around the cake slice.. it adds a good different texture to the cake!  Multiple layers to make it a fat slice for moi!   There was a line going out of the bakery.. boy this place sure makes business!  Their panini sandwiches looked delicious also from what i saw on the tables next to me!  I wanted to try one since they looked so healthy!   Parking around the area can definitely be a pain.. but i managed to park 2 blocks down the street...It was a good walk back after devouring such sweets!  Tables are available inside and outside also.. theres a bench to wait in line if you happen to be unlucky. don't worry, the line goes by pretty fast!  the only thing you would need to worry is if you can grab a table or else... dessert will be TO GO!!!!!

Everyone talks about this bakery is one of the best on the left coast, had to check it out. Luckily it was a weekday morning, so waited maybe 5 minutes before getting to the front to order. We got: - Croissant: Huge and so light, buttery, and flaky. Better than the one I had at Annisette. I think I can safely say the best croissant I've ever had. Also, the outside was so crispy, love crispy. I hate it when a croissant doesn't have any crisp. If it doesn't flake, doesn't belong in your face! - Morning bread: A wonderful orgy of croissant, cinnamon roll, and coffee cake. The texture is of a croissant but it's rolled like a cinnamon bun, and then has a sugar glaze, sugar, and just plain damn goodness. I think there's some orange essence in there. - Quiche: Got the ham and leek, so tasty. You get lots of ingredients, not just the egg. And then it's all about the flaky and wonderful crust. Big slice too for $4. - Gougere: Looked good in the case so decided to get it too. Initially you think it's this huge hunk of a cheese roll, but tear inside and it's hollow and the dough so tender. Like a perfect cheesy popover. The inside bread texture is like a creamy custard with a hint of cheese. Simply said, everything I got was so delicious, best pastries I've ever had. A little pricey, but well worth it. If Tartine was in LA/OC, I'd be such a fat kid..5 stars!

-Long long wait, without a view of the pastries even -Very hipster - think fringe bangs and willowy hair on the girls -Savory and sweet foods abound, all expensive My buy: a quiche and a cup of the brioche bread pudding. I considered the Croque Monsieur but it was...$10. Wha. My quiche was good--a bit too much crust in my opinion. The bread pudding, on the other hand...well; let's just say, I first gave some to my mom, a lover of sweets, who said: "Very interesting. I don't like it very much." And I agree. The best thing about this was the plump, red raspberries. I felt like I was eating sweetened sponges. Sooo spongy, squishy, and wet. Eek. Not my idea of dessert.

I LOVE that my friends know me well enough to bring me Tartine  baked goods when I can't make it there in person! I would love to give a big fat high five to the Tartine staff for consistently pulling off quality product.  Biting into the buche de noel, the lemon tart or the eclair, the sheer heaven of their top notch ingredients shines through.   Tartine made the girl who prefers meat and cheese SQUEAL with absolute adoration!  True story! I broke some of their bread just to check the crumb and it was gorgeous!!!!!!   I am glad to not have to wait in line.  However, I do regret not being able to get a fresh, warm, pain au chocolate which has barely left the oven.  I think that would get them a 5th star!

I am like everybody else.  Love the food, hate the wait, and that's the reason why I hardly frequent this place. However, this being the last stretch of the holiday shopping season, Arnold G, Christel and I inured ourselves to the crowds at Union Square by first going to lunch at Tartine.   I ordered a lovely fluffy slice of quiche with ham.  Tasty, eggy of course, and a bargain at about $3.50 a slice.  It's the perfect small main course since Tartine's desserts and pastries are large.  I had a piece of Arnold's hot panini prosciutto sandwiche.  Nice gooeyness to the cheese, and good bread.  As for the Croque Monsieur with Turkey (they were out of ham) that Christel ordered, I just disagree with an open Croque Monsieur sandwich.  I remember having the Croque Monsieur years ago here and just shaking my head: so wrong.  It should be a closed sandwich with gooey bechemal sauce almost dripping from it, in my opinion. For dessert: there is so much to extol in a wonderful cup of Vahrlona chocolate pudding.  First, there is the immediate association of chocolate pudding with childhood memories.  And for me, there are many associations with North Carolina where I spent a couple of poverty stricken school years eating way too many cans of Dinty Moore stew and...cooking up jello pudding (so much better than the instant jello pudding).  Tartine's pudding is rich, smooth, creamy...a sheer delight on the tongue. Yes, I should dock Tartine a star for the wait as well as something for that open faced Croque Monsieur (just to repeat: so wrong!).  However, their food is really quite good.  And their desserts are worth it.  So, let it stand at 5 stars.

I love pastries. I love bakeries. Tartine was supposed to be the mother load of all things delicious. I was ready to stuff myself silly after seeing 1000+ reviews and a 4.5 star average. Why did the unthinkable have to happen? WHY ME?! I even came here twice since I thought maybe the first time something very rare and VERY wrong happened. But here's the sad truth: Banana Cream Tart - I usually love banana cream but the crust has to be good. I was looking for that flaky buttery pastry crust but it was nonexistent. Instead it was way too hard. I had trouble breaking off pieces with my fork kind of hard. Totally turned me off. Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian - It's supposed to be a lime moistened genoise with passion fruit Bavarian, topped with sweetened cream and coconut. Sweetened? I didn't think this dessert was sweet at all. The lime was actually pretty overpowering and I couldn't taste much of the cake or other flavors. The coconut topping didn't have that nutty creamy taste I expect from coconut. Instead it was bland and was no match for intense lime flavor. I didn't even finish it.   The second time I was more cautious and just got one thing: Chocolate Hazelnut Tart - The chocolate had a flavorless dull taste. The crust here was a problem too, not buttery at all and no flavor. The more I ate, the drier my mouth became. The hazelnuts were the best part but Tartine can take any credit for that. Pretty pricey for a mediocre, small tart. $6.51(including the tax) down the drain! I wanted to like it! I really did. I'm disappointed and sad but I'm not going to fake it. Let's just move on.

Yum, Tartine! I absolutely love this place. Whenever a friend comes in to town, this is where I take them. Off peak hours, of course, if you want a seat. I've had a vast array of items, but there are a few items that really stand out to me. The morning buns are delightful, sweet and filling without being too heavy. Come in the morning for these, you will not be disappointed. The frangipane tart is like an burst of almond in your mouth. If you're not a fan of almond though, you might not want to try this, as it's the predominant flavor. The almond cream filling is light without being too overwhelming, and the tart itself is love. The fruit tart is my favorite, hands down. It might be the light, flaky crust that leaves me desiring more. It might be the fresh vanilla bean cream that tastes like a slice of heaven. Or it might be the delectable fruits, crisp, light, and delicious! Either way, the fruit tart is a must! The hot pressed sandwiches are great, so fresh and delicious! But if it's your first time at Tartine and you have to make s choice between pastries or sandwiches, go for the pastries. Then get a sandwich on your subsequent visits. I really like the atmosphere of this place, but it can get very claustrophobic when you go during a busy time. Beware of the lines after lunch, before dinner, and during weekends. Service is fast, the people wo work there are very friendly. Price points are on the higher end of average, but not an exorbitant amount.

There's so much to choose from that I don't know where to start. The quiche are my favorite now. The bread pudding and sandwiches are also good but the quiche is what I would go back for. It's no wonder this place is packed all the time. It's also easy to find since it's right on the corner of 18th and Guerrero street but parking is a pain on the weekends so be prepared to spend at least 10-15 min looking for parking. A suggestion? Order the pastries/coffee to go and walk over to Dolores Park and sit there to enjoy it. It really does make for a nice way to start off the day.

Love the HOT PRESSED GRILLED SANDWHICHES!!! Even if takes 15-20 minutes to get this, it is totally, totally worth it.   Don't forget to pick up a dessert even if you're on a diet! You DEFINITELY have to get one or else you have to wait another 30 -45 minutes in line to get one. Will definitely come back and try Croque Monsieur and the Coconut cake!

Today, i was looking for this place while following my GPS. then guess who called me on the phone? Crystal herself...to wish my happy birthday...and the first thing i told her was i'm looking for Tartine. she then tells me that the bakery doesn't have any sign. it is on the corner of 18th and Guerrero. it is green. gosh, if she didn't tell me that, i would be looking forever. since its my bday, the bf doesn't gripe at all about taking me there. i asked for money and he pulled all the cash out of his pocket, a total of $27 odd dollars. i can buy whatever i want. the sky is not the limit. i bought a banana cream tart, they have a large one for $36...now i'm regretting it. i should've gotten one for my friends to share. :( bought some rocher with cocoa nibs (the beans inside tasted burnt...should go well with a latte)...and a slice of coconut passion cake. i don't know why, i just had to have cake. i came late in the afternoon as there were not much of a selection to choose from. next time, i will try the lemon cream tart & lemon meringue cake. thanks Crystal. :)

Only been here once but do I wanna come back again!  But I have yet to have time to go to SF since I live in the East Bay. Food: Things I tried? I shared a bread pudding, hazelnut torte and a yummy quiche with my friend. Let me tell you this, we got a small for the bread pudding and it was more than enough. It was warm and soft...just like how bread pudding should be! Now, for the hazelnut torte, as much as I love hazelnut, it wasn't my fav. It was good...but I def prefer the bread pudding.  Now, the quiche! Oh me oh my was that delicious!  I find myself itching to go back to SF just for it.  But, as good as it is, I had to take small doses of it. I think I overate and i felt a bit disgusting cause it was kind of heavy but! def.l something one should try! Yum,yum,yum! Service: Very friendly and very fast (and of course they should be..seeing that there's a fatty line outside) While in line, there are SO many choices on the counter...I couldn't decide! I had to make quick decision for what I want because I didn't want to hold up the line! =] Ambiance: It was a bit tiny inside so therefore, not a lot of seating.My friend and I ended up sitting outside on a bench while a little dog sat underneath our bench.  It was quite adorable! Note: Go early and not lunch time. I've heard from SF friends that aroud lunch time, the line goes along the walls of the building! We went around 10ish and the it was quite packed but, we made it in and got our food.

Writing a review about Tartine is like trying to put a dent in a Hummer with a toothpick.  There are over 900 reviews for shit's sake. Nevertheless, Tartine has good food.  Sure.  But jesus, why don't they do something about the chaos?  I'm tired of the pompous excuse that they are "quaint" and shit.  And when they start messing up orders because they can't handle the madness, they should do something! Last time I was there, about halfway through the line, I (tried to) order one of those famous chocolate croissants.  The nice lady who was helping me said I got the last one, pulled it out and put it on a plate.  Of course, you have to wait another 15 minutes to get to the cashier to pay and get your order. By the time I got there, a different (and very rude) girl told me I couldn't have ordered the croissant because they had been out for hours.   But... the other lady showed it to me!  This went back and forth until the nice lady came over and agreed that there had been a mistake and the rude lady had given *my* croissant to someone else.   Nice lady told me I could get something else - on the house.  At this point, I was overwhelmed by being pushed around by the crowd and stuttered that I wanted zucchini bread with my coffee.   I was charged anyway.

There are bakeries and then there is TARTINE!!!! I wish I could give this place 10 stars!!! It well deserves it. Every little bite is delicious and heavenly. I wish there was one in L.A. Hands down the best bakery I have been to in my entire adult life. Do NOT MISS going here if you are in San Fransisco.

The lemon cream tart was really good. It looked good and the crust was a perfect compliment to the sweet and sour lemon cream. The bread pudding was not very good though. It was drenched in syrup. It looked like it was saying "try something else". I would listen to its advice if I were you.

If there is 1 pastry you have to try in this lifetime, its the Almond croissant from Tartine's. They put this buttery, sweet  creme in the center, then embed it with toasted almonds which makes it completely addictive. I' ve been back there 3 days in a row now just to get this. Don't let the line intimidate you, it goes very fast and even if it took long, it is well worth the wait!

I sometimes feel so out of place coming to hotspots in Mission.  Tartine Bakery, like Bi-Rite is a Mission institution (or so the line would suggest), and when I set foot inside it made me feel like an alien...I don't look like a skinny-jeans wearing Michael Cera clone, do not have his annoyingly quirky awkwardness, my conversations usually gravitate around sports and cars rather than the latest developments on prop 8 and how to take care of your dog, and I don't listen to Indie bands that are so Indie that they don't even want to be called musicians because that's too much of a label.   Enough about me and my lack of hipster-cool though.  I made a point to drag my sick, suburbanite self to this place after my wreck of a vday evening.  True to form there was a line and no available seating; wonderful for a sick person.  30 minutes later and $27 poorer, I got to sink my teeth into the most coveted of SF baked goods: a Tartine Morning Bun (amongst other things).   Here's the breakdown... Morning Bun - Okay, okay, it was pretty freakin good, but not nearly as good as 7x7 and everybody else would like you to think.  It's kinda like an almond croissant mixed with a streudel, texture and taste-wise.  A little sticky, sweet, a little crunchy, yet still pliable somehow.  Still, it's definitely worth a try. Frangipane Tart - Topped with huckleberries, it looked and tasted like an almond croissant with huckleberries on top.  I thought it was too dry and crumbly, but pretty tasty otherwise.  Morning bun is still better though! Muesli - I should've looked in that damn serving bowl before I ordered it.  Worst decision ever.  It was like runny fruit salad with nuts in it.  And I'm not talking plain fruit salad, I'm talking the nasty fruit salad that's made with canned mandarin oranges and sour cream.  I swear it said low-fat Greek style yogurt on the menu too...I've never seen a Greek yogurt that was that runny.  AVOID! Ham & Leek Quiche - Unfortunately the muesli combined with my flu to collectively kill my appetite so I only took a small taste of this.  It was good, but it probably would've tasted better had I not been sick and bothered by the damn Muesli.  It definitely had a strong dose of ham and egg which is always good.   Orange & Grapefruit juices - 100% pure-squeezed pulpy goodness.   So I'm going against the grain here and 3 star Tartine.  Nothing about it was particularly attention grabbing or made me think, "OMGWTFBBQ I haz to get moar later!"  I know, I was sick, but I could still taste everything, and the tastes just weren't really doing a lot.  I felt like I could've gone to any other bakery and been just as satisfied with what they have on offer.

Oooooh, are you in for a treat at Tartine Bakery! The smell from this place is very intoxicating.... Like something pretty tasty! I was told/read to try the Morning Bun. I did try and liked a lot. It is a refreshing twist on the usual bakery staple. At Tartine they have an orange-ish glaze in addition to the sugary/cinnamon-y goodness. I am a big coconut fan, so naturally I tried a coconut macaroon too. It might have been that I was famished from running around in Dolores Park or that it smelled so darn great, but I liked what I had and will come back for more. Beware of the line and crowded space. If you have a big group with you it will be tricky getting a seat at times. Otherwise, it moves quickly and is perfect for grabbing a bite on the go.

Tartine Bakery has enough reviews.  Stop it, people!  Really!  How can I go to Tartine on a beautiful San Francisco Sunday and expect to get my beloved double pain au chocolat if everyone keeps giving them great reviews and the lines on the weekends keep getting longer!?! This place reminds me of my favorite little pastry place in Paris.  That place had lines too.   Just give me a day where I can enjoy the buttery, flaky pain au chocolat without having to stand in line.  Please....

The presentation, sunny location and clientele at Tartine add the 'je ne sais quoi' to Tartine's success. All the food is cooked to perfection, and the cafe seating outside -nicely positioned for hip mission style people watching - has quickly made Tartine into a weekend hot-spot. Tartine doesn't need worth of mouth to entice pedestrians into its sweet lair - it's amazing delectables, easily do the talking for them. Whenever I have sugar cravings - it is usually Tartine's custard and banana tart that dance before me, as my stomach rumbles.  I am one, among many - who crave Tartine's sugar fixes.  Their long lines easily attest to this. So yes, the lines and prices are something to consider before heading out to Tartine - but the desserts are just too incredible to pass up.  Note: Their bread pudding - is a fanstastic bargain; considering the big portions and fresh fruit.

OMG. The BANANA CREAM TART is the best bakery item I've ever had in my entire life!!!! It was pastry perfection. In between bites, I couldn't stop saying "OMG. This is so good. OMG OMG..." The delicate chocolate shavings, creamy custard, fresh bananas, light whipped cream, and the perfect crunchy chocolate layered puff pastry crust. WOW. I was truly blown away. Bravo, Tartine! This pastry alone gives this place 5 stars! Brioche Bread Pudding - one of the most popular items of the bakery! This was also really good but the berries in it were pretty sour. I think this bread pudding would have been perfect if the fruits were sweeter. Maybe I came in the wrong season... Chocolate Hazelnut Tart - this was a little too rich for my taste, but still good! It had big pieces of real hazelnut on top which were delightfully crunchy. If you're a hazelnut fan, get this! I wish there was a Tartine in LA!  I'd come here practically everyday! A big huge thank you to Dee C. for recommending this place!! :)

Everyone knows that Tartine makes fantastic baked goods.  I actually read the cookbook from cover to cover last night and gained even more respect for the husband and wife team that created Tartine, who use the best ingredients and processes to ensure that their products are of the highest quality and have the most amazing flavor and texture. My only problem with this bakery is that it's too popular - purchasing a cookie should not be this stressful!  I would go more often if it weren't so crowded - as it is now, I leave feeling like I've run the gauntlet.  The staff seems kind of stressed, too - and when we are talking about flour, sugar, and butter - I don't know, shouldn't we all be a little bit happier? Anyway, today I met my new favorite sweet treat from Tartine - the Almond Rocher with cocoa nibs. (Rocher means boulder, which is exactly what they look like).  Wonderful crisp meringue with a chewy center and rich, bittersweet nibs to offset the sweetness of the sugary meringue - simply lovely, melts in the mouth. One day I'll get to sit at one of the big wooden tables with a cup of coffee and a slice of cake, but for now, it's a bi-annual pilgrimage to the counter to indulge my sweet tooth and admire the smoothness of the ganache and the layers and layers and layers of buttery pastry that Tartine does best - in the comfort of my home.  Oh, who am I kidding, I mean, the comfort of my CAR *wiping crumbs off of coat*   (PS note to self to buy a container of milk before going to Tartine)

It's good. But based on the reviews, I thought it would be mind-altering. It wasn't. I thought it would transform me into a dessert-lovin', pastry-diggin' chic. It didn't. I anticipated a gain of an immediate five pounds just because I tried this place and could not stop eating to save my life. I didn't and I could stop eating. But, it was good. I admit, I don't have a sweet tooth.  (Thank the good Lord for that because goodness knows I eat plenty - - I'd be in trouble if I loved dessert, too!)  If I have room for baked goods, I'd have another plate or bowl of whatever.   But once in awhile, desserts are SOOOOOOOOOO good that even *I* fall victim to it.  Like, at Acquerello.  Or Waterboy.  Or A16.  Or French Laundry.  Or.... okay, so I guess I like it often enough! At Tartine, though I only tried about 5 different things, nothing really blew me away or made me fall to my knees, praying to God for willpower.  Their bread pudding was good - but bread pudding in itself is good, I'm not sure what made this better.  Coffee?  I love coffee, and their was alright.... ..but... but what makes it so special? It is a busy place, and it's located in what looked to be a charming neighborhood. FYI - - there are actually TWO Tartine bakeries in SF.  Who'd have thunk it?  We went to the wrong one first, looked around and thought, "This can't POSSIBLY be what the Yelpers are raving about."  We asked, and the girl told us that there is indeed one more.  Even we had more tact than to ask where it was, so we looked it up ourselves and headed to "THE REAL" one.  MUCH nicer, much bigger selection, and very good stuff here.  I do not know if the two are affiliated or not, but the selection at this one was MUCH better.  The lines were here, not there. I give it a solid 3.5 stars.  The half star is thrown in simply because with 700+ reviews, I figure I'm missing something... But to be honest, I am not entirely sure what kind of bakery would be deserving of 5-stars.  If you know - -  hook me up.   I'm looking to expand my horizons.

I give and I give and you never give back to me.  I'm sorry Tartine, this relationship just isn't working out.  I know it's a bit harsh to break up with you on Yelp, but such is life. Our first date was okay.  Not great, but I was willing to give you another try.  Your passion fruit lime barvarian cake was decent, but my former lover Citizen Cake does it way better than you do.  The lemon bar you gave me was remarkably sweet and yet remarkably sour, just like your M.O., and it sorta rubbed me the wrong way. Our second date was really hit or miss.  That lemon almond poppyseed cake/loaf was tasty, and I was excited to see you again, but the date really went downhill from there.  Your brownie was dark and bitter, like your soul, and your bread pudding was a mess of mush, just like your personality.  When you gave me that cardboard-esque chocolate chip cookie to munch on after our rendezvous it was like you were pushing me away, and I decided that I have had enough. I told myself that we were through and that I shouldn't see you anymore, but my friends told me to give you one last shot since you know, you're popular and cute and all. Last week's date where we shared that banana cream tart was alright, but not good enough.  When you surprised me with that caramel and chocolate in the bottom layer I was intrigued but after eating the whole thing I decided it fell a bit flat. So that's it!  I'm out!  And this time, I must say...it's you, not me.  Please don't get jealous and make a scene if you see me hanging out with Bi-Rite; you had your chance.  Just let it be and move on.

Don't be deterred by the line that wraps out of the bakery and down the street.  It will be worth it!!  Let's cut to the chase.  Here's what we ordered: - Croque Monsieur: open face sandwich with béchamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper topped with smoked Niman Ranch ham and asparagus - Jambon Royale & Gruyère: Niman Ranch cured and smoked ham with Dijon on country bread. - Prosciutto & Provolone: San Daniele Prosciutto with dressed arugula. - Hazelnut Chocolate Torte #1 - amazing bread! #2 - amazing menu selections! #3 - amazing, mouth-watering dessert display! The sandwiches were very tasty, especially when they are fresh and warm and the cheese is that wonderful melted consistency.  The only downside is that the Hazelnut Chocolate Torte was on the dry side, but sounds like it's not their signature piece so I have to be back to try their Banana Cream Tart.

Fourth stop on the 7x7 journey. Just a thought but I think they should have morning buns all day, it being on the 7x7 list and all. We asked the lady working there in the afternoon if we could try their morning buns to which she replied rather snippy, "no, it's not the morning." Still, we had been zooming around the city hitting up different locales and so we had to get something from here to check it off our list. After waiting in a line that moves pretty quickly, we ordered the coconut creme tart and a lemon bar too. The coconut creme tart was really good. It was the perfect amount of coconut shavings and creamy puff. It had a hidden chocolate base within the crust that made each bite come together in flavor and almost made me think that maybe I didn't have to have the morning bun, but based on some of the reviews here, I'll need to grab some buns next time. You'll need a steel fork for the tart and not the plastic kind that looks like metal (or, as I like to call them, the tuxedo print t-shirt of utensils) because the crust is some kind of tough. At $6.50, I'm not sure the tart merits the price tag entirely but it's still one of the better coconut pastries I've had and I don't even like coconut. Plus, you can eat it at the tables outside and people watch and then have random people come up and ask how the coconut tart is and you mumble something incoherent because your mouth is filled with tart. Nevertheless, I'll be back for those buns!

After sammiches at Ike's and Bi-Rite ice cream, Ciara G led Amy B and me to Tartine, just down the block.   I stared - transfixed by the sight of their gorgeous Croque Monsieurs, and was tempted to take one home on the plane a few hours later. But instead, I got: Morning Bun ($3.75) - orange cinnamon sugar dusted the outside and added a crispy crunchy element to the top and bottom.  The inside was moist layers of cinnamony goodness and a light orange flavor. Frangipane Croissant ($4.25) - sliced almond-topped, almond custard baked in, crispy-flaky outside, moist with a good chew inside, buttery all over! Spiced Nuts ($6.50) - a cellophane bag of savory spiced (rosemary, thyme, cayenne, sea salt) nuts for my dad. Though they looked a little dark, both pastries were DELICIOUS and my dad loved the toasted, spiced (with a bit of a kick) nut mix! Next time I'm there, Croque Monsieurs - you are mine, all mine!!

Their baked goods are wonderful, but their staff is so unbelievably snotty that it brings their 5-star food rating down to 1 star. (Yes, I know -- food and service are 2 completely different things, but one does affect the other when speaking of the dining experience.) In a town full of excellent bakeries, why give my money to a place that doesn't appreciate my business? I avoid Tartine like the plague.

Like most, I'm willing to put up with the half-hour line in order to partake in Tartine's heavenly selection of top-notch pastries. It goes without saying that Tartine has delicious bread pudding, morning buns, quiche- and let's not forget the Mexican wedding cookies. Unfortunately, there is much room for improvement in its service department. I was helped by two employees- a tattooed-woman who became agitated whenever I spoke or showed the slightest hesitation, and an expressionless, shaggy-haired man who seemed far more interested in refilling his coffee cup than helping customers. I sympathize with anyone who must deal with a seemingly endless stream of indecisive customers. But being that this is their job, and keeping in mind that enthusiastic customers such as myself travel great distances to sample their famed goods, shouldn't they at least feign enthusiasm? How about a smile? I became fascinated with watching the shaggy-haired man's wooden face and vacant eyes as he answered customer's questions in a monotone voice. Between each forced response he would release the most subtle of sighs, then scan the counter for the location of his coffee cup. Occasionally, he would disappear for long periods into the back room in search of milk to refill his cherished beverage while customers waited patiently.   The noise level was so high that I had to yell my order, which only added to the tattooed-women's easily triggered frustration. Ordering food should be a stress-free, enjoyable experience. I felt unwanted. With that said, the pastries here are, hands-down, some of the best you'll ever have. For that reason alone I will return.

THANKS FOR VOTING, FELLOW YELPERS!! The photo I shot of Tartine's awesome banana cream pie is their main default picture! ANYWAYS I had to do an update on Tartine Bakery because I am thoroughly impressed with their selection of foods. From tarts to cakes to croissants to PRESSED SANDWICHES. CHYYEAAHHH. PRESSED SANDWICHES. While standing in line one rainy San Francisco afternoon, a server walked by with a pippin' hot pesto looking sandwich, trying to find the table that ordered it. My jaw dropped. I thought to myself, I MUST HAVE THAT! So with that thought, I ordered their "Sopressata, Fontina, Broccoli Rabe Pesto Pressed Sandwich" OMG. TO. DIE. FOR. It runs you in at $13 but what isn't expensive at Tartine? The bread they use is super long so in the end, you actually get 3 sandwiches, not just 2 halves. I happidly ate this on a rainy day. I stopped in the middle and thought about how I just paid $13 for a sandwich but I kept eating knowing that I would order this again. What recession? Yeah, no there still is one but MANNN...I am a sucker for a good sandwich. Mmm.

I'm going to come right out and say that I am a savory over sweet person. Me and sweets make for a rare union, but when in Rome or SF, I figure, hey, why not, let's try it! With that said, yesterday, I found sweet heaven. Holy crap! Their chocolate pudding is redonkulous! What in the hell is in that thing besides crack? I don't even like pudding for the most part or chocolate for that matter and the only reason i ordered it was the cute cup and chocolate shavings that I figured would make a cute picture, but wow, that is some friggin pudding! It was so good I forgot to take the picture!!! I also tried a nibble of my friend's lemon bar and watched my other friend wage battle with a rather explosive chocolate eclair. Sadly the eclair won, but yeah, this place rules. Normally there is a line around the corner, but we got lucky on Sunday afternoon and only had to wait about 10 minutes. The staff was also super cool and pretty to look at and yeah, I will definitely be coming back here again on my next SF trip to get that pudding again and to try the mozzarella and tapinade pressed sammich!

With the help of mommy, the kids are done with their homework. In reward, daddy has invited the kids to go to the East Bay for a quick errand, plus we wanted to start the day with a yummy breakfast at one of dad's bookmarked business. As always, with many people enjoying the weekend off, the line was long as expected. But parking our van is not a problem, because Matt found parking nearby. (You know not to come here on the weekends, do you understand?) We were stunned by the display of artful desserts for us to be pleased. For our drinks, Matt ordered the Double-shot of Latte in a 12oz cup. The kids each had a small hot cocoa. Although our drinks took forever to obtain from the barista, the crafty drinks were very enchanting. Also since our drinks were extremely hot, they also make great hand-warmers and manageable for the kids to hold, but not sip immediately. When the cooling process is upon us, we took a sip and the drinks waked us up with a smile on our faces. Matt ordered an Almond Croissant. The fresh pastry is baked frequently and is big in terms of size and taste. One bite of the brick-like pastry, a simple explosion forces Matt to indicate, that "this is a damn good and tasty Almond Croissant." And with the Latte, they make a good couple. The kids split an order of Bread Pudding. The warm Bread Pudding had raspberries for the topping over a ceramic cup. One bite of the Pudding, the kid's smile was huge and noticeable by other patrons dining at the time. Matt also bought a bag of mini Chocolate-chip cookies to snack for later on. The $8.00 bag contained 12 fresh and chewy cookies made with Scarffenberger Chocolate-Chips. Unfortunately, Matt doesn't know the price of each items individually, however he did lose and spend nearly $25.00, but gained a huge smile and love for this cornered bakery.

Do you like chocolate? Do you like croissants? Don't leave here without the double pain au chocolate which is full of chocolate and is flakier than a dry scalp.

As everyone else and their mother has pointed out, the line here is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. The food is good, though. And the service is friendly. We had a bunch of stuff - chocolate croissants, ham and cheese croissants, bread pudding, pain au jambon - and it was all delicious. It ain't cheap, but they use quality ingredients and the prices reflect that. I have never tried the cakes, cookies, tarts or any other dessert type stuff, but I look forward to trying them - when I convince a friend to go pick some up for me so I don't have to wait in line. ***One big fat Fuck You to the asshole who got an attitude when we told him that we had actually been waiting quite some time for the table that he was trying to grab outside. We were standing right next to it, nibbling on our food and waiting for the people who were sitting there to get up. So no, you can't just walk up as soon as they walk away and try to claim the table for you and your friends who are still waiting in line to order. You can wait around like everyone else did. And your attitude when we politely explained that we had been waiting patiently for that table was completely uncalled for - you are so lucky that there were kids with us or you would've received a much larger earful than my simple "You know, you don't have to be such a jerk about this. We have been waiting, that's how lines work." Your parents must be horribly embarrassed by your lack of manners.

Crispy, flaky, melt in your mouth delicious Morning Buns.  Chocolate brownies, chocolate chip cookies, lemon tarts, pastries!  Yummm.. This place is a sweet tooth's nirvana! I risked getting a parking ticket this morning while running in here to try all the delicious pastries.  I stepped in and was amazed by all the wonderful pastries they had displayed in their cases.  Everything displayed was absolute eye candy.  I was tempted to get a morning bun when the quiche grabbed my attention.  Then the guy in line behind me comes up and orders not 1 but 2 morning buns for himself.  I asked him if they were good and he replied, "Yes, they're the best in the world!"  So, I had to get one too. Well when I stepped into my car and took a bite out of that morning bun it was perfect and such a great start to my day!  I'm going to be dreaming of them tonight and will probably pick up some more this weekend and surprise my husband with them!   I can't wait to stop by again to try all their other goodies.  Tartine's one of a kind.  Parking is difficult, but you can also opt to cab it over, bike it over or take good 'ol SF muni over.

'Heaven, I'm in heaven.  And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak.  And I seem to find the happiness I seek.  When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek.'   Well I can hardly speak because I'm stuffing my face.  And we're not dancing cheek to cheek, with Fred Astaire.  I'm chomping on a darn sammie.  A hot pressed one.  Filled with hot ham and gruyere in all its melted goodness.  And we're (my sammie and I -okok my sister too) momentarily away from all the noise and conversation.   Now I finally know what this song means.  And it ain't nothing to do with a boy, Ma.  But you can call him Sam, short for Sammie if you'd like.   Hello Tartine, I think I love you.

The croissants are good, but not as good as the croissants at Boulange at Pine. The frangipane is good, but not as good as the frangipane at Delessio. The olive country loaf is good, but not as good as the rustic olive baguette at Phoenix Pastifico. The shortbread is good, but not as good as the shortbread at Sketch (not just an ice cream shop). The chocolate chip oatmeal cookie with walnuts is not very good, and therefore not half as good as the chocolate chip oatmeal cookie at Sweet Adeline. The currant scone is good, but not as good as the currant scone at Bakesale Betty. Their bread pudding did not make me a fan. Cafe Clem's bread pudding did. The fruit tart is good, but not half as good as the fruit tart at Healdsburg's Downtown Bakery and Cafe. Their best baked goods (the orange-cinnamon morning bun and pain au chocolate -- when not burnt) are good, but not as good as ANY item I've tried (and that's nearly every item) in Crixa's case. Tartine once made my favorite mocha in all of the Bay, but Blue Bottle recently substituted Michael Recchiuti chocolate for Valrhona in their mochas. I tried one yesterday, and, guess what: The mocha at Tartine is good, but not as good as the mocha at Blue Bottle. Also, the line at 9AM is long, but not half as long as the line at 10AM. (There are better bakeries out there.)

I finally found something I love more than Leonardo DiCaprio. Tartine is such a wonderful bakery. I don't mind waiting 20 mins in the pouring rain for the baked goods and sandwiches. The banana cream tart is just divine and I don't even like fruits in my dessert. The sandwiches are wonderful, the bread is thick, crusty and chewy. All the ingredients are fresh and organic. My favorite sandwiches there are the Niman Ranch ham croque monsieur and the spicy turkey. The croque monsieur is the best I've ever had, and trust me I've eaten a bunch in my lifetime and none compares to Tartine's. This is the kind of place everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime. Oh and if you have out of towners coming to visit, this is a great place to WOW them.

I just don't see how they manage to pack that huge wallop or deliciousness into a small croissant. The ham & gruyere Mr. Crunchies *must* be beamed straight from Paris. Also - carefully crafted coffees and espresso, which is a plus in my book. I daresay - might even be better than some of the pastries I had in France...  *might* being operative - I don't want to upset the Francophiles.

I do like Tartine but they go completely over the top. Tartine is very much Americanized French: quantity, quantity, quantity, butter, butter, cream, sweet, sweet, sugar coma. People are all "OMFG so decadent!! So powerful!! I've having a dessertgasm!!". Skillful, yes, but there is no delicacy to them, no crescendo.. they are full volume all the time. Tartine is the Beyonce of pastries. What I do enjoy immensely are their breads. I could dine on the table bread and butter at Bar Tartine alone. (It's supplied by the bakery.)

Is it possible to have too much chocolat in your pain au chocolat?  Really? Here at Tartine, they serve the notorious "double pain au chocolat" with an extra helping of that stuff y'all crave. In fact, I am a member a unique Facebook group that presses the issue: "Pour ceux qui veulent plus de chocolat dans les pains au chocolat" http://www.facebook.com/… Was there too much rich oozy goodness in the double?  Perhaps. Some would argue that there's no such thing as too much chocolat.  If you feel that way too, head on over to Tartine and delight in the chocolaty bakery goodness.

Tartine, tartine, tartine. I've held off on reviewing this place mainly because the mere thought gets me so worked up, and I get all sorts of all-caps-shouty. But I shall strive for objectivity, and plainly present the facts: Almost $4 for a croissant? Almost TEN for a Croque Monsieur? THIRTY-FOUR for a whole quiche? I will spend a lot of money on a lot of things, I'm the first to admit, but Tartine is simply not worth the money. Most places around Dolores Park incite my ire because they really don't have to put much effort in for people to eat/shop there. It's like buying snacks at the movie theater--you'd rather bring them yourself, but sometimes you just didn't plan well enough (Bi-Rite's entire empire is exempt from this critique). Tartine's heavy and overpriced, bottom line. They wouldn't have to charge $4 for a croissant if the thing didn't weigh as much as a small child. As Shepard Fairey wisely mused about art, perceived value at some point becomes real value. People see that ridiculous line on weekends and immediately want in. I can name a number of better bakeries, but alas, they are far from Dolores.

What I ate: Banana cream tart Visit date: June 7, 2011 First time? Yes and would definitely go again! The banana cream tart was beautiful and delicious. The crust was thick and flaky, inlaid with a thin chocolate layer, followed by caramel that flowed out with each spoonful. Drooling yet? There's more. The cream is so light and not too sweet. The bananas -- fresh, sweet, and cool. As if it couldn't get any better, they serve their banana cream with hardy pieces of chocolate shavings. Mmm... My friend had the chocolate hazelnut tart. I'm not a big fan of orange in my chocolate, but Tartine did a good job of it and I actually liked this dessert. I look forward to trying their savory items.

Seriously one of the reasons I want my own private jet is so I can peace out to San Francisco every now and then and binge eat baked goods from this place. Tell me, WHY was the eclair here so good? I mean, near perfection good? I couldn't even let what little of the cream that had escaped its beautiful chocolatey home sit at the bottom of the box untouched. And the bread pudding! And the chocolate cake! On top of the amazing food, the bakery also happens to be on a cute little street corner in beautiful San Francisco right near a park where you can take your baked goods to enjoy. The only downside is that there was quite a wait when I visited, but considering it was a Saturday morning -- totally made sense. WHY CAN'T I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO? Can't someone just throw millions of dollars my way so I can eat, drink, and travel and not have to worry about work, deadlines, and paychecks?

After reading some of the best reviews on Yelp about Tartine Bakery, I recently made the pilgrimage to this great bakery.  There's probably not much more that can be said that 1171 reviews didn't say already.  But to relive the thrill, I have to tell you what I got. I ordered the Hazelnut Biscotti, Buttermilk Scone w/ currants and the Banana Creme Tart.  The biscotti was small in size but large in flavor.  I expected the hazelnut to be sliced slivers, but they were more like a nut partially sliced.  Careful when you bite into it as a nut may fall out.  Also, the biscotti was not teeth shattering crunchy, but softer in texture. The scone was also delicious.   I wasn't sure about the sugar sprinkles on top, but it was flaky and delicious.  This is one of the larger scones I've had. I saved the Banana Creme Tart as a dessert after dinner.  The creme on top was fluffy with the sliced bananas in a sweet compote.  This made the inside of the tart light overall.  The base (shell) of the tart had a flaky texture almost like a pie but the inside of the base was lined with dark chocolate.  A very nice surprise.  This dessert was fantastic and even better (and lighter) than I expected! On my way out, I ordered a Mellow Chamomile Tea.  This had me calm and relaxed for most of the day (very nice).  Thank you Tartine Bakery for your out of this world selection!!  I'll be back very soon.

To enter Tartine is a test of human will power. Just looking at that glass case filled with sweets that would kill a diabetic and to restrain yourself from trying them all is something you have to fight yourself to achieve. The offerings... on any given day are going to be huge. Slices of cakes that probably amount to your whole week's worth of calorie intake. Cookies and breads that will scratch any sweet tooth itch you'll ever have. I kept reading about a long wait time in this place. I don't know if I was just lucky or missed it, but when I came here I faced very little wait and was helped quickly. In fact, the longest wait was for the preparation of the sandwich. Now the sandwiches are worth twice the price of admission. You are not going to be hungry for long after, even if you tackle half of the sandwich, it's still going to be beyond fulfilling. The sandwich is cut into three wedges that each wedge itself could be considered a meal. Cheese melting off the sides and since there's a variety to choose from, you really can't go wrong with any you choose. It would be wise to take your pastry/dessert to go as you will not be eating it soon after lunch. This place is so good I came back/tried it twice in one days time. I'm sure my waist didn't appreciate that.

After almost a month, I'm almost caught up with my SF reviews. Next up is Tartine Bakery! After utterly delicious sandwiches in Ike's, we decided to walk a few blocks over to Tartine's. Ok, we didn't make that decision. I forced my cousins to go with me. On my way over to SFO, I was watching discovery channel (was too early for bowl games) on the plane (continental, BTW). There was this show about top 10 bakeries in the US. I enjoyed the show as the freshly baked cookies were served (now that's delicious, every airline should be serving freshly baked cookies!!) Even with the cookies in my mouth, my undivided attention was immediately diverted to the screen when it reached #2, Tartine. The croissants looks so flaky and delicious. The tres leches cake immediately mesmerized me. I had instantly decided that I must visit Tartine's. It wasn't really as easy as getting there. I got there on my 3rd attempt. As we walked down the streets of what seemed to be a pretty dead residential area, I suddenly see a cloud in front of me. It turned out to be Tartine's 2 blocks away. The cloud was formed by the vapor coming out of everyone's mouth, and there were a lot of people on the street. The line was 40 minutes long (mostly outside) and it was worth it! So, no, I can't wait 2 hours or even 40 minutes for the world's best sandwich from Ike, but I can wait 40 minutes for my tres leches cake. It's simple. When I need a sandwich, I'm hungry. I can't wait 2 hours. The best meal in the world isn't worth the hunger. On the other hand, waiting 40 minutes to indulge myself isn't that much of a problem at all:-D Unfortunately there was no baking goods by the time I got there at 4pm. (thanks Ike's) That means no croissant for me:( Luckily, there were 3 slices of Tres Leches cake left. I bought them all. I split one with my cousins and brought the other 2 back for other cousins. Damn, I'm a good cousin;) This may not be a "pastry" shop, but the tres leches cake was every bit as advertized. The repeating layers of 3 different creamy milky "stuff" melts in my mouth in flavors I can't describe. I have had tres leches cakes before, mostly in central american countries, but this one has a refined taste to go with an unbelieveable texture. The only thing it lacked was presentation. It was one ugly cake. That did not matter to me though. Pretty isn't editble. (unless it's Heidi Klum) Overall, we split a few pieces of pastry and they were excellent. They are definitely a solid 4 star in my book. However, whether they are top 10 in the country is arguable. But I know for a fact that I will be glad to line up for 40 minutes to get the tres leches cake again next time I'm in town.

On Saturday morning, you will need to queue for 20 minutes while obnoxious losers cut in line by joining their doormat friends who were on line earlier.  You know the scene: loudmouths who wish they would've been hipsters at some point, but now they just have babies that they accessorize. They will talk to the top of their lungs about this restaurant and that dish because they are FOODIES, don't you hear them??? Foodies are the next big thing, like Williamsburg. I am a peaceful woman, but I need to take a break from my Tartine Bakery routine because of this obnoxious scene and the fact that tartine is too busy for enough quality control these days. I won't even mention the giant lint/filth ball that was stuck to the sticky buns.  Or maybe I will. It had a bird feather in it. Join me in the vomitorium? Why 2 stars?  I have gratitude for any establishment that seems to repel hippies as well as Canadians with maple leafs displayed on their person.

The only thing I don't like about Tartine is the prices.  You can pay upwards of $6 for a slice of cake.  It'll probably be a damn tasty slice of cake, but that's no drop in the bucket. That said, if you come here for the occasional visit or rare splurge, there's still a lot to love.  This past Friday, I came here with Susan P. around 8:00pm, and we got a lemon bar and banana tea bread, and then sat ourselves down at the communal table.  I should preface this by saying that I don't have a sweet tooth, but our little desserts delighted me beyond belief.  My banana bread was perfectly moist, and though I thought that $3.75 was an outrageous price to pay for one slice of bread, it was worth it.  The $4 lemon bar was superb too, with a mix of tart and sweet flavors, complete with soft lemon and munchybutterycrusty crust.  That's how I like it.   And you're not just paying for the baked goods, you're also here to enjoy your company and the community.  I just discovered how much I love communal tables, and our experience that night further contributed to my fondness for them.  As we were sitting there that night, eating our well-made and delicious desserts, we spent time talking with this husband-and-wife couple that we'd just met, who were also sitting at the table.   On that perfectly crisp and clear night in the Mission, we shared stories and bites of food with strangers who became great company.  The Tartine staff let us sit there and chat, even though it was getting past closing time.  We found out that we had a lot more in common than just our fondness for the desserts at Tartine.  The world became just a little bit smaller, our food tasted that much sweeter, and my faith in people grew that much more.   Thanks, Tartine, for the sweet desserts, for your communal table, for being a gathering place for this community on a cold night.  Loves it.

It's not as rich but lighter and creamier. =P Only con is that the line was way longer this time around...and it was raining....

Hello there! Some things you should know about me: I don't like lines, or waiting in general when I am hungry. I loathe crowds, especially annoying/clueless/smelly ones with a few/many children sprinkled in them. I do however, adore a good neighborhood bakery and Tartine is so great that I actually stopped half a block away and picked up a real estate information sheet for a house that was on the market. Seriously though, if you lived this close to Tartine (AND Delfina... AND Bi-Rite) why would you ever want to move away? I can't say much about all the beautiful sugary tarts and cakes I ogled in the window, except they looked stunning and I would probably have died from a sugar overload if I had even tried to finish one. Next time Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian, I promise. Same goes for you Banana Cream Tart. I will say, that ever since I was a tiny, I have been eating croissants for breakfast. Fresh from the bakery in Belgium for a couple of years, and fresh from the bakery in Hong Kong (courtesy of a father who liked to wake the household up too early) on Sunday mornings... Once in a while here too, mostly in ham&cheese form from Bennison's. So, I would like to think I know a thing or two about them. My verdict on croissant I sampled at Tartine? Fabulous! A nice flaky outside with soft, buttery, doughy layered inside. Even better than this? The double pain au chocolate, essentially the same dough in a different shape with Valrhona chocolate inside. Can you say NOMGASM? The only downside, is that I'm not the only person who thinks this a great bakery. Locals and tourists alike flock to this small space. During the week, there is a line out the door. Most of the tables are occupied too. The line also doesn't function at its best. You'll be asked for what items you like before you even have a chance to see all things on display. This resulted in me not spying the ham/cheese croissant OR the Gougere (cheese bread with thyme and black pepper) until it was too late. That's okay though, because now I know, and now YOU know too! Definitely on my list of places that I will return to should I ever find myself vacationing in (or moving to?!) San Francisco. Lovingly, Croissant Crazed Yanyao.

I decided to wake up early the day of my birthday, take a morning stroll in the MIssion and end up at Tartine all by myself to do some reflecting and devour what could possibly be the best morning birthday treat ever, which is the pain au chocolat. I had been waiting for some time to try this fine piece of flaky, buttery and chocolately goodness so you can only imagine all my senses being heightened. And rightfully so, it delivered... over and over again! I was a little hurt when the lady at the counter told me that the banana cream pie wasn't available... such Babylon!! So I guess a trip to SF will just have to happen soon!

"TARTINE" (French, from Old French, diminutive of "tarte") - a slice of bread, sometimes with butter, jam, etc. Appropriately eponymous in its beginnings as a bakery that specialized in breads baked in a wood-fire brick oven and elegant pastries, the husband + wife team of Chad Robertson and Elisabeth Prueitt opened Bay Village Bakery in Point Reyes Station, where it garnered rave reviews.  They eventually moved their business to San Francisco's dynamic and eclectic neighborhood in the Mission, corner of 18th and Guerrero Streets in the summer of 2002.  The bakery is small, inconspicuous, modest, bearing no signs nor emblems but a colored 18 x 24 copy of the famous Tartine cookbook and an antique white paper on an 8.5 x 11 wood panel sign posting the operating hours, perched by the storefront window, beside the entry door.  The bakery; nonetheless, is mobbed by customers (locals & visitors), where they wait patiently in line for their turn to order impetuously delicious, heavenly baked goods. My favorites: - QUICHE (made w/ creme fraiche, Niman Ranch smoked ham, and organic produce).  I have never tasted such a delicate, yet flavorful quiche as this.  It doesn't have a heavy cheesy tone as most quiches do, but rather light & airy from the creme fraiche, with hints of smokiness from the ham, freshness from the organic produce, & a subtle taste of nutmeg.  The crust, all by itself, is a wonderful treat.  It is slightly flaky but moist w/ a creamy buttery texture and taste.  This quiche, was by far, the best I've ever had! - CROQUE MONSIEUR   (open faced sandwich made w/ their Country bread, bechamel, gruyere, thyme, pepper, and topped with either the smoked Niman Ranch ham or seasonal vegetables).  Again, the best croque monsieur that ever graced my tastebuds!!!  There is something about the pigs in Niman Ranch, in pork or ham form, that elevates the flavors of a certain dish.  And combined with bechamel sauce, melted gruyere cheese, and slices of yellow tomatoes, on top of a perfectly baked Country bread, will definitely put a smile on someone's face who woke-up on the wrong side of the bed! - CROISSANTS Buttery, flaky, but moist inside are the classical properties of a perfect croissant.  These are as good, and perhaps even better than the ones I've had in France. - HOT PRESSED SANDWICHES * IDIAZABAL & MEMBRILLO (lightly smoked sheep cheese w/ quince jam).  A blissful marriage of savory & sweet, w/ a hint of smokiness! * PECORINO & ALMOND (sheep cheese & almonds crushed w/ olive oil, lemon and sage).  Talk about peculiar & inconceivable pairings of ingredients.  Who would've thought that their combination would result to a grandiose taste!  Incredible!!! * SOPRESSATA, FONTINA, BROCOLLI RABE & PESTO (spicy sopressata w/ Italian fontina and pesto).  In a nutshell...oooooooh-r-g-a-s-m-i-c!  "Someone please light my cigarette!" These pressed sandwiches are delightful!  I might even be bold to say that they beat Campanile's grilled cheese sandwiches!  And Meltdown...definitely move over! - PASTRIES * LEMON CREAM TART (sweet pastry shell filled w/ rich lemon cream, topped w/ unsweetened cream) * CHOCOLATE TARTE W/ TOASTED HAZELNUT (sweet pastry shell filled w/ Scharffen Berger chocolate mousse & toasted hazelnuts) * SHORTBREAD * ROCHER (meringues w/ cocoa nib & toasted almonds) * FRIAND (Scharffen Berger chocolate bite topped w/ ganache) - SCHARFFEN BERGER CHOCOLATE PUDDING.  Freakishly decadent, luscious, and silky!!!   - BREAD PUDDING (housemade brioche, topped w/ caramel and fresh fruit, toppings change daily).   These desserts are wonderful, light, airy, flavorful, and not sugary.  They imbue the true essence of French baking. Another plus is their COFFEE.  The lattes and espressos are strong, robust & flavorful, fresh, and not bitter in taste. The only downside to Tartine is its size and lack of seating.  Be prepared to queue in line and fight for a table once you pay for your goods.  They have a strict policy of purchasing before sitting.  But then again, you can always get it to go!

BANANA CREAM TART. Inhaled between my hubs and me in seconds. Difficult to eat with a fork because of the crust so we ended up using our hands.  We had cream and chocolate and caramel on our hands, faces, and clothes... and didn't care! Divine.

Not that expensive when you consider that everything is HUGE. And delicious. But the oversized portions are much more American than French, and you sacrifice refinement for value. I enjoyed the Morning Bun, a croissant-textured cinnamon roll with a faint orange taste and not too overloaded with sugar. It was extremely buttery though. Get lots of napkins! The Double Pain au Chocolat was gigantic (more than double the size of a normal one) and also very buttery. I don't want to think about how many sticks of butter I consumed with these pastries. The chocolate inside was rather meh, so I wouldn't get it again. If you're into buttery croissants, just get a plain croissant, which is also enormous here. I got the pecorino, almonds, olive oil, lemon, and sage pressed sandwich, which took 15 minutes to make. I got tired of chewing the bread, and it left my mouth really dry. The flavors were great, but it needed some meat or something to make it more substantial and less... just bread with a thin slice of cheese and the spread. I would give Tartine 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down because it didn't quite justify the long line (15 minutes wait) and another 15 minute wait inside the crowded, touristy-feeling bakery.

I grew up in Germany, where you have to have a Masters degree in baking, just to open a bakery so my tastes are little refined. I will say most of the items here are very good, and some of the best I've had outside of Europe. I've tried most of the things on the menu, and the only thing I dislike about the goods are the Crossaints tend to be kind of bland, and their Country Loaf bread tends to be burnt. I understand it's made without preservatives and tends to be tougher in texture. I'm fine with that. German bread is even more dense and tougher, but this is literally black on the outside. I would expect more from a bakery charging these kind of prices. Another annoyance are the strange hours they have regarding certain items. I can understand baking is an arduous process that cannot be rushed, but they don't start serving Breakfast Rolls until 8:30am. That's too late for me to get before work. I think they should change the name to mid-morning rolls. In addition they don't serve bread on Mondays. I'm sure there is a reason for this, but I have no idea. Not to mention they only serve bread after 5pm. This is obnoxious, because in Europe I typically buy a loaf of bread in the morning, and eat it with lunch and dinner. I can't eat an entire loaf of bread from 5pm to bedtime, and it's of course bad the next day. With that said, I have yet to experience gruff service like some others spoke of. Just the usual disinterested, young, white, attractive, female dressed in homeless chic. I don't mean for this to be a bad review as I love their desserts, and I hope they continue to flourish as they have. I just think they have some room for improvement in other areas.

Somehow I managed to find myself in the neighborhood (read: drove all the way from North Beach post Mama's and Yogen Fruz), and decided to get some pastries for later since I've had it bookmarked for ages. I walk in and get the Banana Cream Pie and Fruit Cake thinking I'd save them for later. Riiiight, the second I close my car door, I'm eyeing the box of sweets and I decide to just take a closer look at the Banana Cream Pie. Less than 3 minutes later, someone catches a glimpse of me staring back like a deer in headlights, face covered in cream and pie crust. Dang it, why does this keep happening?? I was asking for it though, thinking that not taking a fork with me would actually prevent me from eating. HA. I don't need to convince anyone that Tartine is delicious with their thousands of positive reviews. Just remember, if you're gonna get something "to go", bring a fork.

There are 1245 reviews for Tartine, why should you read mine?  Don't.  My waistline is rapidly expanding and I write from the POV of a fat-kid-at-heart.  It's getting to the point where I might be able to partake in Chunk's "Truffle Shuffle" from The Goonies:  http://www.youtube.com/w… Came here after Pizzeria Delfina to explore the excellent selection of desserts and pastries (Because, ya know...pizza just wasn't enough).  It seems there is always a line no matter the time of day, but well worth the wait when catering to your sweet tooth.  I ended up with a heaping bowl of delicious bread pudding...WAY TOO BIG to be consumed by two people.   But now I have leftovers and can pig out all week.  The scharffenberger pudding will send any chocolate lover into 9th orbit.  The Maker's Mark pralines will be under the tree for my New Orleans-lovin' family this year, fo shizzle. The space is very crowded (read:  tough to waddle through with two huge desserts in hand).  The outdoor seating is pleasant and less-congested, but there aren't any heat lamps. Tartine has a ton of tempting treats beckoning me through the glass case.  I will be back to work on my case of solving world hunger....starting with myself

Sat at a table with two danish girls. Sitting twiddling my thumbs. I'm trying not to watch them eat, talk with their insatiable sense of seriousness. One tucks into her chocolate cake with great relish - a friend insists her burly figure implies tigerish instincts beneath the covers. I'm a doubter. I try. Eyes closed and fork gripped tight - nothing. My mind wanders to a pork shoulder... the way it's strung up, each loop digging into the flesh, digging deeper as it winds down. Eyes opened. Her tank top has me going kosher. The conversation stalls. I look up and recite some passage from a recent times article, "blow jobs are so yester-year. The new taboo is anal sex; you know?" A gay couple to our left splutter and spill little earl grey. He's wearing a wifebeater; I miss the irony. The first of our two danes screams something to her friend in a foreign tongue; we get the hint, commenting politely on the weather.

The coffee drinks and pastires are amazing and worth every penny.  DELICIOUS!! They get 5 stars.   The rest of the menu is lacking.  The sandwiches are huge and are served on amazingly tasty bread but they are really heavy and on the greasy side with too much cheese.  They also take 15 -20 minutes to prepare so be ready to wait.  these huge suckers are definantely not for anyone looking for something light.  Tartine charged $3.75 for a side salad that was 100% romaine lettuce.  NOTHING else.  Thats a plate of  lettuce not a salad!  The shallot vingarette was onion flavored oil.   blech.  2 stars I will be back - but will stick to the pastries and coffee where Tartine excels.

Judging by the 1500+ reviews, I am one of the last people in San Francisco to have visited Tartine.  As a loyal Liberty Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) customer, I had pretty high expectations for Tartine.  That might have been its undoing.   We came to Tartine around 9 am on a sunny Friday morning, and the place was packed.  Don't you people work?  All the tables were taken, except for two tiny tables inside.  The line stretched from the cash register all the way to the door.  The 15 or so people in line were blocking my view of the baked goodies on the shelves, but I couldn't help trying to see them.  Everything looked delicious, rich and extremely appetizing. Side note: for the people who hang out at a bakery on a Friday morning, the crowd seemed a bit edgy.  I was rudely interrupted with a terse and annoyed "excuse me" twice.  I really didn't mean to be in your way, really.  The place is small, cramped and overcrowded, and I am pretty big.  Sor-ry! We got to the registered an ordered a morning bun and a scone to share.  I also got a cup of coffee.  Actually, I got a cup FOR coffee, since I had to get my own from a self serve station featuring a Thermos and your usual coffee staples. The coffee was very good (Organic Mr. Espresso), and the self serve station meant "have as much as you want."  If I didn't have to go back to work, I would have had a fourth cup. The morning bun was very good, but not "life changing" as I heard some people describe it.  It was a little bit too sweet, even for a sticky bun.  I liked the buttermilk scone a lot; it was flaky and light.  I heard good things about the bread pudding, one of my favorite things to order at a bakery, but I haven't tried it yet.  Maybe next time.

Parking sucks. Hate the looong line!! It takes forever. But I can't resist the Mexican wedding cookies, quiche and the bread pudding. Yum!!! I go here occasionally with my cousin, but I probably wouldn't sit and eat here though, with the line of hungry drooling people behind you at all times, watching your every move as you slowly take a bite out of your [ insert favorite mouth-watering food from Tartine here ]. Unless you're into that kind of stuff, I wouldn't recommend eating at Tartine; maybe unless you're sitting outside or you happen to have a window seat away from the line!! Minus the so-so customer service, super looong wait in line and the fact that sometimes they just run out of a particular food you might have been craving like it was the last meal you'll ever have!

Ham-and-cheese croissant and morning bun earn the top tier spots for me, followed closely by the bread pudding with fruit, the wait-worthy paninis, and the completely shareable lemon pastries. Everything with chocolate (Valrhona chocolate!) is insanely good. The baristas make a killer foam, and a mostly friendly staff comprising entirely cute women doesn't hurt business one bit. If your mouth isn't watering already, I'm not sure you can be saved. The downside: -A looooong line and wait for a table, where, on any given morning, several pods of  table reconaissance will shark around innocent people who are still wiping their mouths and picking their teeth. -It can be a strange mix of both neighborhood snotty and touristy. Somewhere in between is ideal.

Tartine Bakery served the best pain au chocolat I've had this side of the Atlantic. We had a lovely time eating outside the cafe (which was a bit crowded) people watching, chatting, and refilling our coffees. I'd also recommend the bread pudding; we got it because it was fresh out of the oven--very generous portion and topped with delicious berries. Tartine is definitely a great way to start the morning!

3.5 stars but between 3 and 3.5 .. well i'm not really sure :[ I had expectations of this place because of the reviews and rating. Maybe it was the day, after the Red Bull Soap Box Derby, they were SUPER BUSY and crowded or something... but my banana cream tart just wasn't that fabulous. the flaky tart crust was delicious, the flakiness was awesome i could just eat this by itself. the chocolate covering the inside shell was not TOO sweet, but fairly sweet. but the bottom layer of caramel just pushed it over to TOO sweet. the banana filling i really enjoyed! if it had banana filling and tart shell i would have been pleasantly surprised. then there was the whipped cream, gallops and gallops of it ... i started to feel gross after finishing the tart. maybe you're not suppose to eat an entire tart after a 2 hour standing event when you're super hungry. but isn't everything suppose to taste better when you're starving?

A lot of people see a review count like this and think "what's the point?" of writing a review.  Personally, I enjoy the lack of pressure: I can take any little portion of the sweeping review-canvas and doodle in whatever comes to mind. And what comes to mind is that these guys definitely deserve their spot as 3rd-most Yelped business in SF (2nd if you don't count the meta-Yelp).  Yes, the morning buns are amazing (the secret, I think, being the orange glaze), but the frangipane croissants are even more so, and the lemon-almond pound cake--well, it makes me weep to think of all those wasted years subsisting on the dry, crumbly stuff at Jamba Juice or Starbucks.  Everything is just colossally moist--even the hair of the people in line (which frequently goes around the corner but moves pretty fast) has that unmistakable Saturday-morning just-showered quality (complete with shampoo smell). I don't know what it takes to get a seat here, but I recommend just taking your goodies over to Philz to get a cup of coffee that's a worthy complement.

Tartine is a mediocre combination of the best in French baking and the worst in French logistics.  I've managed to fight my way to the counter and eat a few times and everything I've had has been really good (especially the bread pudding).  But hell, the line on weekend mornings, rain or shine,  is 40+ people deep and doesn't seem to move, except when people give up and leave. I think part of the reason for this is that at Tartine, you lose 10 I.Q. points when you enter and gain 10 pounds by the time you leave.  By the time they are up to order, customers seem to have forgotten why they are even there, and spend several minutes staring slack-jawed at $6 pastries.  This is the only place I've ever seen where people go into a food coma BEFORE shoveling down 3 million calories.  I like relaxed European-style dining, but this place doesn't do it right. Also, the seating options here are essentially nil.  If you eat inside, you have to wedge yourself into a chair and get battered by handbags and strollers as other customers roll through.  In the really bad seats, you'll be eating about a foot from the nether regions of someone standing in line.  No matter where you sit inside, people in line will be watching you as you eat, which I hate. If you sit outside, you will battle fearless pigeons nonstop, as there are always dirty dishes to feed on outside Tartine. I hear Godot really digs this place, but I do not.  I live two blocks from here and haven't been in three months.    I've seen people waiting for the store to open 15+ minutes ahead of time, which is just ridiculous.  This place is not worth waiting for.

I wish I could remember what all we ordered but I tried to wipe the experience from my memory. But this is what I *do* remember.. Croque Monsieur --- Mediocre at best. This is typically something I am all about but it was horribly lacking. Bland, blah. Quiche --- I love me some quiche --- but not theirs. The crust was sub-par and the filling a mere shrug. Banana Bread Pudding --- We took this dessert to a friend's house for dinner and to put it lightly we were embarrassed. The bananas were disgustingly over ripe and brown, the pudding was dry and the flavor - if there was any - was masked by the bananas (if you could call them that). I know we picked up a couple of other things but it is gone from my memory. I have no freaking idea why this place is ridiculously over-hyped. San Francisco, you are a food Mecca --- what gives? I am a foodie and I expect you to deliver. I have yet to find a bakery where I would be satisfied serving their desserts instead of making my own. If you can tell me the proper thing to order --- *perhaps*  I will consider giving it another shot because how can so many hundreds of San Franciscans just not know any better? Tartine - I suggest a throw down. Oh --- the pot of tea was lovely though.

I got there late and picked what ever was left. And it was mighty tasty, but not spectacular.  I ordered some macaroons, which Mary Ann says there is a touch of almond in there.  I don't know about the almond, but there were good.  Ferghal liked them too, as he stole one!  Good chocolate cookie, walnut butter cookie, good shortbread, and a really good hazelnut chocolate tart.  I really wanted some kind of chocolate bite size cake in the case, but they were out. I will try to head over there for some bread and better pickings, but I don't think the bread could be better than Acme or Raymond's.

Tartine came up at least 5 times in the last month in conversations. 4 of those 5 have to do with croissants, where I passionately argued that no one should be able to charge $4.00 for a croissant. The best croissants in NYC are about $3. The croissants fresh from patisseries in Parisien streets cost less than $3 in Euro equivalence. So Tartine has no right to be the most expensive croissant in the world - no matter how flakey, buttery, light, and wonderfully delicious. I stand by this! Which is why I will always scowl at the price tag while ordering one (or two, or more). And then I'll proceed straight to completely losing myself in its soft, creamy, and heavenly creaminess.

I came here after hearing about the hype and the fact it was featured on Man vs. Food. I got the bread pudding with peach and strawberries. Honestly, the bread pudding at El Greco was a lot better. This place it was served soggy and it tasted more like a mix between flan and bread. I was expecting more of a variety but it was eh. My friend got the lemon tart which I sampled. It was too tarty for me and the lemon taste was too strong. The crust was really hard as well. The only nice thing about the bread pudding is that the syrup served with it was hot. I really don't get the hype about this place.. there are barely any options and the options that are available isn't that great..

Going against the grain here but the first (and only) hot panini sandwich I tried at Tartine last weekend was a huge disappointment. They were out of the roast beef which was what I really wanted so second runner up was the prosciutto, cheese and arugula... it was just plain nasty. The prosciutto was a strange shade of grey and the whole sandwich tasted like grease. Neither the hubby or myself could even finish it. Also ordered the banana tartlet and that was just mediocre. Kind of hard to eat without making a mess since the crust is covered with a chocolate shell... great concept but made the whole thing a bit tricky. My real complaint though is with the horrible paninis. I would not order one there again. Update 4/9/08: Okay, they got another chance with MUCH better results and a star addition from me. Had a really delicious Croque Monsieur, a bite of wonderful quiche and another bite of a perfect croissant. Actually, that visit gained them 2 stars back. I'm still staying far away from the paninis however!

There's one thing that San Franciscans love, and it's standing in line.  Does it matter what's at the end of that line?  Tartine proves that it does not. I can't come up with a reason why you'd wait an hour for coffee.  I can't come up with a reason why you'd patronize a place where the ordering process is so inefficient.  And I can't come up with a reason why everyone would obsess over the pedestrian pastries this place serves up.  Maybe that's why I haven't been here in years while many people inexplicably waste their entire Saturday waiting for a coffee.

I have never been to Tartine.  But it is my favorite Bakery.  Last year my good friend Nakeisha started bringing me morning buns.  After one I was hooked, I crave them.  Nakeisha who lives in SF but works in Marin stops by the bakery on a regular to pick up batches of goodies for my freezer.  The morning buns are my favorite, but you can't go wrong with those amazing croissants especially the almond ones. This last November I received the Tartine cookbook for my birthday.  I have been baking like crazy this holiday season, and every recipe has been amazing.   One day I will journey to my Mecca, but I fear that the mystery of the place is part of the draw for me.

Boo!  A Tartine Bakery review when it's so so old news.  Believe it or not, I just FINALLY, for the first time ever, ate a Tartine baked good.  I've been to the bakery for capuccino's but have never stood in the line for baked goods.  There are already a handful of  fine sweets establishments I have become a slave to my sweets addiction for - I thought if I don't eat anything from Tartine I won't know what I'm missing. . .until today.   As if two sides, no make that three sides (the third was a gift from the kitchen), a bottle of fizzy water, about 6 bread sticks, and a salsiccia pie weren't enough to put me and Dodo into a Pizzeria Delfina food coma.  Seriously we had to practically be scooped out of the restaurant.  The only thing that would save me from my pain was a double espresso.  Yeah sure let's go to Tartine Bakery for a double espresso only - sure.   Before I go on I have to say had there not been a bunch of empty tables inside and a short line, I probably would not have waited or ordered anything to eat.  Saturday around 6pm is the time to go.  Until today, I've managed to avoid getting "hooked" on this place since opening.  Every time I'm in the area, there's a line out the door and down the sidewalk.  I don't need to wait that long for a bigger butt.  I wait that long for things like discounted Eames furniture, Keihl's products, Madonna concert tickets, and a blessing from the Dalai Lama. Double espresso turned into seasonal bread pudding, macaroon, meringues, and some chocolate goodness round bite size ganache filled yummy.  Holy sugar high I'm in love.  If I were a famous actress and I needed to gain a lot of weight for an upcoming movie role, I'd eat at Tartine Bakery every day. Yum yum for a fat bum bum!  And totally worth it!

The morning bun was fantastic, and the almond croissant was great and about as big as my foot, even if it was little burned. The line was too long to go back, and I didn't want the drama to mention that it was a little overdone. I'll definitely give 'em another try though. Get there early. My only complaint would be that their opening (7:30 am) does not coincide with when I need to move my car for street sweeping (7 am), but they've gotta do what they've gotta do.

Okay. I've seen this line at Tartine's about 100 million times -- I'm always like YYABHL (Yet Another Boogaloos Hipster Line).  It happens to be a weekend with my momma in town so we decide to part-take in the line. Well, I'm happy to report that the line goes quickly, it took a max of like 10-15 minutes. The game plan for future visits: You can shard your wait have 1 person go get coffee in the *coffee only line* and come back to the person waiting in the baked goods line! Brilliance! Yes I know. The bathroom: Seemed acceptable for a bakery.

My friend used to live near this place. I've decided to forgive her for never bringing me here during one of my visits, but ONLY because she brought one of our other friends once, who in turn decided to take me when we were in town. After emphatically suggesting Tartine for breakfast, she started to backpedal a bit. I'm not sure if she was nervous we wouldn't like Tartine, or just wanted to keep our expectations for breakfast in check, but she did her best not to overhype it. Well, from the second we walked in, there was nothing to worry about, we were drooling over all of the items we saw people eating. All of our sleepiness and hungover crankiness melted away as we carefully perused the offerings. We were so visually enamored with their items that we all went a bit crazy, ordering 3 items each. I went with the double pain au chocolat, a morning bun, and a chocolate chip cookie with oatmeal and nuts; I know it sounds gluttonous, but I was starving and everything looked so tasty! The pain au chocolat was a*FREAKING*mazing! The croissant itself was huge, warm, flaky and buttery. Definitely, not something you'd want if you're watching the calories/fat. It was obvious they had been pulled out of the oven recently because the chocolate was still melty. I ended up saving my other two items for later. My morning bun, a flaky pastry roll dusted with cinnamon and sugar and some orange zest, was quite good too. It didn't really compare to the croissant, but that's because it was slightly stale. The stale factor is 100% my fault, I ate it the following morning for breakfast and in my haste didn't wrap it well. Despite the slight staleness it worked wonders for hangover number two, in as many days, and was better than any overpriced, mediocre pastry I would've found in the airport. The cookie was good, but average compared to the other offerings. I liked that the cookie was thin and flavorful and not overly greasy. If you live in SF and have never been here, what are you waiting for? Seriously?! Put down the computer and get your ass over there. NOW!

I am almost positive that I had already written a review for Tartine, as it is my favorite bakery in all of San Francisco, but my review doesn't seem to exist anymore, so here we go again: I have tried many of the desserts from Tartine: -Bread Pudding w/ Seasonal Fruits -Lemon Bar -Lemon Cream Tart -Lemon Meringue Cake -Frangipane Tart -Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian -Chocolate Brownie -Chocolate Croissant -Chocolate Hazelnut Tart -Chocolate Souffle Cake -Devil's Food Cake -Scharffenberger Chocolate Mousse My favorite would probably have to be the Chocolate Souffle Cake.  When slices are not available, and there are more than a couple of us, we just buy the whole cake.  Yes, it's that good. Also: I would happily wake up 30 minutes earlier just so I could take a detour to Tartine on my way to work. I did not cry when I accidentally sat on some dog poop in Dolores Park because I had Tartine pastries to distract me.

This review is for their Almond croissant and banana cream tart, as recommended by fellow yelpsters.  The croissant was tasty heavy and dense but really deliciouslyoso, to me the croissant itself was a meal in itself, but the cream tart looked so good and had so many rave reviews that i toughed it out and ate that sucker too and although my stomach didn't agree I'd do it again! The line was out the door (apparently a common thing) but the line went relatively fast as we waited only about 10 min.  I see this as a normal pit stop for my future trips to the city by the bay

The best bread in the world. Period. So why only two stars? MISSION ATTITUDE UP THE BUTT We need them more than they need us, and they treat their customers that way. I've never been treated so shabbily on such a consistent basis. A major part of this is the bread policy which is: 1) only available from Wed-Sun from 5-8 pm 2) unless they sell out first 3) but you can order ahead of time 4) but only in person since they don't answer the phone, which means waiting in that godawful line twice 5) none of this is written down, you just find out the hard way. I frequently walk out of there with anger in my veins, and that's no way to live. bread beats Paris by a mile though...mmmm

My apologies to the Tartine regulars but quite frankly I don't see the appeal of this place at all. I've been here 3 times; introduced to it by plugs given to it on programs on the Food Network. My hopes and anticipation ran high since I search out anything French, mostly baked goods this side of the pond. Much to my dismay Tartine was more about the bread than the patisseries. In fact, there were only a few tarts and quiches each of the times I was there. A few words about the bread; why is it only available after 5:00 p.m. When nothing beats having bread for breakfast and/or lunch. Other starches are preferable for dinner. I suggest baking your breads earlier so that your loyal patrons (of which you have many - judging from the multitude of reviews) can enjoy them throughout the day. The reason for my negative review does not stem from the lack of variety of les gateaus et les viennoiseries; it's the unenthusiastic, aloof, bordering on rude staff. These employees acted like they were put out to help the customers, really... I've had better service at Louis Vuitton than Tartine; the salespeople at LV were way friendlier. What's up with the arrogance, it's just bread, and there are many many choices of bakeries out there. On one of my visits, the staff were openly sarcastic with customers with one of Tartine's owners standing nearby tacitly condoning this behavior which in my opinion is a sad reflection on much he values his customers. No matter how good the products are, I will never return to this crowded, poorly laid out bakery where parking is virtually impossible to find only to be mistreated by staff. Politeness and good service matters and until Tartine's owners realize this, I will continue to steer clear of this place.

5 stars for food: I work in the neighborhood and am always tempted to stop by Tartine to indulge in one of their many amazing offerings. But my last experience was so unpleasant, it was the last straw and I don't think I can go back.  The pastries, breads, cakes, well, pretty much everything is so so so good there. I've had breakfast and lunch and I have never been disappointed with the food.  I have greatly enjoyed everything I've tried so I really can't dock too many stars.   2 stars for service: The service however is always so pretentious and rude. Like its a privileged for me to be there and for them to deem me worthy of their time.  I always find the servers to be so smug, but I keep going back for the abuse!  There are a couple guys who are nice enough but its clear customer service is not their priority.   Go for the food but don't expect to be coddled.  Know what you want ahead of getting in line, because god forbid you need a second to decide.

I still dream about the bread pudding and the frangipane croissants from Tartine's.  No really, I literally dream about them.  In my dream, I own the store and I eat the pastries for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I may squeeze in a prosciutto & provolone panini for snack here and there, but mostly I eat pastries all day.  I welcome everyone into the store, including friends, family, celebrities, nerds, geeks, and homeless people...everyone except the parking police who issue tickets outside my store. Oh, and in my dream, I am always skinny.

I was pumped to finally go to Tartine with all its hype. I expected and was prepared to spend an ass load of money because I have a serious addiction to baked goods. And then I got to the display cases... Everything looked overdone. I mean everything. The morning buns, croissants, and every other bread item and pastry appeared to be burnt. I don't mean a lovely deep golden brown. I mean everything was black on top. Even the croque monsieurs I saw were completely black around the edges. I was looking around in disbelief like seriously? Every freaking thing is overdone? People are OK with this? I didn't want to pay for any of it. I refocused and instead decided just to order the Banana Cream Tart everyone raves about. Great concept but it was executed so poorly the day I purchased it. The tart crust was inedible. The pastry crust should have been the highlight and it was horrible. Not flaky and also overdone. It would not cut with a fork, I had to use a knife. It just tasted like bad, burnt, store bought pie crust. Horrible. The chocolate poured into the crust was too thick. Just a slab of overpowering chocolate at the bottom. There were just a few scant banana slices in a poor excuse of a cream pie filling. The caramel was a nice touch. I also ordered an iced coffee that was seriously the worst iced coffee I have ever had. I couldn't even drink it and threw it away after trying so hard to make myself like it. The employees just acted as if they could care less about anything. No smiles. No thank you. I really want to experience this wonderful Tartine everyone else seems to love. I'll give it one more chance but I still don't think I've found my bakery in CA. peace, love, and good booze ~ chase

Tartine Bakery is good, though it's always got a line & stuff is pretty expensive.  Why don't they have a sign outside their door? I got this time: 4" Frangipane tart $6 - It has a mild almond filling w/ some tart huckleberries.  Pretty boring & dry.  Skip it! 4" Banana Cream Tart $6.35 - it's good.  Thick crust w/ chocolate & caramel (didn't taste caramel) on the bottom, lots of banana, whipped cream, & some shaved chocolate on top. Walnut Bread $7.25 - it came out HOT & FRESH at 4:30pm on Sun 11/15/09.  The guy said usually at 5pm bread comes out & today was early.  I love HOT & FRESH Bread! My total $19.60.  Credit cards taken. To try next time: morning buns (morning item) croissants (morning item) lemon bars gingerbread tiles Guerrero @ 18th St

Our fourth stop in the Ang and Lily Happy Hour walkabout of the Mission. This place is supposed to be one of the tastiest bakeries in the city, and it didn't disappoint in that regard. I tried the coconut macaroons and got a monster chocolate chip and oatmeal cookie. Saved the cookie for later, ate the macaroon. It was toasty on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. Yumma. Although I know we got there near closing time, we were both a tad disappointed that they were out of a few of their mainstay items. Also, for me, they close a tad early for summer, but that's on them, so whatevs. Final analysis, I'd go back... And my dog would too, since he was the one who ended up eating that big, monster cookie. Damn you, dog! I got one bite, he sneaked the rest (off the nightstand at the hotel). Loved by humans and dogs alike, this is a go...

Who would've thunk over 2.5 yrs ago when I wrote my original review that I would actually end up eating something out of Tartine's garbage?  Well technically it hadn't made it into the garbage bin yet, but was on its way in when my homeboy rode by and questioned what the employee was doing throwing out so many olive and walnut loaves. The large loaves with slightly browned tops didn't pass QC so homey was able to tuck 2 "less than perfect" loaves into his hoodie and ride down the street to my house where my roommies and I devoured them without hesitation. Unfortunately I don't live down the street anymore but when I make the trip nowadays, surprisingly more than anything, i crave their breads. Their ginormous bread book came out recently but realistically I wouldn't cook anything out of it (2 weeks for the starter to be viable? what does that even mean?). But now that I know how much labor and time goes into making the bread, I get why it's pricier than Acme and the like.   Just the thought of Tartine makes me salivate. There's really nothing there I haven't loved from their pastries in the morning to their croques for brunch to fancy cakes for special occasions. But nothing beats their bread (fresh from the oven at 5pm) with some good old fashioned butter...

I stayed in SF with a friend and she was so adamant that I try the croissants from Tartine that she walked 15 minutes to the bakery, waited an hour for the goods, and walked another 15 minutes back to her apartment, just so I could try Tartine's famous pastries. She's an awesome friend. Verdict: In my friend's words, "The croissants are to die for". The croissants are seriously the best, buttery, flaky croissants I have ever consumed. The regular one is the best and the chocolate and almond ones are in 2nd and 3rd place.

Let me start by saying amazing food! Wow When I took the bite of bread pudding with peach, it was just perfect.  I am not really a fan of a peach in a cake, I like it by itself but it was fantastic combination. Frangipane tart (little on crunchy and flaky side), passion fruit lime Bavarian cake and coconut cream tart was out of this world. I definitely want to come back and try the morning bun, since lots of people are raving about it in the review.   Only reason I am not giving them five stars, staff service is very dry.  When you think of bakery, you think of sweet, so I want my server to be polite and nice.  Which was not the case?  I am not going to say, they are rude, but dry. I don't know if anyone experience about receipt, I didn't get mine, I am assuming you have to ask, which does not make sense.

The baked goods are what they are - GOODS! They are GOOD! They are GREAT! They are... heaven. =) If you've ever watched Van Wilder, the eclairs here will definitely remind you of a certain scene involving eclairs and his dog Colossus... Hot pressed sandwhiches here are the best! The bread gets so crunchy - I loves it. I'm so glad my friend introduced me to this place. There seems to usually be a long line, but the wait isn't that bad. Finding a table is! NOTE: DO NOT SIT ON THE GREEN WOODEN BLOCK OUTSIDE. IT HAS WHEELS AND IT WILL SLIP OUT FROM UNDER YOU!

I think key to having an excellent experience at Tartine is to avoid it on the weekends. The line goes pretty quick on weekday afternoons, even right at noon when the sandwiches come out. The jambon royale & gruyere is tasty but the generous slathering of dijon tends to overpower the sandwich. Just request that they go light on the mustard. The pecorino & almond is perfect as is. Crunchy cheesy goodness! I think the only potential gripe with the sandwiches is that they tend to be a little greasy. But for $8.25 a piece, you get three huge hunks of sandwich and a bit of pickled veggies. Quite a deal. And you shouldn't miss the lemon cream tart as it is the perfect combination of sweet and tart. I don't think a better pastry shell exists. And you don't need a fork. Just shove the whole thing in your face! Or at least, that's what I do... So on a sunny day, take your sandwiches and tarts to the park and enjoy your lunch. Don't forget to grab extra napkins. ETA: I think the gals behind the counter are super sweet and accommodating. I've returned again and again for sandwiches and pastries and have yet to encounter any snobbishness. Another update...bread! Just call and reserve a loaf or two so you don't have to worry about showing up after 5 p.m. and have them run out. They use their country bread as the base and variations of it include walnut, sesame seed, olive, or dates and olives. I like the country best for sandwiches and walnut to eat by the slice. Also, freeze the leftovers! The ones with nuts and olives keep better as they keep moisture in. $6 for the plain country loaf and $6.50 for the others.

Perhaps not interesting or informative for me to give 5 stars to place that has almost 150 reviews so far, with many "BEST BAKERY" claims, but I needed to give them what they deserve.  Eating their creations makes you realize how good things taste when made out of quality organic ingredients.  Sitting outside sipping their excellent coffee and enjoying a croque monsieur on a weekend afternoon made me feel so glad to be in SF.   BRUNCH: While I could see how Tartine could be in discussion as one of the best bakery in town, I cannot say it's the best brunch place.  A brunch is a time I want to relax, sit back and enjoy my Sunday paper with caffeine in my hand (yes, caffeine is relaxing), so I prefer a full table service.  My idea of relaxing is not waiting in a long line peaking through people's heads to see the menu, making a quick decision when it's your turn in line (not a good time to be asking questions when you know 30 people are waiting behind you), walking through a crowd of people while trying to find a table without spilling your coffee, and leaving fairly quickly because there is a bunch of people looking for an open table.  Furthermore, most of their dishes are pre-made, like most bakeries.  Therefore, they don't have more involved usual brunch dishes that takes time to cook.   Therefore, I am giving them 5 stars as a Bakery, but not as a brunch place.  Oh, make sure you try their Eclairs -yum.

Half the city is under a blanket of fog and the other half is beaming with sunshine. Whenever I come here whether it be for lunch or weekend brunch the sun is always shinning around Tartine. The sandwiches served for lunch are yummy! The croque monsieur is my fav; thick hearty bread topped with gruyere and shitake mushrooms. The bread pudding is to die for! Seasonal fruit with brioche bread made fresh daily (we got here at  1pm and there was only 2 servings left in the pan). The chocolate pudding and brownies are made with Valrhona dark chocolate. The shelves and counters are lined with fresh made bread, croissants, cakes, tarts and cookies galore. There's chairs inside with wide windows to look outside or you can eat outside and take in the beautiful day. Service is friendly with a smile. After hours the places turns into a bar scene with dinner service. Ill be sure to write my review on that soon.

It's been over 3 years since I last reviewed Tartine and I still love it as much as the first day I went there. And perhaps I love it more because of their amazing baked bread! For those of you who haven't had it, definitely try to get there when they're serving it fresh out of the oven every Wednesday through Sunday, after 5:00 pm, in full or half loaves. They're pretty large so if you're only buying for yourself, I would strongly suggest the half loaf. The olive is my favorite but I hear the sesame is also very delicious. And another addition to my review...after passing it by several times, I finally tried their Bread Pudding. Delicious! Best I've ever had and you should definitely try it, even if you're not usually a fan of Bread Pudding. I'm thankful I don't live closer to Tartine only because I prefer my clothes to fit...but it is a truly amazing place. :-)

Delicious bread. Staff with big attitude. Yes, the bread is delicious. It's expensive but you'll be hard pressed to find much better loaves of sourdough bread short of baking it by yourself. And their quality is consistent, just as the 30 minutes queueing ritual from 4:30 to 5 pm to get your hands on one of these tasty loaves. Alas, some of their staff could well do with some attitude adjustment. We queued up, waited for our turn, just to be told that we couldn't order the bread since they were processing earlier orders (mind you, it was 4:55pm) and had no clue whether there was enough bread left. The random hipster of the day refused to take an order and told me to check back every five minutes and claimed that 'he was doing me a favor' rather than asking me to queue up again until it was my turn again to get some bread ... Fortunately another employee had some more good sense and when checking back 5 minutes later she happily took my order and I got the loaves once they were ready. Overall, great bread, overpriced pastries, and staff that should probably remember that they aren't handing out favors for which the customers need to be grateful but are actually selling things.  One star less for that.

I can't sleep at night. I can't focus. I keep whining. I cry sometimes in my head. I bite or pinch myself until I almost start bleeding. I (try to) force myself to not eat sweets: no ice cream, gelato, candy, etc. What does this have to do with Tartine? Let me set the scene. I woke up today at 6 pm and curled up into a ball because of the sharp pains in my root-canal-needed-molar. I finally get up to go back to my apartment and finally buy toothache medication along the way because I've taken 30 advils the past three days and surely there are better remedies. Throughout the night I've been applying Eugenol (it's hella nasty) to stop the pain in my tooth as I wait all night to make sure I'm awake when it turns 8 am so that I can make an appointment. I'm tired. I smell like cloves. And I still have a ever present pain in my tooth. Then I realize that my friend left one last tart from Tartine's from my Saturday potluck brunch. I remembered how good the strawberry and lemon tarts were but debated in my mind for awhile if I should eat the coconut cream tart (or something like that.) It looks good. My tooth screams no. I dab my finger in the cream and eat a little bit. Mmm. Damn it. I start walking away because I know the risk involved. Even just that little bit was enough. I cut myself a quarter slice. I start eating it and hot, freaking, damn. Not only is the cream impeccable, but there are bananas at the bottom. And THEN I find out there's carmel AND a chocolate layer. All packaged with perhaps the best crust I've ever tasted. I know that in 20 minutes I'll start screaming inside my head with the agony from my tooth being exposed to the sugar. But on the outside I'll be smiling. Because I just ate the best f---ing tart I've ever had.

Remember when you were a kid, and some adult would always ask,  "Which is your favorite: vanilla, strawberry or chocolate?"   Now that I'm old, I realize what an impossible question that is;   There was always that kid who would answer Neopolitan, thinking they were foiling everyone.  No, you're just a pig! (in the fact that pigs will eat anything...)  Strawberry/vanilla, vanilla/chocolate and even strawberry/chocolate, but all three together is plain gross.  Anyone else agree?   Neopolitan aside, Tartine Bakery is the place where you can find vanilla, strawberry and chocolate in all it's forms plus more.  I bring glass locking tupperware here when I'm flying somewhere, or having a party and have them pack it with their bread pudding with strawberries and rhubarb.  It's a good hostess gift that's uniquely San Francisco.  So far airport security hasn't stopped me...     Their chocolate pot de creme is delicious, I don't care what anybody says.  Yeah, restaurants have been known to make it better, but for takeaway in a plastic container, Tartine's can't be beat.   The cakes are great for when you have a tea party, as they're so pretty and Mary Poppin-esque.  Truthfully I only order to-go as the ambience is a bit too cafeteria-ish... albeit perhaps a French cafeteria?  But a bustling cafeteria is preferable to when it was a black void in the building's previous incarnation as Carl's Bakery.  Carl's Bakery, san the kitsch sign, looked more like a leather bar and not very bakery-ish.  Now if only they would open one in New York...

They don't have cupcakes. I was bribing J to drive me to my car (hello, Saturday night bender) in SOMA and did so by saying "Ride to car? I buy you cupcakes." That was enough to make him wake from a near comatose state to "Be there in 30." So, you see, we REALLY wanted cupcakes. And thus, all of you rabid Tartine fans should not hiss and spit for the 3-star review, because I REALLY wanted cupcakes last Sunday. It's not hard to spot Tartine Bakery - there's a line out the door (not be confused with Bi-Rite's line out the door). Maybe they do this on purpose though, as you shuffle in line past the glass windows of a veritable cornucopia of baked goods you're practically salivating by the time it's your turn and it makes you want to promptly order everything in sight. We settled for four items and definitely ate them all in one go at Dolores Park. Coconut macaroon - I personally hate coconut, this was purchased for my driver who requested it. I hated it, he loved it. Go figure. Shortbread cookie - I'm a chocolate chip cookie girl, foiled again by second-guessing myself. Frangipane tart - flaky crust, sweet filling, what's not to love? Croissant - OMFG. GINORMOUS, FLAKY, BUTTERY. HEAVEN. Side-note: That evening a girlfriend actually baked the apple crisp from Tartine's cookbook for dessert and it was utterly fabulous. I'll be back to try their sandwiches and quiche.

I don't particularly enjoy going to Tartine for brunch per se, but I think I'd do anything for one of their banana cream tarts. So. GOOD. Being the gluttons that we are, my boyfriend and I started off brunch with dessert first. He had the banana cream and I had the lemon cream tart. Needless to say, I forced him to share with me. Too good to resist. I don't know if it's because we started at such a high point for our meal, but the croque monsieurs that came afterwards were a bit underwhelming. A tad too greasy and therefore too heavy after inhaling dessert. I'd definitely go to Tartine again...but probably just for the bakery goods...and maybe a stop to bi-rite afterwards!

05-20-08 UPDATE: went back to see if anything has improved and unfortunately, no update. Still the same hipster-girl staff that blankly stare at you with no emotion behind their eyes and think if they add a monotone "please" to our miserable interaction that they're doing a good job. ============== 11-12-07 ORIGINAL POST: Yeah, the food is good, but this is one local establishment NOT to support -- they value your money more than they value their customers as evidenced by their continuing apathetic, smart-ass, hipster wait staff and lack of operational efficiency. And I LIVE in the Mission. Too bad, since I live in the neighborhood and may be taken for a smart-ass, hipster myself, but when I'M PAYING $20 for pastry and tea for breakfast, I would not like a heaping helping dose of apathetic art- school eye rolling and grunting customer service. I really do want to support local biz, but their customer service is a buzzkill and I will NEVER go back, having given them so many chances since they opened.  If you're reading this, then you're a foodie too, and you know that there are too many good alternatives in SF to support businesses that berate the customers who are PAYING for their food. Read on. Here's a typical visit: Queue up in the food line that's almost always 20+ people deep. Ponder why you would wait for 20 minutes in a food line outside of a communist country. As the line moves past the front door, wait in front of the dessert case. Listen patiently to the staff talk about their weekend, who's sexy, or who sucks. They will eventually, when they are ready, turn to you very nicely and ask what you would like. Cuz ya know, if they ask nice, who cares if they ignore you. If it's in the morning, be asked what you want before you can even see the selection since it's in the next case over closest to the register. Dumb. And you know, ham and cheese croissants aren't ready until 9am, and blah blah. Place your drink order. Oh wait, you CAN'T order your drink while you are in line. You have to order it at the register -- and THEN wait another 10+ minutes for your drink to be ready on the barista's glacial pace. It's so nice to score a table, get my food, eat, and THEN have my coffee or tea ready. Finally, get to the register. Do as they say and don't ask any questions -- or incur the wrath of hipster drones who have grown up at everyone's -a-winner soccer tourney's and believe that somehow they are special award winners entitled to everything their way as adults too. Newsflash, I am paying YOUR salary through my patronage. You may have gotten a million trophies cuz no one's a loser when you were a kid, but grow up. Try to find a seat. Decide to squeeze into the communal table, the tables near the cases, or the tables near the coffee bar. Each location affords a lovely opportunity to kick someone in the nuts with your head as they wait in line or worse, snake their way past you with their hot coffee en route to the cream and sugar at the OPPOSITE end of the store. Wait for your coffee or tea. And wait. And wait. Decide to finish eating your food instead, as the barista has decided to chat with the other customers and waitstaff anyway. To top it off, bus your own table. Give me a break. For what I am paying, and the amount of staff there, I expect THEM to bus my table. Hell, the taqueria buses my table. The food court at the Westfield Bloomingdale's mall buses my table. My advice, no croissant is worth the bad service and hassle. Go across the street to Craig's Place for a hearty breakfast. Or one of the myriad of places between Dolores and Valencia on 18th instead, but steer clear of Tartine Bakery.

How it took me so long to finally try this place....i don't know. I'm ashamed.   But better late than never.  Well I finally made my way out here for a presnack before meeting up for dinner.  And I got myself some chocolate croissiant, bread pudding, couple of their cookes (Oatmeal with orange zest is good) and of course the winner, almond croissiant...it is absolutely delicious.  My friend got the morning bun and we all tried it after our dinner.  The almond croissiant, I saved for myself for the next morning as breakfast and Oh My God....it's perfectly flakey, with a good nuts and filling ratio.  I think I'm going to have to come back here more often to hunt that almond croissiant.  sooooo good

I think that there are too many reviews for this place. So, all I want to say is that if you haven't been there before, then get ready for the long line, the crowds and the limited seating. We ordered the morning bun, bread pudding and the croissant with jambon and cheese when we went. It was a good start to a morning, and they also have good coffee. I must say that I think the bread pudding was the best I've ever had and was my favorite of all the stuff we ordered. Custardy and vanilla-y. But definitely too crowded, so that's the reason for the 4 stars. I think next time we go, we'll order and take it away. Overall, a good experience. Next week we're off to the Boulangerie on Pine Street for a battle of the bakeries!

This is a local favorite for pretty much everyone. Their pastries are always phenomenally good and smell fantastic. I highly recommend the chocolate croissant along with the ham and cheese croissant. The only drawback to the place is that there is typically a long line to get in. I once showed up 20 minutes before they opened and was still 8th in line. By the time they opened, the line was about 1/3 of the way down the block. Also, seating is a bit scarce in there. But it's always worth the wait.

The coffee is all you can drink and the best, consistent brew besides my hit-spot- Beanery.  This place has their yin-yang balance between savory and sweet goodies to choose from- the hot pastrami sandwich rocks if u love horse-radish, as do the pizzabread or whatever cute name they call it.  OMG!  Bread pudding is just a blessing and a perfect compliment to whatever else ur grinding on. Yes, parking bites but i usually find a spot in the residential alley right before hitting the street Tartine is on.  This cafe is great to enjoy small talk and conversation with friends or strangers cause of the intimate, friendly setting created.  Usually a line, but be like me and just tell ur friends u will hold a seat for the rest of them and have em order 4 u while u sit back and enjoy a coffee on ur keister ;)

I like everything about this place, from the name to the location to the wood floors.  And their young, friendly, attractive staffers - how do they not weigh 250 lbs each?  Anyway, I tried the pecorino & almond sandwich.  Super tasty, but dare I say that its a bit too big?    It's just too much of a good thing --- I could only finish about 2/3s of it.  And I looove cheese.  Love it.  But it was just too much.  My advice: split it with someone.  And eat your carrots!  They may not look like much but they're pickled or something and they're really good.   Favorite dessert so far is the coconut cream tart.  It's got a crisp, flakey pastry shell with a hard chocolate coating on the inside, and is filled with coconutty goodness.  Delicious.  The lemon tart is also very good.

I thought I had been to the best bakery when I went to Bouchon in Yountville.  Then I went to Tartine, and everything changed. Tartine had the most mouthwatering and awesome-looking pastries I've ever seen.  The cup of chocolate pudding with the perfectly-shaped dollop of whipped cream on top looked like heaven. I bought a bunch of items, and all of them were delicious.  The shortbread seemed to melt in my mouth, unlike other shortbreads that have the consistency of hard cookies. You have to get one of the double chocolate cookies!  It was very soft, and so chocolaty that I could hardly believe that I was having a cookie, and not a chocolate bar. The rocher with almonds was very tasty, and quite gooey on the inside. The coconut macaroon was wonderful, but perhaps a tad salty?  All I know is that it could have been sweeter. The best thing I bought was the fragipane croissant.  It was much better than the almond croissant at Bouchon, and was super buttery and flaky.   My friend had ordered some bread, and when she asked if it was ready, the lady at the counter told her it was just being taken out of the oven!  Talk about fresh!  And it was like 3:00 P.M.!  Not 5:00 A.M.! I will definitely be back to Tartine, but the next time, I'm going to clear out the whole bakery.

It is all about the Morning Buns. Seriously. Get here early, and by early I mean before 8:30 to secure yourself an out of this world morning bun. Buy two. One for yourself and one to give to someone you love so they can be just as addicted as you are and then you both have an excuse to nag each other to go back to Tartine extra early before work. I made a mistake of buying just one... and there were only 2 left! Coffee and a morning bun = the best way to start your morning. I can't believe I've waited this long to try one. Eat with caution, you may not be able to devour just one! p.s. They have the best croissant I've ever had in my life. moist, flaky, buttery goodness.

It's been 5 months since I've last written a review... Damn, I've got a lot of catching up to do. I came here yesterday with Mr. Face for one of our first stops of our SF trip on his recommendation. We luckily found some street parking fairly quickly across the street. I was really surprised about how packed it was because I've never been to Tartine, but I'm glad we stopped there. When I was able to take a look at the display case, some of the items looked really good, while the others... so so. I instantly decided that I was going to have something with lemon, and went with the lemon cream tart with a masala chai latte. Sir Face got the gougere with a latte. Found a table with no trouble at all. We were very impressed with our pastry items. The gougere was excellent, and the lemon cream tart was almost perfect. I think that if the butter was a little more prominent in the crust, I would have enjoyed it more. the texture of the lemon curd was quite different; with the cream, it reminded me of the texture of laughing cow cheese. The dollop of whip tasted just right, and the ripe raspberry was like the perfect accompaniment to the tart - too bad we only had one =( As for my latte, I think it was super light.... More like steamed milk with a hint of chai. Had me wishing that I had gotten a soy vanilla latte instead. Man, I could really go for another lemon cream tart... I'm not sure if I can actually say it's worth the $6, but Mr. Face paid so I guess I can't complain haha. I would say my rating is mainly because of that...

The morning bun is delicious. Got a couple of extra ones for the next morning and warmed them in the oven. They were still pretty good the next day!  It's a small place but we went after lunch and there were only a couple of people ahead of us in line.  On the pricier side but a nice treat every once in awhile.

I absolutely love this bakery.  I fell in love with everything that was in the showcase my first time.  It was almost 2 years ago, when my friends and I drove up here from LA for a road trip.  I moved to the city about 7 months ago and have been trying to go here every chance I get.  I brought all my friends that came to visit, because this is such a wonderful place.  The food is great, pastry and desserts are to die for, and the ambiance is great....it's so loud but everyone is in their own little world and can careless about the background noise.  There is usually a long wait in the morning for breakfast and brunch, but believe me, it's totally worth it.   My personal favorite are their varieties of open faced sandwiches, bread pudding with seasonal fruits, and the lemon cream tart (heaven in your mouth).

I heard of Tartine Bakery via my food obsessed friend, but our resolve to make a trip to Tartine bakery was strengthened after a visit to the SF MOMA, where we spotted the Tartine Bread book in the museum store. It was a sign. On a side note, if you decide to venture to the area, stop by Bi-Rite Creamery, which is right down this yummy block. The BI-Rite Market is also bustling and cute, with a decent selection of chocolate! We approached from Bi-Rite Creamery towards the corner surrounded with rubble and orange cones, yet sandwiched between the building and orange cones were cute round tables with people sitting in them, eating pastries and drinking soup. There were dogs sitting under tables and books being read. Aha, it's a cafe or bakery! So we venture forth and our instincts have drawn us to the right destination - the famous Tartine Bakery. We pick our way past the rubble, and we are greeted on the left by a lovely row of pastries. Pie, tarts, macaroons. Further along are the bread - oh the bread! Morning bun, pumpkin bread, croissants! The service was great, and the pastries did not disappoint. The pumpkin bread was a bit oily, but the ham and cheese croissant was scrumptious. My friend had the morning bun, which, after tasting a bit, I can honestly say it was delicious. We walk out, and we're rewarded with a peek into their kitchen. Along the window we see cheese graters of all sizes and whisks ranging from the size of a watermelon to that of a tablespoon. If you see construction going on, don't hesitate to go in. It's well worth it. It's a little pricey, but still, I'm someone who will spend money on food.

I thought I already wrote a review for this....  See what lack of sleep will do to your brain?   First:  They serve Blue Bottle coffee.   Second:  I thought the Scharffen-Berger croissant alone was brillant enough to give Tartine a 5-star review, but that was before I met the morning bun.   Third:  The Morning Bun.  Pure sweet heaven on a plate, my friends -- enough to make a true believer of the damned.  Not that I think I'm damned (yet), but that is a *fine* pastry.  I'd wait in line all week to get one.  Amen. UPDATE:  Tartine by night is mellow, and a nice place to get a dessert.  However, they refused to slice the super chocolately cake of my desire because it was 15 minutes to closing and mine would've been the first slice.  Whassup with that?  Stingy!  Someone has to get that first slice sometime...  why not me?  I would ding 'em a star right now, but I can still hear the morning buns singing..  drool...

Tartine is a fantastic little shop. If you are lucky enough to get a table at Tartine, make sure you take advantage of it and stick around for dessert and coffee. The grilled sandwiches are fantastic, especially the Pain au Jambon, but the dessert is great too. I split the hazelnut tart and the chocolate mousse with my father and boyfriend. At the beginning I thought that the hazelnut tart was better, but the chocolate mousse is so light and fluffy that it really grew on me. You can only eat a couple of bites of the tart, which is delicious in its own right, but its one of those things that you can't have too much of. The chocolate mousse is the way to go.

The dark chocolate valrhona eclair was delicious - vanilla specked, chilled custard. Sandwiches are hugely portioned - Both the Sopressata, Fontina, Broccoli Rabe Pesto and Jambon Royale & Gruyère arrived piping hot, crusty yet chewy bread.  One sandwich lasted me through lunch, plane ride snack home, and a late night snack.   Unfortunately docking stars for a 30 minute wait for the sandwiches after we placed our order.. and more disturbingly, fruit flies crawling on their croissants and other food items in their open counter section.

I was hoping for their famous "morning bun", but they were out when I came down.   I did get some cookies and some bread pudding.  My friends and I liked the cookies.  Our favorite was this meringue cookie that was filled with an almond nougat.  The bread pudding and the other cookie was just okay.   Whenever I come back to SF, I may consider coming back in the morning.  It's just tough because it's a little out there - it's in the middle of mission district.

I've made my way through more of their offerings now and still stand firmly by the croissant being freaking amazing.  Now, I can add the ham and cheese croissant to that list.  I think I ate one a day for a week over the summer.  :-/ Somehow, though, I don't love the almond croissant.  Too much powdered sugar, not enough almondy filling goodness.  I love almond croissants, so this was disappointing. The lemon bar and tart are still delicious, but the brownie was only meh.  The truth is that I don't really love chocolate all that much, but I don't hate it if faced with an amazing product.  And for this brownie?  I threw most of it out. I am in the extreme minority, but I hated the bread pudding - it was SO eggy, I couldn't take more than two bites.  The first bite and then the second to confirm that, yes, I really did hate it.  That was sad as I had been looking forward to trying it for a long time. My stars are for those croissants and the lemon items - ohmigod so good!

I LOVE Tartine. Only if it wasn't so packed all the time, I would be here every weekend! During my first visit, I fell in love with the croissant. Plain or chocolate. It's so fresh, flaky, and buttery. Just like the ones from Paris. With all the tempting pastries in front of me, I couldn't settle on just one item, so I also ordered the bread pudding. I thought it was good, but I like my bread pudding more "made to order" warm versus sitting out cold. One another visit, I had the Jambon Royale and Gruyere pressed sandwich. YUM!!!! Homemade thick slices of country bread pressed with smoked ham, Gruyere cheese and Dijon mustard. It's so delicious. The banana cream tart is another favorite of mine! Chocolate covered crust with real chunks of banana mixed with the banana pudding and then topped with whipped cream and shaves of chocolate. Such a decadent treat!!! They sell it individual tart size and large pie size!!! MMMMMMM..... Coffee and espresso drinks here are wonderful too!

How can you possibly review a place after 1,026 others have written before you? The irony is that I was around when this location opened. Oh well. I've never been too much of an early adapter. Tartine isn't unique in filling the surrounding block with its tempting aroma, but I'm so glad it does. It's tough: Is merely getting a whiff sufficient when I decide that the line is too long and too annoying? Probably not, but it'll have to do. Okay, I once declared that Tartine's ham-and-cheese croissant was the single best food item in the 49 square-miles of this city. Today, I reiterate that claim. Mouth-watering, perfectly baked and flaky croissant filled with Niman Ranch ham and, I believe, gruyere (not sure where from). Everything is as hot and textured as it's meant to be, every time. The ham is slightly juicy, and a bit smoky. But enough of my yappin' -- just try one already. I haven't visited a substantial portion of the menu, but I can say that everything I've ever had has been utterly delicious -- morning buns (bits of orange rind round this out), plain croissants (again, perfect flakes), croque moisseurs, almond croissants (frangipane), bread pudding (with seasonal fruit), and, well, I know I'm forgetting a bunch of other things. Coffee is by Mr. Espresso, and I don't care what you say (well, I kind of do), it's damn good. Fresh orange and grapefruit juice. Okay, the downside (honestly, what keeps it from getting six stars) is the line, made worse by the fact that the place is just way, way too small. Perhaps not their fault, but my solution is to open Bar Tartine during the morning and early afternoon and serve coffee and pastries there. So I sort of feel like I can fault them for the line. But not really. The love is strong. Prices are reasonable ($3.25 for aforementioned best food item in the city). Get it to go if you can't stomach the line, take it to nearby Dolores Park, and let life be grand.

I would seriously move to the Mission Dolores area for one reason alone: Tartine Bakery. Tartine is so quintessentially San Francisco - the crowd is a diverse mix of hippies, hipsters and yuppies of all races and age groups congregating at shared tables (or separate tables thisclose to each other so that you might as well be sharing a table) over newspapers, chess games, and the perfection embodied by Tartine's frangipane croissants, lemon tarts, bread pudding and croque monsieurs. Yes, you'll have to wait 30 minutes in line just to order one croissant, so make sure you order EVERYTHING you want the first time around because you don't want to underorder then debate (after finishing off your croissant, smacking your lips and licking your fingers) whether you should get in the now 45-minute line to order that other pastry you were eyeing. Tartine makes me oh-so-happy. Even though my visits to Tartine are rare (it's just so out of the way for me), it makes me happy just to know that it exists and that if I am craving a perfect cup of bread pudding covered with fresh berries, or a cup of muesli made with Strauss organic yogurt and chock full of muesli, nuts and fruit, or a perfect flaky frangipane croissant oozing with almond paste filling, or a perfect tangy and creamy lemon tart, it is just a short drive (but crazy parking situation) or BART ride away. Tartine, je t'aime.

it was hotter than an ass crack in this damn place. I hate this insufferable heat. luckily, the wonderful aroma of baked goods and grilled pannini drowned out the sweaty body odor emanating from other patrons. those overhead fans didn't do jackshit, why bother turning them on. my only consolation was nibbling on a delicious macaroon the size of a grape. I exaggerate, it was the size of an anemic plum. my buddy's sandwich took friggin 15 minutes to make but she swears it was worth the wait. she tolerates heat much better than I. since she is a lifelong Sunset dweller just recently transplanted to the Mission (WHY GOD, WHY ???!!!), I do believe she will be dragging me to more of these alien Mission eateries and bars. I always told her she needed psychotherapy. I subtracted 2 stars for the minuscule space and the bizarre set-up. the food was quite tasty albeit pricey

#8 on the 7x7 list brought me to Tartine at 9:30 on a Tuesday morning.  And there was a line.  At 9:30.  On a Tuesday morning.  I wait my turn, get up to the counter, and place my order - two morning buns, a pain au chocolat, an almond croissant, and a cup of bread pudding.  The girl working the counter asks "to go, right?" and I shake my head - "no, for here please."  She looks at me like I'm insane - I guess she thought I was eating everything myself? I finish paying and look around.  No seats.  At 9:30.  On a Tuesday morning.  I thought to myself "don't these people have work!?!"  Then I realized what I was doing there.  You see, Tuesdays are my "work from home" days.  So the rest of the patrons must be "working from home" too, right?  Riiight. A few minutes later, a table opens up outside and I take a seat.  My buddy (who also happens to be my boss/the CEO of the company I work for) shows up shortly after.  That's right - while the rest of you slackers are too busy worrying about getting caught playing hooky by your boss to enjoy your morning bun and coffee, I'm sitting here having pastries with mine.  Yup.  I know you're jealous :) Okay getting a little (ok, a lot) off topic here.  Back to the food.  The pain au chocolat was pretty standard.  The morning buns lived up to my expectations (except that the caramelized sugar on top kept getting stuck between my teeth) and the bread pudding even more so.  The almond croissant was a pleasant surprise... not exactly sure what it was about it though. Definitely my go-to place for pastries here in San Francisco.

If you want a good place to break a diet, Tartine is it.  I went for the first time yesterday and had the bread pudding with nectarines (to go).  I got a cup, but the to go container was pretty full, so I think I got more than my money's worth. The only thing about this place that I don't like is that their menu doesn't give you much information and a handful of the items are announced daily.  If you are new to the place, have a friend stand in line while you take a look at their display cases because once you hit that first counter you have to be ready to order.

If you've all the sudden become a passionate reader of my yelp oeuvre, you might have noticed that I only award 4 stars or higher. Three reviews isnt enough to start extrapolating a trend, but I will say: I do think some things suck and I will trash them in due time. For now, I am writing about the restaurants that I like, really like. Tartine is one of them. And I like it so much that Ill just go ahead and call it the best bakery in San Francisco, hands down. In fact, I think its one of the best bakeries in the world. And Ive travelled far on the pastry comparison circuit. If Tartine was on a corner in Paris, they'd love it as much there as we do here, it would even be better than a whole pile of Parisian Pastisseries. At aTartine in Paris, they might get around to improving their plain croissiant. It pales in comparison to the incredible ham and cheese version, a croissant that would have any Parisian on their knees in reverie, if that was their thing. Back to the Mission. If you can handle the line, you'll be rewarded. I think the line can even be fun: check out the condition your neighbors are in after a night out, oggle the outerhoodies who've been craving the bread pudding so hard that not only are they willing to queue a mile, they've also spent 30 minutes parking their Volvo in Mission-Dolores on a weekend. That same line rematerializes every night around 5 for the bread. Bread with crust, that is. Large, nutty peasant loaves that are unrivaled, if you can ever manage to get your hands on one. The supply doesnt seem to last longer than 2 hours. Favorites: The morning bun. Outrageous. Orange zest is the right touch for these. Like its name suggests, they are best in the morning while they're still gooey and before they've crusted off completely. When they are at their best, each bite is as good as the chewy core. I always make a point of pointing to one in the middle of the tray. Ham and Cheese croissant. Refer to Parisians on their knees in reverie. This is breakfast. The ham is thick cut and porky (which is how I like it) the gruyere is as pungent as good punctuation. With the filling as its brace, the pastry in these always seems to come out perfect - flake shattering and lap smattering. The plain croissant can come out bready, but these always turn out right. Bread pudding. Oh so good. They make brioches just to make bread pudding. That is crazy, but so is the result. Updates daily with what's available. Favorite yet had bananas and currants. The choclate chip cookie. I didnt think I like nuts in my cookies, and i also didnt think I liked them crunchy. These cookies are walnut laden and crunchy and I love them. I think its the butter+crushed nuts+high quality dark choclate trinity together that makes them happen. Pumpkin tea cake. This little guy is always hidden on one of the lower shelves. Its seems an afront to pay $2.75 for something that looks so plain, but its always been super-moist and properly pumpkiny. Great (if not obvious) fall fare. If your a fan of carrot cake, give this a shot. Gougere: a puff ball of cheese barely diluted by flour and butter. Honestly, too rich for me. Everytime I eat one, I am burbing black pepper and cheese all day. But as a specimen of gougere, these are top, top notch. Croque Monsueir: Its my understanding that a croque is a closed sandwich with cheese melted on top, but I wont argue about the semantics of a dish I like so much. The key here is the spread of bechamel to soften that famous bread, topped with ham or the seasonal veggies and then topped with a hard cheese that gets crisped to perfection. Strangely, the accompanying pickled carrots are essential to the experience. The cakes. Take one home to your mom. I did, and she lives in Madison, WI. She's a baker with an epic reputation, prone to exlaiming, ' good, but not as good as mine." Tartine's version of choclate cake silenced her. That ganache is just too good. I feel full just writing about all this. Print out this pastry guide and get in line!

Oy Vey!  The BEST Brioche bread pudding in the city, hands down!!  I forgot about this little gem in this city of so many restaurants and bakeries!  How could I?   I was driving past it today and realized "oh my God, I need some of that amazing bread pudding".  And so, I stopped!   The bread pudding is exactly as I remember it.  Rich, full of fruit and so very completely yummy!!

Delicious.  We came here before dinner, just to get a snack, but we ended up ordering the store.  Tea cakes, bread pudding, opera cake, lemon cake, chocolate cake...  Wow.  My favorites were the tea cakes, bread pudding, and lemon cake.  Moist, melt-in-your-mouth, delicacy... Once again, delicious.

SADLY i came at around 4 pm and they were out of all the things yelpers were raving about! no bread pudding, no banana cream tart.. no morning buns.. IF THOSE ARE THEIR SPECIALTIES shouldn't they be making those all day long!?! i was SO excited to try tartine.. but sOOO dissappointed in what i ended up ordering.. they should have more than just 3 good items! i got a almond tart with blueberries on top which had a nice flaky and buttery crust but i probably wouldn't get it again... and the latte i ordered wasn't top-notch either.. my friend got the chocolate hazelnut tart. it was kind of gross.. and the chocolate tea cake my other friend ordered tasted just like the costco chocolate muffin.. the best thing was my friends rocher! sadly i doubt i'll have another chance to try their crazy good items since i live in LA.. guess i should of gone in the morning!!

TAR-TINE! THIS BAKERY IS SO GOOD THE ENTIRE REVIEW SHOULD BE IN CAPS. I waited in line for a hot, miserable two hours to see the Sistine Chapel. I would have waited twice that for Tartine. I had read about it in a few places before visiting San Francisco (high-five, guys, blowing up all over the country!), and my dear friend immediately recommended it upon my arrival, so, of course- we made the pilgrimage. For a baker, this is effing Mecca. You want a perfect croissant? They've got it. So much butter that the croissant gets overwhelmed and turns into a soft, pillowy, breathless song of TRIUMPH. It doesn't even taste like a croissant anymore, it tastes like friggin innocence. I lost my mind a little in this place, and spent money like a boss. I picked FIVE: pain au chocolat, a plain croissant, an almond croissant, a morning bun, and a buttermilk currant scone. I also bought one of their canvass bags in the spirit of a groupie who simply will not leave the concert without a T-shirt. My friends each got two pastries (including a pepper cheese popover thing), and we paraded our boxes over to Dolores Park to eat them in the sun. Tartine makes baked goods like Ansel Adams takes pictures, like Stephen King creates characters, like Gershwin makes music. Their goods are just uncommonly fine. Every detail is perfect, from the zing of orange in the morning bun, to the eggy pull of the popover, to the type of cheese they use in their ham & cheese croissant. They simply do not compromise, and I'm so thrilled to have experienced such outstanding quality.

What's all the hoopla about - maybe I just ordered the wrong things. 3 out of the 4 things I tried were average to below average. The almond lemon pound cake wasn't moist enough and tasted too much like marzipan.  The bread pudding brioche with peaches was chunky and just lacked something.  I'm a big fan of muesli so I gave the muesli a shot as well - underwhelming. Given the line to order, not sure if its worth the trek.

Why go to Tartine when you can go to Boulangerie in the Fillmore and Cole valley? I know I know, there is an overwhelming majority of San Francisco foodies who swear by, make a Sunday morning pilgrimage to the mecca that is Tartine, and absolutely adore Tartine. Well f*** it! I really, really wanted to love Tartine, but it's always let me down. I'm only giving them two stars and not one because I once had a delicate and orgasmic chocolate tart from them. Their croissants are burned pieces of bisquick. The outer crust is all wrong, burned black and not flaky at all. You have to dig deep through that crust to get to the meat of the pastry, and then it's too buttery and greasy. After getting fat on butter in Paris I crave light and flakey, not black and greasy. I tried to give Tartine a second chance and wanted to get lunch there because I was in the hood, hoping to have a little pic-a-nic at Dolores park. After agonizing in the long line, then dealing with the dismissive 'tude of the urban hipster staff, paying 15 bucks and waiting a painful 15 minutes for my croq monsieur I left to the park to eat. What a freakin cheesy, greasy mess. Way too much cheese, the soaked-in-grease paper bag should have been my clue to my imminent grease soaked bread and ultimate indigestion. Anyhow, try the little chocolate tarts, they're heaven.

Confection Perfection: I was invited by my nephew to meet his friend, who chose this bakery.  The crowds were daunting because the line went out the door and around the corner in this otherwise quiet neighborhood.  We found outside seating, but due to the rain, we attempted the inside.  Luckily, we were able to snag a table and sit with our beverages.  I had water, but my companions had coffee and tea.   Then the goods were gotten.  Among the 4 of us, we shared  coconut cream slice cake, seasonal fruit bread pudding, and pumpkin bread.  The portions were so generous that we could not finish it all.  The baked goods were full bodied in flavor yet strangely subtle in sweetness.   I highly recommend this bakery for its goods, but you need to be patient with the service.

Crazy line even at 9:30am on a friday. However, don't be intimidated by it at all. They've got it down!! We only waited for about 10 minutes. I don't like sweet for breakfast, so I looked at the quiche options, and it was super!! I also enjoyed a latte from the full service coffee bar that serves Four Barrel. I'd go back later in the day for something sweet - like one of the beautiful cakes. Or the buns...something. Because, they got it figured out here. And I am sure the hearth breads are the best.

This review is based on four visits. Despite the roaring hype, I found the pastries here to be unsatisfactory.  The cakes, including the devil's food and tres leches, have textures that underwhelm; the devil's food cake was dense and dry, while the tres leches was too soggy.  The scones were disappointingly hard and parched; I was hoping for a more traditional refinement seen in European scones. Tartine shines, however, when it comes to their bread and perfectly textured and proofed croissants, which seem to trump even Bouchon.  Their baguettes have a perfect golden crust which easily breaks away to reveal a soft pillowy center.  The croissants here, though very large, remind me of my time in Paris: the crust flakes and the folded layers form a beautiful concentric pattern. The service here is no-nonsense: quick and efficient. Like most busy spots, you should know what you want when it is your turn to order.  Thus, I recommend browsing the showcase ahead of time.  Eat the pastries here if you must, but don't leave without taking home a couple loaves of bread.

Almost impossible to find parking around this neighborhood but don't you fret! This is how I do. Listen, I'm going to drop you off in front the Tartine! Stand in line while I look for parking and if you get to the register before I find my parking spot then get me 2 morning buns an eclair, two tea cakes and a banana cream tart. Absolutely amazing! It's butter in all shapes, sizes and textures. You want creamy? They'll give you creamy. You want flaky? They'll give you flakly. You want moist? You have moist. You want the best? Tartine is the best!

Totally unique bakery--love the atmosphere and decor...but my macaroon was not half as tasty as the Old Chinese Women at Eastern Bakery can throw down--and have been doing so without the glam for...oh...100 years. I'll try something else in the future and maybe it will amaze me, but for now...

I found heaven this past weekend at Tartine, a cute little neighborhood bakery and coffee shop in SF owned by a married baker couple (how romantic, I know). The shop is simple and small with a sort of French feel. There was also a really long line trailing out the door (reminded me of Golden Gate Bakery in SF Chinatown), so we had to wait a good half hour before ordering our food. But it was definitely well worth the wait! According to their website, the French word "tartine" refers to a piece of bread, any size or style, with something spread on it. Thus I was expecting some excellent baked goodies and desserts...and luckily, everything was orgasmically good. There were so many cakes and pastries and desserts that we had some trouble choosing our orders. And everything looked so pretty in the display case! After much debate, I decided on a lemon cream tart - a sweet pastry shell filled with rich lemon cream and topped with unsweetened cream ($5.50 for 4"). The lemon filling was nice and tart, but not too sour. And the cream was so smooth! I also liked how they put tiny pink flower petals on top of the cream. Points for presentation! Tartine is pretty famous for its bread pudding ($2.75/cup, $4.50/bowl). To be honest, this was the first time I had any kind of bread pudding, but it tasted great. A very generous bowl of homemade brioche, caramel, and fresh strawberries. But my favorite by far was the banana cream tart ($5.50 for 4") - a flaky pastry coated in dark chocolate and caramel and filled with pastry cream and bananas, topped with lightly sweetened cream, shaved chocolate, and powdered sugar. An absolutely perfect combination of textures, and the bananas and pastry offset some of the sweetness from the chocolate and cream. Mmmm. Of course, Tartine also has other great items besides pastries and desserts. All the sandwiches we tried were excellent. I ordered the croque monsieur (I was feeling very French that day) - an open faced sandwich with Tartine's great bread, topped with bechamel (some creamy white sauce), gruyere (a type of cheese), thyme, and pepper. I had mine with extra Cowgirl Creamery fromage blanc, but you can also get it with Niman Ranch ham or shiitake mushrooms on top. The resulting sandwich is very rich and filling, sort of pizza-like but with more bread. And finally, you can't really go to a coffee shop and not try the coffee. My latte was pretty good, although it could've been creamier. I liked how they served it in a small bowl, though. Very cute. Anyway, Tartine is definitely worth the drive and the wait if you're in the SF area! Freshly baked goods, gorgeous cakes and pastries, and fast, friendly service. Plus they use a lot of organic products in their baking. I want to try their croissants and pain au chocolat next time! (See accompanying photos!)

Pop Quiz. What's more annoying: 1. slightly overdone pastries 2. hopeless waitstaff 3. rude, NIMBY yuppies trying to take it over? if you answered 3, you are correct! (you'd get a free pastry, but the yuppies ate'em all). otherwise, it's nearly perfect.

When I come to SF, I have a strict don't eat at the same place twice policy.  There are so many great places, and new ones opening up every day.  However, Tartine is one place I can't live without.  Get there early on the weekend so you have plenty of delicious items to choose from (and so you don't have to wait forever in the line, although it is worth it).  Seating can also get tough so it's best to visit with only a good friend or two.   Now on to the reason why I can't live without this place.  Baked goods.  Everything I have tried has been delicious, but their bread pudding and croque monsieur stand out as some of the tastiest items I've ever had.  Their bread pudding with whatever seasonal fruit they have is so moist and flavorful and the croque monsieur is a nice savory contrast to the meal.  Giant lattes served in a white ceramic bowl adorned with foamy art make the perfect accompaniment for all their delicious treats.  It's hard not to be a glutton when I come here.

Tartine Bakery is one of those bakeries that make you feel like you're in one of those perfect towns from the movies. It just looks old school and everything around you makes you happy there. I had the lemon tart and the banana cream tart. Both were just absolutely delicious. Mouth watering. I'm craving them as I write right now. The lemon tart was perfectly tangy. Crust wasn't too thick or thin and it balanced the tanginess so well. Pricey for what you get though. It was about $6 or $6.50 for that. This is the one that did it for me. The amazing banana cream tart. It looked elegant and tasted even better. The whipped cream on top was light. Bananas were fresh and thick. Banana ream was flavorful. Crust was flaky. All normal for a banana cream pie right? This was different. It had caramel on the bottom of the crust and had a hardened layer of dark chocolate. That really amazed me. Foodgasm in my mouth. For the size, I think almost $7 is a bit high, but you're paying for the good ingredients. I'd love to come here again, but might have to wait till I generate more money in my wallet. This place is a must if you're in the area and want to drop some money for good pastries. Still need to try the morning bun and fresh loaf whenever I have the chance.

it's a fun, local bakery that has delicious bakery items, but the wait makes it very undesirable. in fact, since i live relatively close, i drive and ride by quite often. given the lines out the door at almost every point throughout the day keeps me from being a regular. perhaps they need a larger location?

1200+ Reviews for Tartine Bakery?!? My fat son took me and the family to Tartine. He knows his food, hence why he is fat. I really liked their Mexican Wedding Cookies (known to me as Russian Tea Cakes) and Lemon Bar.  The Opera Cake was good too with  hazelnut butter cream and dark chocolate.  We also tried their Bread Pudding and Black Forest Cake, which I thought were okay.

Four stars for the food. One star for the staff. Morning bun and frangipane croissant were good. Ham and sun-dried tomato quiche was different from other ones I've tried- the filling was light and velvety, though the crust was just okay. Attitude must be a requirement to work here. My bf and I got to the bakery 10 minutes before opening time, and there was already a line forming. One of the workers asked everyone to move against the wall, only to bark (seconds later) at the lovely couple in front of us to move out of the way because they were shifting chairs around... "obviously." It didn't stop there. I saw eyes being rolled and more snooty remarks directed at other customers.

I want to say that the disclaimer is that this place is pricey depending on what you order. Some sandwiches are $14 + tax and if you buy drinks, for two you are looking at almost a $40 tab. With a few pastries, you're now at $50 for lunch which is what I ended up spending. However, on the flip side, this place was good. I mean I can see why there is 2300+ reviews. The sandwiches are abundant and filling, the spicy turkey had special house-made pesto. HOMYGOSH house-made pesto love. The wait is a bit tedious, its hot inside on a warm day and there is crazyness with table sharing and community space but the numbers don't lie. I tried about half of their pastries and the walnut breads and banana breads are incredibly moist and flavorful. Just the perfect amount of sweet and savoring ingredients. I personally was a huge fan of their butter scone with currants but the bf thought it was a bit bland. I liked it because of its rich butteryness and how it was dry but moist unlike most scones which are just baked hard to flake off in crumbles. Parking here is epic. and I mean epic. But in the end, a worth while visit. Now where are my cheap eats!! haha

I'll be honest...when I heard about how long people typically line up for this place, I was skeptical. Luckily on the day I visited, the wait time was only about five minutes so I really had nothing to lose but another notch on the belt. While in line, I wanted to throw myself at some of the dishes that were being served to other customers - the open faced sandwiches are a work of art, the regular sandwiches look big enough to serve a party of three, and the bread pudding made me believe in the love between a man and his carbs. We ordered a slice of chocolate cake, their signature morning bun, and the gougère. What you need to know first is that everything tastes even better than it looks. What you think is going to be dry is beyond rich, and what looks rather plain is actually going to blow your mouth-mind. The cake was fine...I mean, chocolate is chocolate to me even though that's going to be blasphemy to some of you. The signature morning bun was incredibly dynamic with softer outer rings and a crunchy and feisty orange glaze in the center. If you're going to share this one, go for the middle right out of the gates. But the one that I'm going to have dreams about? That is hands down the gougère. Soft, moist and other words that become creepy when applied to anything but baked goods, this bun was packed with the flavours of glorious Gruyere, black pepper that means business, and thyme. Let's just say that had I not been sharing it with great friends, I would have run away to Vegas with it and gotten married at a drive-thru chapel. The crowd is really artsy and the feel is definitely reflected by the bakery itself. You bus your own table after you're done which is kind of cool, and it's lovely to see the really community they've built around indulgence.

Tartine is my own little bit of Paris in San Francisco. Stopped by on a romantic rainy afternoon.  Rain not only allows for inward reflection but transforms cafés into perfect little sanctuaries to pass the time. The banana cream pie ($6.50) was perfectly made.  The whipped cream was wispy, cloudlike, and delicate.  The pie contained actual fresh slices of bananas.  The shell was crispy and tantalizing.  As a whole, the dessert was only slightly sweet.  A much welcomed surprise for a society that oversugars everything - including life. You'll be sure to see me another rainy afternoon!

I saw this bakery listed with so many thousands of Yelp reviews, so I was immediately intrigued. Since we were already waiting so long to dine at Delfina, we picked up a few things here for future consumption. The smell was intoxicating from the box, but we had to wait until we drove back to the East Bay to start eating the pastries. Honestly, I didn't try much to make a valid judgment on the entire bakery as a whole. I'm not much of a baked goods kind of dude anyway. I'll wait in lines for pizza, but for pastries? Not so much. So when I tried the coconut tart, it was pretty darn tasty. The lemon bar was pretty good too. Heavy, but good. I was amazed at how massive these things were. At over $6 each, I suppose they better be massive. It was definitely enough to share with at least a couple people. If I were to finish off one for breakfast on an empty stomach, I'm not so sure how I would feel. All in all, a good tart for sure, and I wouldn't mind trying out some other stuff.

Apparently the trick to avoiding the mile-long lines at Tartine is to go in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday, as I did - no line at all for me!  Looking at all the scrumptious baked goods in their display case, the lemon bar caught my eye.  Good thing I gave into my urge for the lemon bar- it was damned delicious and made for an excellent dessert when I got back home.  It was not overly tart, not overly sweet, but a perfect balance between the two.  The smooth texture of the lemon filling combined with the lovely crust - aahhh, it was just the best. I also got a slice of the cake aux olives, which was like a savory bread pudding shaped into a loaf.  It had bread, gruyere cheese, smoked ham, white wine, and black olives - pretty much all my favorites.  Unfortunately, it wasn't quite as good as I imagined it would be.  The crust was a little too thick and slightly burned, while the loaf itself wasn't as savory as I would have thought it would be- I think a little extra herbs or salt would have done the trick.  Still, it made for a good snack.   There were many other things in the display case that made me want to indulge- double pain au chocolat,  morning buns, frangipane croissants, Scharffenberger chocolate brownies,  Paasion Fruit Lime Bavarian slices....the list goes on and on.  I could have just sit there and eaten one of everything.  All in all, a great bakery- I'm gonna be back for more!

"In that moment all the flowers in our garden...and the whole of Combray...,sprang into being, towns and gardens alike, from my cup of tea" Marcel Proust, In search of lost time. Proust's novel begins when the protagonist dips his Madeline in a cup of tea which suddenly restores his past and opens an unexplored region of experience through the interplay of sense and memory. I am walking past Guerrerro street on a cold winter morning couple of years ago when my attention is drawn by the huge lines sprouting from the corner of 18 th street. As I come nearer,  I am overwhelmed with a delicious smell of wholesome pastries. I stand in line and when my turn comes, I order a Morning Bun(laced with orange sugar), a chocolate pudding and a coffee. The place is totally packed and this is one Cafe in SF, where you see lot of babies with moms in tow. I dip my Morning Bun in my coffee and suddenly, like Proust's protagonist, I start thinking of my childhood and the happiness I felt as a pampered baby. I feel sucked in a vortex of love and warmth and bask in the glow of childhood innocence. Ever since then, I have returned again and again, to Tartine. All the items(excepting the yogurt parfait) is extremely good and their quality is consistent. They never try to outgrow their local roots. So if you are looking for a "feel good experience" which will temporarily transport you back in time to the magical kingdom of childhood, Tartine is your place to go in SF.

PORTION CONTROL: a weight-loss approach that works by specifying the amount, or portion size, of foods eaten in a day with the goal of eating a specific number of calories. (from the Weight Watchers site: http://www.weightwatcher…) Yeah, so, Tartine doesn't exactly have it. Portion control, I mean. I made myself sick, SICK, I tell you, last night from polishing off a "small" banana cream pie. It looks (at least to my super-sized, pump up the calories, breastfeeding eyes) deceptively like a single serving, but is SO rich that it clearly should be for 4 servings. I was in here the other day and bought the following, in honor of hubbie's b-day: 1) "small" chocolate hazelnut tart 2) "small" banana cream pie 3) ham & gruyere croissant thing for him 4) buttermilk scone thing for me The "small" pie type things (tart & pie) really did look like single servings when they were in the display next to the larger $27 versions of themselves. Hence my confusion in ordering two desserts for his b-day. Next year, it's one small thing, and that's it. I was shocked, SHOCKED, I tell you, to walk out of there paying only $17.50. What is WRONG with these people? They're giving away gold here, pure gold, I tell you. I'd heard so much about Tartine, I assumed it would have cost an arm, a leg and some back fat just to get a single desserty thing, but these prices are unbelievably pedestrian considering the quality of the food. If you're on a diet, do yourself a favor and just keep walking by.

I ate all the gold leaf on top and feel super rich now.

I went today to get many tarts and pastries but the two I am going to have to review are the 1) Banana creme tart 2) Fresh fruit tart. Fresh Fruit tart; 3 stars I thought the crust was good. Easy to eat but still crunchy. The creme went well with the crust, not too sweet and not too overwhelming but smooth and went down nice. However, for the price I paid for the tart, I was hoping to have sweeter fruits on it. It was sooo sour that it was hard to eat, even with the creme. I was a bit disappointed. Banana Creme Tart: 4 stars I can't say it's the best 'Banana creme' tart/pie I've ever had, but the extremely thin chocolate flakes that melted to your touch was amazing! The chocolate layer inside the tart evened out the sweetness of the banana and creme. I loved that! However, the crust was so hard it broke my plastic fork. I had to use real silverware and I literally had to stab at it to get it to break. After awhile I gave up, I threw it against the table and it was still in one piece. My brother however came by and ate it like a cookie after I had finished all the filling. If the crust hadn't been so hard, this would've been a 5 star. Overall I give the atmosphere, price, and quality of the good a 4 stars. I definitely would recommend my friends to come and try it at least once :)

I would consider moving to San Francisco if I could eat Tartine's croissants at least once a week. I hadn't been in at least a year and it was just as good as I remembered when I visited over the holidays. I'm in love with both the plain croissant and the pain au chocolat - they are so incredibly indulgent and large. I'm also a major fan of the gingerbread. So so good. It's like a crossbreed between a cake and a cookie. It breaks off easily and you can snack on it all day long. Not so much a fan of the 20 minute wait to get my hands on any of Tartine's delicious pastries but to me, it's totally worth it. I wish there was a bit more seating... It seems like once people stake their claim on a seat they don't seem to really care that there are other people waiting to sit down. Oh well. Walking around and eating your croissant, thereby getting crumbs all over your clothes is just as fun...

Tartine reminds me that a decent cappucino is hard to come by. The coffee they make here trumps the rest, by far. And if you get nothing else, for the love of God, people, DON'T PASS UP THE BREAD PUDDING! This bread pudding is SO good, it could beat Gavin Newsom in an election. It's campaign ads would go something like this: "Bread Pudding: Doesn't have sex with best friend's wife...Has never been accused of cocaine abuse...Is the most delicious bread pudding you'll ever put in your mouth/smear all over your face...Vote Bread Pudding for mayor of San Francisco." (This review was paid for by Friends of the Committee to Elect Bread Pudding.)

First off - the baked goods get 4 stars. I want to try everything. My first trip here was great. We came late in the afternoon, the place was pretty empty, and we shared some bread pudding. Dee-licious and pleasant. The second trip was not as wonderful. We came around lunchtime on a Sunday. Big mistake. You'd think the service and food would be better during peak operating hours, with high turnover rates of food, but that is not so. They're too busy to mind the details, and they get sloppy when the place is crowded. Plus, there is nowhere to sit, so you figure you'll just get the food to go. The to-go boxes are all the same size, at least in my experience that day. It doesn't matter whether you order a cup or a bowl of the bread pudding, they still put the same amount in the little box. You would get much more bread pudding if you just ordered the bowl and stood there to eat it. To make matters a tad more annoying, the girl who put the bread pudding in the box gave scraps and slop and remnants of the pudding, instead of breaking off an actual piece of the bread pudding. That is R-i-d-i-c-u-l-o-u-s. We don't stand in line and pay $5 for left-over slop. It just didn't taste good at all, and it felt like such a waste of money. On the up side, the chocolate croissant was tasty - flaky and sweet. I just hope the bread pudding debacle doesn't happen again. My friend was pissed. A bakery of this caliber should not be selling mediocre servings of their food. I will be back.

I visited last evening and there was no line. I got a slice of cake to go, since we were eating dinner elsewhere but I never get a shot at Tartine when it isn't busy. When I got to the register, I saw a total of $5.50. I handed dude $6 and stood there for at least a minute, expecting him to hand back change. He was gabbing to someone else behind the counter the whole time, making absolutely no eye contact with me, closed the register and just walked off. My friend couldn't even get his attention for a napkin. Now, I would have just thrown the .50 in the jar, but it's the principle. Isn't this a huge faux pas? Never withhold change. I thought: Is this a douchey, snotty cafe, thing? Is it an 'I'm tired and distracted, I've been here for 6 hours after 2 classes and have to ride home 20 blocks and I'm still hungover from the knockout last night and couldn't care less about you people right now,' thing? Could the tax have not rung up on the register but yet had not been included in the cake price? In that case, I'm the dumb shit, but I couldn't even check because I don't recall him actually telling me the total, and no, I wasn't given a receipt, either. As for the cake, it was okay. I got the lemon cream layer cake with coconut on top. The cake was moist and tender and the cream was fresh. The lemon was a bit much on the puckery end, and not flavorful or satisfying enough on the lemony end.

I am absolutely enamored with Tartine. I'd make it here every weekend if my grumpy boyfriend didn't refuse to wake up and come at the most opportune time: as early as possible. It is without wonder that there is a cascade of people at any hour of the day, on any given day. I don't know how they make their croissants so flaky and crispy on the outside, and their inside so soft, moist, and meaty, but their Pain au chocolate was the best I've ever consumed. The cappuccino and espresso I tasted were strong and went down smoothly. The lemon cream tart was like promised, AMAZING. And I'm not even a fan of biscotti, but I had a nibble of my sister's and it was pleasantly nutty and buttery, not like stale bread at all. I suppose there is well made biscotti out there. Tartine, I will be dreaming about you. I promise.

I've been wanting to go to Tartine since I came to Cal. Finally got a chance on a beautiful sunny day in SF. Took BART to 16th & Mission and walked a few blocks up. First impression: very hipster-y, the environment & crowd. First, they don't have a sign (really..?) but you know its Tartine from the line streaming down the block. Waited a good 20 minutes before I got my order taken. Their decor is very rustic & bread-oriented; pictures, portraits, sculptures made of and out of bread. Its a tiny and with not much space. Luckily there's a high table turnover so I managed to snag a seat at the communal table, which was really nice because I got to chat with some great people! The food: let's just say they know their bread and other gluten-based derivatives. Their display case is overflowing with HUGE cakes, pies, tarts, cookies, pastries, buns, etc. I ordered a sopressata, fontina & broccoli rabe pesto pressed sandwich, a morning bun, and a double pain au chocolat. I paid $20 for all of the above, which I thought was pretty pricey, but to be honest their portions were huge and I couldn't finish it all in one sitting. The flavors & textures were all there: the morning bun was flaky yet chewy with caramelized edges with a hint of orange zest. The sandwich was very rich: salty sopressata, nutty fontina, and bright & zesty pesto, but the thick sliced buttery bread was the star of the show, like it should be in a bakery. And what else can be said about the pain au chocolat that hasn't already been said? It was heaven. Bottom line: Really great bakery that lives up to all its hype, not really a place to linger, expect to wait in line if you go on the weekends.

For a place with little or no signage, it sure gets a lot of traffic. I suppose it's a prime example of the power of 'word-of-mouth.' Tartine is guaranteed to please with freshly baked goods and freshly squeezed oranges. Mid-morning is best in order to avoid the breakfast and lunch rushes, and tables are EXTREMELY limited, so grab it to-go. After my croissant, I told my dining partner I couldn't bother to try the bread pudding. But, I was wrong. I could bother. I did. And then I felt bothered when I had to continue sharing it with my friend. Next time, I'll get my own bread pudding.

I just can't stand the staff here, after working in the food industry for years I guess I never bought into rude = cool, inefficient = cool, indifferent = cool. While their pastries are tasty and an excellent treat (especially the morning buns) I just can't spend my money in a place that seems to have a goal of creating a line. I have never even had the guts to venture in there on the weekend but on the weekdays it would be so easy to get folks their stuff and get them on their way. but alas, this is not the tartine way.... a line must be created....boooo. The coffee is only so so as well.

There is a horrible quality in me when it comes to food: If i see a restaurant with a line out the door, the only thing that I can think about is joining that line asap. Why do we do this? Its easy to assume that because it has a line, that it MUST be worth waiting for... and so we join the line.... and then someone else comes along, sees the same thing and also joins the line. Simple mind games, but oh so effective. This is how Tartine works. Based on the 3000+ reviews, you can already tell its kind of a SF landmark, but.. is it worth the buzz? I say yes, but only partially. Don't get me wrong, the smell of butter and the size of the pastries make me end any diet in a heartbeat, but its not the end of the world if you don't get to come here, really. Unless you come here for the staff. Yes they are hot, everyone knows it. Damn you Tartine, your eye-candy strategy is freaking smart. Might as well look at something pretty while you wait in line, right? ;) After a long (but somewhat speedy line), we ordered the double pain au chocolat, spicy turkey sandwich, chai latte and cappuccino. The best item was definitely the pain au chocolate: giant, extremely flaky, warm and drowning in bittersweet chocolate filling. Oh calories, you taste soooo good. The spicy turkey (not actually spicy, btw) comes with turkey, provolone and broccoli rabe pesto on a toasted brioche bread. Helpful tip, tell them to switch the provolone cheese for GOAT and your sandwich will taste drastically tastier. The sandwich ($12)  is cut into 3 large pieces which is perfect to share (if you're not an overzealous eater like me) and it comes with 2 small carrots that have been marinating in a spicy vinegar. I know the carrots are just a garnish, but seriously, it was the best thing on that menu. Not a 5 star experience mostly due to the fact that we waited over 30mins for our sandwiches and that my chai latte lacked creaminess, spice and overall flavor. For the prices at that store, I don't think they should have the "bus your own table approach" but since they constantly have a line out the door, I don't think they care. Definitely worth coming, but stick to baked goods and pastries for a speedy and delicious trip that is worth your queuing time.

How wonderful is Tartine? So so wonderful that even the menu itself has a delicious, lyrical quality: Double pain au chocolat Pain au jambon Frangipane tart with seasonal fruit Bottomless FourBarrel coffee A steaming bowl of cafe au lait, another of muesli Fluffy brioche bread pudding with warm sugared peaches Perhaps it's hypocritical of me to excuse my distaste of glorified foreign menus (ie: it's not a haricot vert, it's a green bean) but in Tartine's case, it really isn't a chocolate croissant- it's a "pain au chocolat." It's not a ham & cheese croissant- it's a "pain au jambon." Thus ends my grail-like search for the best croissant outside France-- and I am no Francophile; the croissants were just that good. But so are the ones at Tartine. In fact, they're basically one and the same, except that Tartine's flaky, buttery, velvety-rich wonders are also quintessentially American... in that they're about as big as your face. (And you will appreciate this. And you will order extras.) So to avoid seeming like a fatass in front of the hoards of people waiting outside in line (as wafts of heady, bready fragrance waft torturously from the kitchen) bring a few friends with whom you can guiltlessly order extra pastries to share as you wolf down your first frisbee-sized pastry. :) Bottom Line: 14 hours after devouring my first Tartine pastry (and 2 hours after polishing off my leftover frangipane tart) I was back in Berkeley, seriously considering a drive back to SF so that I could park my car in front of the kitchen and wait 'til sunrise promised a new batch of freshly-baked croissants.

PROS:  Very tasty baked goods, delectable sandwiches, to-die-for mochas, beautiful interior with fun ambiance, clean bathroom, great location. CONS:  Long lines, long waits, expensive for a neighborhood bakery/cafe, and sometimes once you've finally gotten through the line, you find there's no place available to sit and eat what you've just paid for. Overall, though, I love this place, despite the cons.  I just wouldn't go there if I was in a hurry...or I'd do a drive-by and get my pastry and mocha to go!

Maybe my expectations for dessert places in SF are way too high, or maybe I shouldn't stuff my face with Mexican food from the Mission before I waddle over here, or maybe it's the five cavity fillings that prevent me from sinking my teeth into anything I want, but I expected deliciousness to the umpteenth degree at Tartine. After finding out this place was nominated for a few James Beard awards, I was really excited to see what this placed had to offer. It's definitely much smaller than Citizen Cake and is more of a Sunday brunch, coffee place than it is for specializing only in pastries; however, I did enjoy what they had to offer. I had the coconut cream tart, but I also got to try everything else from other people: the banana cream tart, lemon cream tart, lemon bar, brownie, and that fruit medley tart. They were pretty good, but was still missing that 'wow, this is the best pastry/dessert I've ever had' factor. Although I did appreciate their high standards for their pastries. I also got to try their shortcake; they ended up giving one piece for free to my friend who bought it because it didn't have enough powdered sugar on one side. Wow. That's my kind of bakery! But I was so stuffed from lunch, that I couldn't really enjoy my tart because by the end, I was so stuffed, I could barely finish the last bite. But I could probably say that it was the best coconut cream tart that I've ever had: crunchy crust with a layer of chocolate and also a surprise caramel filling inside. Edit: Oh I guess I also didn't try the best thing that they have here - the bread pudding. Stupid me; I guess that -1 star is for my stupidity and that I owe this place another chance to try their famous bread pudding.

Wow, did they raise their prices again?!  My friend spent nearly $50 on a variety of mini-tarts to surprise her family with, while I dropped $10 on three cheesy gougere rolls. Still worth it?  Probably, but Tartine is now officially an expensive treat in my book.  Though their gougeres really are just as good as ever.

Yah!  I'm a fan.  Ethereal croissants--- they are expensive but worth every cent.  I have not had anything at Tartine that was just okay--every morsel here has been flawless.  I love all the cookies--a lesser guilty option than everything else.  The chocolafied items are expensive in fact everything here is expensive.  But the quality and first bite remind you how it was worth it. I am still amazed when I go to Tartine -- even when it is slow it is slow--I was in line late yesterday--- only one person in front of me-- took me 10 minutes to get my croissant and pay.  The person in front of me was making or trying to make an art form of her order-- I thought she was ordering up a couple of Fabergé eggs, a Harry Winston diamond ring and a few Tiffany bangles instead she was ordering cookies.  It was a painfully long wait; I wish I could have helped myself.  The counter guy didn't help in fact was a contributor to this jewel-like selecting process for baked goods. I have tried going at all hours--first opening, a few minutes before closing, mid-afternoon.  There is no good time to go.  I end up going just a few times a year even though I live nearby.  Love Tartine but only rarely.

I"m sick and tired of how Tartine constantly overbakes/browns/burns their pastries and I'm registering my protest by downgrading them a star. If you come here, do not get any of the pastries unless it's a Morning Bun.  The croissants and gougere are always too brown. Stick to the sandwiches and the cakes.

What can I say that hasn't already been said about Tartine in the previous 1000+ reviews?   Brioche bread pudding was tasty, but I recommend the small bowl for two people or less.  We got the large and felt rather ill afterwards.   The Ham and Cheese quiche was definitely made with heavy cream.  The crust was a little over cooked, but that was okay for a salty pie thing. But the morning buns.  Oh yes.  We just happened to be in line at the time when the buns came RIGHT OUT OF THE OVEN.  It was all fluffy, sticky, chewy, and crunchy all in the right places.  For the morning bun alone does Tartine get 5 stars.   Their lattes weren't bad either.   The line was atrocious.  You feel like a jerk and a half for hovering over people and anxiously asking them when they're leaving and if you can have their seats.  It's not a very pleasant dining experience, but it might be worth it to get it to go and sit in the nearby Dolores Park on a sunny day!

For all the hype, I had extremely high expectations of Tartine.  It didn't exactly disappoint, but it didn't blow my mind either.  The line wasn't quite out the door when we went, but it was decently long.  Went by at a good pace, as it gave one ample time to salivate over the baked goods in the display as well as peruse the *one* menu floating around. I had to get the morning bun.  I wondered if it would be much different from the Starbucks one.  It looks about the same, but the orange zest does add quite a bit to the morning bun experience.  I wish it was slightly warm so it was softer, but morning buns are just fantastic in all ways.  Part croissant, part cinnamon roll...mm... my only issue with it is the top layer.  I found it to have a sugar crust, almost like a creme brulee.  It was like eating rock candy and having sugar crystals stuck in the crevices of your teeth, eating away at the enamel.  Boo...but other than that, tasty! Pain au jambon gets a thumbs up.  There's cheese in it, in case anyone wondered if it was just a piece of ham hidden inside a croissant.  Very filling though. Ham quiche is also a win.  The filling is super fluffy and savory.  Mm... Unlimited coffee refills.  Lattes served from perfectly French chocolate bowls.  :)   The cafeteria style seating leads to some awkwardness, but hey we're all made of the same stuff so let's just enjoy some delicious pastries together on a breezy winter's day!

Hot diggety, over 1800 reviews! I came here upon a weekend adventure up the bay area. Through friends, I quickly found out that this place was given high marks for a number its dishes and its listing by the San Franciscan 7 by 7 Magazine/Blog. This magazine recalled Tartine to be one of the 100 places to try before you die. So in that light, I had to try this place. It is a small corner shop with not too many seats and an occasional standing line. It was very clean, and dimly lit around sunset, so it provided for a very trendy audience. Parking may be a bit hard around this place, so I recommend taking the bus here. Two words - sesame loaf. The sesame loaf my friends, is to die for. I rarely make these type of statements, but this beats any La Brea bakery bread, on any given day. As a to-go customer I tried the sesame with brie and it turned out to be extremely flavorful. The smell taste of the sesame bread is extremely powerful, and did not let the brie take over my taste buds. While the outer shell of this bread is very hard, I recommend having it warmed up slightly, because the texture of the bread was far more agreeable. I plan to come back here on many occasions, given that I still have carb cravings and wish to try out their fancy-looking desserts.

This place stands for everything I support ... from organic to free range and local to cage free, they made my experience a pleasant one before I even walked in the door. We were lucky enough to find parking right away and when we walked in there were only about 4 people in front of us -- total score!  because when we left the line was out the door!  It only took about 5 minutes or so for the woman to get to us, and we ordered four different pastries: a regular croissant, a chocolate croissant, a fruit tart, and a morning bun.  My boyfriend and I split everything so that we could get a taste of a good amount they had to offer.  On top of the pastries we ordered their house coffee and a latte. Our total came to about $30 including tip, which yes ... would be considered pretty expensive with pastries, but you have to realize what you are really supporting when you purchase anything.  You really do get your money's worth here, it isn't just a name or a brand you are paying for -- which made every penny worth it. The croissants were what we dug into first while I was waiting on my latte.  Next the morning bun, and we saved the fruit tart for later.  Everything was absolutely amazing, crisp where it needed to be and moist where it was supposed to be.  I later received my latte and I didn't get a cute decoration like I wanted, but it tasted great.  Out of all the things we ordered I must say that my favorite was their original croissants, which is weird because I really don't like croissants ... but here -- I love croissants. Two days later we tried the fruit tart and it was absolutely amazing.  I can only imagine how it would've tasted if we tried it that day.  It was gone in minutes ... There are SO many more things to try at this bakery and am SO glad that it's actually pretty close to my boyfriend's house, about a 5 minute drive to be precise, and because of that I will look forward to my routine visits into town.

OMG. Yes! Drool... Another WIN from my fellow Yelpers. I totally trusted you guys and you did not fail me. So I was at home watching Cake Boss and Buddy got me hungry for pastries. I wanted something GOOD, like reeeally good. So I went on Yelp and found this place. I was further intrigued by the fact that it's 1/2 a block from where I grew up. I remember the area being completely shady back in the 80s, but MY how that's changed! It's totally posh now. The type of area where they have sidewalk cafes with chic SF-ers sipping on red wine. I wish I still lived there. I'd be so much cooler. But on to the important part - the yummies. O-M-G...the Passionfruit Lime Bavarian (topped with coconut) cake was something soo delish it can only be adequately expressed through a happy dance. I had to snag an Eclair, too, and a lemon creme tart. They were all little bundles of flaky heaven. I was super bummed they were out of Tres Leches, but it also gives me an excuse to go back. Yee! For all of you reading this - this place is a must try. In case you haven't figured that out already ;)

Alright, I MADE IT here FINALLY! Beat most of the line on a Friday morning luckily and ordered almost everything on the menu. Here's the break down: Banana cream pie: DELISH! Absolutely LOVED the huge chunks of bananas and banana cream with the lovely flaky pastry crust. Although, I could have done without whatever that hard stuff on the bottom inside of the puff was. Chocolate croissant: HUGE and Oozing with melted chocolate in a soft, warm and flaky crust. Coconut passion fruit Bavarian creme: LOVED the passion fruit filling and cake part but could have done without the coconut shavings (which kept getting stuck in my teeth and were kinda hard to chew) The crocet monserier: Delicious thick crusty bread but didn't like my shitaki toppings due to the stem still being attached and awfully difficult to chew. Also kinda pricey. Overall, the bakes goods (and bread I hear) are totally worth coming in for. My advice is pick a weekday morning to get a shorter line (though I don't believe you'll ever have NO line.) and split a few different things with a friend or significant other. I mean that! The portions are HUGE!! Overall, despite being $45 bucks broker, I'd swear I struck gold! ;)

Ham and cheese giant croissant o' love, why are you so bad for me but taste so so good??? This is one of those bakeries that just screams San Francisco the moment you step into it. The close knit quarters, the fresh smell of all of the baked goods, the hipster crowd waiting in line for what you know is the highest of quality and locality in all of the ingredients they serve. And for that you will spend a pretty penny here being local and eating at one of the more famous bakeries in the SF area. That ham and cheese croissant that literally will melt in your mouth costs $5. Definitely pricey for one pastry, even though it is a pretty large one. We also got their famous cinnamon swirl roll thing which was good, but as tasty as that ham and cheese item which I know was packed with butter, but hey that's what makes pastries taste so good in the first place, right? I just wish everything was a little bit cheaper here is all!

My dear friend who lives in SF brought me here because she knows I love good pastries.  She assured me the it was worth the wait outside in the rain.  Luckily, we had rain gear; plus, the rain helped scare away other people, making our wait shorter than usual for a Sunday morning. My friend got the morning bun, which was delicious.  I got a croissant, which may seem plain, but a good croissant is a rare and beautiful thing.  I also got a cappuccino.  The wait to get inside was long, and after we got our food the wait for cappuccino was even longer.   I don't think there is a time when this place isn't packed.  With the bad weather, folks were really jammed inside. Sitting at a table looked like a bad idea, with folks crammed in and being bumped by those of us standing over them waiting for our orders.  I would probably get my food to go (and not order a cappuccino or a food item that needs to be eaten while hot).  Find a nice bench nearby, or take it home to savor it in private. I'd say it was definitely worth the wait.  My croissant was buttery, flaky, and wonderful.  My cappuccino was quite good as well. The other pastries looked divine.  I can't wait to go back.

I love the Mission, and I love Tartine.  Where else can you find THE BEST banana cream tart on this earth, and watch random guys walking in with tutus and ballerina tights on?  Tartine in the Mission! Don't be intimidated by the line out their door.  It goes quickly and if it's a nice day, most people will take their pastries to go, so it's pretty easy to snag a seat inside.  I'd recommend coming in the late afternoon for a nice tea break.

The baked goods at Tartine definitely rate high, but I had to knock off a star for the super-obnoxious girl at the counter.  I found it really surprising because we had just been remarking how nice everyone is in SF restaurants as compared to NY, BUT Tartine made me feel like I was right back at home. So thanks for ALMOST ruining my perfect quiche and chocolate croissant, bitchy lady!  The quiche-- fresh vegetables suspended in fluffy egg.  The croissant-- moist, thick layers of flaky pastry surrounding an enormous, melty chunk of rich chocolate. I prefer more down to earth places, though.

Yeah, this shit is good but is the 'tude really necessary? I thought the cashier was going to spit in my face because I didn't leave a tip for my frangipane tart to go. I have to admit that I do appreciate the irony of seeing a queue full of yuppies like some bizzaro world cold war era bread line.

Tartine is simply delicious and unique.  I admire the simplicity of their system... You line up to order-  while you get a glance of all the yummy goodies people carry out before you, you salivate even more because the register where you order is all the way to the end of all the yummy pastries in their glass shelves. By the time you get to the front, your order meets you at the register, pay and EAT!   Everything they serve looks so mouth watering and the entire bakery smells like heaven.  I had a vegetable focaccia topped w/ asparagus and mushrooms-  if it had not been for the big serving, I would have definitely ordered something else.   The people are so laid back and friendly that despite being so busy, people did not seem to mind the long line and the elbow to elbow seating. I will definitely visit Tartine again!

Yum: * Morning Bun. * Banana Cream Pie. * Brioche Bread Pudding. * Croque Monsieur served as a tartine with spicy pickled carrots. Not worth it: * Quiche. Charred. * Croissants. Charred.

Definitely one of the best French style bakeries in town.   The only things holding it back from being even better is more space.... can get a little crowded due to its awesomeness.

Best breakfast pastry I've ever had. I love this place. I had the chocolate/croissant-like pastry, the veggie quiche and open-faced breakfast sandwich. Everything was wonderful including the cappuccino. This will definitely be a regular stop on all future SF visits. The space is a bit loud and chaotic, try to grab a seat outside if you can or walk over to Dolores Park to eat.

Don't turn around... the line is worth the wait! Tartine is one of my favorite places in San Francisco and I was lucky enough to live a J line ride away from it for a year. You can't go wrong here. Everything is so amazing that I always find it hard to choose. My absolute favorite thing is the ham and cheese croissant; the ham and cheese is baked inside of a super flaky and moist croissant. Next on my list of favorites would be their quiche and the croque monsieur. They also make amazing lattes and have fresh squeezed juices. Tables go quickly but If you are able to score an outside table do it. I always say that a nice day in SF is better than a gorgeous day anywhere else. Sitting outside of Tartine is the perfect place to experience that.

What an absolutely great bakery!  I had heard a lot of great stuff about this spot so I made sure to stop in on my last trip to SF.  My girlfriend and I rolled up around 9:30am for breakfast and the line was wrapped around one side of the building!  I told her we should just forget it and go somewhere else, but she insisted that we try it since we were there anyway.  I'm so glad we did because we had the most delicious meal : ) We shared a piece of the Ham Quiche, the Smoked Ham Croque Monsieur, and took a Gougere to-go.  Everything was delicious, even my Cappuccino.  I really wanted to try their famous Bread Pudding but we were just too stuffed to have anything else.  I'm a huge fan of Quiche and I have to be honest, theirs was just okay.  Everything else was outstanding though.  Definitely give the Croque Monsieur a try... next time I plan to have the Cowgirl Fromage Fort one! Four stars until I have the chance to sample more of their menu : ) ------ UPDATE: The Ham & Cheese Croissant and the Cake aux Olives are DELICIOUS!  I think the Bread Pudding was just so-so though.  Nothing to write home about.  And I'm a big fan of Bread Pudding.

Today was a big day for me.  I drove in the city... all the way from the Richmond to the Mission.  I know it seems silly, but this is big for me, I never drive... not that I can't, I just don't like to, it makes me nervous.  But the idea of delicious Tartine baked goods was too much for me to resist... This was my first time at Tartine.  The line was long but the 15 minute wait was well worth it.  Keep in mind that you will be overwhelmed.  Everything looks and smells soo good.  You might be tempted to buy Everything, but start slow.  I ended up getting a humungous Almond Croissant for now and a big Morning Bun for later.   Armed with croissants and cafe au laits, my friend and I walked over to Dolores Park and enjoyed our baked goods in the sunshine (I definitely recommend doing this).  My Almond Croissant was flakey, buttery and delicious as was my friends Chocolate Croissant.   I am already planning my next trip.  I think I will try the Gougere with gruyere cheese...and maybe another croissant....

Tartine falls into the category of "out of my league," which means the line is generally too long for me to wait.  Not that I have anything better to do, mind you, I just really hate standing in winding parallel configurations of humans. But one Monday afternoon, I found that there was a short enough line to step up my game and approach the "out of my league" restaurant.  There was so much build-up, I was almost scared to try it.  What if I was disappointed? What if all those days of dreaming were for naught? The little chocolate temptress behind the glass was giving me the eye.  The open-faced sandwich thingies were begging for my carress.  Scores of scones were aching for me to nibble their tips.  But I ended up settling with the bread pudding, which was like a pleasant blind date with a snack you would never, ever have sex with. I promise promise promise that I will visit agian, if only to update this review for all you hungry fans out there. ;)

The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly despite having to deal with some of the most banal specimens of humanity I've ever encountered. (And oh, can those staff members keep a good poker face!)   To be fair, it's possible that my hangover from a visit to Smuggler's Cove the night before had a part in my ardent loathing of Tartine patrons.  Maybe I just picked the worst day ever to stand in line, but I swear my IQ went down 15 points and I got 10x more superficial just standing there, lacking a mute button to use on the wanna-be hipsters in front of me.  But don't say I didn't warn you about the excruciating pain of the line.  If you ever feel inclined to write a piece of nonfiction inspired by Sartre's "No Exit" I suggest you set it here - hell is other people, the people surrounding you at Tartine. They were out of the chocolate croissant I wanted, but this gave me an excuse to eat a banana cream pie that was out of this world.  Oh, shaved chocolate, oh scrumptious cream, oh 1500 calories of flaky crust and real banana chunks - I would eat you all over again!  Add to this that they have baristas who will happily and quickly whip up a latte that actually tastes good, and you have a happy Emily - or you will, once I've finally managed to extricate myself from the sea of long-winded Tartine patrons.

Tartine Bakery is brought to you by Liz and Chad Robertson, a husband-and-wife team that named the bakery after the French term for a piece of bread on which something is spread.  It sounds so much better in French.  Tartine Bakery is one of those places that is perpetually busy.  There never seems to be a good time to go.  I even went on a Tuesday for lunch and had to wait in a long ass line to order.  Don't people work in this city??? Food:  4 stars.  The croque monsieur with ham is delicious and a must try for a first-time visit.  I also had a couple of bites of the lemon almond poundcake and bread pudding and was mesmerized by the awesome, sweet flavors.  The only disappointment was the chocolate hazelnut tart, which I only got because they didn't have the lemon cream tart available.  What I also found annoying was the fact that the website indicates you can purchase the passion fruit bavarian cake by the slice, but it was only available as a whole cake when I went.   Service:  3 stars.   This is one of those places where you don't expect anything in terms of service, but they did an admirable job.  The cashier was super friendly and helpful.   Atmosphere:  2 stars.  This is not a fun place to visit on a hot day.  The lines are generally long and you need to be patient and lucky to get a table (I am neither).  They really need to expand the bakery to a bigger space to accommodate all the demand.  Also, the crowd generally leans toward the ugly side.   Hits:   Croque monsieur, almond pound cake, bread pudding. Misses:  Lack of space, long lines to order, some items are not available by the slice or at all. If You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Citizen Cake, Noe Valley Bakery & Bread Co.

While waiting in line I was able to see the kitchen and the wonders it dispensed. The wait is not unpleasant when you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I bore witness to the Lemon Merangue cake.  I heard tales of its wonders as I reveled in the Frangipane tart. There is very little seating within so it is worth it to send a delegate from your party squat for a place to sit.  There is also a counter at which you may stand & dine. If you are lucky enough to find a place to sit please do remember it is your responsibility to bus it. No, you won't be wiping the tables or placing your wares into a neon plastic dumpster a 'la McD's but you will bring them to a rear counter. Upon my trek I noticed the wine selection. I was not surprised. Just think, breakfast, lunch and desert items. What better to round out their offerings than a wine selection?

If you're ever in line and don't know what to try, here's a list of what you should try if you haven't already: Frangipane Croissant: A must try if it's ever available when you're here. It usually sells out right after it's out of the oven, so get it whenever you can. By the way, don't be that guy that buys the whole rack and screws it up for everyone else in line behind you. Double Chocolate Tea Cake: It's like half brownie, half-spongecake. Or half sponge, half browniecake. Or half cake, half browniesponge. Either way, delicious! Lemon/Poppie Seed Tea Cake: Heavy like a pound cake, but moist. Not too lemony, and hints of almond paste. Surprisingly good, even if you don't normally eat tea/pound cakes. Almond Rochers: $0.75 each. Give one a shot. You're welcome in advance!

YUmmyyyyyyy =) Always satisfied when ordering from here, even if it's not something I've had before! I got the Mexican wedding cookies, the outer is like powdery but the inside is a shortbread type of cookie. Like it! I also got a Croque Monsieur (turkey one). It's like a french bread pizza but the toppings are like turkey and tomato and some spices (of course). I wanted to order some croissants and the banana cream pie (tart size) but they didn't have any, so that's on my list the next time I visit. The price is a little bit above what you would usually pay for in a bakery but it's well worth it. FYI : the line is usually out the door for this place, so be prepared to wait for your goodies =)

Nooooo, all of you who haven't been leaving the BEST RATING POSSIBLE -- its totally because you are not getting the right things!! For me personally, the best things I've had from Tartine are their frangipane croissants, the gougeres and the paninis. I've tried the bread pudding, a large assortment of cakes & tarts, quiches, cookies, etc. But really, what made me become a diehard Tartine fan was that goddamn frangipane croissant. I split one with my boyfriend & when he stepped away from it, I totally snuck a bite of his half and he got mad at me. That's how good this stuff is!!!!! & OMG, the gougere!! If you don't really have a sweet-tooth, get a gougere!!! It is heavenly and so moist and full of flavor. Everytime I come home to a gougere waiting on the counter for me, I die a little (mostly physically because of all the fat in the gougere, but also mentally because my boyfriend is so nice!). Yes, the staff is surly, but I've never been one to let some douche get in the way of me & my pastries. Tartine is the shit. & damn, I haven't even tried the morning buns yet.

Hey battuh battuh battuh.  Sch-wing battuh battuh battuh. Now that I've gotten that out of my system, I'll proceed to write this review. Every morn, the bakers at the ever-popular Tartine whip up fresh, delicious, and calorically dense pastries, breads, sandwiches, and oatmeal (my personal fave) in addition to drinks such as Scharffenberger hot chocolate--basically, anything you could want from full-service bakery/cafe. The only drawback to this place is the fact that if you choose to make a trip on Saturday or Sunday morning, you'll be forced to queue up for at least 20 mins.  If you're taking your food to go, it's not a huge ordeal, but if you plan on dining in, good luck because this is where your second dilemma begins--owing to the low diner turnover and number of tables.  In my opinion, it's not worth it because the the experience is nothing special--there is no harpist to serenade your brunch, no tinkle of an indoor fountain, and no white-gloved server to lift the bell jar off your pastry. On second thought, maybe I expect too much from dining out in general.

The banana cream tart is to die for!  Definitely worth waiting in line for, and the line moves fairly quickly.  We tried a bunch of other desserts, but the banana cream tart and the bread pudding were by far the two best.  I can't wait to come back to try the morning bun. It's a really cute place to sit and have a snack.  They have outdoor seating too.

This place ALWAYS has a line and you ALWAYS have to fight for a table, but you know what? It's ALWAYS good! Perhaps a little overprice and overhyped, but it's still my go-to place for Sunday brunch with my friends. I'm particularly a huge fan of the quiches that they make and the fresh fruit tart. The other other day I tried the chocolate banana cream tart and could have died and gone to heaven. The staff could stand to be a little friendlier though. They all appear to hate life. And everyone in existence.

A year ago I would have given Tartine 5 stars - no question.  But, I haven't been impressed these days.  Don't get me wrong, there are definitely some yummy things at Tartine - you just have to know which they are.  Not everything is as good as it looks.  Many items, like all of the cookies (except the Rochers) are dry.  Gougeres are dry too.  The pastry crust for all tarts are too thick and overwhelm the filling. Know what to order: croissant, sandwiches, bread pudding and Rochers (taste much better than they look) are the way to go. Also, don't expect service with a smile.  Servers are usually distracted and apathetic.  Just be glad if they get your order right.

As you might guess from my previous review, I don't go to Tartine. I can't support the mass delusion that seems rampant in SF that it's a "great" bakery. It's not ... it's just okay. That said, a co-worker brought in a box of Tartine pastries the other day. Here's the deal: - the croissants at safeway are actually more "parisianne" than tartine's, which was dense and greasy. Croissants are supposed to have almost no mass and a sweet crunch on the outside. Julia Child is rolling in her grave - the muffins at Starbucks are better than the bit of one that I had ... greasy was a theme on this day at tartine. My takeaway: Southpark was right ... people in San Francisco have their heads up their butts. Either that, or they have never been to France.

Yum-o-licious!  If you have a sweet tooth, ya better stay away.  If you like pastries, ya better stay away.  If you want a little something, something to satisfy that sugar craving then get your rear down to Tartine.  Paula Deen would probably fall in love given the amount of butter in the goodies AKA that is a good thing. In fact, let's make it contest to sample everyone of the yummies and then come back to rate each one.  That is a worthy effort and a super shop.  Get on down there....

This place is insane!  There was a constant line out the door and plenty of people fighting for tables.  I finally got to go here on one of my days off and lucky for me, I found parking up the street about 1.5 blocks away!  The line wasn't all the way down the block either, but at least to the perimeter of the store. I really like this place for it's vegetarian friendly options and pastries.  Everything looked delicious, especially the desserts.  However, I had to limit myself to what I was going to get because this bakery is not cheap!  A quiche is $4, sandwich ~$11-12, and desserts/pastries ~$4-7.  I got a tart, quiche, and pastrami sandwich, which totaled $23. YIKES.  It was delicious though!   Recommend: -Frangipane Tart    4"-$6.00      -Light almond-cream filling baked in a flaky pastry shell with seasonal fruit. -- doesn't look as exciting as the opera cake, but it was sooooooooooooooo delicious!!!  I would definitely try this out! - Pastrami sandwich - watch out for the horseradish... will definitely clear your nasal passages! The sandwiches take about 20 min wait... so in the meantime we had the pastry and quiche... Needless to say, I was stuffed by the time i got my sandwich!  I would have liked to try other desserts, but the line was too long, and I would have gone broke. Now that i've seen the hype of this place, I probably would only come back here if I was in the area and wanted a dessert or morning bun (which I still hve to try)

Follow your nose to this excellent little corner bakery! FAVES: 1. MORNING BUN!  Topped with orange flavor, this was my favorite out of all the treats we tried. 2. Almond croissant - just the right ratio of flaky to gooey sweetness. 3. Cafe latte - it comes in a soup bowl.  No joke!  The caffeine helped me run around San Francisco all afternoon! 4. Croque monsieur - rich, but a slice of cheese and sundried tomato heaven. NOT TOO SHABBY: 1. Pumpkin bread - I thought it was really dense and I like mine more like banana bread instead of pound cake texture, but it was spiced well. 2. Bread pudding with fruit - Fruit on top was fantastic.  It's more on the eggy/moist side, so if you like your bread putting soft, you'll love this.  I prefer more of the bready crustiness on top so it wasn't my favorite, but like the pumpkin bread, definitely more of a texture preference issue than taste.  I would still recommend trying it! GRIPES: 1. Be prepared to wait in line!  We got there before the mad rush apparently, but we still waited 10 min or so to get to the counter. 2. Small space inside.  As Laura B. says, you do feel bad vulturing over diners for a table, but there are really no other options if you want to get a place to sit.   3. They ran out of morning buns when the first half of us got there, so it's all about timing or you may miss out! That being said though...worth the wait if you love sweet breakfast foods!

As it turns out, the line moved fast enough that we had just decided what to order by the time our group reached the register.  The display of sweets was absolutely tantalizing.  In the end we went with a banana cream tart, a lemon tart, a brioche bread pudding, and a croissant. Everything was great.  The croissant was flaky and pulled apart in buttery layers.  The outside was pretty and brown.  The croissant was not at all sweet with almost a bitterness to it.  This was not my preference, but the texture was spot on and I'll bet it would've been magical with some chocolate or almonds.  The brioche bread pudding was very bready and moist without being soggy.  There was a good amount of baked apple and the whole pudding was infused with the taste of vanilla.  Neither the croissant nor the bread pudding were the best I've ever had, but they were pretty delicious. The lemon and banana tarts, on the other hand, were the best of their kind I've had anywhere.  The lemon was as screamingly tart as it could be without getting unpleasant, with a nice dollop of whipped cream on top to cut the sourness.  The texture was creamy and custardy, just, mmm.  And the banana?  Even better.  The tart was obscenely gooey with thin fast-melting ribbons of chocolate on top that imparted just a little bit of chocolatiness without overwhelming the other flavors.  There, that's my attempt at describing it.  It was inadequate, but I'm done. I gather that Tartine can be kind of a hassle, but it was easily worth ten times the distress.  The line was minimal and though the spacing was tight, we were able to get seated after a short wait.  I can see how this place has managed to retain such a high rating with so many reviews.    Everything was delicious and the tarts were just phenomenal.  If I lived nearby I would be horribly fat.

They may be known for their sandwiches but I was on a mission to try the morning bun. It's listed as #8 on the 100 Things to Eat or Drink in SF Before you Die by 7x7. The dough is tender for croissant dough and holds its twirl well. Its certainly helped along by a thick crust of superfine sugar with undertones of cinnamon, citrus, and more sugar. I yearned to try the bread (#25) but it doesn't make an appearance until 5.00 pm. Next time...

With a place as highly rated and hyped as Tartine, we decided we had to give it another try. We went back on a Sunday morning and unfortunately, it just confirmed my hunch that this place is wayyyy overrated. We waited patiently in line (and the rain) for 25 minutes. When we finally arrived at the counter we ordered their signature bread pudding ($6) - it was disgusting - we didn't even finish it. It was watery and soggy and did not even remotely resemble bread pudding. The pain au chocolate ($4.25) had barely any chocolate in it and it was also dark chocolate. I've had better pain au chocolates at airports (at a fraction of the price and wait). Finally, the scone ($3.25) was ok, nothing special, basically it was on par with Starbucks. Bottom line, there are too many great bakeries in SF to justify fighting for parking, waiting in line, and paying inflated prices for the mediocre pastries at Tartine.

Given that I only had a morning to spend in San Francisco before heading down for a drive down the coastal highway, I decided to make a quick trip to Tartine Bakery on the back of the review of its chocolate croissants on 'The Best Thing I Ever Ate'. As usual, parking was a pain to find in the Mission; I ended up having to park 15 minutes and one large hill away. Although it was late Saturday morning, the line didn't end up being as bad as I thought it might be - it was only about 15-20 minute wait or so before it was my turn to order. As luck had it, I scored the last double pain au chocolat, along with a regular croissant to snack on. No, they weren't kidding about how good the chocolate croissant is on TV. Most of the time, the chocolate is already solidified when I've had them from other places, but they manage to keep it warm and gooey inside. The bread is also much richer and more buttery than virtually any croissant I've had before. It's extremely flaky, so make sure to have napkins handy or you'll be making a mess everywhere. All in all, it was worth the trek (and the $4 or so the pain au chocolat cost) to have a very tasty midday treat. Seating will be an issue - there aren't many seats - so it's probably best to grab your food and go somewhere else to enjoy it. But I'll definitely make my way back down here in the future...with Bi-Rite right down the block, it's hard to find a better place to load up on sweets...

Usually I would pass on a place with a long line, but I have heard good things about Tartine. I got the Spicy Turkey sandwich. Get it. Great pesto flavor and good pieces of turkey. My boyfriend got the cheese sandwich (can't remember the name) which was also very flavorful and filling. However, I would like to point out the service was not great. While I ordered the two cashiers were talking shit about a previous customer, I felt this was very unprofessional and rude.Come on...have a little class.

I gave in to the tourist pressure and went to Tartine to try supposedly the best bakery in SF. Well I haven't tried all bakeries in SF but I have to say Tartine is at least in my top three. Last time there I had the Coconut Bavarian Cake and an excellently executed cappuccino. I'm always pleasantly surprised that their cakes are moist and with light icing/filling that's not overly sugary but rather a bit tart and well flavored. I will come back even if that means waiting in line for a bit.

Oh Tartine, why must you tempt me with your luscious tarts....your scrumptious crossiants....your delectable quiches....your heavenly pastries....your decadent cakes?! Thank goodness you're always so busy or I would be a fat little asian girl filled with the buttery goodness of Tartine. There's not much I can add to the 1000+ reviews of this place except to say that this is my favorite place for a quick breakfast. You should think of the long line as a benefit to you...because of that line, the pastries n such go so quickly that they are always making more. What does that mean? Well, that means you get a croissant that is STILL WARM when you get it...not because they heated it up or kept it warm for you...but it's THAT FRESH! So I'd recommend the croissants if you haven't guessed...they're some of the best I've ever had. I'd definitely give this place a try more than once. Experiment and try different things till you find something you love because there are so many options! They're open fairly late here, so you can attempt to come in, but don't expect any of the morning pastries to be available. I was utterly devastated the first time I came...because it was 6:00pm and me being a pastry-loving girl was faced with this horrible dilemma of having NO pastry options! NooOOooOoo! But, late in the day, they do have some cookies and tarts (My dilemma was solved by the hazelnut chocolate tart! and oh my taste buds...how they thanked me.) and cakes available. As Rachael Ray would say, YUM-O! Definitely give this place a try or two...or three...or every day. Mm wait, I take that back. The line is long enough as it is without YOU going :P

Standing in line outside was not so bad - par for the course for any unmarked small breakfast place within walking distance of Dolores Park.  But once I got inside, I started to develop an eye twitch.  And maybe a bit of a nose twitch. Too many shiny glazed things to look at. Too many salivary gland exciting smells. Too much.  Too too much. Nothing lives up to this kind of hype.  The croque monsieur was delicious with those shitake mushrooms and the three cheeses melting through the gaping crevices in the bread.  And yet...there was an emptiness to my fullness at the end, the tour de senses finally over, my meager stomach capacity incapable of trying everything and my patience unlikely to permit me to return. Ah well.

We went late on Friday evening - and there was thankfully no line. I really enjoyed the seasonal tart with lots of berries and shaved almond flakes.. it was fresh and had a good mix of sweet and tangy. And you may think the tart looks like a nice small regular tart for 5 bucks.. but when you actually eat it, you'll find out it's a secretly HUGE tart. Like a fat girl who hides her love handles very well. Nice and filling! The opera cake and cookies weren't bad either. But I'd go back for the slim looking fat tart, anytime.

As evidenced by the over 1000 yelp reviews, this place is popular. Don't let the line discourage you. Nor should you let the $12 sandwich steer you to a lower priced option. It'll be big enough to share. The slowness of the line appears to match the slowness of the patrons. If you wait in line, you will likely get a seat. I really wanted to love Tartine. It didn't turn out that way. The overly rich Spicy Turkey panini proved to be too much for my stomach. The bread must be buttered before they press it. There's no way the provolone could make it that greasy. The broccoli rabe pesto sounded intriguing, but was just OK. The much hyped spicy carrot pickle turned out to be limp. The side salad (extra $) had beautiful baby lettuce heads from Star Route farms (local !), but was overly dressed and almost inedible. Tartine gets stars because they are doing something special. The pastries look amazing.

I am a huge fan- I would love from them to make an outpost in Seattle. I entered the bakery line when it had reached outside, and found that the wait to order was very short. Having done research, and being on a mission to eat my way through The Mission, I ordered a lemon tart and almond croissant to-go. Right after I placed this order I saw the bread pudding and a few other options that made me vow to myself to come back on my next visit. The high ceiling-ed space and vibe also helped with my decision. My lemon tart was wonderfully flavored and a perfect sour sweet treat to eat at the park. The crust was thick and shortbread like. The tart came with a dollop of cream and a garnish- very pretty. The tart filling amount was perfect- any more would have been painful. The croissant was well made and the almond filling was not a glob of paste, but rather well spread out for flavoring and effect. The texture of the croissant was not the best I have had, but came close. I would order it again. FYI's~ * Many many seating options- outside, inside, communal, bench * Crowded with all types of people * Cash only espresso bar in back * They take your order when you are standing in line and you get it when you pay * Great postcards for sending home or to make friends jealous :) * Lots of black and white and drawn art * Wonderful service! My tart was misplaced so I got two!! * To-go items are placed in paper sacks or cardboard boxes- not great for long time travel

When my best friend Kate told me I HAD to try Tartine's banana cream pie because it was "the best banana cream pie in the world"...I was a little skeptical.  I'm sort of an expert when it comes to amazing banana cream pies, so when someone tells me about the greatest pie they've ever had I have to wonder just how great it really is.   The pictures of Tartine's desserts and baked goods really don't do them justice.  You can't get the sense of how moist yet flaky the pie crust is, or how perfectly the dark chocolate shell and layer of caramel combine to create the most delicious pie base everrrr.  If you haven't tried anything from Tartine yet, and like me, doubt it's deliciousness...just drive by there and the line winding around the corner will provide you with the evidence that yes, Tartine IS that friggin' good. My favorites are the banana cream pie (duh) and the coconut cream pie.  It's better to come earlier in the day because it's likely that they'll sell out near closing time. Some not-so-amazing things about Tartine: 1. the wait can sometimes be horrendously long, but when there's an out-of-this-world banana cream pie waiting at the end of it all is forgiven.  2.  there's only ONE bathroom and for some reason the people that frequent Tartine seem to take a long time in there.  3. it can get REALLY, REALLY hot inside the bakery which is okay during winter months, but almost unbearable during summer.

Heaven. I believe the coconut cream tart at Tartine is what Heaven is made of. It's just not fair. Not fair that I have to travel to the West Coast to find absolute perfection in a dessert. I came to Tartine right when I got to San Francisco- and it was one of the best travel  foodie decision I've made in that city thus far. A small, corner bakery offering crispy, flavorgasmic paninis and crumbly, decadent breads, puddings and desserts, I feasted my eyes on the tarts, and, being the coconut loving lush that I am, ordered my dessert with the same dreamy-eyed expression  most 12 year old girls get for Justin Bieber. The Tart came to me like a gift, this perfect crust holding together coconut, cream,  with dark chocolate and coconut shaving smothering the top. When I dipped my spoon  in to cut through the tart, I noticed the whirls of dulce de leche and more coconut weaving through the cream. I almost slapped the tart right then and there, what right did it have to be so damn good? I had every intent of sharing this with my aunt, claiming it was "way too much" for me- yet somehow, the spoonfuls of Heaven on Earth kept finding their way into my mouth. We also ordered a prosciutto and brie panini that was absolutely delicious. If I hadnt been so focused on the tart, I wouldve enjoyed it more. Please, Tartine, come to Miami.

Ohoho Tartine you are two blocks away from me, and I've been looking over the Tartine cookbook for some time now, and they are finally doing some of their seasonal stuff. I finally went in on a day when they had the Tres Leches cake available. Just go get it. You'll thank me later. Seasonal bread pudding is always something to look forward to. THEY HAVE CRANBERRIES AND PEARS IN IT RIGHT NOW! Living near Tartine kind of spoils me.

I'm seriously mad at anyone who gives this place anything less than the five stars it very clearly deserves (just kidding, but mostly serious). But I mean, come on... HAVE YOU SEEN THE PICTURES OF THE CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS?!  HAVE YOU TASTED THE MORNING BUN?! (*insert lewd and corny joke about morning buns*) I came here with my friend on a thursday morning at 9am, and there was already a line out the door.  We smelled the rich aroma of freshly baked buttery sugary pastries from a block away, and walked towards tartine with our noses leading the way.   We split a chocolate croissant and a morning bun (kind of like a mix between a cinnamon roll and a donut), both of which had just come out of the oven.  The outsides were crispy, flaky, sugary, delicioius, and the insides were creamy and flaky at the same time (i mean, how is that even possible??).   We looked so ecstatic that the people next to us offered to take a picture of us with the pastries.  The two girls who were ahead of us in line got two pastries EACH.  I salute them.   One more thing that's awesome about this place, all of the bread art!

"Spare a quarter" you ask people as you pretend to be a robot, that for some reason only moves its torso and arms in piston-like motions, while making strange sounds through its mouth, never really using its robotic legs to walk anywhere. "SPA-ARE A QUAR-TER". "Daddy, why is that robot orange?" a little girl will ask as she and her dad walk past you on the corner of Powell and Geary. "Sometimes robots are goddamn orange!" he will yell. "Shit, am I a goddamn robot! Why the hell would I know!' he will continue. He drinks a lot. You hear her question, and want to explain to her that the orange paint was on sale this week at Home Depot, and that the Ralph Lauren 'Sparkling Silver' you had been covering every exposed crevice of your body with for the past few weeks was raising your Operating Expenses so high that you were no longer turning a Net Profit, but you didn't, and instead, in a very loud and frustrated robotic voice you say"BIT-CH GIVE ME A QUAR-TER DDDDVVVUU DUUUUU". You try to shake it off, telling yourself that orange robots are actually, actually probably, more realistic visions of the future than anything else. "Who will be able to afford that goddamn silver paint?" you'll ask yourself, as you contemplate the widening gap of wealth and poverty in the country. After everything, however, you will take your hard earned quarters and head to Tartine, where you will buy as many as those goddamn delicious Mexican Wedding Cake Cookies at a quarter each as you can. [Editors Note- At the time of this writing, the Author only knows the small white powder coated crunching balls that cost a quarter each as Mexican Wedding Cake Cookies. Let it be known that the Author has never been to a Mexican Wedding, nor plans to ever attend one, as Mexicans are known for drinking dangerous amounts of alcohol as a pretext to smashing the shit out of a stuffed animal or something of the sort, a Pinata, as he hears it called, and this terrifies the Author).

Uhhh, how come I never knew about Tartine's Croque Monsieur??? That thing is so delicious that if I didn't have a follow-up pastry waiting for me, I would've ordered another 5 more. Or 10. What're a Croque Monsieur? According to Tartine it's an.. Open face sandwich made with their country bread, bechamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper. Topped with either smoked Niman Ranch ham, Cowgirl Creamery fromage blanc, or shitake mushrooms and seasonal vegetables. *sigh* I need to get my hands on another one soon!

A pretty solid bakery with a lot of hype. If you're willing to wait in line and order the right thing, you will probably think it's worth it in the end. PROS: + Great bread on the sandwiches. + Lots of different desserts to try. CONS: - Ridiculously long lines that go out the door. They tend to move pretty fast, but it can still be quite long. - A bit pricey. NEUTRAL: - Given the number of people that eat here, it's difficult to rate the service because you are generally serving yourself (bus your own table, get your own water and utensils). FOOD: + Banana Cream Tart: I ordered this based on the Yelp! reviews and must say that while it was overall good (fresh banana, very nice cream texture and flavor), it wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. The crust of the tart was very crisp and required me to use a knife at full force just to cut through it. I was hoping for a flakier and softer crust that I could easily eat. To be fair, I may have come at an off time of day. + Pastrami sandwich with horseradish and gruyere cheese: this was a great sandwich. The bread was fantastic, though my friend claimed it cut the roof of her mouth (I had no issues). My only complaint is that there was an overabundance of horseradish that overpowered certain bites. If you're a fan of spicy horseradish, then this is the sandwich for you. = I really want to try the Chocolate Souffle Cake the next time I come here.

Tartine was the best thing to happen to Mill Valley in years, but after the price of running their ovens went up during the California energy crises they moved to San Francisco.  Our once local secret now has a huge line running out the door, and for good reason.  Their food is simply amazing!  I have yet to find something on the menu I didn't love.  Their cafe mochas are truly a cup of perfection.   The place is small and super popular.  Most of the time you'll have to wait in a line.  If you go, leave yourself a bit more time than trying to double park and run in. If I'm ever in the neighborhood I try and pick up something, plus an few almond croissants for my family in Mill Valley.  Speaking of family, I bought my parents Tartine's cookbook for Christmas.  They loved it!  Not only does it have recipes for all Tartine's great food, it has in depth conversations about how to really bake it correctly.   Mind you it's a whole lot of work, but you really can learn how to bake like a master.  Leave it to San Francisco's best bakery to write such a good book as well.

Another one of yelper's favorite eateries, and with good reason. This place is magical. All the pastries are scrumptious, the croque monsieur piquant and the coffee delicious. I personally come here for the banana cream tart.  It is a gratifying banana cream pudding(?) on a crunchy pastry shell that has a light layer of chocolate lining the bottom. My gf comes for the lemon tart, which she claims is the best dessert she has ever tasted despite not liking lemon tarts anywhere else. Finally, the croque monsieur is one of the best things you will ever taste in your life. There are often long lines, but the food is worth the wait. Also, kudos for having biodegradable disposable silverware.

What is not to love about Tartine? Oh, I know what.  The long line that snakes outside on a beautiful day in Mission-Dolores! Aside from that, I ADORE this establishment. From the homey goodness that is the bread pudding.  A generous heap of challah bread soaked in a slightly sweet eggy-custard and studded with seasonal fruit. To the beautifully flaky croissants in all their powdered sugar glory. To the decandent open-faced croque monsieur, a humble slice of bread topped with saucy bechamel, melty gruyere and a slab of niman ranch ham, with piquant marinated vegetables on the side. oh how i love you, coconut cream tart and banana cream tart.  i dream of your fluffy pastry cream, calorie-laden goodness.   i gain pounds just thinking of you. and my newest love.  morning bun.  flaky croissant layers bound together by a surprisingly good, orange glaze and bespeckled with cinnamon and granules of sugar. thank goodness you are located far from me.  i would otherwise weigh a ton.  but i fantasize about you frequently.

Wow am I glad I missed the train on Saturday morning.  I was supposed to be on my way to San Jose International, but my efforts were thwarted by persistant red lights.  Thank you City of SF!  Had I gotten there on time, I would've never experienced Tartine. If I were to make a list of "Best Things I've Ever Eaten,"  the pain au jambon would be on it.  Croissants don't generally excite me, and I don't like gruyere, but it was early and I was hungry so I gave it a try.  It was pure bliss, seriously.  Delicious.  Amazing.  Wonderful. ...You get the idea.

It's Saturday morning and we're up for breakfast early. The bread pudding is on my mind at Tartine. Once inside we can't wait to order just about one of everything, the smells coming out of the kitchen are making my mouth water. We begin by ordering two bread puddings covered in fresh cooked apples, chocolate croissant, almond croissant, scone, savory warm puffy bread with cheese, toasted bread covered with mushrooms, cheese, tomato. Everything from the baked goods to the soy cappuccino's were spectacular. I'm looking forward to my next trip to SF for another round of the best baked goods I've ever had.

I called one of my good friends JK and I told her about a dream I had. In the dream JK said "when you have a morning bun you have to make a wish before you eat it". So she secretly planned a SF tour for me. This was one of the stops. All I can say was that dreams do come true we split the morning bun and made a wish...

Tartine, I hate that I love you, despite the fact that some snotty male employee practically bit my head off when I asked if you were still open.  I just wanted to LOOK.  Can I just get a PEEK at your sweet and savory offerings that have a Pavlovian effect on my taste buds at the mere mention of your name???  The French attitude is as authentic as your French baked goods...oui, goes with the territory, I guess! The coconut creme tart, croissant, and croque monsieur (especially with the pickled carrot) makes you think you're at a cafe by the Seine.  SF is definitely overrated in terms of food, but you bring me hope.

Over 1200 reviews and a rating of 4 and a half stars - that should speak for itself.  I give Tartine 5 stars because, quite simply, I've never before had such out-of-body experiences from any other bakery.  And I come all the way from North Beach, land of bakeries galore, to enjoy Tartine when I need to escape the congestion of North Beach. It's fun to sit outside with a pastry and coffee or glass of wine.  Some suggestions are the banana tart, chocolate mousse, shortbread, and brownies.  I especially like the bread - so delicious that my family in Texas insisted I bring home 2 loaves for Thanksgiving. The LOOOONG lines are worth the wait.

My brother suggested we go to Tartine after dinner for some proper dessert.  There was a small line which we made it through but it was just constant throughout the night.  The place was packed so there was some hovering about.  We managed to score the small wooden ledge by the front window. Lemon Bar - the perfect balance of sweet and tart is what I look for in a lemon bar and Tartine delivered.  I couldn't get enough as everyone wanted a piece.  The winner of the night. Devil's Food Cake - moist cake with velvety layers of ganache.  The only thing I was missing was a tall glass of ice cold milk. Lemon Almond Pound Cake - another great cake especially with the touch of lemon.  This one is good but the other two are a step ahead. After taking a look at the other reviews I feel I need a return visit to try the breakfast pastries and maybe a sandwich to give this place a full review.  4 stars for now.

It was pretty raining yet there was a line outside the door and people were standing there exposed to the wetness. Must be a good bakery then right?... Line moves pretty quickly and a gal from behind the counter asks me for my order. I started with the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie then she disappears in the back. Um...hello? Another gal asks me if I've been helped and I told her yes but I don't know where she went. So I'm reading off my order and the lady was looking irritated that I kept rambling off my orders to her. For one, it's not my fault you can't hear because I'm speaking pretty loud and two, ask me if I'm done ordering before walking away! I wait until you're done taking out what I want from the case and then giving you the next order so it's not like I'm saying it all at once. Anyways, they ran out of eclairs--super bummer. The croissant was the best croissants I've had. Big, flaky on the outside and fluffy on the outside. Just buttered exactly the way I like it. The ham and cheese quiche was a bit disappointing. Not as flavorful as I expected and I think the ones from Costco are better... The lemon cream tart was pretty decent. Tarty but nothing I'm craving. The morning bun was very sticky and I should have eaten it right away. Instead I waiting until the next day, microwaved it and it was ruined.... Customer service--minus 1 star. Hoping it was just a busy day and the rain has got them all moody. I'll give it another try in the future but right now, there's nothing I'm craving from that place but the croissants. I think it's just the hype that made me want to check it out. Maybe if they had some eclairs my review would have been different.

I'm glad I live walking distance but not too close to Tartine or I would be broke and 50 pounds heavier. This is my favorite bakery in the city. I first discovered this place when dining at Delfina and my friend gleefully announced that we were eating Tartine bread. So of course I had to try it. Their croissants and pain au jambon are great, as are their cookies, especially the deliciously buttery shortbread. They wont slice their ginormous loaves of bread so I split it with my friend and still gorged on it for a week. The country bread loaf is probably the best bread I've ever had. period. I always go during off hours but one day I braved the lines for a weekend brunch. My rooommate loves their morning buns and pressed sandwiches. I think they are good but really I could just gorge on the plain bread and be happy. Not EVERY item is a hit but most of it is amazing. *Update: Uh oh a rave review in the Times? I fear for the fate of my favorite bakery.

Ok I have to upgrade tartine to four stars. On his last visit up here my boyfriend and I decided to stop by tartine after some shopping. There was no line (it was 6pm), and the staff was very helpful. What really bumped up the rating was the coconut tart and my inability to leave without buying at least three other items for us to try. Once again I had to get the cake aux olives, we also got some incredible cookies. The only draw back was the price. I guess for how yummy it was it really merits five stars, but I'm stubborn, and know that next time I'm there during the day I'll bitch about the line! What a brat! Last Sunday I went on my own little tour (with four friends) of local bakeries and had a wonderful time! We tried Arizmendi, Boulantgerie, Delessio, and Tartine. Tartine was our last stop (thank god). We got there around 2:30 pm and there was a pretty good size line. I waited for about 15 minutes and made some very helpful friends! With the help of my newly found "tartine professionals" I ordered a chocolate croissant, a morning bun, a fruit tart, and the cake aux olives. After all my sweets the cake aux olives was wonderful. It was almost like a custard(ie) texture with bits of ham, olive, throughout. The crust somehow managed to still be flaky and buttery, the combination was sinful! The morning bun was awesome! It was flaky and buttery and covered in sugar. It was so light and yet obviously rich. We all enjoyed it thoroughly although the lingering aftertaste of butter was a slight turn off. The tart was nice. The crust around it was also a winner The croissant was weak compared to the previous bakeries. At the end of the day between the long line, the rude and unhelpful staff (thank god for my friend in line), the inadequate seating, and the higher (not high) price, Tartine is a great place to stop in and get something to go if your in the neighborhood, but not a place I would go out of my way to visit for comfy weekend treat. If you have the time and the money though it won't leave you disappointed.

YUM!  This place rocks- I am still giving it 5 stars even though it is s l o w service, and sometimes you might not be able to sit down and munch on the deliciousness right when you want to- however, the croissants and bread pudding rule the earth- everything I have ever had here is scrumptious.  Not a good place to go if you are counting carbs, but what bakery is, really?  My eyes are much bigger than my stomach here, oh wait, that seems to be a pervasive issue at many food establishments that I like..oh well.. yum, yum, yum...

As others have mentioned, there is barely any recognizable signage on this small corner bakery on Guerrero St, but you really can't miss it. The fresh smells of butter and sugar waft through the air, and the line at the door tells you, you're there. I came early in the morning for breakfast and did not want to miss out on these morning buns I've heard everyone raving about.  At 10 AM, they were already sold out of bread, and there was a sign posted on the window "Sold out of bread for the day."  What kind of bread is this that they sell out of within 2 hrs of opening!?   I waited patiently in the line that starts at the door, and in less than 12mins was at the front.  As I passed the glass displays of desserts, you're overwhelmed with all the pastries and delicious goodies, you just want to order one of everything.  Waiting in front of these displays makes it hard to chose just a few items.  It's to their advantage I suppose. I made up my decision for 2 morning buns and a large croissant with some kind of almond cream filling.  The morning buns were everything I hoped for and so perfectly delicious with it's crispy flaky crust and soft interior.  It reminded me of a Cinnabon, but made from heaven because it was so light and perfect.  I also got a cup of coffee and chamomile tea.  They gave me a cup and you help yourself at the coffee bar (which you have to cut the line to get to).  I liked the fact they have simple syrup.  My chamomile tea was made by the Barista who took it out of a large tin can and put it into a tea bag.  It was so good, must be a special blend.  After receiving both cups and 3 plates of food, I had to go outside and search for my BF who was holding down a table.  Thankfully it was a nice day outside, despite what the forecast predicted.   When I bussed my own table*, I asked for a bag to take the half croissant we couldn't finish.  The girl at the register pointed me to the bins in the back to place the dirty dishes in.  I was a bit taken aback that she didn't take the dishes.  As I waited in line a 2nd time to purchase some more morning buns and a Pain au jambon to go, I noticed something peculiar about these girls.   The girls were very pretty.  Maybe their aspiring models or actresses, I don't know but they were very pretty, not cute, and not hot, but pretty.  So if everyone is commenting about their rudeness, lack of attentiveness, or service, perhaps it's because they aren't waitresses.  Perhaps they have poor customer service skills, but who cares cuz they're servin up heaven on a plate every day.   My items to go were consumed the next morning, and the morning after I returned to NYC.  The orange scented sugar made it a sweet memory.  I'll return next time, and maybe for some desserts. *There is a sign in the bakery that says "Thanks for helping us bus our tables"

My diet is ruined. My only consolation is that I ran all the way there and (hobbled) back.  (Note to self:  must get new running shoes.)  But despite the broken shoes and ruined diet, I keep coming back to this abusive relationship.  Tartine beats me down with its amazingness, and, in my masochistic ways, keep coming back for more. The croissants, the frangipane croissants (like the regular ones, except with a delicious almond paste inside, chopped almonds on top, and sprinkled with powdered sugar . . . GOOD LORD, I am salivating right now), and the afternoon breads that are OH so crisp on the outside and OHH so soft and fluffy on the inside (I make sandwiches with the bread-- see here: http://pineapplebread.wo…).  The cookies, pies, and bread pudding.   I need to restart my diet. Tomorrow.

Sunday morning breakfast with Aimee J. Arrived 5 minutes before they opened at 9am. The line was already down the block! On a Sunday! Once they opened though, it took a little less than 10 minutes to arrive at our destination of glory: baked goodie heaven. The morning bun and quiche are good, and the bread pudding was nice just as I remembered it, too..but the true all-star this time around was the: Almond Croissant: OMG. SO FLAKY GOOD. Don't bother pulling it apart or cutting it...just sink your teeth into the *CRUNCH*...Mmmm...*drool* And the almond paste inside? So smooth, almond-y, and not too sweet. This + a Chai Latter (served in a huge bowl) was excellently filling. This place alone makes me want to move to the Mission...

I don't understand why this place has 4.5 stars but maybe I tried the wrong things here. The place literally has no sign outside but I guess they're so popular, they really don't need it. I feel like this is a place to be seen and drink coffee and live the Mission lifestyle and perhaps that's why it's getting such high ratings. We ordered the brioche bread pudding as it was highly recommended, the banana cream pie, tres leche cake and an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. All together, 4 pastries came out to about $18 which seemed a little high but I told myself it was worth it for finally getting to eat a Tartine Bakery treat but now I'm gonna hold myself back from now on because I've learned. The bread pudding was bland and could have a little more cinnamon or sauce. The fruit was not fresh and beyond smushy when I got it home and was quite the disappointment. The banana cream pie, while looking impressive and having a giant piece of chocolate shaving on top, wasn't sweet and had an unusual tasting crust that had the consistency of Filo pastry. The cookie was burned and crispier than I was comfortable with and 4 days later, the cookie and tres leche cake are gonna get put to use in the compost. I hate wasting food but I couldn't bare to finish either attempts at good pastries. A word of warning also if you want to try this for yourself: the lines are ridiculously long and they take their sweet time packaging your order and in my case, can't remember what you ordered. Also, the parking is non-existent and there's no seating available because as I said before, everyone's got coffee in front of them. Maybe it's the coffee that brings everyone back then? Also, if they can raise their prices couldn't they could stand to turn on a light bulb now and then?

Came here for some after lunch dessert; unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. It was 3 in the afternoon and the morning bun already tasted "old." It wasn't soft nor flakey. In fact, it was difficult to cut with a fork. The bread pudding was also something that left me wanting more. It wasn't warm at all and the tartness of the cranberries overpowered the bread/pudding part. I haven't tried any of their other desserts yet, but maybe I'll return to give it another go.

This was a great place to grab some lunch on my recent trip to the area.  I had an awesome ham-n-cheese experience for lunch, and had enough room for the a cherry/chocolate bread pudding for dessert.  The sandwich was better than the bread pudding, but I'm a bread pudding snob.   So yeah, I went for more of the cafe experience versus the straight Bakery deal.  I got yummy food and a great weekday lunch was had by me here.  Of course I too encountered a pretty crowded place with far too limited seating and customers buzzing around everywhere.  It didn't really bother me, since I was on vacation from out of town, but it seems like they might want to focus on baked goods more or risk frustrating their regular customers out of wanting to bother waiting for either their baked or cafe/sandwich/dine-in foods.  Or maybe it's THAT good?  I personally can't say.

Love this place... One of the reason I would go back to San Fransisco Last time I was here I had the Banana Cream Tart and an Eclair. My husband had the hot chocolate. He still thinks it's the best hot chocolate he ever had. Everything was so rich, creamy, and for lack of a better word yummy. I love desserts and I can seriously say this is in my top 5 easily. I love this place because the desserts and pastries are just perfect, not over the top with sugar and sweetness, or lite on the butter and richness. This place smells amazing. You can't help but want to get everything here. If I lived around the corner here I would be sooo fat..haha Next time I'm back I'm trying the Chocolate Souffle Cake, Croissant (because I love croissants), and a lemon meringue or raspberry tart. Only downsides - Parking is horrible (but isn't it everywhere in SF?) Service is a bit slow (can you blame them, they are so popular)

Conversation with the girl last night (approximately) : her:  so i hear there's this really good bakery just a few blocks from your place me:  you mean tartine?  yeah, its just down the street. her:  so why is it that we haven't gone yet? me:  uhhhhh... and so it is i made my first visit to magical, fabled tartine this morning.  at 8:30 am on a cold crisp friday morning, the lines were palatable, although i hear horror stories about waiting for an hour.  also, you have to time things just right, we ended up showing up 15 minutes too early for the stuff we actually wanted. but oh heaven is the food excellent.  the croissants were still warm and melted in your mouth.  the double chocolate inside of them was still melted, but oh so beautiful.   and the banana creme pie i brought into work this morning should keep me popular around the office, even if it doesn't help my review. plus, more importantly, i gots big smiley eyes from the girl. note to self, when in trouble, forget flowers, bring tartine.

To tell you the truth, I wasn't as impressed with the bakery as I was with Bar Tartine.  The line is just darn too long and the communal table is just not as good as Le Pain Quotidien.   Having said that, the bread here is great as are the lattes that come in huge bowls (too big of a bowl?  Maybe, but I like it that way).  The shortbread cookie had that buttery and slightly "cool" aftertaste you would expect in a very well made shortbread.  I wasn't impressed with their croissants though, since it is too dense and doesn't really portray the "layered" testure of a good croissant. I would come here for take out but probably will not sit inside the store again.. particularly not on a weekend.

Solid bakery that I'd say is a little overhyped. Tried various items from the menu -- croissant, banana cream pie, turkey pesto sandwich, and bread pudding, and all were delicious but not so heavenly that they'll be showing up in my dreams any time soon...if ever. The croissant is ENORMOUS. The texture is probably a little too dry for me, but it's a beautiful looking croissant, and very impressive on the eyes. Banana cream pie/tart was one of my favorite items from the trip. Very smooth consistency, and I liked the chocolate shavings in the cream. Turkey pesto sandwich was nothing special, though the bread was quite flavorful -- doused in olive oil. Bread pudding was delicious. When I visited, the flavor was raspberries and blackberries, so it was rather tart. After a few bites however, I thought the pudding was a bit too custardy. Would have preferred a chewier, breadier texture.   3.5 stars.

I've done pretty crazy things in life all for the love of sweets. Back in college, my roommate and I had a craving for tiramisu during a snowstorm. The temperature was 25F (gotta love New York), snow was hitting our faces horizontally and ice was everywhere. So after slipping on  ice, a ripped pair of jeans and a bruise as big as a giant mango, we finally had our tiramisu. And it was worth it. We went to Tartine recently and after circling the mission for almost half an hour and STILL not finding a parking spot, we finally decided to park, uhm, illegally...RIGHT ON Guerrero and 18th. Yep, blocking part of traffic. All for the love of Tartine's Banana Cream Tart. It's probably the BEST Banana Cream I've ever had. Flaky crust coated with bittersweet chocolate and a filling of sweet bananas with caramel and cream, topped with more whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Ahh, what could be better. Simply divine. PS - We didn't get a ticket, but it would've been still worth it if we did!

Tartine.... hmmm.... very much a "scene" place. We went there a few months ago for the first time, I've heard so much about it that I had to try it.  The pastries are nothing special, I've had better pastries  at a little hole-in-the-wall Mexican pastry shop.  There is so much hype about this place, but it's just... whatever!  Also, the girls that work there are total snobs, it seems like everyone there (employees and customers) have the Mission hipster-I'm-too-good-for-you-thing, going on. G o to a different pastry shop and avoid waiting in line and paying too much for mediocre pastries.

I decided to take advantage of my afternoon working in the city, and hit this place up before heading back to the south bay.. My little detour was well worth it! The reviews are true!! Oh man, this place is heavenly.. It looks like your regular bakery/cafe, but don't let that fool you.. The food is awesome. I got their ham+leeks+? quiche. Soo good! The crust is made out of flakey, buttery phyllo dough instead of a traditional crust! I was pretty full after this, but couldn't leave without taking something back home to last me a while longer (or atleast until tomorrow morning!).. I got their Spicy Turkey hot pressed sandwich (toast in oven at 375degrees for 10mins.. you'll DIE!!) and a Banana Cream Tart (it has a surprise chocolate shell layer, between the crust & filling!). Another bonus, besides the awesome baked goods, is the outside seating and live music! Yea, its a really small place, but they had some cool, local musicans, jammin' it out! LOVE THAT on a Thursday night! I can't wait to go back.. it'll definitely be a destination, rather than a detour next time!

I must say. THIS IS NOW MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BAKERY! We got here around 10am so the crowd was not too bad. a few people in line but it did not go out the store. There were still fresh goods to try! We had: Croissant: "To Die For!" it was crispy on the outside and so soft and moist on the inside! I am usually very picky with my croissants but this is the best. My cousin who went with me never usually even eats croissants but we munched on this like it was the last piece of food on earth! :D Chocolate filled Croissant: again, awesome! the chocolate was the right sweetness/bitterness. some other ones that I eat..the chocolate is just in a straight line down the middle, but this one was scattered throughout the middle. delish! Open Face Sandwich (spice turkey): unfornately we came for the paninis but they were not taking orders for lunch until 11:30. but its okay cuz the open face sandwich was very good as well! they toasted it for us so it was hot and good. It had a few thick slices of turkey, a tomato and provolone cheese melted on top. yum Macaroons: SO GOOD! it had a hit on lemon so it had alittle tart to it so the coconut was not "too much" best macaroons we had ever! it was small compared to other stores but I think it was big enough for a light snack after all the pastries and sandwiches. Lemon Tart: We were so full from the pastries that we did not get a chance to try it yet.. its still in the bag and ready to be eaten later. but this one was on SF 7x7 magazine top 50 desserts!! so it MUST BE GOOD! It was  about $27 for everything, alittle pricey but SOOOO WORTH IT!! :D

I love starting my morning at Tartine. When I have a chance to go to the city, I grab my usual slice of quiche and  some sort of tea. I then assume my spot at the standing room area by the window facing Guerrero and watch as the day unfolds before me. I settle in, and start devouring. Creamy egg, crisp flaky crust, and mmm... the cheese. The flavors and textures together are divine. Tartine, you never fail me. And that's why I love you.

This place has the best breakfast in the city. Le Croque Monsieur, bread pudding and the morning bun are all to die for. Although only available in the afternoon, the bread is also fantastic - I had the bread at Delfina and its the only time I've ever stopped the waitress to ask her where they got the bread from. It's just so good. Sure, the seating can be a little annoying, but you'll just have to deal with it. Really, it's one of the highlights of the city. Golden Gate Bridge, Pier 39, and Tartine bakery. Stop what you are doing right now and go there.

Part of me never wants to mention Tartine to anyone, so I can keep as much of it to myself and the in-crowd that knows about this little overstuffed piece of Heaven tucked in the Mission. But unfortunately, the word is out; it's not just local shows and media that blow the cover on this place -- personalities from Food Network even show up here from time to time. Outside of France, this is, hands down, the best bakery we've ever been to. We used to live only a few blocks away, walking distance, and would come here almost every weekend. We've tried just about every pastry here; they never ever disappoint! Liz Prueitt (co-owner) is a pastry goddess and a true artist. Of course, like many patrons, we love the orangey-cinnamony Morning Buns. We usually contrast a sweet morning bun with Pain au Jambon for the salty, savory side. And if you can catch a Pain au Chocolate when it's warm and fresh from the oven, it's so flaky and soft, and the chocolate may just ooze down your fingers and force you to lick it off. Yum! The bread pudding is always changing, and popular. The crumbly currant scones are wonderful with a large cup of coffee. The Gougere (a poofy mound of goodness with gruyere and pepper and herbs) is tasty if you're looking for something savory and not so sweet. Then of course there are all the tarts, cakes, cookies, and puddings for later on in the day (or heck, even breakfast too I guess). For lunch, the sandwiches are pure heaven. But make sure you also order a pastry or tart for dessert. Most mornings, you may need to wait in a long line that runs halfway down the block, but it's worth every minute. Small tip: if you want coffee to sip while you wait in line, when you first arrive, walk past the line and right up to the espresso bar toward the back on the right. You can order and pay for coffee or espresso drinks separately there -- just order your drinks to go, and then get in the big line. Another tip: The line is often too long to rejoin after you finish eating, and can sometimes be longer than when you arrived. So order everything you think you might want the first go around. You can always take it home and save it for later if you can't eat it there. Just don't order the last five Morning Buns if I'm behind you in line, or I'll kick your orange-cinnamon butt before it even gets to the cash register! Unfortunately for us, we no longer live in the City, so Tartine isn't as conveniently blissful as it used to be for us. Still blissful, just not convenient. We still drive up to the City at least once a month, sometimes just for a fix from Tartine, then immediately drive back down the peninsula! We're hopelessly addicted.

A wonderful bakery, but very expensive....$3.95 for a plain croissant, $64.00 for a large cake, $34.00 for a large quiche, granted portions are generous but still steep. Very poorly laid out inside, inadequate lighting especially in the evening hours, too dark to even see the showcases and shelves behind the counter... tough parking, usually crowded, noisy, live music on friday nights. Best to go mid-day when the crowds are thinner.

Morning Bun. The infamous one. It was DAMN GOOD. I loved how crispy and flaky it was. The slight orangey taste made the pastry even better. NOMS. I'd wait in line for this any day. Frangipane Tart. Light Almond-Cream Filling in Flaky Pastry Shell with Blueberry. This was pretty good, but definitely not what I was expecting. I expected it to be more almond-y but what I got was a tart that tasted like a blueberry tart topped with almonds. Cocoa Nib Rocher. This was BOMB. An explosion of cocoa goodness in my mouth. It was made with meringue so it was rather light but still sweet and delicious. Service was much better this time. YAY no b!tch girl giving me attitude! 5 stars just for the morning bun and rocher! :)

Pastries are good, bread is good, sandwiches are meh.  Overall it's overrated and overpriced. The morning bun, and chocolate croissant, are good but nothing extraordinary.  The bread pudding is really tasty. The croque monsieur and the humboldt fog sandwich are both okay but nothing special.

TARTINE BAKERY is slipping! Had lunch with Mom today at Tartine Bakery. We both ordered the Niman Ranch Pastrami Sandwich w/gouda, horseradish, & dijon mustard on sourdough. $10.75 I have a new name for it: HORSERADISH - DIJON MUSTARD Sandwich which includes garnishes of bread, pastrami, and cheese. First Mistake:  Trusting that someone in the Tartine Kitchen would actually taste the sandwich (and tweek ingredients as needed) before putting it on the menu. The combination of dijon mustard and horseradish, and the generous quantity spread on the bread, completely over-powered the sandwich. Both Mom and I starting coughing from the burn. I'm not exaggerating - napkins covering our mouths as were gasping for air, coughing, and tears rolling down our faces. It was like someone had an open bottle of ammonia under our nose and asked us to inhale, deeply. THAT's what it was like eating this Pastrami sandwich today. The sandwich was inedible. And the sad part is, the pastrami and cheese were actually in the sandwich, and not a lot of meat or cheese, mind.  You couldn't taste either. I paid $21.50 for two sandwiches where you couldn't taste the pastrami or the gouda. I even opened the sandwich to make sure gouda was in there. It was.  Worst of all, you couldn't taste - much less enjoy - the delicious sourdough bread. The sandwich was ruined by the horseradish and dijon mustard. WHY doesn't anyone in the kitchen taste the food before it's put on the menu??  If the kitchen did sample this sandwich and approve it, then Tartine Bakery has lowered its standards considerably. Adding insult to injury, the gal at the register advised that it would take 15-20 minutes before the sandwiches would be ready ... but the bakery was half empty.  People were eating; they had been served, except for our table and one other. How could grilling two sandwiches take that long?  25 minutes later, the sandwiches were served. While waiting for lunch, I bought a couple Mexican cookies, two shortbread cookies, and two small chocolate ganache desserts. The Mexican cookies were good, not amazing. The shortbread cookies weren't crumbly. They were dense like pound cake and very plain; needed sugar. The chocolate ganache desserts were okay. Moist cake, dark chocolate - but just okay. Not the "Wow!" we had anticipated. I'll end with a final observation:  The tables were sticky dirty! Staff were not cleaning up after people finished. Several of moms & dads had a toddler sitting / walking / laying on the tables (yes, shoes/sandals on the table, too).  Staff couldn't be bothered to wipe any of the tables down before new patrons arrived. It was a really bad experience today!  And I was embarassed having told my mom what an amazing place this is and how great the food/desserts are.

Not much to add to the 700+ reviews on this place other than...Tartine is AWESOME!  I'm definitely a fiend for baked goods and this place does not disappoint.  When you drive by and see that line 10 deep out-the-door...don't be discouraged...the line moves relatively fast.  Since seating inside is limited, most people are there to grab their goodies and run.  And since I equally like to get my sugar fix on while sitting down or on-the-run...the grab-n-go system at Tartine works well for me. Everything I've tried so far is really good...The Morning Buns are however the stuff doughy legends are made of.  I've also heard the fresh fruit bread pudding is pretty mind-obliterating as well...that's definitely on my list the next time I hit up this haven of baked blissdom.

Most disappointing meal in SF. The croissants were like mini cakes.  They should be flaky not cakey. The eclair was merely adequate. I can't believe that people go gaga over this place.

Let's get this straight. The bread pudding was FABULOUS AND BEYOND! "Cup or bowl?" "I'll have a bowl, please." (and yet I was the only one eating...) Yes, I will wait in line for just a bowl of bread pudding, some other great desserts, and a cup of coffee at this place any day. For the sandwiches -HELL NO. The sandwiches were far far far away from that standard. Ugh! I ordered the pastrami, and this is what I got: Oil-soaked slices of bread, and thick cheese back to back!! And out of nowhere, the sandwich had this awful, way too zingy and spicy mustard hidden somewhere underneath the horseradish. Oh man did that taste bad! It was criminal -CRIMINALLY BAD. My friend ordered the proscuitto and provolone and her's was much better, but more or less the same, with the greasy bread and thick cheese. I don't know about you, but judging on the reviews, I think I may have just ordered 'the wrong thing'. But that's two sandwiches out of 10 or something, so I don't know if there's much more room to impress. Don't go for the sandwiches, but you must definitely go for everything else!

Actually really good. Is it worth waiting in a giant line for?  Probably not. I tried the pastrami sandwich, damn good.  Some real kick in the horseradish mayo. I have to admit, the hype is real regarding the bread.   Cookie I tried was the dry crumbly kind, which I don't usually like, but was actually good.

Beyond amazing! Talk about melt in your mouth bread, that doesn't need anything on it for it to be delicioussss. :) We bought a plain loaf and the raisin bread, and both were really great/lasted a long time without doing anything speciallll. I also had a croque monsieur, which was one of the best ones I've had outside of Paris! Come here if you're looking for amazing, quality baked goods-the line is worth it! I've also heard you can call in your bread order a few days ahead of time. :)

This French bakery truly speaks for itself. Every single morsel they create elicits a moan of delight from the patrons. The coconut cream pie is to die for. If you're more in the mood for savory, try the pressed sandwiches on their fresh country bread. The Jamon Royale (fresh Niman Ranch Ham and organic Gruyere cheese) and Pastrami are both incredible. But be warned, they are HUGE: two people can be more than satisfied by one single sandwich. If you don't have someone to share your sandwich with, it's easy to overeat because it is so delicious! They also have delicious coffee drinks. This place is hands-down a rare treat!

So the first time I came here, I had the lemon meringue cake.  The person working actually gave it to me on the house because there wasn't much left and it didn't quite come out to a full slice.  That was very kind of her and definitely mitigated my last experience passing by and getting yelled at by some guy because it was closing time.   Oh man, the best lemon meringue cake EVER.  I still remember my first experience having lemon meringue pie.  I was about 8 and I was in Fedco (if anyone still remembers what that is).  One of the those happy memories from my childhood now reincarnated and upgraded into my experience Tartine.   So today, my friend and i shared their croque monsieur, chocolate pudding, almond crossaint, and morning bun.  The morning bun was ok.  The almond crossaint and chocolate pudding were both good, but neither were items that stuck out to me.  The croque monsieur was pretty good.  Sadly, after having such a great experience with their lemon meringue cake, I had too high of expectations for their other times.  Don't get me wrong.  Everything was good, but the only thing that really stuck out to me was the lemon meringue.   Came at 9:30 am, waited about 15 minutes in line, another 5 for a table (it was damn crowded), rushed through meal (felt bad that other people were standing around waiting).

Now that the bread is available at 5pm, my sweetie and I get the 2# bread for dinner, then keep the leftovers for grilled cheese sandwiches or panade / some other bread-based dinner dish. I love a good loaf of ACME bread, but this stuff is a level beyond. The desserts are tasty, but lean heavily toward the walnuts. But seriously, go for the bread.

I would find it hard to believe that dessert gets any better then this. I had a coconut creame tart that stopped all conversation and made me have to take a momment to gather my thoughts. It is kinda hard to find parking try to bring someone that can jump off and run in. I drove an hour for these and it was worth every minute.

Things to bring with you to Tartine: 1) Reading materials for the wait 2) A companion you trust 3) A warm coat unless it's one of SF's 3 hot days of the year 4) Sunglasses 5) Sunscreen 6) Patience Strategy: 1) Walk, don't try to find parking. 2) Read the menu while your companion (see above) looks at the inside pastry cases 3) Read 4) Play on blackberry 5) Wait 6) People-watch 5) Place order  - we usually go for some sort of hot sandwich, croissant au jambon  or croque monsieur and a pastry or two and always the bread pudding (with changing seasonal fruit). Sometimes we go for a cup; sometimes a bowl. 6) Pay for order 7) Retrieve drinks 8) Find a place to stand or sit - we like the outdoor tables outside if we have puppy with us 9) [optional] Leave room in belly for Bi-rite (yes, even after the bread pudding!)

Happy happy joy joy!  This is what makes me LOVE living in San Francisco.   Breads, pastries, and desserts are all legendary.  I feel like I died and went to heaven at this place, and they really bring the love to Bar Tartine, their restaurant (see last meal on earth on my profile). But back to the bakery.  You really cannot beat a sunny weekend day in Dolores park with anything from Tartine.  If you are in a breakfast mood, they have pastries, if you are in a lunch mood, incredible pressed sandwiches. To be fair their chocolate desserts (and I'm a chocolate fiend) are really  a little too rich for my taste, but this place is just heads and shoulders above anything I've ever seen.

It was very weird last night, my destination was Pizzeria Delfina and i ended up going to two other places that I've always wanted to try, Bi-Rite and Tartine Bakery.   I walked up on 18th and i noticed the bakery on the corner and was like oh whats this... omg its Tartine Bakery.  Im going in.  my friend was like..a... we are going to get pizza.. im like... IM HERE.. IM GETTING A BAKE GOOD!.. Hhhahah.. so i stood in line, trying to figure out what I can get before dinner that wont make me too full, I got a brownie.  it cost $3.25.  i thought it was a tad pricey.  But as i found out later.. it was worth it. I split it with my friends.  man... thats a rich brownie.  and its bittersweet chocolate, so its not too sweet.  it was pretty much like just eating a bar of chocolate.  hella goodddddddddddd..

TARTINE.....come to meeee!! The majority of everything here is so freakin fantastic...BEST IVE EVER HAD status.  The reason there is a line all the time is bc everyone is entranced by the decorative pastries and constantly ordering more as you walk through more choices to the cash register. Almond Croissant: Flaky, chewy, light, decadent paste....all at the same time.  How is that possible. Ham and Gruyere Croissant: Cant even talk about it without my mouth filling up with water! Morning Bun: ok....its like a melding of Croissant, doughnut, and cinnamon bun with a hint of orange zest.  Is that not the perfect pastry? Chocolate Hazelnut Tart: DO IT.  That perfectly made crust holds the richest creamiest chocolate mousse.   Coconut Cream Tart: A little too rich for me....maybe Im not as big of a coconut fan as I thought I was. Sandwiches....who care which one you get.  Get 2!!!  No matter what you get they use the BEST ingrediants and baste the bread in butter before grilling it up.  There could be grass in between that bread i would still eat it. Just be prepared to hit the gym for the next few days....you will NOT leave this place with just one thing!

I smelled this shop before I saw it.  Thankfully we arrived JUST before the massive late breakfast lines began on a sunny/rainy Saturday, otherwise my drool may have flooded the tiny restaurant. We ordered a few of the bread puddings (warm and flavorful with a great hint of cinnamon and lots of creaminess), lemon-almond poppy bread (perfect for snacking on later), bacon and leek quiche (hot!  very tasty), pumpkin cake/bread (dry, but ok), almond croissant (flaky and nommy), croque monsieur with sun dried tomatoes (CHEESY GOODNESS - mmmm), a morning bun (had to have the 2nd wave order this one as they ran out for about 20 minutes - WORTH the wait), a couple of coffees and a latte that I mistook for a huge bowl of butternut squash soup. This place is crowded and bustling and no one is in a hurry to leave their table.  I felt bad for vulturing over a couple people, but Tartine either needs a bigger space or to finish whatever construction they are doing on the corner and get some sidewalk tables!  I'll be back, but I'll be taking my bread pudding and morning buns out for a picnic a few blocks away in Dolores Park :)

Of all the places I have eaten in San Francisco, this has to be one of my favorites. Actually in all the places I have eaten in this country, I think it may be in my top 3.... The croque monsieur is absolutely lovely, the soft gingerbread in the shape of crown moulding is splendid, and the brioche bread pudding is one of the most amazing things I have ever put in my mouth. They also have yummy hibiscus iced tea to wash it all down with. Every time I go to this place the line is literally out the door, so seating is kinda hard to find, but it's okay, Dolores Park is just a couple of blocks away... so grab some brioche pudding and go up to rub your toes in the grass while you eat it, it's a lovely experience...

Tartine and I have a love affair that will last for ages... I've always kid about living right on top of this bakery or right around the area just so I could stop by everyday, but I think I'd really consider once I move out of my current apartment. This place has got a sweet buttery aroma that permeates that corner of 18th and Guererro. It's charming, it's chic, and perfect at any time of the day. I've frequented more than a few times in the early hours before work- 7-8am and really, that's when the croissants are worth every dime and more. They are probably the best croissants I've ever had. Everything else is good too, but come for the croissants or the banana cream tart. I tell every one of my friends I'd bring them here, just so I have an excuse to go over and over again.

This is my favorite place to come for banana cream tart and tea. The tart has a very buttery flake crust with chocolate encrusted with loads of banana and cream --delicious. The Zucchini bread is very light and tasty too. I am not a fan of quiche so I do not like the bread pudding. The hot sandwiches here are good and big so you might want to share it with another person. It takes about 20 minutes to make the sandwich and it comes out really toasty and tasty. This bakery is pretty pricey but then again you are paying for quality so it is totally worth it. One banana cream tart cost about $6.00, bread pudding about $3.00, and sandwiches ranging from $9-$12.00. I love the jasmine tea here to wash down the desserts.

Came here this morning at the earnest suggestion of a wise old man. =) YUMS : Pecorino & Almond pressed sandwich - Sheep milk cheese & almonds crushed with olive oil, lemon, and sage. Very rich, I'd be in awe of any person who could finish the whole thing, or even 2/3 of it. : Jambon Royale & Gruyère pressed sandwich - Niman Ranch smoked and cured ham & Dijon mustard on Country bread. A savory rendition of the classic ham & cheese with a bit o' spice to it. : Banana Cream Tart - Flaky pastry coated in dark chocolate with caramel, pastry cream, and lightly sweetened cream.... WOW - like insanely delish!  100% times more enjoyable than the bread pudding, I swear my life by it. UMS : Bread Pudding - I know this seems to be a favorite here, but I must say, I've had better. I prefer to have the fruit chopped to get bits of it easily along with the pudding. I guess I could have just cut it up myself, and who am I to say how it should be done - nobody.  It was still yummy as hell and worth getting...just don't think i'll be getting it again. NOTES : Yes, even on a rainy Wednesday early afternoon, the place got packed to the rim. : Wish I had known that the sandwiches were large enough to share, even among three. That's ok, cuz now I have enough to last me the rest of the week. The wiches were a bit too greasy. : 2 wiches + 2 lattes + 2 pastries = $44 Time to go run a few dozen miles...before I go back to sample some of their other delectable treats... ======================================== UPDATE:: The fact that I am friggin craving the BANANA CREAM TART every damn day makes me change my rating to a 5 - just for that tart - so get it!

I love savory pastries.  Some people don't get it but give me a great ham and cheese croissant over a danish any day.   If you have to have sweet in the morning try their pain au chocolat - made with dark, bitter Scharffenberger chocolate.   Their take on Croque Monsieur is also excellent.

I waited around 30-45 minutes to reach the front of the line to place my order because the line was out the door like it always is, but man did I get some goood pasteries! Frangipane Tart - I tried the Huckleberry one. It wasn't bad. It can get somewhat dry so make sure you have something to drink with it. Coconut Cream Tart - Good if you're into coconut desserts. Not a huge coconut fan myself, but I enjoyed what I tasted. Devil's Food Cake - Rich, chocolatey, delicious. A little heavy to eat the whole thing. I suggest splitting with someone. Bread Pudding - It's served room temperature in a little cup. I only wish it were served warm. Good, nonetheless. Walnut Bread (loaf) - Ehh.. not my favorite. I'd say just get the plain. Almost Croissant - DELICIOUS! The almond paste filling is the best part. Haven't had a croissant that was better. Poppyseed Cake - A dense, sweet cake with a hint of lemon. Really REALLY good for the taste buds. Shortbread Cookie - Melts in your mouth like butter. Fantastic. I love the tea here too. Add some honey and everything's perfect. By trying the food, you know Tartine only makes their pasteries with the finest ingredients. You're also paying for it as well because this place is a little pricy, but you forget all about it when you take your first bite. Come here on weekdays and you should be fine, but the ridiculously long line on weekends are a turn-off. No croissant is worth waiting 30-45 mins in the cold wind, but you know when you have to use the bathroom sooo bad that as your proximity to the toilet gets closer and closer you feel like you're about to almost wet your pants? Well that's sort of what it's like at Tartine. As I move up in line and get closer to the food where I can smell the delicious goodies, my stomach growls more and more.

I just moved to San Francisco and was hesitant to even set foot in this place, as I have celiac disease and can't have any gluten. But my roommate used to work there and told me that I'd be safe with the chocolate pudding, the meringues (or Rochers, as they call them) and the macaroons, as they don't have flour in them. I went, tried all three, along with a latte in a big bowl. So good! And I didn't get sick, so I've gone back several times. The chocolate pudding is outrageously expensive at $5, but it's awesome. And I'm not even really a fan of pudding. Had I not had the gluten restriction, I probably never would have tried it. I have to admit, most of the employees here aren't super friendly, which is a bit disappointing. I've found the same to be true at Bi-Rite Creamery. People, you know this place is going to be crazy busy. If you don't feel like being nice to customers, then don't get a job here. In any case, I still go. And get super excited if I can even find room to sit down and drink my yummy latte while reading a book. But that's doesn't occur too often, as the place is usually packed.

Why do 90% of the 3-stars-and-below reviews come from people who don't live in San Francisco? Curious. Curious indeed. Do they not know what deliciousness tastes like because their senses have been dulled by sub-par pastries from the likes of Starbucks? Or are they so jealous that people who live here can have Tartine anytime we want that denial causes them to tell themselves it's not that great, anyway? I would love to know what these people think is a superb pastry. If a more superb pastry exists, I have not had it. I adore Tartine. Adore it. The morning bun is worth losing a parking spot over, and the gruyere-ham croissant is one of those experiences that makes me forget that I have a brain--I just become pure taste. Tartine just knows how to make the perfect pastries. I have been meaning to create a reason to go running in the morning, and jogging down here to eat a sticky bun and then running back just seems like the perfect daily ritual. I'm on it. Starting tomorrow.

I don't really like cold, eggy bread pudding. And that's what I got! It's a shame... I had such high hopes.

I had originally wanted to come here for the Double Pain au Chocolat. I knew I had to get here early otherwise they would run out of it. The line moved pretty briskly and we were able to order after about 10-15 minutes. Figuring that I don't go to San Francisco that often, I decided to be a fatty. - 2x Double Pain au Chocolat - 2x Pain au Jambon - Morning Buns The best Pain au Jambon aka Ham and Cheese Croissant I have ever had. EVER. The saltiness of the ham (Niman Ranch I believe) and the gooey, meltedness of the cheese just meld perfectly together with the flaky, buttery croissant. Just goes to show you that quality ingredients make for a quality product. And of course a couple pounds of butter. I did not have the pain au chocolat or morning buns the day of, but they were still mighty delicious. You could tell the morning buns were baked with orange zest and favorite part of them was definitely the caramelized edges of it. I reheated the pain au chocolat in the oven, so I could recreate the nice flakiness it had at the bakery. Definitely quality, rich Guittard chocolate.

So, I went back this place numerous times after I wrote the review. Why? Because the food is so good and it doesn't matter how rude their staffs are at that point. Yes, they're still rude and incompetent (geez, that does sound pretty harsh, doesn't it?), but their pastries are amazing enough to compensate that. Their pastries are so good that I can give them 5 stars and completely ignore their attitude (I still do value customer's service in general though). Just as my friend said, their Éclair is AMAZING. The best I've ever had in the states for sure. I can say the same thing for their croissants. Lemon Cream Tart is my favorite and Banana Cream Tart is very good, too. I personally don't think they're at all expensive because the portion of their pastries are quite large. I now admit, this is probably one of the best quality pastries you can ever get in the United States. I've had amazing pastries in Paris and Tokyo, and this place definitely can complete them as San Francisco style French pastries. Tip when visiting Tartine: Avoid visiting on weekends if possible. Visit mid-morning time during the weekdays to avoid large crowds and cranky staffs, better parking during that time, too. Know what you want to order before it's your turn - again this is to avoid unpleasing experience with their cranky staffs.

Tartine has what are hands down the best croissants I've ever had the privilege of eating.  Their dessert pastries are all among the very best in town and thier quiche (yes, real men do eat it) and sandwiches all melt in your mouth (try the croque monsieur with the niman ranch ham). The only thing that makes me sad is that as wonderful as tartine is, the crowd that it draws from other neighborhoods has the unfortunate side-effect of encouraging further gentrification of this neighborhood which is already crippled from the impact of class warfare.

This is a place that makes me drool from time to time.  I gotta go back! (Actually, I tired to go back the following weekend. But ended up there at 5am, not knowing that they don't open until 9am.  Our little secret...shh shh...BTW I did evidence that they bake things early in the morn.  haha) Screw Bouchon!!!  Hail Tartine!!!

First off, sorry, I'm a yelp virgin. I've used it hundreds of times, but I've only recently decided to add my two cents. I started a Yelp account because I realized that I can't write like a normal person anymore. All the sentences that I write comes out to sound like something a science nerd would say. This means, my language ability is somewhat incomprehensible. And you might wonder, what's with the sudden interest in improving my writing skills? I'm taking my GRE's in 2 months, and I need to sound like a real person. Not a science geek. (I sadly have a subscription to Science and Nature magazine. Actually, not Nature, but wouldn't I be even geekier if I did? Perhaps I should invest.) Anyways, my point is. Tartine is good. Very good. The hot pressed sandwiches are to die for. The bread was my favorite part. So flaky, so moist, so oily, and so yummy! It's essentially just a ham and cheese sandwich. But the bread makes all the difference. If only we can eat this with no regrets. My damn clogged arteries! What makes this place even better is that you can go to Dolores Park which is up the block and walk off that fatty sandwich. Coffee there is surprisingly good too. Very creamy. (I have my coffee black.) I didn't get a chance to try a croissant, but the bread pudding was really good too! The open faced sandwich not so much, it tasted nothing more than a glorified pizza to me. I am officially a food yuppie. God help me.

In high school I worked in a market where my job included prepping baked goods by going down into freezers in the basement,  pulling cold lumps of lard, flour, and chocolate out of a box from the Quaker Oats Company, and sticking those lumps on trays for tomorrow's "fresh" baked goods section.   Customers never knew that their croissants came from some factory in Trenton, NJ or wherever.  They didn't know that the "croissants" they were consuming were actually "fresh baked" (not "fresh made") preservative-laden crap!  They were getting fatter for no good reason! Tartine, on the other hand, is croissant heaven, where you can get fatter for very good reasons!  You don't even have to ask yourself where and when their sublime chocolate croissants were made...you can see them making them right there in their bakery!  To me, that kind of true freshness is well worth the wait and well worth the price.  And well worth the extra exercise or pounds I put on! But, go ahead and give Tartine low-star reviews...maybe the line will get shorter! Thank you!  ;)

I've heard about Tartine, seen the cookbook, read about the hype, and finally tried this little spot while a girlfriend was in town. Being the little piggies we are, we kind of went crazy and ordered more than we really should have because we wanted to sample as much as possible. We arrived right at noon and not a minute too late because there was a HUGE line forming behind us right after we entered. From the pressed sandwich menu we tried the sheep's milk cheese with quince jam. It was really buttery, like it had been drenched in butter prior to being put on the griddle. I'm one of those super sensitive to butter types of people, so I felt like it was a bit much. However, for those butter lovers out there, you'll want to lick your hands of the butter that has formed on them after you finish your sandwich. The tangy sheep's milk cheese coupled with the sweetness of the quince jam was a great combo. Next up was another sandwich off the pressed sandwich menu. Fromage blanc with bananas. It was also extremely buttery and the banana chunks were a bit large, but it was also a good flavor combo. The chocolate croissant was the highlight of the meal for me. They use Valrhona Chocolate and use a lot of it. It's not like the typical chocolate croissants that contains two "tubes" of chocolate and it's mostly pastry and no chocolate. Not this version; there's yummy chocolate in every bite. All in all, I get why Tartine has such a following, but I felt like there were some small things that needed adjustments. However, I will make the trek to the Mission any day of the week to experience that sinfully delicious chocolate croissant.

Tartine, Tartine. 922 Yelpers can't be wrong. They're not, don't worry - I ain't callin you out (I just had my nails done afterall, uh!), however I do think y'all are a tad over-enthusiastic about The Tart. We got there about 4, good for the line, it wasn't too long, the people are fast, friendly and cool, the bakery display is heaven to gaze at whilst in line. We had the croque monsieur, the Jambon Royale & Gruyere and the Sopressata pressed sandwiches. Admittedly, I didn't know what the hell sopressata was - but it came with pesto and broccoli rabe - I liked 2 out of 3! They were beautiful. The 2 sandwiches were done to perfection, but the croque monsieur was a little over crisped, making the crust slightly tough to chew and the ham a little dry. It was my mistake ordering the sopressata, I'm not a fan of salami and that's kind of what that is, and the cheese was an odd choice to accompany, the pesto didn't have that savory punch that I love about pestos the world over and the broccoli was mysteriously missing. I did call the local authorities, however they told me that it has to go missing over 24 hours before it's technically "missing." So, we'll see. We took a whole Lemon Meringue Cake home to share and this tasted as good as it looked, however dry on the ends, but the wonderful tart, tangy lemony middle made up for that with meringue that was so light, sticky and perfectly browned. The place is tiny and no matter what, if you've got a table, you've got prying eyes waiting hungrily for you to get out of your seat so that it will soon become their seat. All in all, I love coming into the city and trying new places and this was good - but there's just no way that I can be this close to Delessio's and pass it up. Not for Tartine, I just can't do it!

This is going to be the 961st review and I feel like there were 961 people in line before me. Every minute, every day, tartine has a line. Raining, hailing, alien invasion....they will probably queue too, for a hazelnut tart. Price? Slightly high...but good, no questions. The Eclair was unbearably runny but the light touch of lemon zest and the buttery flour sensation of the cream was unbeatable. Chocolate/hazelnut tart was rustically authentic. Espresso can be improved. Overall? A terrific pastry shop, very often found in Europe, very rare in San Francisco. Oh no!!! They make sandwiches? F##K, I've to put myself in line after the aliens!

Originally I wasn't too thrilled about coming here because I saw the line outside, I'm not really a pastry person, and I had just stuffed myself with donuts. But the line moved fast and I'm always down with savory food items.  The only savory items they have before noon are basically the Croque Monsieur, a croissant, a quiche, and a few other things here and there.  They have four types of Croque Monsieurs but at the time we arrived, there were only the Ham and the Frommage Blanc.  We got one of each at around $10 per.  It's made very differently here because they use one slice of thick French bread as opposed to two slices of regular toast.   This was the BEST.  I cannot even begin to describe just how exquisite it tasted.  Both had its pluses.  The Frommage Blanc had a lovely curdled texture to it and wasn't overpowering as it was paired up with the gruyere.  The Ham one is good because the quality of the beat is superb and it just adds a nice hint of meatiness to it. It takes a while to come out because they heat it up and it's pretty fresh.  It's topped with some tomatoes which really aren't your typical tomatoes... they're not that acidic.  Everything about the Croque Monsieur was light in flavor but heavy in texture.  You get pickled heirloom carrots on the side which balances everything out nicely! I would gladly come back for some Croque Monsieur.

If someone were to ask me where to get a great croissant I would point them in this direction with the caveat that a wait in line is inevitable.  The delicious morning buns are also kind of like a hybrid between a croissant and sticky bun.  Rolled up similar to a sticky bun and sugar glazed with cinnamon, but with the light buttery and flaky consistency of a croissant.  Added in the mix, which caught be by surprise, were sparsely placed small bits of stick-to-your-molars chewy candied citrus rinds. I've also had a hot-pressed spicy turkey sandwich and some of the bread pudding from here as well.  The sandwich is very good but a word of caution, if you are in a hurry you probably shouldn't order one as they actually take quite awhile for them to get it to you.  The bread pudding wasn't too bad, but nothing really special in my opinion.

I've heard a lot of good raves about Tartine and was finally able to make a visit a few weeks ago and since then I've gone twice. First time experience: Went there at 3PM on a Thursday, no line and plenty of seats. Ordered two hot pressed sandwiches: I had the Prosciutto & Provolone - San Daniele Prosciutto with dressed arugula and my sister had the Spicy Turkey - Peppered turkey breast, provolone, broccoli rabe pesto. Both were delicious, very nice crunch to it, finger licking good. My almost 2-year old daughter couldn't get enough of it! We also ordered two Banana cream tart to go since all three of us were stuffed. Once we got home we dug into the tarts and was delish. Perfect amount of cream and banana.   Second experience: Went there on a Saturday around noon. There were four of us plus my daughter. When we passed by, there was a line out the door but we were starving so we decided to suck it up. Found parking after 5 minutes and waited in line for about 15 minutes. We were able to share one small table with four chairs plus my daughter on my lap. We ordered: the Prosciutto & Provolone, Jambon Royale & Gruyère - Niman Ranch cured and smoked ham with Dijon on country bread, bread pudding, Coconut cream tart and a slice of the Tres Leches cake. Finished the hot pressed sandwiches and the bread pudding at the shop plus two hot mochas and took the desserts home. Even though the place was packed and we had to wait awhile, it wasn't bad as I thought it was going to be. The food and drinks didn't disappoint us at all. I am definitely a fan!! Now if I'm such a big fan, why not give it 5 stars you say?! Well it's because the first time we went there, I found a small piece of metal/plastic in my sandwich. I told the waitress about it and she apologized and said that it's from their sponge. Now I wasn't trying to make a big deal about it so I told her to just tell her associates to please be careful with whatever they are doing since I'm over here feeding their food to my little girl. I still ate the sandwich and it obviously didn't stop me from going back there. Now I am just extra careful and comb through whatever I feed the little one.

You know you've got a winner when you come at 6pm, pick one of the lesser desired cakes (the "left over rejects"), and still get an amazing dessert! The lemon meringue cake was light and not overly sweet with just enough tart. Pretty much the perfect cake. It cost ~$5, but it was most definitely worth it. I'm hoping to come back again, but hopefully I'll get more choices to choose from!

I wonder if Tartine makes anything that isn't good. Pros: - Pastries - Bread - Sandwiches Cons: - Too many people go here so the line can be REALLY long - Ordering a loaf of bread is a bit of a pain as they only bake bread on certain days and you have to order a few days in advance. - Seating is limited

I really was expecting this bread to not live up to the hype. Oh, but it did. Totally worth the 40 minute wait in line I got a warm sesame sourdough loaf fresh out of the oven and had trouble not inhaling the entire thing during my 1 hour drive home; it smelled like heaven. This bread makes for the best toast and sandwiches of all time. Note: the loaf disappeared within 2 days even though my family is generally somewhat carb conscious.

Got a chocolate hazelnut tart and a coconut macaroon.  Amazing.  The macaroon was good, but the chocolate hazelnut tart was one of the best desserts I've tasted in my life.  Perfectly balanced flavor, good mix of textures of the chocolate tart filling and crust, with the right amount of hazelnuts topping it. $6 for 15 minutes of perfection.   I'll definitely be back for the everything.

The croissants and pain au chocolat are some of the best that I've had in SF and it measures up pretty well against the flakey awesomeness I've sampled around ze planet! The actual eating area is waaaaaaaay too congested to get any real pleasure outta the food, so I always get my pastries to go and head down to Dolores Park (weather permitting haha!) to enjoy them. Oh yeah, they need to fix the long-arse queue problem. There is absolutely no reason folks should wait that long. That aspect is definitely not authentic!!

Tartine is amazing. Stars are lemon tart, fruit tart, anything with chocolate and all the sandwiches.  5 stars due to choc eclair and ham and cheese sandwiches (turkey and pesto awesome too). It's all in the bread. Which you can get after 5. Their book on bread is wonderful. One of those cook books that's wonderful just to read. also worth a mention is the pickles that come with the sandwiches. They are so tasty and a little extra treat that adds real class.

Update 7/24/08.  How could I not have given five stars to this place?  I think it was the coffee.  Yes, Tartine has improved their coffee finally to something worthy of the food inside. This restaurant won the James Beard award this year for the best bakery in America, and I know why.  I hate waiting in line and yet....well I will let my poetry from my first review speak for me.  I could write something similar for every other thing I have eaten there--quiche with its magnificent crust of perfection and creaminess; croque monseuir with a garden of mushrooms and the spicy gloriousness of white pepper; macaroons, pudding, and coconut cake that are making me drool even today. Tartine is sheer perfection.  There is no equal in America. I love thee, o morning bun.  Allow me to wax poetic about your velvety buttery insides, your caramel orange toffee coating and the rich cinnamon sugar sprinkles.  That you were fresh out of the oven my darling made your beauty that much more appealing.  However, the mountains I had to climb to find you (long line, no seating, no parking), make you sadly, only an occasional treat.  Your friend, the cafe au lait, while dressed appropriately in Parisian bowl style, was a bit too cold for my taste.  I shall be back to taste your goodness and perhaps that of your friends, lemon bar and chocolate pudding.

I'm a little disappointed that Tartine's hot chocolate isn't as rich anymore and...it was just warm. I still love the Coconut and Passion Fruit cake (so fluffy looking!) as well as the Chocolate Croissants. Still so chocolate-y it takes me all morning to eat. Perfect for a working-from-home Friday morning.

I'll wait all day for a mocha at Tartine.  They pre-melt super nice chocolate (not powder) for this yummy treat, and I'm hooked. As far as their foodstuffs, I experience anxiety every time I get in the line because everything is tasty. It's always a tough choice between something savory (like the croque monsieur) and something dripping in sugary goodness. A warm sunny Saturday morning is well spent taking your mocha to Dolores park with a book and a blankie.

I am pretty certain that heaven smells exactly like Tartine. Tartine was on my list of places to check out on our quick stop in San Francisco. We were able to stop by on our way out of the city. We got there about twenty minutes before they opened and already a line was forming. The crowd outside all appeared to be salivating. When we stepped in the smell was intoxicating. We both ordered two massive almond croissants filled with chocolate and coffee and were on our way. While on the Bay Bridge we took our first bite and felt as if it was the first croissant we'd ever truly had. I mean sure we'd had croissants, Parisian croissants, but this was entirely a different league. And it was the perfect way to say goodbye to SF.

Best bakery-- well, EVER. Seriously.  I defy you to find a more tasty, fresh, or mood-lifting array of pastries, tarts, cakes, breads and sandwiches anywhere.  Favorites include the bread pudding, croissants, and prosciutto & provolone hot-pressed sandwich.   I'd give this place 10 stars if I could, and.... if it weren't for the lack of parking and the woeful amount of seating available.  But, that's the price you pay for being in the city and being universally adored, I guess.

The masses on Yelp aren't lying. I've tried the entire sweet menu by now, so I can say with authority that the absolute most delicious thing is their chocolate pudding, made with Valrhona chocolate and hand-whipped cream. N00bs come for the pastries, which are excellent of course. But you, seasoned Yelper, should know to stay for the bread. One country loaf will turn into half a country loaf by the time you finish walking home with your boyfriend, who is more bread than person at this point. And that half a loaf will still last many meals and sandwiches. I won't try to describe the bread for you with my clumsy, non-English-major words. Read this. http://tartinebakery.com…

One of my missions for my recent SF trip: TARTINE BAKERY! We finally stopped by Sunday during brunch time before heading to Napa.  Parking was near impossible. Since it was pouring outside, my generous bf dropped me off so I could wait in line as he looked for parking.  20 minutes passed before he was able to join me in line.  After waiting another 20 minutes outside with just a raggedy ol' umbrella to shield us from the pouring rain (who needs a heavy duty umbrella in so-cal?) We finally ordered our food and waited like vultures for an open table.   To my dismay, I find out there is a SEPERATE line for beverages, which required more waiting. sigh.. After an hour upon arrival, the food&beverage finalllly arrives at our table.  It was like seeing an oasis in a desert, I could finally relax and veg out.  Heres what we had:   ham croque monsieur banana cream tart lemon bar provolone & prosciutto sandwich latte The croque monsieur was AMAZING.  almost worth the 1 hour wait.  almost.  Everything else was great, but not mind blowing. I suspect if I were a local and could come during non-peak times and order to go, I would probably be here on a regular basis.  It was just too much waiting and hassle to dine-in.

I don't think there was any way this place was going to be able to live up to the hype. As I stood in line devouring a bag of chicharrones from 4505 meats, I contemplated my plan of attack. I wasn't sure how I was going to do this. It was too crowded to see exactly what desserts they had left, but I knew many difficult decisions lie ahead. The bread pudding was a must, so we got a large order of that. For my secondary dessert I went with the coconut cream tart. As we sat outside devouring our purchase I concluded the following. The bread pudding was a warm apple bread pudding, and was honestly nothing to write home about. The coconut cream tart was a great concept, unfortunately it was a 9.5/10 on the difficult to eat scale. The dark chocolate base on the inside refused to break off and the coconut custard and cream top created a mess in the struggle to cut this thing apart. A pleasant surprise came in the form of a pocket of caramel hidden somewhere inside this complex dessert treat. Nothing blew me away. The bread pudding was supposed to be the show stealer but left me disappointed, whereas the coconut tart was good, but had me remembering the complexity/difficulty of the dish rather than the flavor. Yet, I would go back, they had too many other good looking things in their display case.

Tartine, why are you such a tease? With your display case full of scrumptious looking and tasting desserts followed by a line of 4 different kinds of croissants, tea bread selections, open faced sandwiches and more, you make me want to come and visit every single day! Hands down Tartine makes the best croissants (all of the flavors)! So buttery and flaky- not for the faint of heart. Call me a croissant snob but this is the only place I will get croissants (I always leave with a box full of them); other places can't even compare. Another savory treat worth trying is their Gougere's- cheesy peppery goodness with a hint of thyme. A trip to Tartine is never complete without a dessert! Frangipane tart, Tres Leches cake, pumpkin bread, lemon bar, lemon tart, and of course the infamous Banana Cream Tart are all amazing! I actually bought the Tartine cookbook before ever setting foot in the store and after receiving it, I've made the Banana Cream Tart quite and few times and they always came out delicious- all of my family and friends absolutely love it. But I knew the real one has to be even better. It was SO FLAKY (from all that butter in the tart dough) and not too sweet- PERFECTION! Seriously guys, GO GO GO!!! In the future, if I move into the city, I can't live too close to Tartine or else it's bye bye to my waist line...

Oh, how I love Tartine! The line is intimidating, but it moves fairly fast, so if it's out the door but hasn't yet passed the boundary of the Tartine kitchen window, the wait is usually less than 20 minutes... not bad! My favorite things -- The quiches are delicious, split one with a friend so you can try some other stuff. The bread pudding is also delicious... I always get the smaller serving because it's pretty heavy. In the baked goods department... Everything is good, but the almond croissants and morning buns stand out. The almond croissants are light, buttery but full of almondy goodness. Also, my friends tell me that they keep for at least three days (if you can wait that long!) And the morning buns? Delicious and interesting. I generally think morning buns are pretty boring -- but the Tartine ones have a hint of orange zest and a caramelly stickyness that add great complexity. If only I could eat twice as much...

Great, great coffee and wonderful(!) hot sandwhiches - but it's quite horrible sitting in there. Way too crowded and with a constant line of 30 people makes you feel like everyone have their eyes on you and your table. Also make you feel like you're at a bus terminal. Too bad. The coffee is great - and I like coffee a lot.

SO delicious!  I went with two friends on a rainy Wednesday and it was pretty packed but we didn't have to wait long for seating at all; turnover is relatively fast.  We each got the Croque Monsieurs.  They were not traditional but simply open faced sandwiches with melted cheese; but they were AMAZING!  Ours had turkey, cheese and asparagus.  My friends also got an assortment of pastries that were amazing, including the morning bun.  I got the lemon cream tart for the next day and even the next day it still tasted wonderful and creamy and very lemony.

Is Tartine the victim of hype?  I went on a Sunday around brunch and the place was absolutely jam packed.  Perhaps it was my mistake for ordering a sandwich, but it seemed to take forever, which is not fun when everyone is reaching around you to grad napkins and utencils.   Still, the food was tasty.

Dear Tartine, I met  you for the first time on saturday... and although you made me wait in line for over 30 minutes, it was totally worth it! Between 4 of us, we got 4 different types of sandwiches ($7.95 to $8.95), breadpudding ($4.50/bowl or $2.75/cup), a lemon cream tart ($5.50), and a bananna cream tart ($5.50).  And I must say... every bite was heavenly.  I don't even like banana cream tart, but your BCT was absolutely exquisite...  How do you create such perfections and only charge us with reasonable prices?  no, no, i am not complaining, merely expressing my gratitude.   So, after leaving your bakery on saturday, all I can think about and taste in my mouth was your delicious pastries and I started to fantasize about what other items may taste... so I went back on Monday (yesterday)... and you satisfied me once again.  Your chocolate crossiant ($2.95ish) was.... perfect.  Not too sweet (dark chocolate) and flaky on the outside and soft on the inside... And the lemon bar was great too... with buttery crust that wasn't too over-the-top.   You are now officially my favorite bakery and I will be visiting you every week or so... or as long as I can still fit into my jeans...

I'm not a huge fan of bakeries & eating pastries for breakfast, but I love the Croque Monsieur (an open face sandwich w/ ham, tomatoes & cheese) at Tartine!  I would brave the long line just for one of those.   By the way, I stopped by there last week with two friends from France and they both gave it the thumbs up.  Either that, or they were just being nice... but the French aren't nice so they must've liked it :)  (just kidding!)

Someone in management please do something about the snail-pace line!!! Yelpers will agree with these statements: Tartine's morning buns are unique and wonderful. Tartine's Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian and Chocolate Souffle cakes are great. Tartine's Croque Monsieur, Jambon Royale & Gruyere, Proscuitto & Provolone, Mozzarella & Tapenade, Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese, etc. are excellent. However.....if the Department of Motor Vehicles and Kaiser Permanente can improve their wait times in lines, so can Tartine Bakery. I mean, c'mon! How hard is it to hire two more people added to their unfriendly staff? It doesn't take a genius for management to rethink this problem by taking a moment and say: #1: "Hmmmm. I think it would be wise to have a person taking phone orders." (lightbulb glowing) #2: "Hmmm. I've got another brilliant idea. Why not have a separate cashier for just pick-ups?" (another lightbulb beaming) I don't recommend visiting this bakery anytime after 10:30am, especially on weekends. YOU WILL WAIT FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES! If you have the time to preciously give up, then stand in line. Otherwise, bag the entire venture and thank the heavens you minimized your carb intake that day!

First and foremost: if there isn't a line, Tartine isn't open. Once you get your food, you'll probably have a hard time finding a table. You may even wind up having to share space with another human while enjoying your fantastic meal. Get over it or don't bother. If it is convenience you want, go to Starbucks or move to Danville. Tartine is a wonderful neighborhood bakery that is all about the sublime, amazing food. The scones are moist, with fresh ingredients in them. The chocolate croissants have ruined me; I don't know why I even bother to get them anywhere else now. If you need a larger portion for your breakfast, the Croque Monsieur will do nicely, thank you very much. With over 800 reviews, you have to expect the place to be popular. So if you can't spare 15 minutes for the best damn pastries in SF do one of two things: 1) Re-examine your priorities; or 2) Go on a weekday. The best way to avoid the line at Tartine is not to go: more for the rest of us.

I had the bread pudding, and it's not like my momma made. Sorry momma, I know you are 19 years gone, but this bread pudding at Tartine is simply the best. They say it is seasonal, which means the fruit they stuff it with is fresh at the time of baking. Today's stuffing was pears and cranberries. Yeow and wowie. Very filling. There must be some gas in the air that makes you eat way way too much at Tartine, and that is exactly what I did today. I will be back for more, please.

A nice little bakery in a popular area! This place always has a long line, even during the weekdays. For starters, the Morning Buns (coated with some kind of orange cinnamon sugar) are awesome, and they make great food gifts for your friends and/or co-workers. I have not met a single person that doesn't like the Morning Buns. I also tried the Banana Cream Tart and it is excellent. Nice consistency and the pieces of banana go really well with the chocolate embedded crust. As expected, parking in and around this area is horrendous. If you do manage to find parking, remember to take the time to enjoy your newly found parking spot and make sure to visit Pizza Delfina and Bi-Rite Creamery after picking up some baked goods from Tartine Bakery.

The Magic's Gone We used to Love this place.  The morning buns held a wierd hold over our souls.  Once a month I'd stop by and pick up $100 worth of pastries (really) to take to my office. But somehow it no longer does it for us.  Not that the quality has changed - it hasn't.  And its not the service, though more on that later. I think it may just be a bit too much. Like a sophisticated Cinnabon.  The first time you taste it you think your life has changed. But after a dozen visits it just seems too sweet, too rich.  too, too, too. Now about the service.  It is almost worth going just to watch the dumbest counter-intelligence in the City.  Its like a study in motion-inefficiency. Maybe it doesn't matter, and they are selling everything they can bake. But a bunch of halfwits from McDonalds could double the througput and halve the wait.  Its a good thing there are so many people with disposable income but no obvious job who are able to wait in line for 30 minutes for croissant and a cup of coffee.  I don't think the staff is actually rude, just unbelievably clueless. And the layout doesn't help. Is like the opposite of the old Cafe Roma (Cafe Strada since 1991 or so) in Berkeley on College and Bancroft.  Used to be there they would hvae a line of 30 people out the door and onto the sidewalk, but you could constantly get served in under 5 minues (and back then a cappuccino cost 90 cents, but I digress.) Yet it doesn't seem to matter. I pass by almost every day and there is usually a line out the door. On the positive side, their bread - which seems to be available only in the afternoon/evening for some reason, is really spectacular.  Of course, it gets stale while you wait in line, but still.

Oh Tartine, how I love thee? Let me count the ways... 1. Sharffenberger mochas in a bowl 2. Lemon Tart, so sweet, light and tart (ha!) with a firm crust; sometimes you are dressed in rose petals, and other times in a few pine nuts, what ever you wear, you are delicious 3. Morning Bun, O! Morning Bun. Your sweet roll of orange and cinnamon make me forever forget my former lovers at Cinnabon(TM). Your crunchy sugary tops and your soft and tender center make it a joy to start my days with you. 4. Salad, Le Petite Green Salad. You have inspired a simple salad brought I've into my home. Simply romaine, fresh lemon juice, salt (and I"m guessing honey) you are the perfect match for number 5. 5. You, decadent quiche are quite delish. 6. Bread Pudding, you aren't so bad yourself! For those who know how much I like hot fruit, this is the place to get it. So fresh, and bready eggy yum yummy. These are the only things I've tried so far, but beware mousse au chocolat, macaroons, cake, etc. I've got you in my sights!

HEAVENLY would be the word to best describe this little gem of the Mission District.  Everything, and I mean everything, here is to die for.  The famed morning buns, for example, are just divine! They're light and flaky with delicate hints of orange zest and cinnamon. I get this every time I go.  The chocolate vanilla pudding is another unbelievable creation, so soft and so luscious.  The croque monsieur is also fantastic. If you're looking for savory goodness, then this is a sure bet.  Be warned though that it takes about 10-15 minutes for it to come out, unlike the other ready to go delights.  Oh and the lattes, served in a nice, large bowl, are excellent too. What can I say, I can go on and on, listing all the organic pastries and breads that this place has to offer, but you'll just have to try for yourself and see....that I am absolutely spot on!

After watching "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on Food Network, it immediately became my destiny to come to this place. The guy on there (I forgot his name) was raving about their chocolate croissaints, and boy, do I love chocolate croissants. A few days later, my fellow yelper Stephanie Yuan showed me the 7x7 list of 100 Things You Should Eat in SF Before You Die, and the morning bun from Tartine was on it! So I knew right then and there that we had to go, so that's exactly what we did one cold morning in SF. We arrived on the corner of the bakery at exactly 7:37AM, 7 minutes after it opened, and there was already a line of maybe 20 people deep. I decided to go all out and order both the chocolate croissant, morning bun, and a coffee. Stephanie also had the morning bun and a chocolate chip cookie w/ oatmeal that was as big as her big appetite. LOL! Anyways, so on to the food... THE MORNING BUN IS SOOO GOOOD! If you were like me, you would also be thinking, how good can a morning bun get, right? And what the hell is a morning bun anyways? If this was the quintessential morning bun (and I can bet you it's not), then a morning bun would be a big, fluffy, doughy bundle of goodness with hints of orange and caramel. Oh so goood. Now on to the chocolate croissant.. I wasn't too blown away by my first bite, but after a couple more bites, and after it cooled down, I decided that it was pretty good. I find warm, flaky croissants extremely difficult and messy to eat. The chocolate is dark chocolate so it's pretty bitter. The croissant itself is the perfect doughiness with a flaky surface. If you're willing to spend close to $10 on a pastry-filled breakfast (which in my case I spent $14 because of my all-outness), then Tartine is just the place for you! Until next time, Tartine.. In the meantime, let me work off the 1000+ calories that you have given me.

EDIT:  Ended up at Tartine again with friends who wanted to go have a coffee and pastry. Ordered coffees and was moved aside to wait with four other people dying for coffee. 5min passed and my boyfriend said, "We're waiting here, but no one is working the espresso bar."  We looked around and I was like what's the deal... It's a Saturday morning and there is a small crowd waiting for coffee and no one at the bar, yet staff are moving about freely. I took action by pointing out to the woman at the register, the same woman who had shuffled us all over by the bar to wait for our coffee, that no one was working at the bar. She then visually confirmed what I said, slowly had an "oooh yeah, you're right" moment.  Then passed the message along to someone else, who also passed it along to someone else. Eventually someone lackadaisically appeared to make the coffee. Sigh, oh Tartine, why? ---- I've been to Tartine numerous times and have always enjoyed myself, the espresso, and the goods behind the counter. That said, I brought an out of town friend here and everything was swell until I brought our plates and cups in from outside. I couldn't remember if we were supposed to bus our own table. To be safe about it, I brought our dishes inside to look for a tub which I didn't see. So I politely asked the woman behind the counter where I could put our dishes AND... ...She paused from what she was doing, rolled her eyes at me ... in a big way, scoffed, then told me in what was certainly not a friendly tone, to look behind the register... I couldn't believe it. My guest gasped (seriously lol). I just don't understand where the attitude came from. I have been to Tartine plenty of times and no one has ever been rude. If they are burdened by my business, I will take it elsewhere.  I was a fan, but now I think they are tres pretentious.

OMG this place is heaven! You must try the ham and cheese croissant but warning they tend to all go by noontime. The latte they made also complimented it perfectly. I dont want to downgrade the rating because the food is so good, but the only two minuses are the coffee is a bit expensive and too many seats taken up by bozos who just sit there all day reading Botswana land use reports from a NGO on their mac while listening to john legend. Get out I need to sit down!

Not that Tartine needs any more reviews (lest that perpetual line grow any longer), so I will keep it short. I, like many others, did the obligatory morning bun + coffee combo on a Sunday morning and took it to Dolores Park to enjoy. I was expecting more of a cinnamon roll, but it's really more like a glazed croissant. Not a bad breakfast, though I wished the moist center extended a little further. The hint of orange in the glaze was a nice touch though. I've also had their croissants, and they are flaky buttery mounds of goodness. The coffee is just meh, especially in a city with as many coffee snobs as San Francisco. Someday I'll be back to try their sandwiches and buy a whole loaf of bread for myself =)

So much so that it has inspired me to open my own bakery!!! ...ok well that is only if I could wake up at 5am everyday to get my ass to bake... hmm... on second thought, i'll just have Tartine bake for me! Everything i've had here is good!...no not good...AMAZING! The 7x7 list has listed some honorable mentions, but the morning bun is NOT one of them. IF YOU HAVE NOT TRIED IT, or were a fool like me and wait this long to try it, put down what you're doing and GO ALREADY! if morning buns aren't you're thing ..hehe..they have coconut cream tarts, banana tarts, paninis, cakes, cookies, fresh baked bread...WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR?!?!

Love it but hate how high-maintenance this place is. First the bread doesn't come out until 4 pm. Or 5. Or 3. Who can say?  Next, getting said bread is an ordeal -- you wait in a tremendous line only to arrive at the front to find out it's still baking. Join Citizens for a Tartine Bread Express Lane! Still: the walnut bread is divine.

GOD I HATE/LOVE WORKING IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOOOOD!!!! i had an early work meeting today so i got to go on a 45 minutes break at 9. of course.. i take a five minute drive down to tartine bakery to avoid their notoriously long lines. after i find parking and walk down... it was roughly 9:12, and there was already a mini line out the door!!! (WTEFFFFF) so this is my first time here and i was all excited and whatnot. shit.. i wanted to try EVERYTHING! but..of course that wasn't practical. ='[ so after a 12 minute wait, i got to order 3 double pain au chocolats (they were for my bf and co-worker! i only had half i swear!) a lemon tart (that was mine, allll mine!) and a hazelnut tart for my bf as well. the pain au chocolat was amazzzzing! flaky and buttery on the outside, warm and soft on the inside... with the perfect amount of chocolatey goodness in the center. OMG! i dont even LIKE croissants! how did this happen?! the lemon tart i saved for after dinner to eat so it was no longer warm, but i swear i had an foodgasm after the first fucking bite. PERFECT PEEEEEERFECT blend of lemon and sugar, the middle was so soft and fluffy, not all thick and gel-like at all. and the outside crust was sweet and not too crumbly. sigh..... BLISS! i had to scrape a lot of the cream on top off but still used a little of it to compliment the tangy taste of the tart, but thats just me... i dont like too much of that cream stuff. man.. i cant get over how MOUTHWATERINGLY GOOOOD that lemon tart was! i love lemon/lime pastries and that was by far the best i've ever had! i really wanted to try the banana creme tart as well but they sadly didnt have it that early in the morning. ='''''''''[ but i guess that means i'll be back.... SOON. MUAHAHAHAHA. fetty fettty.

It's been a year and I thought I would note any changes. A year ago most customers were visitors like myself. I discovered this by talking to people at the communal table during lunch. We went twice this visit and I noticed two things. At midweek lunch the crush has turned into a more manageable flow. Along with this, everyone at the communal table was from the neighborhood both times we visited.   Unscientific as it is, it may suggest a small shift to a local cafe, at least during the lunch hour. Less emphasis on the sweet bakery items and more on lunch type fare. I was struck by the friendly, relaxed and open atmosphere which is sometimes lost in a trendy San Francisco eatery. We had grilled cheese sandwiches along with great Belgium beer. It was a simple and satisfying lunch served more quickly than I remember. I follow the Tartine recipe when I bake bread so that is an attraction for me but my friend enjoyed his sandwich too!   So the bread temple is maturing into a friendly neighborhood cafe, all to the better.

The food - fantastic. The service, the long lines, the lack of seating? As I was told by the sales woman at the Givenchy counter in Galleries Layfayette while I frantically searched for a limited-edition, nowhere-to-be found mascara, 'They are a product of their own success.' Here's a thought - buy the building currently occupied by Farina, as I doubt they'll get a liquor license with all the hubbub. I'm not coming back, as no one should have to wait 45 minutes to buy a damn bun and a cup of coffee, regardless of the taste.

There are no signs overhead or on the door but you know it by the line that wraps around the corner. The coconut macaroon, quiche lorraine, and cafe mocha were all fabulous. The croque monsieur was a bit disappointing...it just wasn't that flavorful...melted cheese, shitake mushroom on a big piece of bread. I could've made this at home. Nonetheless, a great experience. The weather was gorgeous and the bench outside offered a fun people-watching time. I love SF.

Granted I only come here at night so don't have to deal w/ any long weekend lines.  And probably because I haven't been there when it's crazy crowded, I adore the vibe.  Frenchy cafe, live music, people sipping their vino or cappuccinos and covertly eyeing each other, just love it.   The food is Yummy.  Do yourself a favor, if you plan to have dessert, split your sandwich with a friend.  And don't EVER throw away those little pickled carrots they give you, it's the absolute best part!!

#1220 I think thats a nice rounded number. Well,  for the sake of sounding really unoriginal...I'm not going to rave about their food or their sometimes moody/ emo hipster workers. No. I am just going to tell you about MY relationship with carbs. I've grown up eating rice, everyday. White rice. Now, I don't. Not because, I'm trying to watch my figure or anything, hell I eat 2 cupcakes at a time. But because I just prefer OTHER carbs. And when I say other carbs, that being, garlic naan, croissants and beer. Its really all about choices. And ..... since my glycemic index is pretty much in jeopardy, you better believe....that I only eat fresh carbs. No  2 day old discount for me.  Fresh carbs or none at all. For this very reason, I'm not a baker. Choices.

Just wanted to restate my love for Tartine and while I'm in the loving mood I also love San Francisco and I love Dolores Park and I love my little dog Spammy. A perfect day: short line at Tartine (I know what a miracle), yummy flaky jambon croissant (Spammy was eyeing my croissant the whole time waiting for a big ham chunk to fall from my mouth), best chocolate pudding, fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, banana cream pie, 70 degree weather, a nice blanket and book, and a nice tired dogster from playing all day with the other dogs. Extra bonus: pumpkin ice cream sandwich from Bi-Rite creamery...life should not be this good.

Let's start with the cons. 1.We went on a Friday, lunchtime. It was still difficult to get parking. 2. There is very limited seating.  I can't imagine what a weekend looks like. 3. The staff doesn't really help you understand how to order or ask if it's your first time there.  They just treat you like a regular. You have to be aggressive! 4. There is no sign out front that says "Tartine" just a small menu in the window.  But you can't miss it if you look for a corner store with black walls and cafe seating outside. The Reason it still gets 5 stars: 1. The food is fresh and amazingly delicious.  I don't really like carrots, but their in house spicy marinated carrots are worth the trip any time of day. 2. The menu items always have a vegetarian option. 3. You know they use the best quality ingredients if they have Humboldt goat cheese on the menu. And menu items change depending on what produce is in season. When we were there, they had Croque Monsieur with Shitake mushrooms and quiche with asparagus. 4. The best deep dish quiche I ever had, and I claim to make the best quiche. Although my bf now agrees that Tartine may have the best of me. =( 5. Great bread pudding. It's not too sweet like most I've had.  I just wish it was more warm. 6. The "Bus your own Table" concept.  Not only does it save you money, but it has a fun communal feel like you're eating at home with a bunch of strangers. The will be the first place we visit anytime we come to SF again. I just wish they would expand!

My loverman actually wanted cake for once and I was in no position to object. We were on our way to Bi-Rite when we noticed Tartine was actually not packed for once. It was probably due to the fact that it was incredibly hot and there was no A/C inside. I was about to order the fruit tart until I noticed they had my favorite dessert, bread pudding! I very rarely ever find good bread pudding anywhere. It's usually really dense and gross and makes me wonder why I even like bread pudding. A bite of their brioche bread pudding reminded me. I was given the option of a cup or a bowl. I'm so glad I ordered the cup because it was a huge portion. I wasn't even able to finish the whole thing and I ALWAYS finish dessert. Well okay, this wasn't dessert in the literal sense but it was sweet and baked which usually means I'll eat the whole thing, and then want seconds. Their bread pudding with strawberries was light and not too sweet. I still regret not finishing the whole thing but the fact that I was sitting there, sweating my thighs stuck to the chair, really made me want to leave. I think their bread pudding is one of the cheapest things there too. My loverman ordered the lemon tart. I took a bite of it but I have no memory of whether or not I liked it. I was probably lost in the euphoria from eating that bread pudding. He also ordered some cheese open faced looking sandwich thing that he took to go. I could've spent another good hour or two looking at all the baked goods but my sweat drenched back had other plans.

This place is famous for their bread pudding and this sweet bun or something. We got it for the sake of it being so famous...and we also got a million other items. ummm, i think everyone is on crack with the bread pudding. It sucked. Too sweet, and not the best thing here at all. The eclairs are yummy. The cream is light and a little runny, but still delish. The lemon creme tart is my favorite of the pastries here. We also got the 3 cheese sandwich and the open top veggie sandwich. Both were wonderful and great to share. We cut everything into 4 pieces and it was perfect. The 3 cheeses were random and I can't remember the names, but it was very tasty and the bread was also very crunchy and good. The veggie sandwich was flavorful although it looks like a big glob of weird stuff. Trust me, it tastes good. The cafe au lait is also in a bowl and soooo yummy. I thought the cafe at Le Garage is better than Tartine's but this was also very good. The peppermint tea is refreshing and just warms your stomach. Can't go wrong with that. The line for this place is out the door everytime. We got there around 10 and it was packed full. We waited about half an hour to get in and place our order...so get your orders ready while you wait! The turn over rate is fast so you are likely to find a seat in the crowded place by the time you place your order...but you are likely to share it with other people who are vying for the seats just like you. The place is teeny tiny, and everyone is crowded up against each other like a metro in Rome. Our table was jostled by the people in line ordering, but that's the fun of it. Just don't spill your coffee!

Tragically, I wasn't very hungry when I came here today, so just shared the "hot chocolate" - a chocolate pudding cup with a chocolate chip cookie on top... and had a cup of coffee. Both were about the best I've had. That being said, the sandwiches looked AMAZING and I want to go back for those. I was not even a little hungry and my mouth was watering. Only lost one star because the guy behind the counter looked so unkempt, even by SF gritty urban standards, that it gave me a moment's pause.

Tartine is ah-mazing.  So good.  Mainly, for me anyway, it's all about the morning buns.  Why do they run out?  I don't get it.  It's such a popular item, you'd think they'd make them all day long.... but they don't.  Which can lead to me being a very unhappy camper after walking for SEVERAL blocks in the RAIN, dreaming about the sweet, sweet taste of a morning bun with each cold and damp step.   I'm taking 1 star away because they don't "keep 'em in stock" despite obvious demand.  Taking another star away because they should move into a larger space.  The current space is way too small.  Even if you are lucky enough to score a table, it kind of takes enjoyment of your food away when your chair keeps getting bumped into and people keep saying "oh, sorry, oops."  You also need to be prepared to have people give you the evil eye if they deem you have lingered a moment too long after eating.

Not feeling too generous with stars today but Tartine's was good and I'll admit the line out the door caused us to drive to Stable Cafe and back to the line....Interesting herd effect at work here! Drove at least 2 miles around the block and alleys to find a space just across the street - no deductions for tough parking. Once in line, we needed the extra time to gaze at the menu and decide on the Muesli and Bread Pudding....The Muesli was a little too 'yogurty' for me so by adding honey it gave it the right sweetness. Next time I'll stick to anything flakey like croissants because they are GOOD.  But almost every other customer had the bread pudding...so include that if you're new.   Sitting at a table in or out is fine for people gazing but a little challenging when the line is active. Oh, the coffee is fine...I expected a darker richer look when I pumped it from the self serve pot so I was a little suspect of the 7-11'ish thin looking coffee but it did taste better than it looked.  They also have a custom coffee bar that seemed to be the default for regulars.

All right, I've been coming to this place for years, and I must say that overall, this is an excellent French-style bakery.  It is a must-visit when you're in SF, but be warned that it is extremely expensive. The prices have gone up and I don't think the value is as good as it once was.  Still, there are certain things to get (as well as certain things to skip).  Let me give you the run down.   Absolutely get:   Croissants (esp. chocolate and almond) - they are enormous and actually worth the $4.25 (!) you plunk down for them Chocolate pudding - outrageously delicious, served with unsweetened whipped cream and chocolate shavings Bread pudding - dense, moist and very good Merengues - love the nibs Skip: Cookies, esp. chocolate chip Brownies Chocolate tart - too small for the $$ The space is smallish, but warm and friendly.  Lots of hipsters here, but also lots of "normal" folks too.   But what is up with the attitude of the staff?  Seriously, do you need a dual degree in surliness and bedhead to work here?  I think they started to get worse when Tartine was named one of the top 50 Zagat-rated restaurants in the Bay Area a few years ago, but now?  C'mon people...show me a smile!

Yay for perfectly sour lemon bars! yay for whoever thought to put peanuts in the crust! yay for the communal table where you get to randomly meet someone who has a son your age who turns out to be an alumni of a school hundreds of miles away! yay for delicious banana nut tea cakes! yay for espresso art! Their banana nut bread is wonderfully moist and really wonderfully banana-y, even 20 minutes before closing! If you have never seen latte art, be sure to order a latte here and you will see beautiful latte art here. Great place to go with solid baked goods. Nice and inviting interior. If you haven't been, go to Tartine Bakery! _______________________ Plus one star for meeting an alum Plus one star for not kicking us out even after they were closed

This place was deliriously good. I felt so guilty afterward though, there was so much butter dripping on everything we ate. Argh. Spicy turkey sandwich and a croissant, but I seirously would have ordered everything on the menu. We went with the basics, too. Americano and Coffee. There was a humongous line. And it was hard to find a table. But I can understand that as everything in the display case and on the menu looked delicious!

The line was out the door as I expected and it moved along pretty quickly. While my friend was in line I took a peek at the pastry case and the size of the cakes, tarts, crossiants  etc were all HUGE and decadent. I highly reccomend the banana cream tart and the broiche bread pudding. Just thinking about them make my mouth water. The crust on the tart was perfectly crispy  and not too thick and im typically not too fond of crust. Inside the cream tart were real bananas and bits of chocolate chunks filled with yummy goodness. It was absolutely delicious and my favorite out of our 3 picks. We also had the bread pudding, the very reason that lead us here. It was accompanied with fresh berries which was a perfect balance with the sweet bread pudding. Without the fruits the sweetness would probably be a lilttle overwhelming. The consistency of the bread pudding was at par. It  was not mushy and saturated so I was very pleased.   The last item we had was the Frangipane tart which was nothing amazing compared to the other 2 items I've mentioned. It reminded me of a chocolate covered donut with nuts on top. You can go ahead and pass on this one.  Overall, I think this was an awesome bakery worth trying. Im definately going to visit again to try the cocunut cream tart.

Three Words......Banana Cream Tart! Today was my first visit to Tartine Bakery and I have to say that their Banana Cream Tart really blew me and my friend away!  It wasn't super sweet which was a good thing, and the bananas and cool cream gave it a nice contrast from the big bowls of espresso we ordered to go with it.  My bowl of cafe mocha was also really good! When we got there at around 3pm, the line went out the door, but it went really fast and we still managed to snag a table.  Not too bad for a Saturday afternoon. I'll be back here again soon, definitely for dessert after a hefty sandwich from Ike's or a super burrito from La Cumbre.

Are you familiar with the Food Network show - Best Thing I Ever Ate? If I had to profess my love for one food to the rest of the world on national television, it would be the Banana Cream Tart from Tartine! An untouched tart has large delicate chocolate shavings layered on top of a fluffy mountain of quality whipped cream that hides the banana slices. All seems average so far.. but when you take a whole bite from crust to the shavings - you'll find a slight layer of caramel that blows everything else out of the water. Amazing!! I'm grateful the full sized Banana Cream Pie is a bit pricey because if it weren't I would be indulging in the wonderfulness every day.

"So where is this Tartine?"  Just look for a place with a line out the door like mad. Came on a late Saturday afternoon after a day at Dolores, and by then a lot of baked goods were sold out already.  All croissants gone, morning bun gone, and pudding gone.  Those just happens to be my favorites. Decided to grab a lemon pound cake and a huge chocolate walnut cookie with a cup of latte.  The lemon pound cake was amazing, especially the crust.  Really refreshing lemon flavors and makes me forget I'm actually eating a really buttery piece of pound cake.  The cookie was awesome as well with bits of walnuts throughout the whole cookie.  Just adding the walnuts makes a chocolate chip cookie taste that much better. Also got to try their open face sandwich.  Perfect size for a fulfilling lunch.  That artisan bread holds all the ingredients up really well so.  Cheese, tomato, ham are the main stars on the particular sandwich that I had. For the drinks, there's a separate counter and you can order there as well rather than waiting at the long line if you are only getting drinks. Having all their stuff gone already, I'm determined to get all that I missed the next time around!

You know this place is amazing when there's a huge line snaking outside at 3pm on an overcast and fricking COLD day! First off, location location location. Next to Dolores Park, right next door to Delfinos, and right across the street from Bi-Rite. This street is the perfect recipe for disastrous obesity. Long line, but it moves fairly quickly. Ordered their famous croissant and almond-lemon pound cake and sat outside to munch and chat. CROISSANT. Huge. Crispy outer shell. Moist and FLUFFY inside. I felt like I was eating clouds. A delicious, buttery cloud. Wow. Best croissant I've ever had. Definitely tried to eat this as slowly as possible to savor the amazing flavors and texture. ALMOND-LEMON POUND CAKE. Moist, almond-y lemon-y goodness. The majority of the cake was almond, with the lemon flavoring concentrated in the top layer. The sweet and sour flavors really complimented one another. Finished this in two shakes of a lamb's tail. Must come back soon to try everything else in the bakery!

Not really being a sweets type of guy, I hardly ever look forward to desserts (with the exceptions being Mango Go-Go at 37degrees and Kings Hawaiian Paradise Cake).  I must admit that Tartine has made some awesome creations over the years! Tonight: I had the Passion Fruit cake with dried coconut crust. It was very interesting, the cake was fluffy: the texture was divine! The actual cake was tart yet the natural sweetness was just enough to make it the perfect shade of deliciousness. I love coconut. In fact, when I'm in Hawaii i normally go to that vendor guy who machettes the top for me, like twice a day during my vacations.  Some how dried coconut is a mere shadow of the real thing!  I know it's probably not feasible to have fresh young coconut topping, but that would be SO much better than the dried stuff.... The wait: not so bad tonight The cake: not sweet at all, yet the perfect dessert My tummy: satisfied as usual, thanks Tartine!

After hearing so much about this place from everyone else, I finally got the chance to come here with my sister and cousin! Between the three of us, we ordered a vegetarian quiche, the bread pudding, and the seasonal fruit tart. Quiche: very yummy and had a strong egg and cheese flavor Bread pudding: the bread was very moist, but this came with seasonal fruit..and I'm not really a fan of fruit in dessert Seasonal fruit tart: The crust was very good and crumbly!

Duh! What should you expect when you get to Tartine? Long lines, crowded tables, and expensive food. You better decide what you want to get before you make it to the counter. Everyone in the world is waiting behind you! This will be an expensive treat. What's good here? Everything! From the incredible pastries, croissants, cakes, and cookies with the perfect texture and crumb, to the sandwiches and quiches with interesting and delicious ingredients (sandwiches can take 15 minutes to make, so beware!). The best savory thing I've had at Tartine has to be the croque monsieur with mushrooms (rather than ham). The best sweet thing I've had at Tartine has to be the lemon bar. This is the quintessential bakery. A must.

If I lived a block away, I would go to this bakery. But since I live an ocean away and we made a stop at the Mission to see this, I felt like this was not extraordinary. Ordered the banana cream tart, morning bun, and coffee. I would consider going back for the morning bun but with the 15 minute line at the bakery's opening time (on a Tuesday for God's sake, don't people in SF work?), I'd probably go elsewhere. The banana cream tart was okay, pricey. I don't recommend their coffee, maybe I just got a bad batch. Staff seemed really stressed out. Probably the worst service I got while in SF. But I guess if I had to wake up early in the morning to bake then serve people on a Tuesday morning, I probably wouldn't be too pleasant either.

Well, you think that by coming here on a rainy cold afternoon, it will save you from the crowd? Wrong!  There was a line inspite of the pouring rain.  I guess nothing is stopping anyone from all those sweet temptations.  I'm glad the line went quick and I was able to secure a table. How can one start a low carb, high protein diet when a place like this exist in my neighborhood?  As I dig into my bread pudding (lemon cream and coconut cream tart and an eclair later, mmmmm), I realize I can't live without carbs.  So what?  I'm still a rock star, I've got my rock moves...

We stopped by a few weeks ago and wanted to grab a few tarts for my mom's birthday.  We drove past it twice because we couldn't find parking and also the line was out the door and we didn't know what the expected wait time would be.  My bf was nice enough to hop out of the car and get in line for me while I looked for a parking spot.  I was glad that I was able to find one shortly after I dropped him off. Once I got in line, the wait wasn't too bad.  The staff actually was quick with their service and was able to get the line moving.   I attempted to get the bannana cream tart, but they were sold out of it.  We ended up getting 3 small tarts.  We got the strawberries, coconut and the lime one.  Not a big fan of the lime one.  But the strawberries and coconut one was a hit. Hopefully the next time we head out here, they'll have the bannana cream one in stock.

This place was not worth the hype. It was overcrowded and loud. The service was short and not very good. before I could finish my order our server was on to something else and did not get the rest of what I wanted. The prices were a bit much for the baked goods. The morning buns were actually good, but the croque madames were not good at all. They were tough and chewy with a bitter flavor.  The coffee was flavorless at best and I would not order it again. This was not worth any trip.

We were among a small gathering of late lunchers and were second in line when we arrived. My husband and I shared a Sandwich (which are huge and very very rich) and a side salad and a slice of the lemon meringue cake. All was over-the-top rich and amazing. Service was just as poor as my previous visit which really did disappoint  as it was not busy. I have spent most of my life serving people and I try to be the best possible customer so when I get attitude from three different staff members in a span of five minutes it hurts. Then they lost my order again... only this time they admitted it and made a half-assed apology. How do you do that to the same customer twice? I also had to ask if the dirty dishes from the previous guest could be removed from the edge of our table as the food runner had brought us our lunch had neglected to notice there was a tower of crap there already. I really want to give these guys one more star because of the divine food but my service industry gut says no way. They need to revamp their order system and get a grip on how to treat people if they want locals coming in again and again.

One of my sister and I's favorite brunch places.  The pastries here are really decadent.  I recently found the recipe to their morning heavenly buns on the 7x7 magazine website and I'm going to be trying it out using Trader Joe's frozen croissant dough instead of from scratch...yum...http://www.7x7.com/content/food-­finds/tartines-heavenly-morning-buns-recipe. We always have really funny experiences when we're here...because the seating is so close together, you can eavesdrop on other people's conversations...we once had a guy comment on all our girl talk...it annoyed some of the girls in our group...but it made my sister and I laugh! :)  Another time a lady came in with a fur coat and our friend was absent-mindedly brushing her cheek up against it because it was so soft...we teased her mercilessly for that!  Fun times, fun times... oh, and the croissants here are incredible...the chocolate ones have whole pieces of Scharffenberger chocolate in them...

Dislike: Waited 45 minutes in line to place order and then another 20 minutes for a hot pressed pastrami sandwich which itself was a waste of time and money. Bread was too thick and too toasty. The horseradish sauce was overpowering. I'm sorry but it really can't measure up to some other deli joints. For instance, Carnegie Deli in NYC is the real deal where they give you like a pound of meat at a similar price and you can taste the pastrami. Like: Lemon cream tart: rich and creamy.  Tasty and tangy lemon but the whipped topping tasted like plastic.  We scraped it off and enjoyed the middle.  Crumble top berry muffin:  This had a raspberry middle that was a good combination with the crumble.  Good

Four not five stars because of the limited seating... but once you go, you'll know why the place is so crowded! I've been a few times, but the my recent trip was most fruitful (ha!) because I had the illustrious banana creme pie. Wow. The pie crust was crispy, then came a layer of solid chocolate, topped with banana filling and some kind of heavy whipped cream on top. Plus some chocolate shavings after that. I was full for what seemed like days. Well, I have been full for days anyway because it's the holidays and I'm off my normal routine... but after eating this pie, I actually turned down someone's offer of more chocolate. This is rare. Visit Tartine - you won't be sorry!

Tartine has been a bakery Gilbert H. has always wanted to try, and I'm glad we were able to stop by for a quick energy boost during our Mission District exploration date :D AMBIANCE The bakery itself is very small and neat, but packed to the brim with folks!  People of all ages filled the seats, and some patrons watched like hawks in order to swoop on a vacant table. There are a few metal tables/seats outside, but be wary that it may be a bit too windy for you.  We couldn't find seats inside, so we were forced to sit outside.  I'd say, sit at the tables furthest away from the corner of the street so you won't feel the wind from the cars rushing by. FOOD I wanted to eat EVERYTHING because it looked so delicious, but I knew my stomach would hate me later.  So the bf and I decided to just share two things, and grab a mocha.  Be aware: the regulars know exactly what they want, so don't take too long to order!! 1)  Coconut Cream Tart (4"-$6.35) "Flaky pastry coated in dark chocolate with pastry cream, and lightly sweetened cream." ---I'm a "crust" girl, meaning I loooovvveee flaky crusts / pastries!  And I fell in love with this pastry the first time I laid eyes on it.  Slightly on the hard side, you definitely have to use a knife to cut through this bad boy, but it will be worth it.  The little shavings of coconut are so scrumptious!  Let me just say that in the end, my plate was CLEAN. 2)  Chocolate Eclair ($4.65) "Filled with vanilla custard, dipped in Valrhona glaze." ---The boyfriend is an eclair kind of guy, so he wanted to see what the hulabaloo was all about.  The eclair was more on the cream side, which was fine by me because the taste didn't overpower my mouth (a plus!) 3)  Mocha Latte ...Mocha in a bowl? ...That's when you know it's legit. All kidding aside, Tartine's mocha's = amazingness in a bowl.  So cute, and just the right amount of sweetness.  Wonderful to sip on during a slightly cold, autumn day :) A cute bakery in the area that everyone in the area should stop by and try.  Yummy Mission District snack!!  I'm definitely coming back to try more food :D

Good things come to those who wait. I waited and Tartine delivered. I'm talkin' 'bout large, fresh, buttery croissants that tear apart with the slightest force of finger.  Yummy gougeres (baked pastry with gruyere cheese inside) and chocolate chip cookies (note: these came with bits of nuts, and are of the thin and crunchy texture) so large that I had to save half for later.  Definitely try their seasonal fruit tart... it looked strange at first, but the huckleberry's tanginess was a wonderful accompaniment with the sweet and buttery taste of the rest of the tart.  Combine it all with a simple house coffee (free refills!), and you'll for sure not leave disappointed. If you want something a little healthier, you can try the Muesli- but in my opinion: go big or go home!  Definitely will be back to try the rest of this wonderfully gluttonous bakery! =)

The food is good, but not great that I miss them, but I decided to revisit the bakery to try something new. So I went there for Wednesday lunch and the line was much shorter than usual. What a disappointment. I mean I could not get to the food. I was told it would take 20 minutes to make a sandwich. Come on! 20 minutes for a sandwich? Besides, their sandwich is not that complicated! When I asked for a croque-monsieur, the counter lady said they only have cheese for croque-monsieurs. Without ham, it is not a croque-monsieur. Then I asked for a tomato quiche which she recommended, she started, "Actually, you know...we don't have it right now..." I gave up and left. What really bothered me was the attitude of the staff. The counter lady, who sort of looked like Michelle Williams  with much more power, was an example, but none of the staff looked very friendly or helpful, at least when I was there. I ended up with Bi-Rite Market where I got a really good sandwich in a flash with friendly smiles :) Thank you, Bi-Rite!!

I still dream about that Lemon Tart. Came here on a whim, got what I expected and much more! It's a bit expensive for a bakery but you get what you pay for -NOM! Didn't feel like getting the much appraised Banana Cream Tart but will come back for it definitely. Instead we got the Lemon Tart and Bread Pudding. The pudding was nice and hot although it didn't look that great; but what can you expect from bread pudding? And that tart -sighhhh, so delicious I didn't want to eat it all. I felt so torn because part of me wanted to eat it and the other part wanted to save it so that I could build a shrine for it. But I figured the latter was a bit cray cray and ate it instead. YUM :) Atmosphere is really cute, but it's hard to get seats, thus -1 star. Parking is a beezy too but hey, what can you expect from that neighborhood? I NEED TO GET MY HANDS ON MORE OF THAT LEMON TART!!

Having just returned from some time in the coffee-proud and pastry -rich city of Vienna, my partner and I decided to go to Tartine for a late drizzly Saturday afternoon snack. We decided to give it a whirl since, for once, the line was not half the way up Guerrero Street. Even though the line was only inside, it still moved at a snail's pace. I echo all the sentiments previously expressed about Tartine's woeful operational deficiencies: why not have more service staff and both cashiers going at all hours when the bakery is full (which is most of the day)? When it came to my turn to order, miraculously a whole new tray of bread pudding arrived. So I ordered a bowl. But the food server started to spoon into what remained in the older tray. I asked for a serving of the fresh bread pudding. Aghast! How could I ask for such a thing? I got the arctic cold stare followed by an extremely self-important "humph!" The place was jam packed, not a seat to be had. Yet when we got to the cash register 3 seats opened up at the communal table. But wouldn't you know it a group from the very back of the line grabs the seats! I calmly walked over and in a very polite tone informed them that there were people already in line waiting for the seats. Two of the women look like I just insulted their first born child while the guy gets all belligerent on me! We ask the cashier what the seating policy is, only to be told "oh, people just do what they want." I have had this kind of experience a number of times at Tartine now. Enough is enough. Sure, some of the selection is prepared wonderfully. For example, I think their almond croissants are the best in the City. A lot of other items are above average. But then there is plenty of stuff that is average at best. In short, some good finds, but nothing justifies the horrendous waits, haughty staff, bad seating, lousy staffing and operational patterns, and rude customers. If you can get in at "off hours" and get the food to go then you probably will be one lucky pasty hound! Update: the last few times I have been there the staff has been more friendly in the past. Also, I stay away from "peak" hours, so the seating and noise madness is not so noticeable.

If it were for food alone, 5 stars. It's unique and delicious.The hefty chunks of fantastic bread smothered in rich mustard and savory ham & cheese (Jambon Royale & Gruyere) are a perfect balance between rustic and delicate. Same with the Croque Monsieur. Fantastic pastries and cakes, of course. Tartine is typically very busy, but you get the feeling it would be kind of a clusterfrack even if it weren't. My gripe is the somewhat complex workflow involved in lining up, dealing with people dragging their bikes in, ordering food, ordering drinks possibly at a 2nd counter, finding a place to sit at communal tables and bussing your stuff after. There really isn't any direction from signage, or from the staff (who are really sweet, but seem to be on another plane most of the time). Nobody is in much of a hurry about anything, which is part of its charm, but also always makes me think: "I wonder if they're gonna get this order right?". The place just seems to work based on the fact that most of the customers are regulars who just "get it".  You just kind of have to wander through and hope you're doing it right, and that those around you know what they're doing. Screw it. 5 stars. I love the place.

The fantastic pizza just round the corner was too packed so... Gave Tartine another try.  Had one of the little bread / cheese spreads with tomato.  It was fairly tasty, but for $10... ummm... well... really?  $10? When quality food meets a reasonable price, I'm a big fan.  Great food here, but that's the end of the story.

Yeah, it's good... but not ridiculous line/ crazy rep good. the lemon cream tart was pretty damn delicious, but i dont know about 6.95 delicious. The bread pudding was mediocre, and the mixed fruit tart was good at best. I was really excited to go this place and really wanted it to live up to its expectations, but.... that was a no go. Although the random Italian guy behind me who insisted that his guide book said the best thing to order is the jam tartine, and that we should totally share to find out if it's true. And insisted the entire remaining time I was in line that we share. That was when I decided to do take away instead of eating in. Maybe next time.

MY FAVS: The croissants...chocolat or plain...soo good with your bev of choice in the morning..tea, coffee, milk, diet coke...They are so flaky and each layer just melds into buttery goodness. Chocolate cake is a great bad day pick me up, the cake part is heavy, but the filling inbetween melts and coats your tongue with chocolate, which entices you to..take..one..more bite. I am allergic, but my husband loves the tarts....he loves the chocolate, cream and banana flavors that the tart brings together. It's a must have for him. The one star is knocked off and I am not sure if it is Tartine's fault or if it is the price of fame: the uber long lines, the lack of signage, and for first timers, a tough time knowing what in the world there is to order until it is waay too late because you are already at the counter. Otherwise, worth the wait, there are tables, but good luck getting one, and same thing goes for parking. If you can, come on a weekday morning and the line won't be as long.

After seeing a picture on yelp of the pastrami sandwich at Tartine, I knew what I was having for lunch that day. I have been warned that the line can get crazy, but apparently we timed it right because it wasnt out the door yet! Finding seating was a little tricky, but after a few minutes of wandering around, we grabbed a table that someone just got up from. That is the only slightly eh thing about this spot..more seating would be awesome, but then again, that would take away from the cozy-ness...sooo just be prepared to eye out a spot as soon as you walk in, even though you will be completely distracted by the bakery case... So, the pastrami sandwich.... Pastrami, Gruyere, Horseraddish, and mustard- all in between two toasty pieces of bread. I want it again. 13 dollars, 3 good sized triangles, totally enough to share..and then you can have room for a treat! That was my mistake..I saved one triangle of the sandwich, and was still too full to try any of the desserts that visit. I was eyeing the lemon tart, and those mexican wedding cookies though..and knew it wouldnt be long before I returned to those babies. Truth be told, I was back within a week, and tried both. Do yourself a favor....go in, get yourself a cup of coffee- FYI CASH only for the coffee bar, and a lemon tart...and expeience true love. Mexican wedding cookies must be good because I overheard a gentleman tring to buy them all up. However, the pretty girl behind the counter broke his sweet heart, and told him she could sell him 12 max. That way she had some for other customers throughout the day. I liked that. I got one, and some kind of chocolate drop cookie to go. Ummmm, I understand why that man wanted alllllll the mexican wedding cookies!!!!!! Even a 12 max limit could get a little danergous...  the other cookie was yumyum as well. Tartine, you and me are like a match made in heaven.

Anyone that says that "these are just pastries"... I need to know where you are getting your goods.  The morning bun here is the closest thing to religion that I have had in about 10 years. Yeah, the line is too long. No one that works there is that nice.  Who cares?  I mean have you eaten this stuff? Whoa.

Tartine Bakery is saturated with Yelp reviews for good reason. I understand I am but an echo; thus, I will keep it brief. --------------------------------------------------­--------------------------------- 1. In sum: Natural. Rich. Whole. Delicious. Communal. Euro-Homey. 2. Personal reflection: This delightful bakery nook embodies what I want my culinary life to be. 3. Tasting tidbit: The opera cake, seasonal bread pudding with cranberries, and cappuccino were all decadent. 4. Savvy suggestion: Bring friends and grab some goodies to share. 5. Irrelevant insecurity: I am unsure how I feel about the terms:  "saturated" (in the literary sense) and "Euro-Homey" - but insist on their accuracy in this entry.

I'm not one to wait to look for parking 3 blocks away, I'm not one to wait in a line out the door on a Saturday morning, in general I was pessimistic at the possible taste of a croissant for breakfast - but lucky I was wrong! Parking wasn't so bad in turned out and on a beautiful, sunny day in the city it was a pleasant few block walk.  The small line out the door was alarming at first, as well as the intensely crowded small bakery - but in general the line was quick, the patrons friendly in a low hum and I was still questioning this supposed amazing croissant I had been promised. The counter girl and cashier were both friendly and quick with such a crowd and soon we were off with our breakfast.  I chose the ham croissant and  . . . . . oh my!  It was sooo buttery, flakey, flavorful, the ham not too salty or over powering but a perfect combination!  I devored it and was soon sadly left with crumbs in my lap. Worth the wait, crowd and I hope to be back soon!

Just as a note to tourists: dont get 1.5 things from here for breakfast. Its too much... butter. My friend and I split the banana cream tart and I had a almond croissant and she had a quiche. We couldnt finish our individuals. Especially not first thing in the morning. The almond croissant was pretty good and it was the biggest I've ever seen at 3.75. I like the marzipan a lot cause it had so much almonds on it. but its not as sweet as those in new york. The banana cream tart was a second fav. My only problem was that the crust was pretty hard. Though, if I ever have a chance to come back here, I would like to try out ALL of their pastries. They look so damn appealing.

I love pastry shops! Aww... reminds me of Paris. The shop is small, quaint and casual. The pastries a little pricey, but they're large. Some items I tried were: DOUBLE PAIN AU CHOCOLATE - 3.5 stars BANANA CREAM TART - 4 stars LEMON CREAM TART - 3 stars ECLAIR - 3 stars WALNUT CURRANT COOKIE - 4 stars, my fav Street parking spots are very limited. So walk or take public transportation.

Look: Tartine is good. The presentation is excellent and the pastries, cakes, and cookies all look mouth-wateringly delicious. I've have eaten a morning bun (or two), pain au chocolat, and a hazelnut tart. Really, they're tasty. But... I can't help but feel like the reviews are way overblown. I have to subtract a star because the line is normally so long as to not be worth it. Getting a table inside or out seems so close to impossible that I've never even wanted to try. And while the staff is friendly and helpful, I feel like there is some kind of haughty vibe coming from the whole cafe. "We are Tartine and we are better than you. End of story." It's good...but maybe not as life-changing as one might expect it to be. Still, I'll eat a Tartine morning bun any day and won't say no to a good pastry, regardless of where it comes from.

Went here the other day after attempting to play tennis at windswept Dolores Park.  Luckily, didn't encounter a winding line I've heard this place has during weekends. This joint has an exquisite, aroma very Euro, and the employees all seem other worldly as well. Had the house iced coffee $2.79, which may actually get me closer to drinking proper coffee.  It was refreshing and spot on with a swig of soy milk and 1.5 packets of Splenda.   Good people watching area, major foot traffic on neighboring Guerrero.

Expensive goodies, but pretty worth it! I went here for the first time yesterday and I tried the Fruit Tart and the Ham&Squash Quiche. They were delicious. I would definitely come back here again for another tart. Maybe not a quiche though, because it's no different from other quiches i've had in the past but it's still good. I'm a big fan of quiche so all of them taste good to me hah. The atmosphere is really cool too. I like bakeries like this where it's ok to be solo and eating by yourself. AND i like the outdoor patio.

4.5, because I've never been inside. My friend brought me a berry tart and an eclair. We'd already had pizza and BiRite ice cream, so I took them home safely encased in their box. I was careful to keep them upright for over an hour while walking, on muni, and on bart. I'm about to open the door to my car when I drop the box with the goodies inside. Small scream. Cursing. Pathetic sulking all the way home. Lucky for me, everything was still delicious and only slightly mangled. That has got to be the best eclair I've ever had. Good quality, smooth chocolate on the outside that doesn't melt too quickly. A crust slightly softened by refrigeration but still dry and encasing the vanilla bean custardy creamy filling. The eclair is a good companion to the berry tart (especially smashed together), as all the berries are fresh and the custard they're sitting on top of is even more delicious than that inside the eclair. It's not the same filling but it, too, did not render the crust soggy. These two desserts are extremely well executed and definitely worth breaking any diet you're on for. If you're gonna eat sweets, do it right. These treats survived a bad fall and several days in the fridge with me picking at them. I highly recommend them and will be stopping by the next time I'm in the area. A lovely surprise for friends or just for yourself!

If you don't like hassle going in here? Fall in line before they open in the morning. It gets pack easily I mean this place is always packed. Come on it's one of the best bakery in town! You must try this: Morning buns Banana cream tart Bread pudding Croissants Lemon tart Buttermilk scone I never like eating my goodies inside this establishment. Small, all tables and chairs are so close to each other that you can't just stand up and move around. So, drop by and go somewhere quiet... And ahhh! Slowly bite your goodies... I once tried their coffee here and Nah! I don't like their coffee... :( That's the only negative in the menu. Tartine is a winner...

Parking was horrible and there's always a line when you know it's a good place to get pastries! It was so packed inside we had to get our food to go and we got the morning roll which was delicious! It was nice and crunch and it had a orange twist, yum! I didn't like the bread pudding. It was my first time trying and probably my last. I guess it had to do with the texture and also the fruit was really chewy and you get it in a cup, but since we got it to go we had to get it in a box and the presentation didn't look very appealing =( Lastly, the popular banana cream tart had a lot of whip cream on top and I wish it had more of that yummy pudding. It was a nice personalize size, but I shared with the bf and it had a good amount of banana and was really tasty. I just wish the tart wasn't so hard and easier to eat, but other than that I liked it and also the fresh shaved chocolate on top :)

So glad I live nowhere near here, otherwise I'd easily take off 10 years of my life from overeating. 20+ minutes waits are completely worth it and if your favorite items are missing, its easy to find other great options - the staff are super friendly, so you forget you had been waiting forever. Morning bun - Half way between a sticky cinnamon roll and a brioche. Very good, better when heated. Almond croissant - Really freakin' good Bread pudding - Light, texture between a fluffy quiche and a flan. Never thought fruit topping  would be good, but it was the best part. Tres Leches Cake -   Not very milky but so moist, perfectly layered - didn't even make it out the store Lemon bar - Average Gougere - Needs to be cheesier Mexican Wedding Cookie - A good version of this cookie Ham Quiche - Flaky buttery crust, textbook Coconut cream pie = crack cocaine. In order to make up for all the damage I'm going to do next time, I'll have to walk the two miles there and back, but it will be so worth it.

This place is amazing. It has some of the best baked goods you can find in SF, which is why it's so hard to give it a three star rating. The fact is that the line for this place is ridiculous. I would imagine it could take someone more than a half hour to endure waiting in this line, however I have only tried waiting once when it was crowded. After waiting for more than fifteen minutes and not even making it past the front door--I left. If you want to enjoy this place, I would probably say to get here in the early morning, although I can't say it's any less crowded from experience. I love you Tartine, but I refuse to wait.

I've said it before and I'll say it again... it's a damned good thing that Tartine is 6 blocks away and not 2 or I'd easily weigh 300lbs. I guess I am biased in that I can walk but the lines have never bothered me, the staff has always been friendly and the pastries are phenomenal. It's a staple visit for all of my out of town guests and I have a hard time keeping them away once introduced. Once my friend and I arrived too early and sat on a bench underneath their vent hood... the smell of buttery goodness was almost too much to handle. For those who still feel scorned or skeptical - I urge you to find me a better ham and cheese croissant - I will willingly accept the challenge.

Is it worth the line?  Maybe...So I finally got to try the infamous Tartine Bakery.  And after my great experiences with Bar Tartine and waiting half an hour in line, I had high expectations!  Did it live up to all the hype?   The food did!...we had a delicious strawberry bread pudding; the quiche was tasty; the ham and cheese croissant was flaky and buttery; and the jambon and gruyere pressed sandwich, took 20 minutes, but it was melty and steaming hot when it came out. But, Tartine gets a minus star for the long line, long wait for food after you order...but definitely has cute atmosphere if it weren't so crowded on a Sat. afternoon!

Went to Tartine because I love bread pudding. After reading rave reviews of Tartine's bread pudding, I knew I had to try it. The claims of giant portions is true. I got the bread pudding to go and my little box was so heavy! Unfortunately, the bread pudding was not quite tasty enough for me to relish the ginourmous slice I had been given. My problem with the bread pudding was simply that there was not enough custard and the flavor was too bland. Just kinda sweet with no real eggy-ness or apple-ness. Just a blah-ness. However, their Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian cake was really good. The passion fruit filling in the cake was so flavorful and tasty I ate out most of the middle before my SO could take more than a bite or two. :D The cake was moist and soft. The coconut shavings on the outside were a little hard and bland, but you just ignore that part. Croissants were OK. Not the best on the West Coast as claimed by that NY Times guy... but it was flaky on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. Flavor was lightly buttery.

Frankly, I think this place is overrated. Don't get me wrong -- their sweets are delish. And I like their bread. And a friend ordered a coconut-covered passionfruit cream cake for her birthday, and that was mighty tasty. And I liked the fancy chocolate pudding from here that J. gave me for my own birthday last year. Another plus: I like seeing all the different kinds of dogs that hang around with their owners outside, on-site. But I get tired of all the brouhaha around Tartine, all of the write-ups in national publications. And, okay, I don't like their brittle version of the humble chocolate chip cookie. And the lines are ridiculous. I'm giving Tartine a backlash rating of three stars! Unfair? Perhaps. Not in keeping with my generally positive review of their food? Maybe. But sometimes gut feeling, apart from more objective evaluations, is what it's about.

Tartine is Tartine you should go there.  If you live in SF you probably have. I have nothing to add to any other reviews other then I could eat their bread pudding everyday, have a heart attack at 28, so I try and stay away or I just remind myself I have more important things to do then stand in line for baked goods everyday of my life. __________________________________________________­_____ Revision 4.19.09 from 5 Starts to 3 Stars __________________________________________________­_____ I have to say on a few more trips to this place that I absolutely love the Passion Fruit Bavarian Cake but will no longer be going into the establishment by the general unpleasant nature of the employees.  The product is great and for that you should try it but the people there are the worst!

My friend Max has a wise saying: "A line outside the door means the place doesn't suck." ;-) Tartine's line was long...but so worth it. Don't go when you're hungry, otherwise you'll do what I did and spend $20 on pastries -- everything looked so good! Ordered 2 morning buns and 2 tarts.

Not sure why people are so obsessed with Tartine.   I heard so much about this place and even read about it online before I moved to this city.  I was very disappointed.  I've been there 3-4 times and after I visit each time, thinking it will be better the next time because I didn't order the right items, but no luck. First of all, I love real French pastry.  There is simply nothing like it in the world.  It's just one of the great creations of mankind.  And for some reason, Americans just cannot reproduce it, including Tartine.  The baked goods are just  too dry, often over baked and not flavorful enough.  The texture is not on the mark.  The croissants just don't taste like a real French Croissant - not layered, tasty and buttery enough.  The cakes and bread pudding are just okay, nothing unusual.  The banana cream pie is the only item I've had there that actually stood out.  Other than that, it's just very ordinary... just a bit better than your average bakery with a rustic French presentation/exterior.  I guess I just have to continue to search for that real French bakery in SF.

I come here religiously for breakfast when I come to visit. My idea of a perfect SF breakfast involves a croissant, large fresh squeezed orange juice and an americano. Nothing more, nothing less. Ok, I'm feeling overly indulgent, perhaps the chocolate pudding, because it's also incredible. I highly recommend the place. It's so quaint, the staff is uber friendly and the area is great for a nice walk to kill off some off the calories ; )

I finally had the chance to go to Tartine Bakery after church last Sunday.  I've attempted to go a couple of times, but every time I drove away because of the huge line outside.  However, this Sunday I decided to just wait it out and see.  I waited 30 minutes, but it is totally worth it.  We had an almond croissant & a morning bun.  Morning bun was ok....I can live without it....but the Almond Croissant was amazing!!! AMAZING!  It is the best croissant I've ever had.   I saw a ton of people ordering the bread putting with fruit on the top.  I am not a bread putting person but it looks like almost everyone there had a bowl. To all that wants to try this place... definitely go and wait! It's totally worth it.  I am a huge fan and definitely am going back often.

Bread is the star of the show at Tartine, for sure. The closer your item gets in bread-ness to a straight up fresh baked batard, the better. That is to say, puffs and macaroons = meh, quiche and tarts = ok, gougere and frangipane croissant = great, bread pudding and fresh baked loaves = outstanding. Definitely worth the wait if you're in the area.

If you have a chance to head over early in the morning... their fresh croissants can not be beat. Flaky on the outside, warm and buttery on the inside. Incredible. I am also a fan of the vegetarian quiche.   All of the baked goods here are delicious and buttery. The sandwiches on the other hand... a little too heavy. I'm not sure if the issue is just that they don't have any great vegetarian sandwich options.

If only San Francisco is not up, up, and away, Tartine will be my favorite hot spots. - banana cream pie. super duper rich and smooth blend of whipped cream and banana custard. it's crusty, rich, and filling. out of this world lusciousness. - chocolate mousse pudding. amazingly silky rich but not overly sweet. I love it. SO much. - bread pudding. the legendary bowl might be moist and soft but I'm not a fan.

How sad that I didn't make it to this bakery earlier in the day!  I finally found my way over here around 6:30, and by that time most of the sweets had sold out.  The bakery, however, was still fairly packed with customers sipping on espresso and eating croque monsieur.   A friend and I split a slice of lemon meringue cake, and while I noticed it didn't get much mention on Yelp, it was still delicious.  The meringue was  light and the perfect complement to the tart, dense, lemon cream and cake.  I wish that there had been slightly more of the merigue actually, because when I reached the center of the cake I was missing it and all I was getting was the cream.   I definitely want to come back here earlier in the day and try the chocolate croissants.  The fact that a mere left over pastry was so good gives me a lot of hope that everything else is much better.

Stumbled upon a long line near Mission Dolores and decided to try it out. Everything looked amazing. It ended up being good, but very packed and the servers were really haughty. I tried to ask one what her favorite thing on the menu was, and she just scoffed at me and said mumbled something about that being a hard question to answer. YEAH. DIFFICULT FOR YOU, because you probably haven't patronized your own place well enough to know. Or aren't very good at promoting. We finally got the open faced sandwhich.. which was okay, but nothing spectacular. Average ingredients, kinda cold. We also had one of the desserts which was delicious, but really over priced. Don't get savory here- get sweet- but that might be my sweet tooth talking. Overall I would say its one of those hyped foodie places in the Mission.

What the heck, I just started Yelp with 2 reviews containing the name Baker (Baker's Chem-Dry Green Carpet Cleaning and Baker Beach), so I thought real hard to come up with a kick-ass baker name, and Tartine Bakery had to be the one. You cannot go wrong with the cookies and croissants, but I adore the bread pudding. And I buy the morning buns and take them home for heating and eating. What a scrumptious way to spend a Sunday morning, a bit of home brewed coffee and a morning bun from Tartine. Mmmmm. extra good.

Had never been here until a couple of weeks ago...glad I finally got to experience it. Got the Ham croque monsieur, chocolate croissant,  morning bun, and a coffee. (don't worry, I shared) Everything, including the coffee, was great. I NEED to go back and try the ham/cheese croissant. That's my guilty pleasure...I wanted so badly to order one when I went, but didn't want to look like too much of glutton. I always thought Arizmendi was the best bakery in the city, but this definitely gives it a run for it's money.

I still love this place.  I love their frangipine tarts, their morning buns, and they make the best croissants.  But I'm taking away a star...nothing significant I know, but if you're the owners of this place, or some of the staff members who work here and are reading this..... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE can you speed up your service!!!?!??!? I don't mean Flash Gordon type speed now, I just mean, be a little more efficient than a snail!  A line is out the door, and you only have one cashier who's taking her sweet ass time reading the manual on how to install a new roll of receipt paper.  I mean, come on people, we have croissants to stuff down our face, and you're leisurely chatting away with other staff members, walking around looking for dust, watching paint dry...i could go on. Seriously, be a little more efficient at doing things, try to keep ringing up each customer under 5 minutes...not even kidding!  This isn't a one time thing either, every time I've gone, it's always the same, the cashiers think they're really working in lazy Paris, watching the sky turn dark. In the mean time, i'll just have to block out an extra hour every time I want to come here to pick up some delicious wasted calories, or an entire day if I even dare eating here.

Tartine the Bakery! It should be known as "The Bakery" because everything there is so damn good. We went for brunch on a weekday, and to our surprise, we got in line and got a seat really easily. The double pain au chocolat is a miracle itself. It came to me warm, crispy, flakey, and the chocolate inside was rich, creamy, and nicely melted. Every bite of the chocolate croissant was worth it. It was crispy without being too greasy; it was nice and warm without being soggy. and check this out HOT PRESSED SANDWICHES Spicy Turkey  $13 Peppered turkey breast, provolone, broccoli rabe pesto How can you read that and not be drooling? The sandwich was better than Ike's in my opinion, but to be fair, they're not exactly the same thing. Let's just say they're tied, but I would choose this over Ike's any given day. The flavor of the sandwich was overwhelming; the spiced turkey breast, the nicely melted provolone, cheese, and the pesto paste was phenomenal. We also got a latte and a hot chocolate; they're so frothy and creamy it's unreal. Avoid rush hours if you can, and you'll definitely have a great time!

Tartine is pricey, but I can guarantee every penny you spend goes towards amazing baked goods. I highly recommend the lemon poppyseed pound cake - it may not look like much, but when I took my first bite I actually gasped in surprise - there is a thin layer of crunchy sweetness on the outside! The cake itself is surprisingly light, perfectly balanced by the fresh lemon flavor. The frangipane croissant is also wonderful, once you make your way through the crunchy outer layers there's a layer of smooth almond filling blended with the fluffy inside...mm!!  And I don't even like croissants! Tartine has officially converted me. As others have said, expect a huge line and nowhere to sit. But I really don't care if I have to take it to go - as long as I get to savor Tartine's delicious goods I'll be happy.

There are so many reviews of this place it's going to be difficult-to-impossible to say anything that hasn't already been said, and I'm not about to read close to 300 reviews to sort that out. So at the risk of being redundant... Of course Tartine makes lots of really wonderful, beautiful things both sweet and savory. There's no denying it. But as other reviewers have aptly pointed out, the lines are long (often even at 'off' times), and a place to sit can be super hard to come by (leaving you standing there dumbly, trying to juggle a plate, a bowl and a cup of coffee). The employees are also prone to acting like they're doing you a really big favor by deigning to take your hard-earned money or put your order in a box/bag/on a plate, which is a little bit tiresome (although I'm sure the endless stream of customers is tiresome to them too...). But now, at the risk of sounding like the Antichrist, I'm going to say this: there's too much chocolate in the pain au chocolat. I don't care if it's Scharffen Berger -- there's just too much of it! The balance of pastry and chocolate goo is...well...not balanced. This is my opinion, I realize, but I do have some street cred in that I lived in France for four years and have eaten a lot of chocolate croissants in a lot of different places. And finally, I like their quiches --the egg part-- but the pastry is poopy. It's kinda soggy and tough and often tastes slightly burned. I want light and flaky and buttery! (I refer you to my byline, or headline, or whatever it's called. 'nough said.) Aside from all that, I truly do like Tartine and regularly subject myself to the haughty treatment of the cashiers in exchange for a little piece of edible heaven...like a lemon tart, or an open face croque-monsieur.

So, why does Tartine need another review?  Why am I compelled to bang my keyboard on a place that you already know is good? Because we did something really geeky and cheesy on the surfance but turned out to be incredibly fun.  We hosted a "Croissant-Off."  It all started with a Montague-Capulet  "I am better than YOU" non-sensical feud on whose almond croissant was better - Tartine or La Boulange? [for those of you rolling your eyes right now because you know the answer already, do continue to read on.  promise it'll be fun] So one Sunday, many baked goods were purchased from Tartine and La Boulange - almond croissants, plain croissants, pain au chocalate, various specialty ones from L.B., and of course the Ham&Cheese. We geeked out - we did a whole scoring card thing.  We decided the categories (appearance and taste, with taste counted double).  We scored, we rated, we tallied, we try to figure out who had similarity taste in. I'll spare you all the gory details, but we found that once and for all, the almond croissant ("Frangipane") at Tartine simply demonlished the one from L.B.  Everyone around the table, including the Capulets who swore by L.B. concurred.  However, the pain croissant came in just the opposite - L.B. 's was almost perfect.  Light, just crunchy on the outside, moist/flaky inside.  The one from Tartine was a little too crispy (it wasn't too baked, I think Tartine just like to make theirs crispier). One of the funnest brunch we've hosted - and the caloric count was not nearly as bad as we thought.  We basically ended up each eating about 1.5 pastry.

Very good bakery for SF.  While I won't say Tartine's quality comes near any bakery in Europe, it hits the spot for the US and this city.  Great coffee, good pain au chocolat, and filling/cheese-covered sandwiches are quite delish. The lines, staff, service, and crowd leave a lot to be desired so I will only go back if I can just take my order and get the hell out. Also, the basic croissant is not that great.  And since this is a self-proclaimed french bakery, it is the staple it should have down pat.

If you are easily seduced by cake, pastries, bread pudding, quiche, and latte in a bowl, this is your happy place. I got a cup of bread pudding, a latte, and shared a french thing that I can't name but can describe as a hunk of really divine bread toasted with fresh mozzarella and sundried tomato with a side of pickled baby carrots. The pudding was topped with caramel and appples, and just the right firmness for me. Best strategy? Go with 2 friends, and share. Don't go wiht more than 2, as seating is hard to manuever then.

MUST HAVES: 1)  Banana Cream Tart 2)  Coconut Cream Tart 3)  Quiche 4)  Chocolate Pudding 5)  Meringue 6)  Ham & Cheese Croissant 7)  Country Loaf Bread Basically --- EVERYTHING and ANYTHING!  They also offer up my favorite Pouilly Fume (imported by Kermit Lynch, of course) by the glass. Sigh. Keep in mind space is limited --- so it's best to go solo or with a buddy to stake out a spot.  Great ambiance for reading, writing and people watching.  One of my preferred spots in the Mission to catch a breather. The staff can be friendly.  I stress that middle word because I've had a few tangy servers --- not enough to annoy me to the point of not returning, though.

I really don't think ANY other bakery in the Bay Area compares to Tartine in terms of quality. I think Dottie's is comparable in terms of its pastries, but they don't sell them to go. There used to be this tall svelte brunette model girl who worked the cash register and the mere sight of her along with the smell of freshly baked goods from the kitchen was enough to make me weak in the knees. She's no longer there, but it remains as damned stupendous as always.

Tartine is a great spot to have a cup of coffee and a sweet pastry.  My wife and I came here and had a latte (the cups are big enough to share for two) and a banana cream chocolate tart.  Both were delicious and the tart was bursting with flavor. We were lucky enough to get a table outside and enjoyed our afternoon snack people watching. The one thing I didnt really care for is that you have to bus your own tables.  You would think they would have staff to take care of that for the prices that they are charging.

Best pastry I've EVER HAD. I stopped in here this morning for an hour for some coffee and nourishment, and Oh My. The Apple Turnover was pure perfection! The house coffee was also very good. Also, I'm new to San Francisco, and my husband and I noticed how cool it was that this French Bakery is actually owned and run by a French woman. Very cool. She was very kind and provided wonderful service. The only thing I'd mention is that around 10am, lots of high school students come in for a snack/early lunch, so it tends to get a little bit noisy, but it's not annoying. :)

I went here with some friends 4th of July weekend. It was hella busy but they moved the line pretty fast. I was super excited to eat here but had no idea i was gonna love it so much. I ordered the Croque Monsieur (an open face sandwich), and my friends ordered the mozzarella & tapenade sandwich, the spicy turkey sandwich and one other one i cant remember. First off, the four of us could have shared 2 sandwiches. They were ridiculously huge, and quit honestly the best I have ever tasted. I also had a fruit tart which was good. I have been thinking of this place every since. The only thing is there isnt enough eating space, but thats always how it is when a place is so tasty. I have to go back soon. Maybe this sunday. Happy face!

Laundry plan: Load it all and make a quick run for pastry and latte. Arrived at Tartine just before it opened on Saturday morning, and there was already 10 people in line.  My mom and I tried the morning bun, croissant, and seasonal fruit torte. The morning bun and croissant were perfect, nice and flaky on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.   The latte was delicious! The espresso to milk ratio was perfect.  I feel some people add too much milk and you can't really taste the espresso.  The served it in what looked like a small bowl, very charming! Already looking forward to my next early morning Tartine Bakery run!

Lured by the hundreds of good reviews, I drove an hour to SF on an early Saturday morning.  By 9.30am, the line was wrapped around the corner and extended beyond the two long benches.  Seems like waiting is part of the dining ritual, nobody complained and everyone in line seemed excited or just focused at the menu. Inside the bakery, there are four or five wooden tables for shared use.  Besides ordering, everything else is self service, including geting water and putting the plates away.   By the time it was our turn, it was around 10.30am, which was too early for their sandwich (not available till 11am) and too late for a hot out of the oven morning bun.  But we ordered anyways. -Eclair: This took us by surprise.  Hubby wanted to order the chocolate pudding next to it but the pointing angle was probably off.  I wasn't in the mood of eating this ugly and too sweet looking worm shape pastry but I gave it a bite anyhow and OMG was I wrong!  The creme filling inside was so light and chilly that it meallowed down the chocolate covering by a ton and the end result was a tasty well balanced not too sweet delight!  We finished it in no time. -Breadpudding: i love how much fruits were on the top, although a bit sweet at the end, it was delicious! -Hazelnut chocolate tart: Huge hazelnuts on top and very dark rich chocolate filling in the middle.  In fact, the chocolate was a bit too hard and overpowering for me.  It's not a good combination with the other three items we ordered, but I could imagine it tasted powerful on its own. -Morning bun: I don't get it.  Maybe it is heavenly when it is warm, but in cold room temperature, it's just an orangle flavor sweet sugar glazed big bun that I actually felt bored eating. Not much service at the counter and the line setup made it ineffective for people who want to see everything from the display before ordering.  We ended up call back a waiter to get us the last order before paying.

This has to be the most popular corner in San Francisco (that doesnt involve trannies at least). I was there for 3 hours and I don't think I ever saw a break in the line that was out the door. Don't let that derail you though, the line moves pretty fast and it's worth the wait. I've been told to go back early to get the sticky buns which tend to run out by the afternoon. However, they have an amazing selection of cheese sandwiches (as well as meat filled, but i stopped looking after I saw cheese) and freshly baked treats. You really can't go wrong with any choice. The coffee is just as good and the barista is quick with the cups. Note that if you want just a regular coffee though, you get it yourself from a dispenser.... The place is super small, cozy and has that neighborhood vibe that just makes you want to say CHEERS. It's easy access right off the 16th street Bart station and if it's a nice day, take your treats to Dolores park!

There are currently over 2600+ reviews about Tartine!  As if they need another!!  I will humor them anyway...   So my girlfriends and I love to do SF food tours.  I grew up here but there are always new restaurants to try.  Every few months we visit the latest & greatest.  There is no better way to spend quality time with friends than over a shared meal.  Well, in our case, it was 10 in one day!!  Tartine has been consistently at the top of everyone's list so this was our 1st stop of our food tour. The morning bun is their specialty but I actually find it a little too dry for my taste.  I've been here a few times, each time hoping it will be a little more moist but it just not that kinda pastry.   Definitely need a cup of joe to wash it down with.  I've also tried their croissants- plain & chocolate, grougere, & lemon tarts which are all delectable.

Friends swear by this place, and from the 514 reviews it seems that Yelpers do too. But the number of times I've been here I haven't found myself that enthused by the pastries. Maybe I'm ordering wrong? I've tried the Morning bun, the tarts, the pudding, etc. etc. and I still don't see why everyone loves this place. The prices, the limited sitting, and the ridiculously long line don't seem worth the wait. If you're not from the Mission or a nearby neighborhood I'd opt for your local bakery.

I'm not a huge bakery guy, so take this with a grain of salt (which I prefer, actually). Delightfully, I was brought there for my birthday and ordered a devil's food cake slice AND a banana creme torte thing and found a seat at one of the communal near-picnic tables. I have to say, these pastries were everything I expected: rich, large, carefully made, and delicious. The hardest thing to do was decide on something to order. Did I mention that I went there on my birthday? I didn't experience a line at all; in fact, I walked in and they asked me what I wanted immediately. So, 10-10:30am on a Tuesday is a good time to go, apparently.

I dream of Tartine every night and wake up jonesing every morning.  I think my girlfriend is tired of hearing me every saturday and sunday morning.  She likes to sleep in.  All I care about is getting to Tartine before the lines of people. The morning bun... it doesn't get any better.   If they served Blue Bottle coffee, I'd have probably moved in upstairs instead of around the corner. One tip:  Go *right* after 5pm Wednesday through Sunday  and get a fresh baked loaf of bread.  I recommend the country bread.  Now, make your own tartine: 1 thick slice of their heavenly bread a generous spread of cowgirl creamery creme fraiche local lox-style smoked salmon (find the guy at the Ferry Bldg Farmers Market for a real treat) sliced cucumbers (try persian cucs!) chopped chives fresh ground pepper It's the only way I can survive not eating there every day...

I was very, very excited to try Tartine, as my friends have been hyping it up now for months.  I have the biggest sweet tooth, and a passion for pastry.  But I wasn't so impressed when I finally tried it. I went with my cousin, and we ordered the chocolate hazelnut tart and the bread pudding.  I had ordered a double shot of espresso to balance the sweetness of the hazelnut tart, as it usually compliments it well.  I thought that the actual tart was nice as it was flaky and had great consistency.  The chocolate hazelnut filling was rather mainstream and lackluster, however.  Nutella would have tasted better and been less preparation, I'm sure. I was rather disappointed with the bread pudding, since it was my friend's favorite treat.  The consistency was rather soft, and it had a strange tartness to it.  It just doesn't come close to the bread pudding you get in the South, and maybe because of that frame of reference I didn't have as good an experience.  Maybe next time I'll bring in some rum to drench it in...maybe it would make me a little happier to eat it. The one saving grace was the espresso I had.  It tasted like piss, but it kept me up all night. That is a rare feat to achieve given this caffeine tolerant twenty six year old that started chugging espressos since my first days at Lowell High School in 1995.  Maybe next time a sweeter pastry would help me get the buzz while masking the taste.

Ever since I was introduced to this yummy palace of delights, I cannot pass it without enjoying a little something (or more).  I would say I am satisfied 99% of the time (the 1% only from the time my car was hit while I was parked in the neighborhood, but this is SF, right?!).   Favorite item?  Banana cream tart!!!  Can't beat this, with chocolate, caramel, sliced bananas, and yummy custard in every bite.   Only complaint is the parking.  Well, I guess I'll just foot it... it's worth the walk!

I was informed of their greatness after several months of living in San Francisco.   It also received an extra star for being within 20 minutes walking distance from my apartment.   I was also forewarned by their long lines.   On my first try,  my bff was coming by to take me to Napa to shop at the outlets.  Since I had an hour to burn, I drove to Tartine to check out their pastries.   I ordered the Morning Bun and Double Au Pain Chocolat.    My friend chose the Double Au Pain Chocolat.   She said it was very flaky and finished it within 10 minutes.   This thing was huge too!   I was left with the Morning Bun but am so grateful to have been given this choice.   I thought I had tasted wonderful pastries before, however this was unlike any other.   The outer layer of the bun was crunchy due to the orange zest syrup or layer of sugar and the inner layers were chewy and soft.    So yummy! Second try, it was my nephew's 1st birthday and my brother called me last minute to pick up a birthday cake.   Fortunately for him I was still at the apartment and about to leave for their house in Dublin.   I immediately knew where to go.   I waited in line for 15 mins at least.   I couldn't decide between the Chocolate Souffle Cake or the Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian.  I ended up ordering both and knew that my family would be happy with either.    I was almost floored when my aunts fought over who was going to take home the last slice of the Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian.  They loved the lightness and exotic taste of the cake.   They also enjoyed the fresh coconut shavings that covered the cake like fresh sheet of powdered snow on a hill.    They said the Chocolate Souffle was good since it was very rich and you don't need a huge slice to feel satisfied.   I have since picked up Morning Buns to share with my co-workers on Christmas Eve.   The admin enjoyed it so much that she did not say one word or allowed anyone to bother her as she finished it off.   My French CIO said it was tasted like Brioche.   I can see what he means now.   My co workers also commented,  thank God the bakery is only in SF, otherwise they'll be stopping by daily and eventually blame me for their weight gain.   Tartine Bakery is like a rare gemstone that you take out to wear on special occasions or when you feel like a star.

This place actually lives up to the hype.  If you haven't already tried this place, go now. Go today b/c it actually is that good.  I'm a bit of a baker myself so I feel I can review this place from that perspective.  As you may  know, their morning bun is listed as one of the foods to eat before you die.  I whole-heartedly agree - outstanding!!  The bread was perfect consistency, light and doughy (even in the late afternoon when not fresh out of the oven).  There is s slight citrus taste that was spot-on - not too sweet or overpowering.   We also ordered 2 sandwiches and got to taste their bread first hand.  Yep, perfection.  We had a croque monsieur, which wasn't typical, but wonderful anyway.  It was huge and served panini style with oven dried tomatoes.  We also had a smoked cheese sandwich w/ quince jam that I had to wrap up and take home b/c we were stuffed from the other sandwich. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the service.  We had this dingy girl who was absolutely clueless who waited on us at the counter.  Not only was she slow, but she forgot to put in our 2nd sandwich order all together and I had to remind her twice.  Really poor service and they weren't that swamped at the time.  But the other servers seemed just fine. Great atmosphere and consistently busy.  We sat next to a couple who drove 2 hours to get there and ordered 10 loaves of bread the day before.  Yeah, now that's dedication!   I can't wait to head back for my next round of goodies at this gem.

What's for breakfast? Fresh coffee, sweet breakfast pastries and yummy quiches! Small and super packed this bakery is located on the corner of Guerrero St. My hunny ordered the morning bun - warm, crispy, flaky pastry with an orange glaze....i'm not super fond of orange glaze but I have to admit it's pretty good. I ordered the Vegetarian quiche....a little burnt but the center is pretty good. Would come back to try their other yummy looking pastries. =]

Whenever I get back to San Francisco, this is my first and last stop.  I've been a fan since I ate at Tartine years ago. The vibe of this place is top notch.  Huge loaves of crusty bread everywhere, mixed in with fruity, sweet treats, and a staff that's running around like crazy but oh so nice.  It's a pretty small location but all the natural light and open windows/doors makes it seem more airy. I usually get the pressed Turkey sandwich and iced coffee.  If I'm feeling extra naughty, I'll go for the bread pudding too! Please excuse me as I go to the back room to lick my lips and reminisce. Please note, the line can be beyond intense but it's worth the wait.  Bring the paper, a book, your IPad, or whatever works.  Just get there and eat!

The best croissant I've had in America was made here. (FYI- I've had croissants in France, Belgium, and Switzerland). And actually, the Tartine croissant is better than those I've eaten in Switzerland. I'd go to this bakery more often if it were less crowded. Or if the people in line were pre-caffinated, instead of the bitchy 'tude due to lack of latte in one's bloodstream. People are much more pleasant after one sip of coffee or one bite of sweet. If only world peace were that easy....

I had given up on ever getting pastries from Tartine.  Happen to be in the neighborhood, parking in front and I was good-to-go.   Tartine's morning buns are my new addiction - I become completely obsessed to the point of "must have" on a weekly basis.  So this will become a  first stop for me as I head out on errands.   I need, I want to try everything. . . The man in front of me purchased a Chocolate Bavarion Cake for his wife (her favorite) and it looked amazing. At some point, when I retire, I want to work in their kitchen and immerse myself in the smells of a bakery and not have to deal with rude people in retail.

Tre Croissant! If I could be a pastry or maybe just use one as a blanket it would a Tartine Croissant. SO Amazing. Joseph Sofaer thanks for the recommendation. This croissant is just many layers of sweet butter bliss. With its flaky crust of an outer shell, and sweet soft insides you'll want to grab one to go so you have something to look forward to a little later. Totally worth the extra set of 25 crunches.

I've heard my brother talk about this bakery and I've always wondered if it was that great.   Since we were in the city on Monday, my bff craved their pressed sandwiches, so lunch at Tartine!  There is always a line out the door.  The line to get the pastry and order the sandwich wasn't bad but the wait for the sandwich was BAD.  We waited about 30mins for 2 pressed sandwiches and that was just crazy!  I've never waited that long just for a sandwich.  I said to my bf, "this better be a BOMB-a$$ sandwich for us to be waiting this long!"   We ordered 2 sandwich for the 3 of us.  (Prosciutto & Provolone; Sopressata, Fontina, Brocoli Rabe Pesto) The sandwiches come in huge 3pc portions so it was plenty. OH YUMMMY!  These sandwiches are the BOMB.  I don't know how I can explain the yummy goodness of the bread.  The bread is chewy yet doughy yet crispy.   WOW! I can probably eat just the bread itself!!!  NOTE:  The sandwiches are heavy so it won't be a "light" lunch.   Of course I had to get myself a pastry since Tartine is KNOWN for their pastries.  I picked up an order of the small lemon tart ($6).  The tart was great!  It had JUST enough zest and sweetness.   I'll definitely come back again for their pastries!

I got up at the crack of dawn (7 am for the "live free, live unemployed") and headed over to Tartine in the hopes of beating the heinous line that forms in the morning.  Luckily, if you get there before 9 chances are you will not need a wristband for CarbFest and I got in and out rather quickly.  The staff is very helpful suggesting options that really did fulfill what i was looking for.  I got the Gruyere cheese puff pastry (sorry I forgot the Frenchie phrase for it,  but it is located by the quiches) and it was excellent.  They lose points for playing a depressing medley of Morrissey .  Do you guys sell handguns too? Honestly, Tartine was good, but I would rather go to Four Barrel listen to Jawbreaker (at least it's not depressing) and get an almond croissant and coffee there, where it is less chaotic.

Not bad but definitely did not live up to the hype. Usually, a long line is a good indication that a place must be on to something if people are willing to wait a long time for some pastries that can be bought at any other bakery. However, I think this is one of those instances where the line tricked me! I ordered the apple crisp and my gf got the eclair. The apple crisp was a little on the mushy side while the apples were incredibly sour, as in Extreme Sour Warheads kinda sour. As for the eclair, I thought it was generally good. The cream was smooth and tasty but the chocolate was a bit on the rich side. We also got a latte, which was decent. For those of you driving here, be warned that parking can be a little tricky on the weekends since the popular Bi-Rite Creamery is just down the street.

Oh, frangipane crossiant, why do I lust for you? Could it be your perfectly airy crust or your fragrant almond cream filling?  My heart is palpitating just thinking about you.  But the lines, the lines- why must the lines always be out the door?   I guess it's part of the price for one of the best damn crossiants outside of Paris.

Came here for a banana cream tart, but came home with a coconut cream tart. It was a lot yummier than expected. But aside from that, the price of one tart is a little costly. I also wish their fruit tart was a fruit tart, not a raspberry tart. They offer a small variety of cookies and pastries. Coffee, tea, and sandwiches. Really small place that is super packed. Not the best place to catch up over a cup of coffee with a friend...but definitely come to grab a tart for dessert later. Quiche is good too!

My mother is an absolute Francophile. So when she was in town last week for a visit Tartine was at the top of her "to do" list. (Apparently, they've heard of it as far away as Michigan.) We stopped in on a Tuesday afternoon well after lunch hour and this tiny boulangerie was standing-room-only. Tartine lacks the ambiance of another one of our favorite lunch places, The Butler and Chef, however the Croque Monsieur sandwich I had was belly-achingly good. Beware to the lactose intolerant!

I had such high expectations... too high - THANK A LOT YELPERS :oT I ventured off to our usual morning get together with Jeff. He's my person - like in Grey's Anatomy... It was for our usual debrief on our lives, his girlfriend, and other important factors in our lives. First, there was limited parking... then there was a line (which is usually a great thing) and then, there wasn't really any seating.  I had to use my super Asian traits to hover over people who looked like they were ready to depart and start their day. The coffee, excellent!  I *heart* Mr. Espresso's coffee.  We had 2 quiches (one ham, one... something else) and 3 pastries (overkill if you ask me) - croissant, chocolate croissant, and some spiced/herbed/cheese fluffy thing. The quiche was a little under and over done. The crust was so overdone and the egg so not, it made for a weird combination.  The chocolate croissant and the spicy airy thing were my favorites, but still - not as great as I had hoped.   The line never stopped. It was super long the entire time we were there, and almost doubled by the time we were leaving (an hour later). I wouldn't drive all the way across town to eat there, but I would come back and buy their cakes for a special occasion.

Hmmmm, nothing like a decent cup of coffee and a morning bun...shared with many, packed into a small space, juggling their pastries and coffee cups, jostling for a table or space to stand. The pastries that we tried were superb, the almond croissant and morning buns were exceptional. The place was packed. I don't mind a short wait in line but once you get inside it's like a sardine can. Have to give the staff five stars, they were unruffled and very nice in the midst of morning chaos. If I was in the area I'd grab something to go, but still prefer Bakesale Betty's in Oakland for my morning sweets.

Pro - I can walk there. Con - I can walk there.  Grrr... Tartine is another one of those reasons why I'll never be a six-minute miler.  Because holy Jesus, everything there is insanely delicious, and it's all I can do to limit myself to one trip a week.  The line can be long (especially on the weekend), which only makes things worse, because you have all that time to gaze at the display case, thinking of more and more things you want to eat for "breakfast."  By which I mean desert, 16 hours or so after the fact. I usually just grab a croissant, either plain or filled with ham & cheese.  This, I can at least argue is a somewhat functional breakfast, even though it's mostly butter.  As I've said to people before, unless you've actually been to France, you haven't had a real croissant until you've had one from Tartine.  Other things that regularly tempt me include the bread pudding, the fruit tarts, and the quiche, all of which could pass as centerfolds in some sort of food porn publication.  I've also eaten lunch there a couple of times - they have really great sandwiches with high-quality breads & meat (the turkey is my favorite), but again, beware the copious amount of (delicious) butter.  The open-faced sandwiches (in the display case) are also phenomenal (but extremely filling).  I had a mocha there once, which was fine, but not amazing - generally I stick to the food.

I SCORED LAST NIGHT AND BOY WAS IT THE BEST! I was on my way home and it happened just like that! What grabbed my attention first was the amazing aroma coming from my latest conquest. I couldn't stop fondling, it was so big and fun to squeeze and warm and beautiful. I couldn't keep my mouth off it on my way home. Wow it is a rare happening when you score like this! You too can score like me. Just make it to Tartine Bakery soon after 5:00pm on Wed to Sunday. I was there at 5:30pm and seriously had one of the last loafs. It was a sesame loaf and was still hot. I was taring piece after piece on my walk over Dolores to Noe Valley. I am surprised that there was anything left by the time I arrived home. I actually ended up cutting it in half because it is so big and wanted to freeze it for next week in case I can't get back. Rumor has it this is the best bread for French Toast. Do yourself a favor and get some. This should be in the book "1001 one things you must taste before you die".

Seat is super hard to get, thankfully this really nice lady let me know that she's leaving so we got a table outside. Eating inside mustn't be too great since there are people lining up non-stop. The bread pudding is delicious. The coconut tart is pretty good but it's not *that* good for 6 bucks. Their lunch menu is ok, the croque monsieur is alright, the 3 cheese sandwich isn't that special either. When I go back I think I'll just get the dessert.

My lunch date wanted ethnic food, we ended up with Yuppie.   I have mixed feelings about the place.  The sandwiches were grand.  Large, rich portions but it was only about the cheese.  Plus, I know I'll probably be ostracized for saying this but I wasn't all that impressed with the desserts.  They were dry and dense.  I've gotten closer to full blown diabetes from items purchased at Safeway.  My roommate brings home a selection regularly and I've never truly been impressed.    In addition, I really wonder why I'm the one busing my table when I just paid $10+ for a sandwich?

We went here last night around 7pm, before catching Wicked.The place was hard to find (no signage and dark) but luckily there were no line. I heard so much about Tartine from the yelp grapevine and it's been on my bookmark to try for a while. So I was looking forward to trying Tartine. I'm dissapointed. It wasn't all that I thought it would be. We ordered the cup size Bread Pudding ($3) and the smoked ham Croque Monsieur ($9.25). They were OKAY. I've had better bread pudding with better texture. It might be because we got the last piece so it was just everything that was left in the pan. And I've never had croque monsieur before but I think $9.25 for a slice of bread with ham & cheese on top was a weeeeeeee expensive! Not coming back.

Whenever I go to SF, I try to make it a point to come here, around 5pm, when the bread comes out of the ovens.  You can order just a half loaf, which is more than enough for a few days.  It's so fresh it's steaming, literally.  Country walnut is our favorite. Also of note: chocolate hazelnut tart is absolutely delicious, the best pastry we've tasted, with their frangipane pastry a close second. Space is crowded, but stop by, grab some bread and pastries, go down the street to bi-rite, get some cheese, and chill out with a picnic at Dolores Park (and maybe get some bi-rite ice cream while you're at it!).

Wandered over to Tartine after we were told it would be an hour wait to be seated at Delfina. Sadly, there was already a sign posted on the window saying they had sold out of bread. And all bready, pastry related items. SAD! There were a few tarts left, along with slices of cake and a few savory items. Since we were already there, I decided to try the quiche. It was a fairly generous slice, but I think a fairer price would've been ~$3.50 rather than $4.75. That's just being nitpicky I suppose. The quiche had a nice, flaky crust, and the silky smooth egg custard part was deliciously herby. For now, 3 stars... until I get a chance to try their fresh baked bread and pastries!

So, we felt like fools outside, pacing around trying to figure out if the corner cafe (where is the sign?) is Tartine. No need to suspect; if it's crowded and loud, it's Tartine. Tried the bread pudding and some kind of chocolate cake. Tasted pretty great. (The bread pudding, though, I would've hoped they make more frequent and smaller batches, because I got maybe the 2nd to last scoop, and it doesn't look as great as it would've if it were fresher. Besides, it is such a popular item).

I've been hearing phenomenal things about Tartine for the longest time but never had the opportunity to check it out till now.  Often regarded as the best bakery in the city, you know I had to put it to the test. My buddy insisted that I try the panini with the Sopressata, Fontina cheese, broccoli rabe, and pesto, all grilled on comfort bread.  We also tried the frangipane croissant as well.  Let me say that both were absolutely spectacular!  I have now officially tasted awesome, and it goes by the name of Tartine.  The flavors were all extremely distinct and it was grilled together to perfection.  Even the pickled carrots that came with the sandwich were sensational.  That croissant, it was just, wow.  It was so good I even took one home with me to San Diego!  Honestly, it's difficult to pick a favorite because the quality and flavors here are so amazing.  If I lived in the area, I'd probably come here every day. The vibe here is great and they occasionally have live music playing as well.  The food isn't the cheapest around but considering the quality and flavors, it's great value.  There are a couple tables outside where you can enjoy a pastry and a glass of wine with your dog, and everybody seems to have the same idea.  There's usually a line here and it takes a little while to whip up the sandwich, but it's absolutely worth it.  This is now officially my favorite bakery in all of San Francisco, and perhaps beyond.

It doesn't tell you on the outside of the building that it's tartine until you walk up to the door, it's just a black painted building with a line out the door. I have to say go early if you want some chocolate croissant or banana cream tart, they sell fast! The people are nice and very helpful if you don't know what to order.

Is there room on this bandwagon?  I hope so because I'm jumping onboard! I'm a huge banana cream anything fan, and when I heard about the tart and saw the photos.... I was on a mission!  It's right around the corner from pizzeria delfina and bi-rite, so you've got a lot of delicious places to hit up if you can get to the block. The line was down the street (one house down) and apparently that is "good".. after we finished at delfina it was only barely out the door = AMAZING.  Worth the wait, although now that I've been spoiled, it's going to be tough not to break down in tears if it's the usual 2 houses down line. YES, THE BANANA CREAM IS AS DELICIOUS AS THEY SAY... it's also just so fun much to walk in there and count the number of things you want to eventually get to trying. Can't wait to go back for the brioche bread budding and everything else. YAYUMMMM!

Morning Bun (toasted, a must - thanks, S, for the tip!)?  Heavenly. Banana Cream Tart?  Ultimate bliss. Coconut Tart?  Heavenly, divine, ultimate bliss. Frangipane Croissant?  Meh, just so so. The next time I visit Tartine Bakery, I'm only going to bring with me $6.50, so I don't go crazy and end up spending over $20 on four pastry items (true story; easier than you'd think it'd be).  Not that the pastries aren't worth it - they totally are - well, most of them - but I need to cut back on the spending and, yes, *sigh* the calories. Service is fine - quick (visit on a weekday mid-morning to avoid the line!), but lacking a bit in emotion and enthusiasm (perhaps suffering from a sugar hangover?).  Indoor seating is a bit cramped, but outdoor tables and benches are available and make for great people watching on breezy SF days.

While price points are higher here than at other bakeries in the city, there's a reason why Tartine has a near-cult following and has earned a very high 4.5-star average among 2600+ reviewers: everything looks and tastes amazing... from the tarts and paninis to the croissants and quiches. Arriving at around 3:30PM on a weekday, I came too late for their famous morning buns (available until sold out), and too early for any bread loaves (ready after 5pm). Bummer! Still, everything behind the glass cases made my salivary glands go haywire, and my brain crazy in having to decide what to get... The bread pudding with seasonal fruit (this time, pear) was sublime. $3.50 for a small portion was perfect as a midday pick-me-upper for two. The gougère ($3.50) with gruyere, black pepper and thyme turned my skeptical BF into a raving fan. The lightly crisp crust sheltered an incredibly airy, spectacularly cheesy, magnificently moist center. Both gone in 60 seconds. During my short stay, the line waxed and waned, from zero to 7+ people... I can only imagine how intimidating the wait can get during peak times, especially with limited indoor space and seating available. Makes sense that there's no wi-fi available!

The fact that I live 2000 miles away from Tartine makes me want to cry.  This place is fabulous!  I visited Tartine when I was in SF for vacation.  I'd seen their double pain au chocolat praised on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" and was really stoked to try it.  It seriously lived up to the hype!  Believe me when I say that it was truly the best pastry I've ever had in my life.  The layers were so flaky, so buttery, yet so light and heavenly.  The chocolate tucked inside was rich and velvety.  All the other pastries and goodies on display looked spectacular as well.  Had I but known, I would've taken like, 9 things to go.  Or just hung out there for the entire day... We were there on a Friday around noon and it was pretty packed.  No line out the door (like other Yelpers have noted), so we got in and out pretty quickly.  Although waiting in line would've been totally worth it! Bottom line: Any visit to SF warrants a visit to Tartine!

Pain au Chocolat: Yum. Bread Pudding: Super Yum. Spiced nuts: To Die For Yum. Coconut Cream & Banana Cream Tarts....wait, ALL tarts: I've Died and Gone to Heaven Yum. Yum. Yum. If it wasn't for the consistently yummy fare, I would not exercise the patience required to wait in the slow as molasses line to order. And believe me, it is sheer torture to be separated from the objects of your (momentary) affection, by a glass display case, while moving what seems to be an inch per eternal minute towards the cashier. Nor would I have the patience to devour these delectables in the rather crowded and cramped cafe space. But one bite of any of the above, and I forget about all of the extraneous stuff....

This place gets so crazy crowded! The line moves fast though, and you really don't have time for indecision. People come and go quickly too, so while you're waiting in line and the tables seem overly full, soon, the tables will open up for you right as you hit the front of the line. My friend and I tried the devil's chocolate cake, the pumpkin tea cake, and the chocolate tea cake. The devil's chocolate cake was so moist, decadent, and gooey. The pumpkin tea cake was also moist, with a nice top, and a hint of pumpkin without being overwhelming. The chocolate tea cake was also a hit, moist, rich, and joyful! I want to come back and try the savory foods such as a quiche or the croque monsieur, everything on the menu looked great, and judging from the crowds and the way everyone ate everything up, you can't go wrong!

You know when you go into something knowing that you have unreasonably high expectations because of all I hype around it? Well that's how I went into Tartine. And, I can honestly say, it lives up to its reputation. First, we had the Coconut Cream Tart. Now..I'm not even a big fan of coconut desserts..or cream, but this tart was unbelievably decadent and delicious. As a warning, split it amongst at least 2 or 3 people, it's very rich but well worth trying. We also had the Chocolate Hazelnut Tart, that was good but not phenomenal. We then had the bread pudding..delicious. Definitely worth a taste (btw if you're fans of bread pudding, District in Soma has a surprisingly good one.) The negatives are that parking is very difficult so take a deep breath before driving over. And don't go on Sunday cause they you have to compete for parking with local church-goers. The line looks long but moves fast so don't let that deter you. Oh..and the beers are great, definitely worth trying. Lastly, for the Croque Monsieur lovers out there, I didn't try the one here but if you're looking for a great Croque Monsieur or Croque Madame, try Grand Cafe on Geary. It's the best I've ever had in SF. Go to Tartine on a sunny, lazy saturday. It'll be a great addition to your day.

Overall, they know what they are doing.  The pastries are all very good.  Butter croissant is the best I've ever tasted and it is one item that makes me  go back to Tartine.  Chocolate eclair is so tasty.  Cakes, on the other hand, are a bit too sweet and heavy.  As to the line, it is just too long.  Tartine needs to come up with a solution to serve its loyal customers better and faster soon.  Because I am afraid that line/ the slow speed it moves is so painful even for the best tasting croissant...

Ugh. Tartine. You can smell butter from around the building, and as you get closer into the bakery (you should expect a  ~25 minute wait), it's like being enveloped into a croissant-y, buttery, fatty, decadent, sweet, savory heaven. Here's the deal. Bread pudding. Quiche (ham & leek). Pain au chocolat. MEXICAN WEDDING COOKIES. Sandwiches... Okay let me stop there, because just about everything from Tartine will be sure to please. I think my favorite were the wedding cookies. Powdered sugar is SO fine, and just adds the perfect amount of sweetness to the almond-y, buttery, crumbly inside. Just. The. Best. The bread pudding is like none I've ever had. It's covered in caramelized apples, and the budding is super decadent & creamy. Chocolate croissant (pain au chocolat) - super flaky and the chocolate is semi-sweet so it's not too overwhelming. EVERYTHING ELSE. Come back, often. Try everything. Tartine is just a quality bakery, something very hard to find in California, or anywhere for that matter. *atmosphere - very quaint. They have fresh flowers in vases, and there is very limited seating. Loved their long wood table. Simple & elegant. *prices are kind of steep, but definitely worth it *long wait any time and any day of the week *don't expect the full selection past 5 PM

I've stopped by on a couple of occasions.  On the first, they had sold out a bit after 5.  The second time, I snagged a tartine loaf for $9.  I will say that the bread was pretty good, but not better than what I make at home (at least to the tune of 9$ per).   The service is terrible and the wait is long.  You'd be better off to avoid the hype and go to a different bakery that gives a damn about its customers.

Until there is scratch and sniff technology, reviews will not get you any closer to understanding Tartine's goodness. You just have to go.

We tried this place after a recommendation from yelper patrick g.  We needed a quick and tasty bite and some melted small farm cheese on artisian bread would have really hit the spot.  Tartine Bakery delivered with its hot pressed Three Cheese Tasting with Bellwether Farms Jersey Carmody, Straus Cheddar, and Cowgirl Fromage Blanc.  They were out of the usual bread they use so they substituted the walnut bread. I was happy to be sharing the sandwich with my husband because if not, I would have stumbled out of there in a cheese coma if I had been forced to consume the entire melty goodness before the cheese turned opaque and unappetizing.

The hot pressed sandwiches are delicious and HUGE!! I had the Pastrami sandwich, and I loved it. I'm a big eater, and I thought it was plenty for lunch (girls will probably want to half it, or  maybe even split it into thirds). Iced Tea was fantastic. Hints of mint.. and other flavors? A mysterious, but pleasant surprise. It's a tiny little spot. Crowded so you have to hustle for a table after waiting in an achingly long line. All the while they torture you with that unavoidable deli case filled with scrumptious looking pastries and desserts. I wish I lived in SF, right near here so that I could have Tartine at one end of the block and Bi-Rite at the other. Heaven.

It's no secret that Tartine is one of those stops you have to make when in San Francisco {and apparently before you die}. While in town this past weekend, I had to stop and get my favorite croissant of all time...Tartine's frangipane {aka almond} croissant. For me, it's the best croissant ever. The morning buns and almond rochers, as well as the eclairs were out of this world. Everything seems so lovingly made...and the heaps of butter don't hurt either. Final thoughts... Probably my favorite bakery ever. The line may be long, but it's very much worth the wait.

With so many reviews, I just had to try this place out, there was a decent line out the door, but it didn't take long to get through it, maybe 15 minutes.  In the cases there are all kinds of breads, pastries, tarts, cakes, all this yummy food I would love to try.   I had the coconut tart and lemon tart, both were really delicious.  My friend also ordered a prosciutto and provolone sandwich, that takes 20 minutes to make! but the worker told us that and we were okay with it.  It was really good, kinda oily, but I guess thats was expected a little. The prices are a little on the high side and this place was super packed, no place to sit inside or out, and it was really squishy since there were so many people.  I'll definitely drop in again to grab something toe at but not a great place to sit down and enjoy a meal.

Sorry Tartine, you just lost another star for yet another passable performance -- a far-too-rich morning bun. All butter, no finesse. Good ingredients and fresh baking are delicious, but require no skill. May-06 update --- Hmm, I should just cut-and-paste my Pizzeria Delfina review (perhaps because I visited the same night?) An excellent experience but couldn't possibly exceed the hype. I had a brownie, of course, which was as expected and could not compare with Miette. Also tried a slice of Pumpkin Tea Cake, which was excellent (quality taste & ingredients), but nothing exceptional. Perhaps my next experience will be better when I'm not trying to block out an insult-to Ella-Fitzgerald, wanna-be jazz singer. As though the space weren't small enough already. Jeez.

After reading about this place in SF Chronicle, my wife and I decided to bus on over and try it out. We split a banana cream tart which was amazing! The cream was light, and the bananas flavorful but not mushy. My wife wasn't too keen about the flaky crust since it was hard to cut without a knife; she preferred a graham crust. I thought it was great, being a chocolate-lined pastry shell! Pros: - lotsa variety - fresh! - Fast and efficient. Despite long lines, the wait seemed short. - Probably the nicest, cleanest bathroom I've ever seen in a bakery. Hardwood wainscoting and a fresh orchid? It's a sure sign of how clean the kitchen'll be. Cons: - Small table spaces, but that's what happens when the place is so gosh darn crowded. - Did I mention the crowds on a Friday morning? Can't imagine what it's like on the weekends. - Leave your diet at the door

This is one of those places that's always gonna be busy no matter what time or day you arrive. I can see why. Everything here is great: a huge bowl of banana pudding for less than $5, a giant slice of quiche for even less, an open-faced ham and cheese sandwich for about $9, chocolate pudding for $4...  Their open-faced sandwich was one of my favorites, made from their fresh-baked bread. The banana cream tart - creamy and not too sweet with a flaky crust, it's inside coated with chocolate. Delicious. One thing I don't like about this place was how crowded it is, but I guess I shouldn't blame Tartine for being so damn popular. JONASAPPROVED!

Anyone who's ever stood in line halfway down the block outside Tartine on a Saturday is probably not surprised at the sheer volume of reviews for this place.  To sit here and write "oh tartine is the bomb, the bread pudding is to die for and pretty much everything they put their hands to is like a revelation from god" is sort of akin to reading shakespeare and saying "jeez that's like a really great piece of english writing". which is to say, Tartine makes really excellent bread pudding, and i dare say that nearly everything they put their hands to is like a revelation from god.

Tartine, I Heart You. Seriously I do.  You are my must stop shop when I am in San Francisco.  You are my favorite bakery in the world.  Tartine, you really got me now. Tartine is perfect.  Their food is 5 stars.  I have never had bad food there.  I give it only four stars b/c 4.5 is not an option and I want to make a point to warn people about seating/ambiance b/c it doesn't exist.  Prepare yourself for lines out the door.  Steel yourself against the prospect of not sitting down.  Know that it will be worth every bit of discomfort and awkwardness.  Every single bit and more. The hot sandwiches are wonderful and huge.  The humbolt fog grilled cheese is amazing.  The croque monsieur is perfect.  All come on crusty country bread with creamy and toasted bubbly cheeses.  And the famous Tartine pickled carrot.  Must find recipe for the carrots!  Spicy, crunchy, sour, sweet.  A perfect foil to the richness of the sandwich. The quiche is, well, there are no words.  none. its that good. Pastry?  Perfect.  The gougeres are grapefruit sized and made with cracked pepper and one of my favorites.  My brother swears by the Ham and Cheese croissant (and who wouldn't).  Tartine takes their pastry and bread to just past the golden brown stage of cooking.  They go dark with their savory puff pastries and breads and I love it.  The lemon cream tart is both light and rich, creamy and sour.  The friands and rochers feel like Paris in spring.   Am I gushing?  not enough.  never enough.   Go there.  Wait in long lines.  Trust me.  Worth every minute.  Its bliss.

You can't really say much about this place that hasn't been said. It's a regular place I bring out-of-town visitors to. Yes, that's us crowding up your line, locals. But then again, I'm local, too, so... there... I hate me, too? Anyway, I think a story to help you understand how great this place is can be illustrated by what I consider one of the highest compliments. My boyfriend and I brought a friend of mine from France to Tartine. She's not one of those Parisienne types, though she's been there often. She's from a small village in the Loire Valley. This hearkens to mind the opening scenes from Disney's Beauty and the Beast. I picture a boulangerie run by the same family for generations, with the baker buying butter from the farmer down the road and using the same recipe his family perfected since before the revolution. She's no naif. She's lived in the UK and Spain and traveled around the world. I take her to Tartine and she takes a bite of croissant and her eyes begin to brim with tears. "What's wrong?" I ask as I prepare mentally to run away if she's dropped off the emotional deep-end. It's quiet for a moment. "This is just like France. I miss France so much because of this." A French person saying that a not-in-France bakery is just like France??? That's one hell of a compliment. Note: We ordered the Croque Monsieur, bread pudding, banana cream pudding, morning bun, croissant, olive bread (not that great), coconut cake and something else I can't remember. (we had a few other people there, too, that day. Okay, one other person. But we ate it all. It was delicious.)

If it weren't rude, I would be WRITING THIS REVIEW IN ALL CAPS b/c Tartine makes me want to SHOUT FROM THE ROOFTOPS: SO YUMMY! We've come here many, many times to get their fabulous breads after 5pm.  Today was the first time we actually ate a meal there.  I had the croque monsieur which was fantastic, love the gooey gruyere and ham and oh, the bread.  Others waited 10-15 minutes to get the sandwiches (croque monsieur is served right away, doesn't count as one of their sandwiches), and those sandwiches were delicious!!  Such interesting flavors, toasted perfectly, very generous portions, and the bread!!!!  We were lucky to grab a table for the six of us but it didn't seem too impossible to get seats/tables.  Fellow Yelper Jeff H. loves those pickled carrots served with the sandwiches.  After some initial skepticism, I decided that they were a very nice contrast to the texture and taste of the sandwiches.  Yummers all around. Did I mention I LOVE THEIR BREAD???

I have to admit I am a little disappointed... with myself for not trying the bread pudding. Next time - and yes, there will be a next time. Today I went with my friend Yuriko and we shared a Croque Monsieur topped with smoked Niman Ranch ham, Cowgirl Creamery fromage blanc and asparagus, a  Little Side Salad (Star Route Farms organic greens with lemon and shallot vinaigrette) and a couple of cappuccinos. The first thing I tried was the salad. The description of this salad seems pretty simple, but I was amazed at how delicious this was. As was our Croque Monsieur and the piece of Almond/Lemon Poppy seed bread we took with us for later. We were here on a Monday morning so the line was not too long, but come prepared to wait in line. On the weekends this will be a long line. The space itself is a little cramped, but once you go through line and order it's seat yourself. Most people eat and get out (like we should when there is a big line), so you can find a seat. This is not exactly an intimate space though. So if you want to confess an affair or  a pregnancy this is probably not the best place to do it.

Oralgasm. Do I really need to be the 1,386th person to write a review of this place?! Clearly, the answer is yes. Tartine deserves over 5 stars for its mouthwatering confections that make people wait in the 'always there' line out the door. The quiche is *the best* I've ever had.  Melts in your mouth and rocks my world.   Other standouts I've tried are: the croissant (OMG), the lemon tart, fruit tart, chocolate pudding and their fab open-faced sandwiches which come with that ever important pickled carrot. Yummy in my tummy.

Definitely lived up to the expectations I had, which was a nice little cafe in the middle of a busy city. The day me and a friend went was a bit rainy so luckily the line wasn't super long but I can see the lines going out the door on a nice sunny day near Dolores Park. While the baked goods were tempting and I'm sure delicious, me and my friend actually settled on some prosciutto sandwiches. (I most definitely would like to come back for the baked goods someday though). Loved our sandwiches, they were quite respectable in size so I had no qualms in paying about 10 for them. Nothing wrong with the taste either! It would be hard to bring a large group here as seating is limited (be prepared to share a large table with a bunch of strangers if you don't get a small table) but I definitely think Tartine Bakery is worth a visit when you're wandering around Dolores Park. Just stare at the baked goods while you're waiting in line.

I'm always up for some sweets...so when I saw this had good reviews, I came all the way from Mill Valley by bus to try it out. lol The line wasn't super long but maybe that had to do with the fact that it was 2:30pm...not so sure. I had to wait about 10 minutes. The music was loud and the girl behind the counter spoke like a mouse. Good thing I could semi-read her lips. I kinda wanted to try the bread pudding but I also kinda knew it would probably be NOTHING like my granny's Southern recipe...didn't want a let down, now do we!? I decided on the lemor bar and coconut cream tart. I spent $12, total. Well worth it? Ehhhhh.....I might have to think about that one. The lemon bar was really good...for the first three bites. Then the sugar and sour started settling in and it just tasted super sour. Maybe that is what it's supposed to do, but either way...I just wasn't feeling it. The coconut cream tart...well, that is sitting next to me, as I type! It survived a BART ride, a short little ride on the 28, AND it crossed over the GG with me and into my fridge. It sat in there for about an hour before I couldn't handle it anymore...I had to have it. I couldn't get my fork thru the crust so I gave in and bit the damn thing. I think it may have been the chocolate that was so hard to break but anywho, now I have a big mess on my plate. ha. It's ok. I'm not a super coconut fan but it's pretty good. So, maybe I'll be back...maybe. I'm still thinking on that one too... Ooh, they need pecan pie. Yummmy.

I was really happy that my friends live relatively close to Tartine. Such a great bakery! I went on the weekend and the line was a nightmare but when I went back during the week it was almost non-existent. My friend and I tried the Almosd Frangipane Tart with Seasonal fruit, the brioche bread pudding, an eclair, and the chocolate croissant. This was however between two trips. We don't want to seem overly gluttoness, do we? The quality fo the baked good is fantastic. I used to work at Flour bakery in Boston and Tartine really gives Flour a run for their money. It's a good thing that they are on opposite coasts. They lose one start because their employees are devoid of personality. Not my favorite thing to experience after waiting in any line.

Went here on a visit to the city cause my sister begged me to. (She has the cookbook and thought their bread would be worth all the effort). Well don't go for bread in the morning-silly me!  It apparently is available only in the evening for s short window of time. We missed it. The almond croissant was really wonderful, though, and made up for not getting bread.

I've never really ventured into the Mission until this past year and I should be ashamed of myself for missing out on places like Tartine Bakery for so long. We got to the Tartine Bakery at about 7:50PM and they closed at 8PM, so instead of trying to find parking, we just stopped at the street corner while I raced in to try to pick something up. Even though they were closing up in 10 minutes, the place was still packed (that's how popular they are). I was immediately attended but had no idea what to get. The server recommended the bread pudding (as it is one of their most popular desserts), so I got a cup ($3.50). After she packed the box with bread pudding, I annoyingly asked if she could separate it into two separate boxes (for two people) and she willingly obliged. Not only did she separate the pudding into two boxes, but she actually added a bit more to each box to make it more "full." End price: $3.50. WOW! The bread pudding itself was pretty good (even though I'm not the biggest fan of apples). It was rather cold but I'm assuming that's how it's made. I must update this review because I know I will be back again to try their other wonderful desserts. I also wish they would be open a bit later as it would a perfect place to catch desserts after a nice meal in the Mission.

I don't drink tea or coffee, but if you want a damn good hot chocolate. Not something that tastes like it came from a packet then I highly recommend you set your ass down at Tartine and drink this fine concoction. I know not how they make it, but it reminds me more of the hot chocolate I drank in Spain. Thicker and slightly bitter. Make sure and ask for whipped cream because otherwise they serve it without.

Fantastic bakery ... every item I ate was full of buttery goodness.  The coffee drinks (I had a hot chocolate) served in a bowl with fresh whipped cream helped "round out" breakfast. The line was very long but moved quickly.

I loooove this place.  I stumbled upon it one day when my friend and I were driving around Delores and Mission areas.  I didn't know about Tartine's reputation until I looked it up after eating there.   Well, we were there for lunch, and there was a line out the door, so we had to wait for a bit to even get into the bakery.  When I finally got in the bakery I was overwhelmed by the selection of baked goods.  They all looked divine!!  I finally settled on the quiche.  They warmed it up for me and put it in a nice to go box.  My friend ordered vegetarian quiche and the brioche pudding.  We took our food and had a nice little picnic in the park.  Wow, the food was delicious.  The quiche was huge, it wasn't one of those little dainty slices, it was a nice big, hearty slice.  It was so good and not too heavy.  The brioche pudding was amazing....hands down one of the best I've ever had.  Creamy, delicious and not overly sweet with some lovely fresh berries.  I have dreams about the brioche pudding.   Love this place, just hate waiting, what can I say?  I'm an impatient person.  It is worth a trip though, don't let the wait completely discourage you, you'll be pleased with the food for sure.

My favorite things here are the morning buns, crossaints, and the fresh fruit bavarian cake during the summer. This is probably the best bakery in san francisco. The lines here can be super long, especially on the weekend. Even before they open, they already have a line. The bread pudding is good too, but when summer comes I always make an excuse to buy their fresh fruit bavarian. I'm waiting for summer again. Theres one thing I didn't like from here is the passion fruit bavarian.

Wow just browsing at the yummy pastries from the display makes me pile on the calories. I was quite undecided on what to get but eventually got the lemon tart and the two friands. The friands are small moist chocolate cakes with a smothering of chocolate on top. It is a great tea time snack if you just want a light bite. Ooooh the lemon tart was awesome too...the right amount of tangy custard in a nice crumbly biscuit base with a big dollop of whipped cream and two flakes of tangerines (I think that is what it is), it is just delightful. The iced hibiscus tea was tangy and refreshing. Oooh..I'll be back for more. I just wish there was more seating space. Passed by on the weekend and the line was snaking out of the doors so beat the rush folks! Oh the hot pressed sandwiches actually look sooo yummy and so was the quiche. It was light and flaky...I am usually not a big quiche fan but this one, i thoroughly enjoyed it :)

Oh yes, the famous Tartine bakery.  Do brace yourself, you will be paying $10+ for a sandwich and $4 for a chocolate croissant.  Kiss your work lunches goodbye and save for a nice weekend visit here.  The ingredients are top-notch (organic and local), so their inflated price is a function of their quality.   A had the sopressata (dried salami) and pesto pressed sandwich.  Now, we've had pressed sandwiches before, but this sandwich was nothing short of spectacular.  It was as if an angel sat on the country bread and seasoned it with salt and butter crack.  It did take 20 minutes for us to get our meal, but it was worth it. K had the prosciutto and provolone pressed sandwich.  It tasted like ham 'n cheese from heaven.  The cheese was melted perfectly and the prosciutto was perfect: not too dry, not too greasy.   The only downside to Tartine, as others have noted, is the wait and parking.  You can NEVER find parking in the Mission and if you do, you'll worry about it getting jacked.  But this place is that good.  It's worth the risk.  So remember to wipe down your GPS suction-cup windshield mark and take all valuable belongings with you.  These will be the best $10 sandwiches you'll ever eat.   I guess #63 from that infamous blog "Stuff White People Like" is true-- they sure to love dem expensive sandwiches.   http://stuffwhitepeoplel… Thanks for sharing your taste with us Asians.

Great ambiance, relaxed vibe, delectable treats and the richest chocolate pudding ever, mmmmmmmm. The only reason I knocked it down one star is the seating factor.  Whenever I do find a seat it's usually at this cramped communal table that has seats right up to the wall/window and a few times there has been nowhere to sit at all.  But this is just an indication of how good the food is here.  The quiche (at least one veggie quiche per day in addition to the meat quiche) is very good as well, the crust oh so flaky.   All is good here, I have no complaints about the food at all, raving really.

Ok, ok, this place is fabulous. Even William Grimes says it turns out the best croissants he's had on this side of the Atlantic. And I agree. And it makes me want to bake beautiful heavenly smelling things. The only problem with this place is the limited seating....but if you're serving things like that decadent chocolate souffle cake or that gorgeous lemon merengue cake...I guess you could have all the seating in the world, and there wouldn't be enough.

THE SHHH ** IS BANANAS!!! banana cream tart hands down THE BEST.  I've never been a huge fan of banana cream pies in general, but I LOVE Tartines.  The crispiness of the buttery crust, with the chocolate around the shell so that the pie isn't soggy.  The croissants are pretty good.  Very rich and buttery.   I had there lunch sandwiches  Sopressata, Fontina, Broccoli Rabe Pesto, but honestly, I felt like the sandwich was a tad bit greasy. I'd stick to the banana cream tart.  My sister and I always bring our so cal friends to this bakery.

There's little I can say that's not already been said in the 1200 odd reviews before me. But I'll try. Yum? Oh joy? If heaven was a bakery, it would be Tartine? I'm too lazy to do a search on the words. A friend first introduced me to Tartine by bringing me a chocolate souffle cake for my birthday. Now, visiting town and being in the area, we swung by to see what was available. I've heard things about the queue. But while it existed around 7 pm on a Friday, it was only a few people. I say the queue should be an opportunity to examine the items on the counter more closely. But when you're wishing you were eating the bread pudding rather than looking at it, my rationale won't get a nod of approval. Anyway. The chocolate souffle cake is incredible. And everything else looks wonderful. Fat, decadent, rich, lovely looking pastries, cakes, breads, and served up in a rustic and sensual and lusty atmosphere. A quick glance behind me and I caught a woman in the midst of her mouthful of bread pudding. She was sitting alone, and her eyes were closed, savoring the moment.   Perhaps I might not consider it worth the wait had I been subjected to a long queue, but I got lucky. So I leave with my cake, a slice of quiche, and a memory of that woman enjoying her evening dessert. Merci.

Literally, the best croissant I ever had was at Tartine.  We waited in the ridiculously long line on a sunny but cool morning, oohing and aahing over all the baked pastry deliciousness under the glass counter as we edged into the crowded bakery, and ordered up a whole array of buttery croissants, croque monsieurs, orangey-cinnamon morning buns, hot fragrant teas and coffees.  We then proceeded to the park nearby and laid out the food for an impromptu picnic, tore into the boxes, and enjoyed bite after bite.  Seriously. The. Best. Croissants. I've. Ever. Had. Oh yeah, and when we were done, we relived a few "Full House" style moments running through the park with somebody else's dog (unfortunately, he wasn't a Golden Retriever like Comet, but close enough).  Yummy croissants put us in a good mood.

I don't know why people love Tartine so much.  I do know why people go there -- it's the only standalone bakery in the neighborhood I can think of with its range of offerings.  But somehow that got extrapolated from "only one" to "the very best." Well, it's not.  It's really just a decent neighborhood bakery.  None of the pastries are made with much precision.  There's no sophistication ... you won't find much more than big lumps of crust (usually harder than it should be, and cracking in the case), lots of filler (usually butter and sugar) ... the bread pudding is good, but it's really one-note and a gut bomb.  It is bread pudding, after all.   It's OK for a bakery to be kind of homey and inelegant.  They kinda serve the pastry your grandmother-you-don't-have made in your fantasy childhood.  But it's not worthy of the hype, the crush of people, the general snobby attitude that infects the place, the sly mention on the Apple commercial ...

Oh Tartine, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. No seriously. As much as it is hipster-hyped, beneath it all, Tartine is the pastry and baked good cotillion. Yes, only the most elite, gorgeous, rich and tasty morsels are presented here. I've tried tarts, bread, croissants (filled and unfilled), open-faced sandwiches, buns, even the bread pudding. Not a single complaint. About the food, anyway. The lines are a different story. Don't come hungry - you'll wait about half an hour before you even get a taste.

I love the location, the decor, the simplicity, and the vibe of this place.  It is just quintessential SF if you ask me.   The bread is amazing.  I love country white. It is simple, has great flavor (its sour, but not as sour as sourdough) and an incredible texture and crunch on the outside.  It some of the best bread I have ever had.   The lemon tart is out of this world delicious. I have never tried their crossaints or pains because they look overly cooked for my tastes (I like them soft, airy, buttery, and lightly crispy/flakey).   They have great coffee as well. I love their croque sandwiches.   I love their sandwiches as well, however, the last time I came I could not finish it.  i believe they add butter to their sanwhiches.  I love butter, and no doubt they use high quality butter, but I think they use too much (if they do in fact use it). I got a meat sandwhich the last time, so there was oil from the cheese (which is not a bad thing), oil from the meat (which is not a bad thing), and oil from the butter (which is a bad thing.).  That was just too much oil.  The first bite was heaven, the second bit was good, and every bite after that was just ok. They have such a quality product that I have to give them 5 stars, but i wish their sandwiches were less rich.

I'm giving this place 5 stars for the fresh baked bread only..if i could id give even more for the sesame loaf...the pastries i've had so far i  think would hang out between 3.5 and 4, depending on how angsty i'm feeling. but seriously, the bread here is amazing. i moved 2 blocks down from tartine just a few weeks ago, with no knowledge of its existence. happened to  wander here right after 5 in search of a snack, and saw a sign saying fresh baked bread, wed-sunday after 5. fresh baked bread has broken my heart numerous times, but what can i say, i keep crawling back. I got a few pastries (not really noteworthy - im moody about Scharffen Berger, there are stronger chocolates out there but i digress) and half a sesame loaf. both pastries i had were eh, so after a bite i turned my attention to the bread. the loaf was still pippin hot, with toasted sesame on the perfect crunchy crust, and I tore of a piece to discover steamy, mushie perfection on the inside, laced with some sesame for some extra nuttiness.  one bite bought tears to my eyes. the bread was so good, i sat there on the street corner and ate a good fourth of the loaf. walked 10 feet to the other corner, and sat down and ate another fourth. i love this bread. and it loves me. im really only writing this review to kill time till 5pm.

This is one of those places that you hate to love - OR - that you love to hate - It has the bestest - yummiest pan au chocolat (That's chocolate croissants for the rest of us non francophiles) - It has the rudest - meanest - nastiest - slowest people behind the counter I have seen in a long time - and I lived in Paris for god's sake - It has the bestest - yummiest - most delicious butter laden cookies your cholesterol craving clogged blood stream could want - And the bitch behind the counter - Gee whiz - I said "Good morning - how are you today - I'd like a _______" - and she snarled at me and walked away like I had just informed her that I had run over her cat with my gas guzzling SUV. (I don't have an SUV....) -Maybe she was in a bad mood cause she hadn't licked her cat that morning ..... Tartine is one of the bakeries in SF that make eating baked goods worth it - Maybe they can set up an Automat style window system - you  know - put your $$ in the wall - open the door and get the item you want - and not have to deal with slow and weird and rude and hippy mission types gotta go - I think the croissants are due out in the next few minutes and I need to get inline for my butter and abuse ............

Yes their pastries are exceptional, especially the eclairs. But my favor was sealed one evening when I spotted Clint Baker through the window, with the most pleasantly peaceful grin, working the upright bass alongside none other than Craig Ventresco!  (Ventresco did the ragtime guitar work on the Rober Crumb documentary.  Baker is arguably the most notable Bay Area musician in traditional jazz these days. )   The crowded Tartine patrons barely applauded between songs, despite the obvious talent.   From the sidewalk, visibly smitten, I just peered in and smiled.

Tartine has amazing food.  One time when I was unemployed, a friend and I said we were going to try and eat our way through the entire dessert window.  After our second visit, we gave up, because we realized we would gain entirely too much weight.  It's not that you couldn't do it, it's just that isn't the way Tartine is meant to be enjoyed.  Bring a newspaper, and order just about anything, and then wait.   It's also great to bring some of their fresh baked bread to dinner parties.  I went a solid year where I would go at 5 pm to pick up a fresh country loaf of bread, and grab a little bag of their thin, crispy, chocolate chip cookies.  If you have a smaller group, you can grab just half a loaf.  It's worth it.

Don't really get what the hype is all about. First time I tried their spicy turkey sandwich was when my sister brought left overs back home. Sandwich was slightly burnt which left a bitter taste and very very oily and slightly smushy.  I assumed that the sandwich was like that because it was take out. However I finally went there in person a few days ago. These are what we ordered and the reviews of them. 2 spicy pesto turkey pressed sandwiches: I would rate 2 stars. THe whole thing was covered in grease and oil. The inside of the sandwich was pretty good due to me liking melted cheese and turkey. You can't really go wrong with that. However it would have been much better with 1/4 the oil. Its insanely expensive for the quality and taste of this sandwich. They also packed a lot of oil on the inside which i like but again there was WAAAYYY too much grease on the inside of the sandwich as well. to summarize: BIG OILY GREASE BALL TURKEY SANDWICH Breadpudding: ok but i felt like it wuz kinda of dry. I didnt see what was so great about it.  Also cost an arm and a leg. ALmond croissant was good. but not GREAT. not good enough for the price I would say. Lemon tart: was also good but not GREAT. too pricey. All in all I would probably not come back due too high prices and lack of quality to match those prices. Your much better and will save a ton of money going somewhere else. Also what is up with the workers?? They look INSANELY dirty and unkempt. Makes me seriously question what they could possibly be doing to the food while my back's turned. Just don't come here ok. THe people who rave about this place are delusional.

Very overrated. The cashier's rudeness sealed their fate as an unprofessional establishment. The friand we got was dry and stale (overbaked or day old perhaps?) and the croissant was dry, heavy as bread.  The TJ's frozen croissants (made by Jean-Yves Charon) are light years better. Slow service (30 min wait for a croissant??) makes this a very fun destination too. I've never had to wait so long in line, even in the busiest bakeries in Paris. The hipsters can have this place.

I am a dessert kind of girl. Yes, I totally have a sweet tooth! Finally, I made time to give this place a try. It's kind of hard to find because there's no sign or banner with its name.  After circling around, we finally found it with parking right in front. SWEEET!!! Small little bakery with some tables inside as well as tables outside, perfect for those nice sunny days! Between two people we tried... COCONUT PASSIONFRUIT BAVARIAN CAKE: this was recommended by the guy who was helping us.  This was the first dessert we dug our forks into.  Neither of us enjoyed it too much.  I was expecting more of a coconut flavor to it, but the tartness of the lemon and passionfruit overpowered the coconut.  Also, I didn't like the coconut flakes that the cake was topped with.  This just didn't do it for me. We moved on to the cookies.... COCONUT MACROONS: nice light little treat.  I loved its crunchy outside and chewy inside.  The coconut flavor was not TOO much, just perfect.  I'm not a big coconut fan, but this definitely left me wanting more! ROCHER with toasted almond: I had no idea what it was when I ordered it, but I decided to give it a try and it was another delightful little treat!  I'm not sure what its made with, but i love how its chewy almond flavored insides. Delicious. BANANA CREAM TART: the best thing we ordered! i wish we didn't save it for last because we would have killed it if it was the first thing we ate. I absolutely love the flaky crust, which went well with the custard cream.  There is also a bit of caramel in it, which definitely makes it different from all the other banana cream pies I've ever tried.  I wish the banana slices in the pie were sliced a little thinner. I think it would have been a bit more enjoyable. I enjoyed my dessert with a Latte while my friend had a ginger beer. I wish the latte was served in a mug with handles to hold onto.  Instead it was served in what seemed like a soup bowl. weird. The ginger beer tasted like ginger, not my type of drink. I noticed a great variety of savory pastries and goodies. I will definitely be back to try more!!

There are few words that can describe such divine pastry crafting. I could rave about this little hot spot for hours. I'll save you the time and just recommend you leave now to get in line because it will wind around the corner. Please keep waiting. You cannot go wrong when you order. It's overwhelming to see just perfect little buns, pastries, puddings, pies and more, but just hold the course and pick one (or three).

I am in love. Their baked goods are just as good as if you were to get them in France. Rustic French baking (I think so anyway) is delicious here. Their pastries are fragrant (from all the butter) and their cakes are moist, pungent and mouth watering. I was a little early for their afternoon bread so I was disappointed in not getting a chance to try their bread. If everything else wasn't $6 each, I would've taken one of everything home with me. I also love that they have outdoor seating, and you can sit outside to enjoy your coffee and sandwich. Parking here is almost nonexistent because of the neighborhood so don't plan on driving here. Also, the first time I came here, I wasn't sure if this was the place or not since it doesn't have a gigantic sign but it is. If you drive by, it looks like a bakery with people packed inside and out. That's how you known you're at the right place. The gals behind the counter are friendly and helpful, though the cashier seemed a little less friendly. Still, the deliciousness of the goods is worth coming for.

I dont understand why the morning bun is one of their signature buns to get. It was dry, too sweet and kind of cold when I got it. Also, it's always packed in there and they have less than 10 tables all the time. i'll definitely have to try their other pastries to see if this place lives up to the hype.

The rating for this review is very complicated, it takes into consideration all the hits and miss of this place. Let's start with the service - slow as hell. Tartine owners - you know there is a line on weekends, why not put another cashier? and another server? why one of the workers is sometimes at the achier and sometimes serving people? Would it cost that much to add another employee - or you have to see the line? Because of this behavior of the owner I have to worn you: STAY AWAY DURING THE WEEKEND. This place is right in my neighborhood - and I would never stand for 40 minutes to get anything baked, unless it is world war II all over again and like my grandfather I live in Leningrad during the siege.   Now if you decided coming during the week - NOT AROUND LUNCHTIME!!! (12:00-2:00). If you enjoy standing in line for almost an hour - please do. But it is my opinion that the owner/manager of this place should do more to cut the lines (and he can, trust me, there is nothing holding the line except for the fact they are always one employee short). I think it is rude and shows that he doesn't respect his clients. Now let's go to the food review. They have some good baked stuff. Best are the chocolate tea cake and the almond-lemon teacake - don't miss it. Their eclair is also very good. And on the weekends (remember I told you to stay away during the weekend? Friday's afternoon is an exception) they have canales which are also very good. All the rest? Mediocre at it best. Croissant  - heavy as hell, yes they are big, yes they look pretty, but if you ever been to paris and tasted a french croissant, you will immediately recognize that this place knows NOTHING about french patisserie and they should stay away from it. Same goes to their pain au chocolat - STAY AWAY! I also don't like their huge choco-ship and oatmeal cookie, and the lemon pie is simply disgusting - way too much egg yolks in the curd - feels like eating raw eggs. Sandwiches - also stay away, unless you like huge sandwiches - full of cheese and fat. I don't like it at all. BUT the carrot on the side is amazing and their side salad is also very simple and refreshing. So why do I keep on coming back to this horrible place? Because their tea cakes are amazing. Pretty expensive at 3.75$ per piece - but oh-so-good that I simply cannot resist!!! Go for the american baked goods - stay away from everything with a french name (except eclair) because they know Sh$%^ about it!

BEST Banana Cream Tart EVERRRR! Starting from the top, dark chocolate shavings rest on a pillow of lightly whipped cream. As your fork sinks in, smooth custard-y pastry cream and fresh slices of  banana await. With each bite, there is rich creamy caramel sauce and just when you think you've reached heaven, dark chocolate coats the perfectly flake-y crust. MMmmmm, my mouth waters just thinking about it. There are days when we wait 20 minutes in line, just to find out the banana cream tarts are sold out. So sad. Thankfully, there are lots of other delicious treats waiting behind the glass display that protects the pastries from sweets-monsters like me from reaching in and shoveling everything into my mouth. I've had the eclair, lemon tart, coconut cream tart (definitely rivals the banana one), chocolate pot de creme--EVERYTHING IS GOOD IN THE HOOD. I've also had the freshly baked country and olive bread loaves (ready at 5pm Tues-Sun), so fresh that steam escapes when you break through the crust and the meat of the bread is almost chewy (which I actually prefer). The loaves are surprisingly heavy when you hold them, but that's because they are so dense. Bottom-line, Tartine is always worth the wait.

Crazy delicious croque monsieur, so-so fran-tart, really soggy/eggy brioche bread pudding (less pudding and more... wet sponge.)  I was super curious (and not the one paying) so it was worth it to try it once, but for the 45 minutes I spent in line on Memorial Day I think I could have done better down the street with a lunch of bread and cheese taken to the park.

Line out the door, mayhem over food is oh so typical of the city's foodie culture.  Unfortunately, I did not understand the hype upon my visit to Tartine. Ordered three items: 1. Bread Pudding - I love bread pudding but that HAD to have been one of the worst ones I have ever tasted.  The pudding that day had bananas and I'm cool with that.  But the consistency of the bread pudding itself was nasty.  All mush, kinda like baby food.  There was such a strong presence of egg and I swear I was eating a mouthful of egg whites at one point.  Big thumbs down.   2. Coconut Creme Tart - Only ordered this because they had already run out of the Banana Creme Tart for the day.  (Major disappointment)  The tart barely had any coconut flavor.  Pretty much the only thing coconut about it are the toasted coconut shavings on top.  The crust itself was pretty good but hard because of the layer of chocolate on it.  Wasn't really a fan of that part because I was trying to eat it with a fork and I found myself having trouble cutting it apart.  I will be less lady-like and stuff it in my mouth next time. 3. Lemon Bar - Probably the most decent thing I tried that day.  Notice the word "decent."  It tasted like what I expect a lemon bar should taste like.  It was pretty good, Expect a strong punch of tangy lemon to hit you. And that was my experience.  I will for sure come earlier in the day next time to get their morning buns/croissants/banana creme tart before I make my final judgment.

SUPER fancy pastry for a SUPER fancy price but SUPER worth it. Now that above post sounds annoying. Anyway, this place is pretty cool; tons of pastries that would blow your mind. Great for large crowds. My friends and I got: Strawberry tart, chocolate pies, fruit bread pudding, some sort of cheesecake, and a whole lot of other goodies. This place is great for ordering a crap ton of desserts, hanging outside in the SF sun, and sharing food among your friends. Yeah it's pretty expensive but don't get too hung up on their prices.

Tartine is the perfect bakery to go to for people who fancy pastries and cakes that aren't too sweet and heavy, not to mention, their bread is superb! Everyone says their morning bun is to die for, but you have to get there somewhat early before they run out because they do not make more  (I came at 4pm on a Saturday). I had a slice of their coconut passion fruit cake, the passion fruit cream was not sweet, it had the perfect amount of tart to it, the cake itself was spongy and light, and the whip cream was also light. The slice was around 5.50, some may find that a little pricey, but the portion was really quite big. My brother had their bread pudding which was just "okay" while my other friends had their pastries (forgot which ones), but they were AWESOME. I happened to buy a loaf of their sourdough wheat bread and let me tell you this is the best loaf of bread I have ever eaten in my entire life, whenever I am in the mission district I will definitely wait in their line to buy a loaf before I head back to South Bay.

Delicious just about everything.  To name a few of my favorites: chocolate pudding, lemon tart, banana cream pie, chocolate chip cookies, I could go on. Coffee is great and wine selection is good. The people who work there are nice, though it seems quite disorganized. And cross your fingers for finding a table - it's almost as hard as finding a parking spot.

Things that make coffee good: flavor, freshness, and overall strength.  Tartine manages all of these very well.  The pastries are spot on, every single one, but my fav, by a landslide, is the morning bun.  The orange zest coupled with the buttery pastry is so divine. It is also the perfect size, leaving you full and not overwhelmed by the richness (which can overtake the pleasure in some of the other items.) The lines are a pain, but again, sometimes they are worth it for something really special.

Last I checked, your J-O-B is to provide service to your customers, SOOOO, WTF is up with the 'tude?!   My friends and I all agree that it's such a misfortune because Tartine would be so much more pleasant if it weren't for some of the employees.

I know people who will claim this is the best bakery in town. I'm not sure about that but definitely can fight on one of the top 3 spot. This is one of the only places that understands that croissant is not just a different shape for donut. They also feature other interesting delicate pastry which mean you can do breakfast, branch or just spoil yourself with sugar. Note that this place does get full after 10:00 and you will probably need to stand in line. But yes. It's worth it.

Came here with a friend who proclaimed it as one of the only places to get real French pastries outside of France. I wasn't sure what that meant until I experienced the luxuriant richness of their goodies. Coconut creme tart: one of those times you'd really prefer a private enclosed room in which to enjoy it fully, as it moves you to make passionate "MmMMMmmmmm" sounds while eating that aren't quite appropriate in public. Thank goodness its loud and full of conversation. Don't forget to clean up your crumbs!

If I see another bakery in America try to be an 'authentic' French boulangerie, I'm going to puke in my mouth. While the treats and breads are good for those with nothing to compare them to, if you have ever been to France (or are an expatriate!) and tasted real viennoisserie or pain/baguette, then don't go here looking for your fix. I have been searching in vain for authenticity for years.

I didn't see a point in adding another review for this place because the long ass queue speaks for itself.  Morning bun is to die for and so is the almond croissant.   But damn.  I just had some of their freshly baked bread and that motivated me to write this review.  Fresh loaves of Tartine Bread = the best thing since sliced bread!  Go down the street to get some triple cream cheese from Bi-Rite and you have yourself a delicious, albeit nutritionally unbalanced, meal!

Tartine is the closest I've come in the US to European (especially French and Italian) baked goods.  The croissants are the perfect combination of flaky, salty, sweet - and if you can eat one soon after it comes out of the oven, you will be in heaven.  What I like is that they do the basics so well, the scones, breads and pastries are just right. And then there's dessert.  The passion fruit coconut cake or the lemon tart are perfect if you happen to be tired of chocolate.   My only sadness about it is that when I'm really craving a sweet and a cup of coffee (or glass of wine), it feels like torture waiting in line staring at all those taunting cookies behind the glass.  And then once I get my plate and cup in hand, waiting again for a table to open up...

Was celebrating my colleagues birthday and wanted to a get a cake for him. We landed at Tartine Bakery on a Saturday evening at five and there was a serpentine queue outside. The place seemed very popular. It is a small cafe with few sitting and standing spots inside and a few seats outside. Nothing to vote on the ambiance It is a self service joint, so you stand in queue, choose the stuff, pay the bill, find a place and take the food and then take the empty plates back to the dish-washing place (i found the last bit just by observing other people!). So i vote myself a 5 for service :-) After a 15 minute wait, we got a 6 inch "Opera Cake" for $26..was little expensive..i guess it is not a safeway cake! and when we ate it later was wondering if it was supposed to be so hard? Would have liked it to be little more soft and moist. The lemon tart and bread pudding were out of the world....absolutely lip-smacking, the best i have eaten. The Hot cocoa was not too great, i think Starbucks is better. My friend said his coffee was good though. For a total $46 it was little heavy on the pocket. Still would vote 4 stars on the food I would like to go again to try other items in the menu. Oh well, later i also found this joint was a Bay Area Top 100 listed. Well, that explains the pricey tag!

Alright, so I have never reviewed here and this place triggered an urge inside of me to review it. Tartine is simply the best bakery I have ever been in the whole world (trust me, i have traveled to over 30 countries)! Luckily for me I went there on my last day in San Francisco and I am very happy I did. Their morning buns and almond croissants are simply delicious. The quiche is also pretty good. Bottom line is: if you are in San Francisco, this place is a must.

The pastries are so good that someone actually tried to steal them from me!!!  No Joke!   My boss asked me to pick up some pastries, so I got to the bakery at 7:30am (a feat in itself) and waited for 20 minutes in line.  After I got some warm yummy Morning Buns and Croissants I got on the 22-Fillmore heading to work.  As I sat reading  my newspaper, a well dressed middle-age woman on her way to work (she was sitting facing me) jumped up grabbed my box of pastries (not my purse) and makes a dash off the bus!!!  She tried to steal my pastries!!!  The Audacity!!! So I lunge over the guy sitting next to me and yell "That's mine!"  She doesn't stop so I grab the pastry bag and tug on them until she lets go.  Meanwhile I spill my coffee on the guy next to me (who was reading a How-to book on developing personal magnetism).    At first I thought she picked them up by mistake but then I realized that she never said sorry and just ran off the bus.  Plus the pastries were warm and smelled really nice.  I can't believe it!  Anyway these pastries are so good that it causes seemingly normal looking people to try and steal them from you - watch out!

Ah Burning Man week... The BEST time to live in San Francisco. Less traffic, fewer commuters, shorter lines, it's fantastic! So I decided to celebrate this holiday in the Bay by going to Tartine, which usually has some insane lines. I had attempted to go to Tartine a few times before but couldn't handle the wait. Today I was able to walk right in, check out the pastries on display and... wait. I wasn't sure what the protocol was, as I stood by the case I kept trying to make eye contact with one of several Tartine employees so I could ask them a question, but nobody came by. So I walked to the register, where a girl was standing, and waited some more. She looked up once, the sort of fiddled around with some stuff, while I stood there. There wasn't a "I'll take your order in a moment." or anything like that. After this, I decided to just order an eclair and some lattes, and decided to shelve any questions for another visit. I have to say, the coffee drinks weren't all that good, but the eclair was alright. I can't say I would go there again, and I can't for the life of me imagine why anyone would wait in line for this. If I wanted to wait in line and deal with less than enthusiastic staff, I'd go to Ritual. At least the product at Ritual is worth waiting for. Why aren't there any other decent bakeries in the Mission anyways?

Love the freshly baked bread, whole reason why we placed an order! We got 2 half loafs. Walnut and country loaf! For both loafs it was around $9. Yes more expensive then bread you can buy at the store but the bread is made from local organic products. We picked our order up right as they were bringing it out of the oven! Read all the hype about this place and am a believer! This is not the type of place to spontaneously stop in and pick up bread. When we went to go pick it up there was a line out the door. If you order ahead of time you can bypass the line. Since we  were coming from Anaheim, I wanted to make sure that we wouldn't waste our time waiting in line so I ordered ahead. Their website includes very specific instructions about how to order. You must place your order 3 days in advanced, must call in to speak with a manager, get confirmation of your order and pay in advance. But saves you the time when you get into the city and check out all the sites (if you are a tourist). We decided to pair our bread with some goat cheese from Cowgirl Creamery! Best pairing EVER!! Must give it a try. We didn't get a chance to check out the dessert or food from Tartine! Maybe next time

Always worth the wait. and the line moves fast. I can't say that I've ever been disappointed here. The daily bread pudding topped with fresh fruit is wonderful in the AM. The gougères are the best. The tarts (banana cream, coconut cream, chocolate etc), the croissants... Sizes have been apportioned up for America, so the items mostly come in larger sizes than you would see in France. The pressed sandwiches are varied & fantastic and always too big for one person, so I like to bring a friend to help me eat one. This also saves you a bit of room for dessert, which a sane person would never pass up here. They don't always have every bakery item at all hours of the day and that's how it should be. What's available now is always fresh. The Coffee is also excellent. If you're having coffee or tea with your food, order it at the main food line. But if you only want a beverage you can always go straight to the coffee bar and order it there. The revolving art show on the walls is always a pleasant surprise. Interesting choices. It's always crowded but this place always feels like home.

I've been here 4-5 times; the wait is crazy around 9-10am on weekdays and weekends but in the afternoon you can just walk in. I mostly dislike this place because it's expensive (like breakfast for 2 for $25... theft!), and the food is not that interesting flavor-wise. What's really going for it is the massive amounts of butter. Seriously, it's coma-inducing--things are tasty enough, but my visits here are generally followed by an involuntary nap, so I'm going to have to stop soon. If you're a decent cook, their cookbook is quite straightforward and can replicate the bakery results. I've made better lemon tarts; I've definitely made better bread pudding. (Theirs is practically like sweetened scrambled eggs, yuck. Why the hype, yelp?) The service is decent, sometimes not very good -- I came in once and the server seemed bored and slow--every question made her freeze like she was incapable of both handing me a croissant and answering a basic question like 'what time do you serve bread?' Sucks because I bet working at Tartine is like the best job in America. They should be able to pick and choose people! And instead they choose. these guys?? anyhow. Speaking of which, the bread: not very good. Their olive bread has like, 3 olives per pound. It's bizarre how they serve it still warm. It hasn't even finished cooking. I did try it when it cooled down--not very flavorful or interesting, just tastes like plain artisan bread, and a bit rough. And huge. And, expensive. And oddly, rich--like it could be dinner by itself. My favorite things here are the lemon pound cake, almond croissant, and gougeres (though I wish they served them warm). Bread pudding is terrible, other croissants are 3/4 butter by weight and will knock you out, brownies way too rich, and it makes me feel like a tool to pay $7 for a fruit tart so can't review that, etc.

Okay, there are many things on this earth that defy explanation. However, very few of those things are man made, agreed? Tartine Bakery is an example of this anomaly. To use another astronomical term, it's a singularity, a singularity of deliciousness. If I sound hyperbolic it's because SO ARE THE FLAVORS IN THIS PLACE, and I know what I'm talking about. I think people in SF take genius for granted because there is so much of it in this town. From computer programming to journalism to cuisine, there are just some extraordinary people in this city. That does NOT mean that they don't deserve to be heralded. God bless Tartine Bakery and I hope one day to live upstairs and eat every meal there!

We've been here twice, with us being impressed on the 1st visit with the one or two items that we ordered (we forget what we ordered exactly) but disappointed on the 2nd visit.  The 3 stars is a reflection of our recent visit. A few years back we tried the croissant, which was very delicious.  During our 2nd visit we ordered a gougeres which smelled heavenly, but I wasn't impressed.  I've never had one before, so I'll admit that my ignorance of what a gourgere is led to my reaction. As for sandwiches, we were very excited to order a pressed sandwich but to our dismay when we got there they were out of bread for sandwiches!!  (A bakery out of bread?!)  We ordered a ham croque monsieur, a mushroom one, and a ham quiche.  We were very happy with all three, especially the quiche.  Despite the fact that it is basically eggs, cream, cheese, ham, and a buttery crust it seemed very light--we were impressed!  My husband and brother enjoyed their croque monsieurs, but I wasn't blown away, especially the ham one. We finished off with a delicious chocolate pudding.  It was a very nice ending but it's hard to see how a place could not make more than *3/4 * of its lunch/dinner menu not too long after it started serving.  We could understand running out of bread 8, 7, maybe even 6 hours into the afternoon service but we got there at 1, just an HOUR after they started serving lunch.  That was very disappointingand unacceptable.

Upon reading so many good things about the banana creme tart, I had to give it a try.  The place was bustling on the inside, so after we got our tarts, we headed for the outdoor seating.  Since it was only slightly windy, I enjoyed the outdoor seating because there were so many cars and people passing by.   The tart was scrumptious!  Every component of it, from the thin chocolate flakes with powdered sugar that formed a roof over the tart to the slices of real banana lightly covered with caramel, made the tart absolutely enjoyable.  Although the tarts were a bit pricey, I am definitely coming back to try the other pastries they have to offer.

So I finally made it to the Tartine Bakery! There isn't much I can say that the 1800+ yelper ahead of me haven't already said. It really is THAT good. But I will warn you that this is the place where well intentioned New Year's Resolutions go to die!!! I went with the naïve idea that I go and pick up a couple of things for breakfast and enjoy my coffee before starting my day. Instead I had breakfast and left with a goodie bag of treats I couldn't pass up to share with my co-workers later. I needed the excuse of treating my co-workers to live with the fact that I bought soo much. I will say that I usually don't like quiche. However, their ham and arugula quiche looked so good I couldn't pass it up. And I was glad I didn't, it's very light and fluffy and not too rich. The morning bun was also amazing and it's usually not my top pick in a bakery. But after reading the raves of my fellow yelpers I felt the need to try it as well. I don't think I've ever had such a flaky croissant! I sampled the chocolate filled one which might have ruined me for all other croissants in the future.   The brioche bread pudding is also very good! Not as sweet as other bread puddings but very creamy and filled with lots of baked apples! I'm a fan.

I had my first (but definitely not last) Tartine experience last weekend. Everyone in San Francisco raves about it.. they used to look at my like I killed someone when I said I had never been! We stopped by Tartine after hiking Twin Peaks- it was a well deserved treat! The line was ridiculous but I toughed it out. I picked out a couple of things and was not disappointed. Would have loved to try their famous morning bun but since it was 4pm there was obviously none left. I loved the brownies- they are so rich that it took me extra long to savor and enjoy. Can't wait to go back next time we are in Dolores Park. I might even give up waiting in Bi-Rite Creamery's line for Tartine... wait, maybe not :)

I was told by a friend to visit this place for their Eclairs. While I was standing in line, I was tempted by all the other wonderful patries, so in addition to an Eclair, I picked up a butter croissant, a morning bun, a banana tart, and a coconut tart. (yeah, that's what usually happens with me, just like buying milk at the supermarket) The Eclair was just ok. But I'm not a huge fan of eclairs in general, since they are usually soft after being placed back into the fridge. However......I'm addicted to their croissants, morning buns, and banana tarts!! I've gone back many times for said items. The croissants are buttery and crispy (especially when reheated in the toaster oven). The chocolate layer and caramel gives the tart that extra edge. Delicious! I really need to try their other items, but I always end up getting the croissants and tarts.

The only reason why I'm not giving them 5 stars is because one time I ordered a lemon bar, and it was such an intense sweet and sour flavor that it stung my throat. :( Other than that one incident, this place is perfection! From the little 75 cent bites to the $5-6 slices of cake... or my favorite, the lemon cream tart. Don't let the line out the door intimidate you. It moves pretty fast, and I've actually always been able to get a seat (because so many people take their stuff to picnic at Dolores Park!). They also serve delicious hot sandwiches, which, at $12, seem pricey but are actually well worth the price!

Hm I don't know if it is fair of me to rate Tartine Bakery because I only had cookies, pastries and coffee from it, but I'm going to do it anyway. We really wanted to come here during our trip to SF, but we didn't have time to squeeze it into our schedule. However, luck was on our side! When were walking to Dolores Park, we decided to look for a store to buy some water and we accidentally stumbled into Tartine Bakery. Once we got inside, the smell of the bakery just overwhelmed us. We had already eaten lunch but we had to try some of their pastries. We bought about half a dozen random cookies, a chocolate eclair and some coffee. Tartine's eclair was so rich and delicious, it was really something else. Hopefully next time I'll be able to try the food. Recommendation: Coffee

Finally had a chance to go back here (well the crowd wasn't spilling onto the sidewalk...) and so the bro, sis.in.law, BFF and I decided to get dessert first before dinner... that's how we roll =) We got two eclairs... a mocha for me... latte for the bro and sis.in.law and of course a chair for the BFF. We managed to sit outside since the weather was gorgeous... amazing. First bite of the eclair... first time ever... WOW! The chocolate was dark and thick and the eclair itself wasn't too sweet and it was just right. Very creamy and rich indeed... seriously, we were all in heaven! The combo of the mocha and eclair... ooh I loved it! Can't wait to go back... so worth the hype!

When I was in college, I would drive all the way from Davis to SF at 8am on a Saturday morning just to revel in breakfast at Tartine. I had to fight for parking and wait in a long line outside in the cold.. yet it was worth it. And because the drive to and from Tartine was so long, I would hoard boxes of goodies to last me throughout the week.. until I came back the following Saturday to stock up again! I would start my morning with a cafe aux lait and some quiche, and then pile up on all the different bakery goods -- a frangipane tart, a banana creme tart, croissants, tea cakes, bread pudding.. and just whatever they had that looked good, I would buy it and take it back with me in sheer delight. Ahh, Tartine was and still is a little slice of heaven. Even in a city full of options, there is a reason why this place is considered an establishment and why years and years later, I continue to flock back for more.

I'm a big fan of the 7x7 100 things to eat before you die list, and I noticed early on that Tartine was the only place with TWO items on the list.  The first time I went, I had the morning bun, the quiche, and the airy gruyere roll thing (I can't remember the name, though).  Everything was great, especially the morning bun.  Had just a little bit of a hint of orange, but the texture was perfect, the bun was flaky, and the cinnamon flavor stuck with me for a long time.  I also loved that gruyere roll and the quiche too.  I've been back a number of times since, having those same three things almost everytime, as well as the eclair (awesome as well), bread pudding with apples (very good), and cookies (mostly good).   However, recently my wife and I decided to go wait in line for the fresh loaf of bread so I could check something else off the 7x7 list.  We found out from a friend that the bread is ready at 5 pm, so we showed up one day at 4:55, only to see a line of 30+ people, which ran outside the restaurant.  Uh oh.  It was a bit hectic out there, since I guess one line is for pre-orders and the other is for everyone else.  The people out there were quite restless, as the line moved a bit slowly.  When we finally got to the front, we were told that we were the lucky winners of the LAST half-loaf of sesame seed bread.  The bread was warm, light and crispy on the outside, and soft and yummy on the inside.  We finished half of the bread before we even got home, and had to fight the urge to eat it all in the car!   Now I understand why Tartine gets two items on the list!  I can't wait to go back to get more bread, but next time I'll call ahead.  I advise you all do the same as well (unless of course you want to eat all of the other baked goodies, in which case you'll have to wait in line anyway).

This morning bun is amazing! It's like two very good things put in one: crossaint and cinnamon bun! Not too sweet and very crispy. Just the right kick. This is totally making my morning start of the week... I am lucky though - no need to wait in line - someone brought them into the office for me...

One word - delicious.  My wife had been here several times and I always wanted to check it out (especially after seeing the cover of their book with the incredible looking bread on it).  We came early on a Sunday morning and there was a line outside but it didn't take them too long to get through it.  There was so much activity going on that it was hard to take it all in.  You could get a sneak peek into what they were making in the back. When we got to the counter I pretty much wanted everything that they had to offer but since we were having lunch relatively soon after I just got a chocolate croissant and a hot chocolate.  The croissant didn't look like it had any chocolate in it but boy was I wrong after I bit into it.  The bread was soft and flaky and the chocolate was delicious.  I can't wait to come back and have more since they have such a variety.

Spent the night in San Francisco with the goal of heading to Tartine's for their much hyped up Morning Bun.   Receipt: Cookie Bag - 8.50 (Ouch - I remember the cookies tasting better) Morning Buns - 5 @ 3.75 = 18.75 (Expected much more.  My coworkers were happy about them though.) 4 " Banana Cream Tart - 6.50 (It's actually really good! Big though...try sharing) Spiced Turkey Dorado - 13.50 (Edges were a bit dry, but a good sandwich that I would have again.  You can toast it up again and it won't be soggy like other sandwiches if you have any leftovers.) Total: 48.53 - Quite steep for my taste.   Self service for water. Not sure if I would return.

I was fearful when I found out we were coming before 11:30 (the time when sandwiches are served). I'm not a big pastry eater so my breakfast breads are limited. Yet when I took my first bite of that fluffy, buttered croissant? Yeah, total convert. It was expensive, sure, but I didn't feel like I paid $4 for a crappy croissant. I was treated to a delicious breakfast that also included a piece of ham and cheese quiche. Again, not too eggy, cheesey, or full of ham... perfect blend. So glad we waited in line for this because it was GOOD. We went on a Sunday and arrived around 9:30am and the line was out the door, but I hear that weekdays it's a lot less frantic and you can easily snag the infamous morning buns. I was too stuffed from my own food to taste them, but my boyfriend noshed on those like it was his last meal on earth. Must be good in that case...!

I researched numerous SF bakeries to find the perfect Tres Leches cake for a special occasion.  Tartine won my business for 3 reasons: 1. Extended business hours - I couldn't pick up the cake until well after 6pm, when Shubert's and other local faves were already closed. 2. Fabulous website - You can tell a lot about a business by how they present themselves online.  I wanted the absolute best and Tartine's elegant yet professional website convinced me they could produce it.   3. Accommodating staff - I spoke with a woman on the phone who agreed to box and set aside a cake for me, on just my word that I would be there soon.  When I arrived, the cake was chilled and a staff member gave me helpful advice on how to serve it. ... The cake was... perfect. Gorgeous presentation, fresh ingredients and a thin, very special crust.

I finally tried Tartine Bakery the other day, and it did not disappoint! I ordered the croissant and banana cream tart. When deciding on what to order at first, I was a little surprised by the prices...like really $3.50 for a croissant? But when I finally saw the pastries I knew why: they are MASSIVE. One 4" banana cream tart can count as a meal. Anyways, the croissant was perfect. It was warm and fresh. The top was crunchy and the inside soft and buttery. You can really taste how much butter was added to the dough. Delicious. The banana cream tart was also quite good. In particular, I loved the whipped cream on top and the banana cream. The chunks of actual banana inside were a pleasant surprise. The tart crust itself was very crunchy, and while I liked the dark chocolate covering the bottom of the tart, the caramel that was also there made it a little too sweet for me. That's pretty much my only quibble. Servers there were nice and the wait wasn't as bad as I expected. We came at around 9:30 though, and the line exploded a half hour later, so get there early? There are many more things I want to try at Tartine (eclair! morning bun!) so I'll definitely return.

YUM. The morning buns are worth the wait. The downside is the hard to find parking, especially on a sunny weekend. Also, at $3.75 it's really expensive for one morning bun. You can almost get two semifreddi's morning buns for the same price. BUT the Tartine morning bun just might be twice as delicious. Definitely worth it's spot on the 7x7 list of things to eat before you die.

Yep...its pretty damn amazing, and although the coffee is between a three and four star, the pastries seriously pick up the slack.  I can personally attest to the wonderfulness of the banana cream pie (their crust is coated in ganache/caramel), pain au chocolat, croissant, almond croissant, currant scone, chocolate chip cookie and bread pudding.  My favorite dessert of all time is bread pudding and this one makes the top five list!  It comes with a seasonal fruit and the day I ordered it was bananas!  fan-frickin-tastic! I personally think if you want an actual dessert time is of the essence!  Next time I go I will patiently wait for a seat at one of the tables and make a go of it right in the store!   Also this place is a stone's throw from Delores Park and Bi-Rite so if you really want a blow out get ice cream to go with your pastry and get your gorge on!

So I'm strolling through the Mission with a fabulous friend on a very warm, sunny day. We had just left Dolores Park and had, successfully, drained a bottle of pinot, a french baguette and way too much cheese.  We were sunburned. We were buzzed. And we were sleepy.   That's why when passing Tartine, it seemed like the perfect idea to dart in for a great cup o' joe in hopes of securing a bit of stimulation.  In ordering a nonfat latte, I asked at the last minute if they had any vanilla flavoring.  This was clearly the wrong place to reveal my yuppie streak, because the barrista put his milk carton aside, and shot back, "This isn't Starbucks, sweetheart." with an unmistakable glare.  I mustered a "no problem" response, and paid for the beverage.   It didn't bother me that they didn't offer the flavoring for the coffee, but it was his delivery that rubbed me the wrong way.  It was rude, unnecessary, and incredibly sarcastic.  Three things that do not add up to good, let alone decent service.  I do have to say, however, that the latte was delish. This mediocre experience aside,  I will most likely return to sample the sweets.  At the time, I was too full to indulge in their heavenly-looking creations. Update to follow once I fatten up on their goodies....

First of all, I would like to thank God for NOT blessing me with diabetes so I can feel so happily guilty eating all the sweetness my Dentist tells me to stay away from. What hasn't been said already? Exactly. We go here when we have extra time (meaning I actually make it out of bed by 5am) to get to the city for work. Allen E got me hooked on the morning bun. Forget the crust!! I start chowing down the middle. That's where the party happens!! I gotta give it up to their bread pudding and their packaged thin cookies. OMG!!!! I really like how I can just eat a bun on the way back to the car and a dose of daily amusement courtesy the panhandler laying down on a mattress on Dolores. Only in SF can you find smart bums! Out of the plenty times we stopped by, I'm yet to see the nasty lines everyone talks about. But then again, we're there right when they open on weekdays when I feel like I have pregnancy cravings - but then it's just my indecisive female hormones that kick in to play. Check out their restroom too. CUTE and CLEAN. Aha. . . until next time Tartine.

A place with 713+ Yelp reviews and 4.5 stars just has to be incredibly amazing, right? Well I was rather disappointed. Yes, the place has terrific looking baked goods and yes, the almond double baked croissant and devil's food cake tasted good, but I didn't think this place was THAT amazing. And what's up with the $3 slice of pound cake? I can buy a whole big pound cake for the cost of 2 slices.  And the place was a zoo inside and all the tables were dirty from the previous inhabitants. Bottom line: Yes, I was happy to go there and be able to say I've been there but Tartine and overall experience is overrated. I'd be willing to go back and try some other stuff to see if it changes my mind. 3.5 stars.

Everything looks so good!!  But how does it tastes?  My partner and I ordered a variety of things at Tartine, and the overall opinion about this bakery is it's just "OK". Here's the breakdown: For a sweet: A slice of the Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian.  I like this the most out of all the things we ordered.  It wasn't overly sweet and the tangy lime is refreshing.  Not much of fan of the shaved coconut on top though.  It makes the good cake taste dry. For a savory:  One gougère and a Humboldt Fog goat cheese sandwich.  IMHO, the gougère doesn't have much of a Gruyère cheese taste to it, only a hint of it.  Could use more pepper too.  I wish the taste is a bit bolder. The $12 grilled goat cheese sandwich was just how it was written on the menu.  Just bread and cheese.  Don't expect anything else.  That said, it would've been nice if there were a few slices of tomatoes or something to counter the richness of the goat cheese and buttered bread.  The sandwich was grilled very nicely with nice blackened frilled marks.   Points for that.  However, I didn't like it so much when I bite into my sandwich and it was more like a (VERY) hard cracker bread with melty cheese in between.  Btw, was it walnut bread?  I didn't see any walnuts that the other reviewers mentioned.  More like white bread. Lastly, A loaf of bread to go:  tasted bitter and burnt from the bottom crust.  Definitely not the best quality.  But for $8???  Boudin is much better.   Drinks: The earl grey tea:  Not the best. Mocha: Mediocre in taste and served in a bowl.   First time I've ever had mocha in a bowl.   Mocha soup for you?  No thanks for me.

one of the last SF Must Haves that I had before I went to Boston was a 'morning bun' from Tartine. My roommate at the time kept telling me about this 'morning bun'-- she never exactly told me why this 'morning bun' was worth a trip to the Mission.  All I remembered was she used a moaning sound to describe this 'morning bun'.   "Like that?"   The last time I felt like describing a dish or a delicacy by using a moaning sound was when I was at Ippudo in New York City--when I had the delectable Akamaru Modern ramen with a side of braised pork belly.  *moan* Because my eyes are bigger than my appetite, I also had a couple other things, like the fruit tart and something else that was unremarkable.  But the 'morning bun'..... this... 'morning bun'... so flakey... but not too hard.... not too soft.... but juuuuuust riiiight. with a hint of orange... mmmmmm. *cue LL Cool J's "doin' it"* like that. ( | )

Being new to San Francisco, I wasn't actually aware of Tartine until I heard the hullabaloo around Chad Robertson's Tartine Bread cookbook.  And truth be told, I bought that darn cookbook within 1 viewing of the promo video(http://www.tartinebread.…) and made a mental note to get my ass to that bakery ASAP. Following the Tartine method of making bread has made me x1million more appreciative of delicious, delicious bread.  And when we finally made plans to go try some, saying that I was excited is an understatement.  But Mr. Robertson, I've gotta tell you - they are absolutely RUINING your bread in the pressed sandwiches by making them transparent with grease. I get that you've gotta grease up the ol' panini grill to get the sammie on and off in a timely fashion, and I get that greasy things inside of sandwiches (I'm lookin' at you, cheese) will seep out to the bread.  But holy jeebus the greasy bread on my sandwich proved to be an insurmountable barrier.  I ate 1/3 of my $12 sandwich and boxed up the rest to go. Flash forward to right now - I've reheated my remaining 2/3 in the oven, and when I picked it up from the baking sheet it left a pool of grease behind.  I set it on a folded napkin as though it was a dripping slice of bacon.  Again, I was only able to stomach another 1/3 before throwing in the towel.  Le sigh. The conclusion for us is, unsurprisingly, that next time we go to Tartine, we'll take a loaf home and make our own sandwiches. Despite the disappointing sandwich experience, the pastries blew us away (and are what took this review from 3 to 4 stars).  I'll readily add my 5 stars to the pile for the morning bun (the orange is such a surprising and welcome zing!) and the eclair was just as decadent.  Everything in the window looks to-die-for (and I'll bet it is). So in conclusion: Tartine Bread book, 5 stars.  Tartine pastries, 5 stars.  Tartine sandwiches?  3 stars, unless they take a good hard look at their recipes and cut the grease by a significant amount.  Will definitely be back!

Tartine specializes in selling pastries like a crack dealer specializes in selling drugs (although without the turf wars). We're talking fluffy, flaky, chocolately, flavorful awesomeness. The counter staff are helpful at providing advice and fast service on the pastry selection, and the lines (while long) move pretty fast. Additionally, I had a (very rich) mocha, that was absolutely awesome. Quick tip -- apparently they must pre-mix their mocha concoction as I was not able to order a non-fat version on this case, so if you are looking for something a bit lighter you'll want to order a different beverage.

Excellent organic food at regular prices.  Normally organic =  $$$$, but not this place.  It's not cheap either, but the quality is unsurpassed.  You must try: All their desserts All their tartines All their pies Okay try everything, but some of the breakfast food is ehh - like the museli!  If you go there during the weekends, good luck finding a table.  Get the food to go and enjoy it at a park or something.  Oh, the iced mocha (large with one shot) is amazing.

It's been on my mind to go here for several months now, but I have just never been that motivated.  While flipping through my issue of Elle on Saturday monring and seeing Tartine featured inspired me to make the trek over there.  That and I needed something sweet to help me cope with stress that my sister was inflicting.  So I can see why it was featured in Elle.  The shop is staffed by waif like girls with deadpan glazed look in their eyes.  I picked up 3 things, which were all amazing.  Well the coconut thing not as much, but might try it again when I can eat it right away. The bread pudding served as my lunch and as enough fuel for me to walk back to Union Square.  I also picked up a chocolate eclair, which was my Sunday morning breakfast...definitely rivals my grandmother's cream puffs.  The pudding was amazing.  Except that the waif like girl that arranged my packaging smushed it in there so the pudding spilled out.  Not ashamed to admit that my finger managed to get every last bit of pudding out of the carrier box. In any event, I would definitely go back and I am definitely glad that I don't live any closer to the place.

While its hard to find new words to describe this much beloved Mission bakery, I would support just about any flowery compliment bestowed on this wonderful bakery. The lines are always out the door, but they move quickly enough and give you time to take in the myriad of options. The morning buns are terrific, as are the chocolate croissants and tarts. The cheese sandwiches (croque monsier and three-cheese) are absurdly heavy, but if your the type who likes to get all your indulgement in at once, they certainly are tasty and use delectable sharp and smelly cheeses. The bread pudding was very enjoyable, but not as great as I'd heard. Despite complaints a hipper-than-though staff, I've always found them friendly and accommodating.

The first thing I had at Tartine was the chocolate eclair. It's flat-out the best I've ever had. Since I've been back I've moved on to savory items, specifically the typical croque monsieur -however their preparation is not so typical. They use oblong cuts of bread, top-notch smoked ham, and grilled asparagus. Best I've ever had, not sure how it could be better (someone email me if there's better, I'd like to know). While there's typically a line and a wait, and the place isn't exactly cheap, the quality of the food and the charm of the place earns this 5 stars in my book.

*SPOILER ALERT* Well, it's not really a spoiler but if it was it would go like this - imagine going to a bakery and seeing all their baked goods. Now think in your mind how good the cookie, tart, croissant - whatever it is would be once you got to taste it. Now if you take that and raise it a level above that - that would describe how good Tartine is. After seeing their book and hearing the name so many times, I decided to try it out. From reading the Yelp! reviews I knew I had found the place, not by the address but by spotting the line outside the door. Yes, it was quite a wait but not quite unbearable - I wasn't that hungry yet. People there are pretty easygoing and seem to expect a line and a wait, so everything went fine, that is anyway until I reached the counter... Soooo many choices! Since I was new there I wasn't quite drooling onsite, but next time - watch out! Everything looked good - how was a girl to choose? But I wisely chose a small variety - for me and my friends to sample (hey, I was already waiting in line, so I thought, why not share?). We enjoyed everything - the chocolate cookies, the pain au chocolat... Oh, and can I also say - I loved how nice and accomodating the staff is. With so many people coming through the door, I expected the staff to be disinterested and impatient but it was nothing like that at all. As busy as they were they were still great and answered my questions and even were as considerate as to ask me questions as to how I wanted my pastries packed. The staff is also large and I can see that they are trying to get the line moving as fast as they can. That's an "A" for effort in my book. Definitely worth 5 stars and definitely worth a return visit.

You know what I think would be insanely successful?  "The Glutton's Guide to San Francisco's Finest Foods: A Day-Long Walking Tour." It'd go something like this: 10 AM: Take a cab to 18th and Guerrerro.  Stop in at Tartine Bakery for the flakiest, most buttery croissants and scones west of paris.  Take a seat outside, order an espresso, a pressed sandwich, and top it off with a mexican cookie.   1 PM: Walk WEST down 18th to Pizzeria Delfina for lunch.  Sit outside, order a few pies, enjoy the weather. 5 PM: Continue WEST to Delfina's for dinner. 9 PM: After dinner, stand, wipe any crumbs off your belly (be sure to check in the creases of your tummy), stagger to the curb.  Hail a cab back to your hotel.

I wanted to stuff my face with everything in the glass case. Seriously! The one thing I don't particularly enjoy is: 1) Bussing my own table (I'm lazy.

Tartine was my first love in San Francisco.  Long before ever moving here, a friend took me for lunch at Tartine with the promise of the best scone I'd ever taste.  Many scones (and quiches and croissants and tarts) later, Tartine is still my favorite bakery in the city.  Their dessert case is enough to make any calorie-counter keel over in anguish, especially after waiting a good half an hour to catch a glimpse of it (which you will spend in a line snaked down the street f you plan to sample Tartine at any time on a weekend - believe me, it's worth it.  Why else would we all be standing there?) Not only are the scones delicious, but the quiche has made a true vegetable eater of my partner.  Even as a meat eater, I prefer the daily veggie variety (ranging from mushroom to kale) to get that much more egg-goodness.  The crust is flaky and perfect, but be sure to heat up your slice if you choose to take it to-go. The serving staff is sweet and flirty, and surprisingly good natured for the nonstop nature of their work on weekends.  The coffee is strong and good, and the chocolate used in mochas and the like is some of the best I've tasted in a cup. Not only was my first visit to Tartine consummated with a tasty Croque Monsieur (love the pickled carrots on the side), my friend and I were also photographed enjoying our lunch street side by a roving group of National Geographic Traveler journalists.  I never found the article, but this bakery deserves national coverage.  I bring all out of town guests here and pine after their cookbook (though making their recipes likely won't disrupt my regular visits!)

Evil.  Big fat ass inducing buttery harlot!  Damn morning bun makin, chocolate croissant bakin, soul sapping tartlet making beast. You make me stand in that line with the guys talking on their cell phones (no I don't care what you did last night), walk that ridiculously designed space (which forces you to walk through everyone breakfast snack (or triple bypass), to whack a couple years off your heart smart life. You suck, and I love you for it.  Save me a morning bun, will ya?

This place is always busy and yes, even on stormy days when most people stay at home (I know). They have a wide variety of decadent desserts and other items. As my friends and I all agree, this place is pretentious. It seems out of place since all the other places in this neighborhood are all chill and hipsterish. In the end, good food is good food. - Fresh Bread Loaf: nice, chewy, soft consistency while having the hard rustic outer layer, but not too hard so you can't even bite into it. - Eclair: good but filling was a bit too runny for my taste - Oatmeal Currant Cookies: thin, hard, but good

Every chef in training should eat at Tartine to know what a true eclair and croissant is. The next closest thing would be to go to Paris or train at the Culinary Institute of America. Some tips for you: 1. Expect to wait in line, especially in the mornings. A line that goes out the door is *not* unusual. 2. Expect to be packed inside the cafe and share tables with other people. This place is usually packed and any available seat, even on the same table, is usually taken up (but please ask to join the table, be polite). 3. Expect to walk (~5 minutes) from your car (street parking - if you can find one) to the bakery. Highly Recommended : (If you want to know what a "true" Eclair and Croissant is supposed to taste like, you will not regret this choice). -Eclair - Thick slab of rich chocolate, with warm vanilla cream and specks of vanilla bean with the smell of egg yolks. -Croissant - Slightly dark, buttery, crunch with a phenomenal middle. After I ate this, I DO NOT buy croissants anymore (from markets, bakeries, etc.). After you taste divinity, it feels like a waste of money spending it on less qualified, so called "croissants." Even the Panera croissant would be a C- compared to this. Regular market croissants, I would give an F. Costco croissants, a C. Tartine croissants - an A+.

I made it a mission to not leave San Fran with stopping here after reading all the reviews. I am so thankful I did. The chocolate croissant was amazing!!! Just the croissant itself was delicious. The crust was so crispy, flakey and the bread inside was so fresh, soft. The chocolate filling was heavenly. It was a rich semi-sweet chocolate. Make sure you ask them to toast it. It tastes sooo much better when its warm. We also got a few other treats, the eclair was decadent. The friand, mexican wedding cookies, and latte were just okay. There was a bit of a wait on a wednesday morning-but it was totally worth it. There are a few tables inside and outside to enjoy your pastries.

BEST MORNING BUN EVER. hands down! you need to go get one now... every morning bun should taste like this! PERFECT texture...perfectly crispy/crunchy on the outside but amazingly soft and chewy on the inside. DELICIOUS! seriously... i'm not easily impressed, and I don't even normally like these types of pastries or getting things where I see sugar crusted on the top... but this morning bun blew me away! there's nothing at all that could be better about it... the crusted/caramelized sugar spread throughout the morning bun gives it the best, most irresistible texture. Every 2 seconds I couldn't stop raving about how incredibly delicious it was! i literally thought to myself, "If France has better morning buns than this, I might have to move there." haha! also have amazing paninis (love the spicy turkey!) with thick, chewy, indulgent bread and fresh pesto. banana creme tarts, lemon tarts, coconut creme tarts... are heaven! wish i lived closer to here so i could get my morning bun and four barrel coffee everyday!

Been to Tartine many times and they have never disappointed. The lines are usually out the door but they are efficient at trying to get it moving, they can't do much more than that so I appreciate the effort. As far as the food, I would recommend the cakes first, as those always impress - specifically the bavarian coconut cream is amazing. The cookies are very good and have their own twist if you want to go simple. Pastries are solid, and their morning bun and croissants are definitely good but not their best point. The sandwiches are amazing and what converted me to Tartine from the beginning - definitely try them. The place is a bakery cafe so expecting much on service when they're always pretty busy isn't recommended. They take your order with a smile and get your food to you as fast as they can, I'm happy with that. Tables are bussed by customers and the place has a charming simple feel to it. Grab some sweets or food with a nice coffee/espresso and find a seat, you won't regret it.

A review for the Bread at comes at a 5pm. I was very excited to try tartine's bread, but the crust was burnt! The inside is good and chewy but I believe overall it doesn't hold a candle to the wonderful bread at Acme. I'll go back to try some of their pastries but I won't be getting the bread if I can get Acme's.

Had to wait in line outside for a long time.  When we finally got inside, it took a long time to find a table and it was very crowded and warm. I had the turkey sandwich and it was possibly the best sandwich I have ever had.  It was really big.  I could eat only a third of it and brought the rest home.  I'm definitely going back.  Most other people were having pastries.  The pastries are also really big. Looking at the menu, it seems slightly expensive until you factor in the portion size.  Once you do, it's very good and very cheap.

Ok, so the lines are long, and sometimes there's no where to sit. But, some things are just worth waiting for, then bringing to Dolores Park and enjoying in the SF sun. The pastrami panini is really good. Good, meaty pastrami slices, deliciously melted cheese, and really spicy mustard on Tartine's country loaf. It's pretty magical. It comes cut into 3 sections, which is kind of odd, but it makes the pieces more manageable. Served on the side are pickled vegetables, usually baby carrots. Beware of the cute baby carrot. They are pickled, like really pickled, like soaked in vinegar for a year pickled. Other than that, delightful. The pastries are also good. Croissants and scones are notable and worth trying at least once. I'm avoiding the cakes after the chocolate cake, bought to impress, disappointed. And these were chocolate loving people. It was "too chocolaty in a gross way". The banana cream pie had a decent crust , the inside coated in chocolate to prevent sogginess. But there was no custard. Just loads and loads of banana topped w/ whipped cream and more chocolate. I don't know about you all, but I like the custardy part, and this pie lacked in that department. The prices are a little steep, but worth it when the product is consistently good. Don't expect a cheery, friendly counter-person, and you won't  ever be disappointed.

I've been twice so far and both experiences have been good but not the five star ratings that everyone else is giving it.  Here's why: 1.  The line is slow and too long.  Is it the service?  Is it the customer?  I can't tell from either experience since I was too far out of earshot to hear how each patron's order transaction went.  All I know is that the guy in front of me had to tell the counter women three times (there was one helping him, then she stepped away and another came in to replace her) his order and he was ordering for four people.  Hmm...  that might keep the line moving less steadily. 2.  The patries are good and look so pretty, but really... are they worth the price?  I guess they do use organic and the frangipane tart was something I would hestitate to attempt myself...  The cappucino I ordered wasn't so bad either.  Ok.  I give on the pastries.  But the open faced sandwich (basically a piece of  bread toasted with cheese and ham/veggies on top) at nearly 8 dollars a pop?  I don't know... 3.  Seating.  A bit awkward for a cafe/bakery.  It's the kind of pastry at the kind of price where you want to sip on your cap, eat your eclair feel relaxed and carefree doing it.  Instead, you're scooting your chair for others to get behind you, answering "yes/no, this seat next to me at the communal table is/isn't taken," or watching others in line watch you as you bite into your piece of cake.

How the hell did this place get so popular?  I had high hopes for this place after seeing all the great reviews they were getting from Yelp.  I had a horrible experience here and would never come back even if they were giving away free food. The first thing I noticed was the guy behind the counter with the thick mustache and a tank top.  He reminded me of L. Ron Bumquist from "Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas".  He looked like he just crawled out of bed, and went straight to work.  He looked pretty sloppy considering the fact that this is supposed to be a "five star" bakery.  It didn't bother me too much until he walked by while I was eating and I caught a strong whiff of BO.... not cool at all.  I stopped eating after that. The food itself was nothing extraordinary.  I ordered the bread pudding since that is one of my favorite desserts.  I've had plenty of bread pudding in my life, and this has to have been the worst I've ever had.  I don't like my bread pudding too wet and this was practically soaked and was prepared sloppily.  The cookies and other pastries just didn't do it for me either.  The only thing that was pretty good was the shortbread cookie, and it doesn't take a genius to make a good shortbread cookie. I'm still shocked at all the support this bakery is getting.  I like to think I have decent taste in food and desserts which makes me wonder why my experience was so different from 1000+ other people.  Maybe I'm a little biased, I was comparing it to my favorite dessert place which is Extraordinary Desserts in San Diego, and this place doesn't even come close.  To the San Franciscans who love their fancy desserts, try to check that place out next time you're in SD.

Their scones remind me of that time when I was scolded by my pediatrician for being too fat.   As a young lad I suffered through the low self esteem, and being a middle child certainly didn't help matters.  Then, the vicious cycle of eating out of comfort for my weight problem snow-balled into an orb the size of jupiter. "When is this misery going to end?!!" I screamed as my uncle squeezed my boy boobs.  But that was for the last time!  In the summer of '88 I decided that I've had it.  "No more!"  I screamed.  "I will overcome this.  I am in control of my destiny!"   I've exercised the pounds away with due diligence.  Years have passed with great health and much self love.   But, oh crap! I have found myself challenging those demons once again! Damn you, scone made at Tartine (chomp chomp) (gh)yur so (ph)lagy and (chomp) delshious.  .,:..;.... crumbly..';.,arrhrrggghh!

This is a good neighborhood joint for coffee, pastries baked goods. Parking in the mission is the worst, but on a good sunny day if you are in the neighborhood this is a nice treat. Last time had the hot chocolate and the bread pudding-very tasty, sweet and moist, enough for two to share. I also had their chocolate pot de creme which was amazing. Their croque monsieur is good but a bit on the greasy side and one order is enough for two as the sandwhiches are so big. Last time I had the prosciutto one and it was a bit on the salty side but still very tasty. Usually there is a long wait and generally you have to stalk for a table, but go early and you won't have to!

My girlfriend and I stopped in one afternoon and the line was pretty short for this place. There weren't as many confections and pastries plus we were hungry and opted for sandwiches. The sandwiches list is really a selection of paninis. The sandwiches were BAD. Uneven-cut, super thick, BURNED break slices with a minimal amount of food stuffs in between. They were soaked in either oil, butter, or both. In fact, the fat was so heavy we both felt nauseous for the rest of the day. The sandwiches were the worst part. After that though, the service sucked. Two of the people behind the counter were snobbish. One sandwiches came out but the other was nowhere to be found. After a wait, I inquired and found they stuck mine in a to-go box and left it somewhere hidden away. They gave it to me cold without heating it up again. When I asked where creamer was (didn't see it), the response was very rude. On top of the sandwiches, we got a slice of the banana bread to start with. It was cold, which kind of sucked but that's just a matter of personal taste. It was nothing special. A lot of people seem to rave about the confections, but the service and sandwiches are really, really bad. That's enough for me to avoid this place.

I'm writing this review while in Tartine; wi-fi is spotty.  This is not one of Tartine's strong points; however, it's not meant to be.  This is a place to enjoy the food, drink, and converse with your family/friends.  It's NOT a coffeehouse where you spend a couple of bucks and stay for hours working.  It's one of the reasons I believe you never have to wait long for a table even though this place can get mobbed like others mention.  So for those who complain about long lines, long waits, etc, show some goddamn patience.  I've been about three time now (I come whenever I'm visiting my brother); it's always crowded, but the staff moves people along in a quick, cordial manner and people don't table hog for hours. That said, I've tried the morning bun, a banana tea bread, the ham and Gruyere croissant, and some other things.  Everything has been delicious.  I love the subtle hint of orange in the morning bun, and it doesn't make me feel disgusting and guilty for eating it.  The coffee is decent.  It's not their strong point, but, again, it's not meant to be.  It's quality, though. The best I've ever had?  I don't know about that; I'm not going to oversell it.  But Tartine is certainly worth visiting, and I'll continue to frequent it whenever I'm in SF.

Aside from one of the most convenient (yet high trafficked) locations in the Mission/Dolores area, Tartine Bakery is also one of the most enjoyable places to dine daytime. While the lines meandering outside the bakery appear intimidating, it's a fairly quick shuffle inside to order pastries and sandwiches. The FOOD: As Gaga would say-- "beautiful, dirty, rich." And 'dirty' as in sinfully delicious. For the notoriety of the Tartine name, the portions are very large, especially for the sandwiches. I devoured a blanc fromage and banana heat-pressed sandwich. Three massive chunks with a tart quince jam. Bread is made (duh) fresh in the bakery. Note: While most pork lovers will love the remainder of the savory menu, there is remarkably few non-pork meat selections. However, this does not disqualify the quality of the food! Oh, hell no. The croissant was carb-rich and delicious; chocolate just this side of dry, juxtaposed with the pastry dough. PRICING: You're paying for quality, my carbolicious friend. Whereas a giant choco chip cookie is around $2.50, a choco hazelnut tart runs closer to $5.50. Sandwiches are between $11-$13, unless you opt for the lighter portioned "open-faced" ones, running around $9. SERVICE: Ordering is quick, however I did end up waiting 20 minutes on a Saturday at 2pm for my banana sandwich. A server came outside to my table and personally told me that it was unusual to wait so long. She also offered to take an extra order for something to nibble on while I waited. That is damn fine customer service, especially how busy they are. You also bus your own table, for the most part. Servers bring you your food, but you get to clean if you want a table (which you have to be on the lookout for- otherwise there's a wooden countertop off to the side of the pastry ordering station). Props also to one of the most beautiful bread-making recipe books I've seen in a while.

Not that Tartine needs another review! We had the Pecorino & Almond and Prosciutto & Provolone Hot Pressed Sandwich (aka gourmet grilled cheese). YES they were delicious. The sandwiches are a lot more substantial that you would think (especially for $12-13). They make their own super hearty bread and use quality ingredients. Two people could easily share one sandwich and a pastry. We also had the chocolate hazelnut tart and slice of chocolate souffle cake. Once again, pretty price but a good size. The tart crust and chocolate cake was just ordinary. The heart poured out in the foam of the cappuccino was a nice touch. Love their effort to be more sustainable. The employees were not the friendliest. This could be the result of the high volume of people they deal with or just the attitude you acquire from being such a popular place. They have signs posted asking people to clear their own tables. All I wanted to know was where to place our dishes and our recyclables. It was like pulling teeth trying to get an answer from the three employees inches from me.

Finally! I've heard about Tartine Bakery since forever. And I have attempted 2 times to have the Tartine experience, but have always come short. Attempt #1: Rainy day. Coffee and pastries at 2pm? Let's go! Treck to the Mission from NOPA. Arrive at Tartine, line is OUT the door. Finally reach counter to find that there isn't much left. Decide to go to Bi-Rite for ice cream and had the Bi-Rite experience instead. Attempt #2: Rainy day again.. Friend with car says "Tartine?" I say yes, lets go! I think I don't have a car in the city because the parking gods hate me! Took FOREVER to finally find a spot - albeit, illegally, with hazard lights on and one of us stayed with car (sigh, me.) to make sure a ticket/tow free adventure. Already, what a pain. I just sat in the car listening to the radio for what seemed like eternity when my friend came back with a morning bun, a regular croissant, and a latte for him and regular coffee for me. Everything was good - especially that morning bun, but I think the circumstances strained my ability to fully appreciate the Tartine experience. Attempt #3: On the mark! Took an out of town friend to Tartine per her request. Line was short, weather was nice, and tables outside were open. Ordered a lemon bar (per Allison M.'s recommendation), the double pan au chocolate, morning bun, and the croque monsier with seasonal vegetables. Delicious, delicious, delicious. The open face sandwich was delicious with the perfect amount of ooey gooey cheese goodness, sun dried tomatos and great flavors. Excited to try one of those hot pressed sandwiches in the near future! The lemon bar was delicious, but after 3 bites, I was done. The best part is the crust which I think has pine nuts or something crushed into it. So, I'm happy with my Tartine experience and hope circumstances (and patience) will help you along the way too!

I went here this morning at 9:30 AM and the line was pretty huge already!  Anyways, despite living in the Bay Area for a long time, this was my first time visiting it and though the line was intimidating, I'd say it moved pretty quickly. Anyways, my friends and I ordered a bunch of things, but mine specifically were the Morning Bun, Rocher w/ Cocoa Nibs, Frangipane Croissant, and Banana Cream Tart (to save for later).  They were all really great, but the stand out things to me were the Morning Bun and Banana Cream Tart.  Morning Bun was soft, crunchy, and flaky--I thought it lived up to its promise.  The Banana Cream Tart was also really good, not too sweet and the pastry wasn't as  hard as some of the reviews I read claimed it to be. I can see why it might be hard to cut with a plastic utensil, but I think it shouldn't be a problem with metal utensils. I tried some of my friend's orders and their Bread Pudding is really good as well with the seasonal fruits on top.  Another one I really liked was the Gougere, but it might've been because I was loaded up on sugar and needed something savory to balance it out. Still, I thought it was pretty great and I'd love to get that again when I get the chance to venture out here. Service was alright, I didn't get any of the infamous 'tude that I've been reading about here, but maybe that's because I went in the morning and they're just getting started. Anyways, it lived up to my expectations and that's 4-stars for me.

In the Mission district of San Francisco lays one of the City's most delectable treasures: Tartine Bakery. The cakes, pastries, and tarts are a serious must-have for the ultimate chocolatier and sugar-addict. The bakery is foremost known for its breakfast pastries (morning buns & double pain au chocolat). These pastries alone have become so popular that they run out by noon. Make sure to get there extra early to experience a breakfast treat of the Gods! ... But if you're more like me and can't get yourself out of bed before noon, let alone to San Francisco that early, try the following items for a just-as-heavenly experience. Banana Cream Pie: Flaky crust, covered in dark chocolate with a hint of caramel. The custard has the right balance of cream and bananas. There really is nothing not to like about this dish. My favorite! Tres Leches Cake: Tartine puts its own spin on the classic mexican dish by adding sweet coconut milk, cajeta, and crema. Definitely worth trying and getting if they run out of the Banana Cream Pie. Devil's Food Cake: THE cake for my chocoholics. The Devil's food cake is made with dark chocolate and layered with caramel and chocolate ganache. I'm not crazy for chocolate cake, but this moist treat is full of chocolaty decadence with layers of love. Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian Rectangle: The lime flavored cake is topped with sweet cream and coconut. It's a nice fluffy cake and a great, tropical alternative to chocolate. A little insider tip: Try to at least get to Tartine by at least 2 PM, otherwise you will miss out on their best selections.

If the people who work here seem smug or uptight, it's probably a wall they've had to put up to deal with the jerks they're serving. Example A. I have no problem waiting in line, ordering quickly, or paying their prices. I don't even have a problem with busing others' dirty dishes in order to clear a table to sit at. I do, however, have a problem when a group of people immediately sit down at the table I just cleared, leaving no room for me. Their response to my obvious look of disgust? "There's a seat over there," pointing across the cafe. I tried to stay put out of principle but eventually got sick of bumping elbows with the mom of the group and just took my food to go. Example B. When the line snakes out the door it can get a little tight as customers try to exit or refill coffee, but a simple solution is to leave a gap in the line for others to easily pass through. This, apparently, is expecting too much awareness from Tartine's customers. I tried to leave room in front of me for as long as possible, but as soon as I stepped ahead in line the ladies behind me shuffled up so close they were practically leaning on me. I watched in disgust as people, each balancing full coffees and plates, had to uncomfortably squeeze through in order to exit (saying "excuse me" got no response from these women). I let a gap develop in the line in front of me to give people a way through and what did these "grown women" do? They stepped right around me and filled the gap in the line. Is it really so hard to take other people into consideration that those in line at Tartine can't help but cut in line and block the only exit? Example C. Hey lady with the double stroller - are you planning on picking up that bicycle you just knocked over? No? Ok then, I'll do it. Unbelievable. Considering that this is probably just the tip of the iceberg, I'd say the folks that work at Tartine keep a pretty stellar attitude. And they make a damn fine morning bun as well.

I love bread and Tartine is my match maker. Went today at 5pm (right when the bread comes out of the oven) trying the Country Loaf for the first time and it was amazing.  Crusty, chewy exterior & hot, robust, tender body the experience was whimsy. The bakers love/passion for good bread translates quite clearly. The entire loaf (its HUGE) was $7 but staff gladly sliced it in half and put it in separate bags for my friend and I. The place ALWAYS has a line but don't be dissuaded it moves quickly and trust me its well worth the wait! Bread is a must have but watch out soon enough you'll be coming back for the desserts as well! Cheers, Alex

Maybe it was a bad night, but I was underwhelmed. Had the lemon merigue cake and the one of the chocolate cakes and a cafe latte and it tasted like any other cafe.  Disappointing, but I will try it again sometime when I'm in the neighborhood.

There's not much I could add that hasn't already been said. I have trouble deciding on what to get at Tartine. I love love love their banana cream tarts and chocolate eclairs, as well as the Pecorino and almond pressed panini. The best thing to do is go with friends and get five different things to taste. For a great afternoon, head up a block to Dolores Parl to enjoy the tart in the sun. I have a friend who stops at Tartine to pick up their olive or walnut bread before getting to SFO and flying back to NYC.

I will surely be a regular here. Tried it the first time on Easter weekend and it was FABULOUS! We tried a few things to try to get the lay of the land - ham and cheese croissant (my husband loves these and this is the best he has ever had), a macaroon (spectacular), quiche (really loved the use of seasonal veg and it was just the right creaminess with crisp/flake of the crust) and a hazelnut tart which was the only thing I wasn't totally impressed with. Line was a bit daunting, but it does go pretty fast and you can keep yourself entertained people watching or reading the menu or looking at all the amazing stuff they have. Definately reccomend Tartine.

I went to Tartine in the afternoon, which was an unfortunate time because it was too late for the morning buns, but too early for the bread. We had: Quiche, Prosciutto and Provolone Sandwich, and the Frangipane Tart. The Sandwich was good, but a little too oily.  It was pretty large though, so be aware of that.  The Frangipane tart was good too, but it was hard to get all of the goodness in one bite, as it kept falling apart. Another reason for the loss of star: The atmosphere was a little bit snobbish.  My examples: no continual baking of morning buns (ok, so if it is  morning bun, those should be served in the mornings, but since they know people would buy it in the afternoons just to try it, the fact that they don't sort of gave me a "i'm-too-good-for-morning-buns-in-the-afternoon" attitude.  Also, the people behind the counter weren't that friendly.

This place has soooooooooo many pastries and desserts, huge variety. I've actually never heard of this place before, until my friend took me this weekend. I was awed by how much yummies they got, and by how long the lines are. I heard the lines are always really long though, which I'm not surprised about since the stuff is so delicious. So between the 3 of us, we got: +banana creme tart: DELICIOUS!! =P absolute heaven +chocolate hazelnut tart: pretty yummy +double chocolate cake: kinda dry, not what i expected, but still decent +cranberry bread pudding: pretty good +rocher: very delicious =D We devoured all of it...so good, definitely wanna come back to try the rest of the stuff. The only downfall I would say is it's pretty small so it's hard to find a spot to sit. They should build a second floor!

WEAK! I lived for a year in SF and was always told to go to Tartine for great pastries and desserts. I meant to go while I lived there, but just never got around to it. I was back in SF for a day last week with my wife so we made it a point to visit. We shared a croissant with almond filling and it was definitely one of the worst that I have had in my life. It tasted old, it crumbled in ways that it never should have and it was just not good. It was also WAY overpriced. I honestly didn't care about the prices at Tartine when we ordered because I was confident that it would be good, but I was proven very wrong. Never again will I go here. I just don't get why SF is considered such a great place for food. I understand NYC, but after a year of eating out in SF at some of the highest regarded restaurants, it's quality restaurant and food reputation eludes me. Also, the silly ass hipsters in SF who hang out at places like Tartine look like cloned clowns. I know that many of these people are nice people, but their pretentiousness and personal insecurities exude their every pore. SF has geeky hipsters and LA has plastic. They're both the same, but just in different packages. Just be yourselves and womens jeans on men and black tights with tan boots on women is not original when everyone else is doing it. I'm so glad that we moved and I'll be happy to not go back to SF for a while. Cool city, but not as great as people make it out to be.

The Tres Leches cake is to die for!! Its a little different than your traditional tres leches but Better! This place is always packed but its totally worth it. I loved everything I ever ordered at this bakery including banana cream pie, fruit tarts, brioche bread pudding, croque monsieur, and the chocolate eclairs ( which melt in your mouth. ) You should def. buy more than one. P.S. This is one of my fav bakeries for good reason. ;)

I've been to Tartine a few times and I can't think of a better bakery anywhere. Don't know where it is? Just look for the place with a line out the door and down the block. I got there at 9am when they opened and there was a line out the door. The morning buns are perfect; tasty with a bit of orange zest, and fun to unroll. They do run out by the end of the day, so get them in the morning. Enjoy your day and come back for some fresh baked bread at 5pm. I've had the sesame bread and it was an experience. So much sesame flavor! Perfect on its own, or as toast with your favorite topping. When it comes to the food though, I'm fairly certain that anything you get will be amazing. The bread pudding, oh my, out of this world. So delicious. The tarts and sandwiches are amazing. I hear the croissants are no joke either. Oh yeah, there's Four Barrel coffee if you like Four Barrel, and there's also a coffee bar serving delicious espresso drinks with organic Straus Family Creamery dairy. The only downsides are the lines and getting a seat / moving around inside the restaurant. (There's also some tables and chairs outside.) But hey, if the food is this good, it's got to be expected right? I mean, they were the only restaurant with TWO things on the 7x7 2010 list. Oh yeah, the owners were voted best pastry chefs in America in 2008. 'Nuff said.

The continual challenge I have with the bakery is this:  the brutal gap between a great product and poor service. Service is so disorganized, casual, and unapologetic.  As if waiting in line for at least 20 minutes isn't bad enough to get a bag of pastries, you wait another 5-10 for the coffee bar to serve your coffee that you can only order at the till -- but it's certainly not made to order.  "Our grinder only makes doubles.  You can choose the 8 or the 10 ounce.  Same shot in both." I would be a regular customer if Tartine could figure out how to serve customers at the speed of Grand Central Bakery (of Seattle and Portland).

I give this place 4 stars only because of the wait. Which is annoying, particularly when it's cold and/or rainy. And because it's pretty expensive (I paid over $50 for a cake that was not very large). HOWEVER. Yum. The smell alone is probably enough to entice you from the street to wait in the long line of crazy people to get in for some wonderful baked goods. Need a cake or desserts to bring somewhere? Come here. I honesty have only been once now and only bought a cake and had to run, but everything looked and smelled so wonderful I can't imagine I will fee differently about their other baked goods. I will be back and will update my review.

So obvi this place is legit.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the last time I went, they gave me a lemon tart instead of a lemon meringue slice and I didn't enjoy the lemon tart at all (the only thing thus far from Tartine that I've disliked). If you come here for brunch on Sat/Sun, you're going to wait so just get over it.  If you're driving here, I suggest coming with at least another person - one of you waits in line while the other finds parking - team work! My faves: - frangipane croissant - banana cream pie - the crust is so flaky, it's unbelievable - fresh coffee - good tasting plain coffee is hard to come by - shiitake mushroom croque moniseur - any of their quiches - morning bun!  i always get 2 so i can eat the other one the next day, such a treat! Good, but will prob not get again due to my faves list: - chocolate croissant - plain croissant - tres leches cake - frangipane tart - bread pudding - chocolate chip oatmeal cookie

Pros: Croque Monsier (with ham, as it was originally intended), morning buns, and any of the tarts (banana, almond, strawberry?) Cons:.... the lines are long and seating is very limited. So if you come with a group of friends, don't sit down saving seats while your other friends are waiting in line ordering because well..... the people who have actually received their food are hovering over you giving you dirty looks lol! Trust that by the time you receive your food, you'll have found seating and everyones a happy camper! Or... just don't come here with a group!

This place has earned the reputation of having the best bread in SF, so I was intrigued. It was close to 6pm Saturday night and still a line out the door. Price are a little steep here, but so good! I'm glad I don't pass by it everyday or I'd go broke and gain lots of weight. Is it really the BEST bread in SF? I can't really say. The bread is really good, esp since we got it right out the oven :) It's crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside...but a glutinous chewy, which sets it apart from most other breads I've had. Depending on personal preference, people either like it or not care for the texture. Lemon meringue cake looked too good to pass up. The slice was big enough to share, so I was grateful for that. Normally, I don't care for meringue, but this was really good! It was toasted perfectly that it tasted like creme brulee with moist lemon cake!! It was hard not to eat it all myself. The sandwiches looked really good too, I shall come back to try.

I love the fact that I can just walk to this place. Had a pretty heavy brunch here, big bowl of bread pudding and a bite of their smoked ham Croque Monsieur. Guess my stomach is not used to heavy duty calories and it was reminding of that the whole day. This is definitely a place to go to silence that rare craving, but not for a regular brunch. Be prepared to stand in a line for ~20 minutes.

Oh how lucky I am that Tartine is in my neighborhood! Everything is too good for words. Just look at the line that never stops to get a little idea of how stopping by Tartine will bring a taste of paradise to your day. I probably stop by for the brioche bread pudding with fresh fruit the most, some other regular items include the orange glazed morning buns, almond croissants, lemon poppyseed cake, and the hot pressed sandwiches. Oh yes, don't forget the fresh juice, rich hot chocolate, or gourmet teas. Don't be afraid of the line, although it's often out the door it moves very fast, within minutes you'll be at the front.

4/17/09 - I'm getting Fat. Strawberry Bavarian - Droooooooool Banana Creme Pie - yum! --------------------- Cons: For first time visitors - Not having any identifying name for the bakery from the street.   I drove around in circles looking for it until i finally parked and asked a passerby.   When I got there on foot... oh yes... that dark blue cafe on the corner with no signs anywhere to identify it;  ok , I get that you want to be cool and have people "recognize" the bakery or restaurant that has no name on it, but really, it certainly was not good for the environment as I wasted 20 minutes worth of gas driving around in circles trying to find it. Poor customer service - the cashier packing my tarts in the bag with the heaviest on top.  Which caused the bag later to fall over twice, smashing the coconut creme pie.  The cashiers always asking if i needed a paper bag when it is obvious I do not have a bag on me nor is it possible to carry 5-6 individual shaped items down the street without dropping it.  Unless they thought i was a juggler by profession or could float along in the air.   I was disappointed with some of the tarts - coconut creme: the caramel just made it too sweet & heavy and the coconut flakes' large size made its texture too chewy. The hazelnut tart was meh.  The  Lemon bar was too sour.  Not even the powdered sugar on top could help balance it.  I really do think this was an awful item. O Why O Why?  The desserts I had at their restaurant was delicious.   The pressed sandwiches:    the niman ranch pastrami was horrible.  Like biting into a giant mouthful of salt.  I'm not sure if it was a one time thing due to the particular pastrami they used or if it's the norm (2/27/08).  the sopressetta (also in the pros area) was a bit salty.  If they cut the salt level, it would be a really good pressed sandwich. The lonng lines but that can't be helped. Pros: The frangipane pastry Croissant Ham & Cheese Croissant (must be eaten warm/hot!) The pressed sandwich sopressetta was interesting though a bit salty.   Lemon tart - flavor was balanced beautifully with the dollop of whipped cream.  Each mouthful of lemon tart MUST be eaten with some of the cream, otherwise the tart will not taste very good.  This is an example where two separate flavors create one incredible one.   The chocolate pudding was truly delicious. The Lemon meringe...not bad!  reminded me of the lemon tart where the meringe cuts the tartness of the lemon tart.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE IS NO HAM & CHEESE? WTF, I dream about these Ham&Cheese kwasaants, and when I'm able, I try to load up. However, I haven't had one in about 2 months BECAUSE every time I go in, it seems there is some H&C emergency (last time: it was bad weather or something, they burnt the batch, whatever). I'm going through some serious withdrawl and there isn't a damn thing I can do about it. In general though, going to this place is like going through a Herculean ordeal. Yes, there is no parking (you're likely to get a ticket if you park ANYWHERE in the area at ANY TIME), yes you have to stand in a ridiculous line to get into the joint, and yes when you go through all that they may be fresh out of the thing you've been dreaming of. That said, I'll simply quote you the notes I made in my (snobby I know) Zagat guide about their bread pudding with fresh seasonal fruit: "It made me weep with fond memories of my childhood on the farm!"

This place blows my mind. I live a block away from it. If I could work from home everyday I know I'd be 50 lbs heavier because i'd be having breakfast, brunch, lunch and tea at this place. Everything i've ever purchased here has been excellent. I must think nikki for introducing me to Tartine no less than 8 months after I moved around the corner from it! So, buy anything. You'll like it. I love the spicy pickled carrots they serve with their sandwiches. They have the best latte's on the planet in my opinion, hmmm - lets make that the galaxy :) (yup im dorky!).

Going to Tartine always brings a smile to my face. Dessert lovers (like myself) will go crazy here. All pastries are good, but I definitely recommend the Banana Cream Tart (available everyday except Monday) and the bread pudding, especially when it's heated up. Both items are like heaven in your mouth. For those who need a meal before dessert, you can't go wrong with the croque monsieur topped with Niman ranch ham. One gripe, however: lack of seating. Tables are always taken whenever I go to Tartine so prepare yourselves to be aggressive in finding a seat here.

yum yum yum. There are too many things to try! Almond croissant: Deliciously moist, almondy, and flaky. Perfect. Banana cream tart: not actually as good as I thought it'd be. Not a fan of the weird hard-but-flaky crust. croque monsieur with turkey: took a bit long for them to heat it up, and the bread was slightly too crusty and oily tasting. I was also really full by this point, dessert came first. On my late night drive back to the southbay though, I devoured this baby. Dare I say it was more delicious cold than hot?

I will offer up that the place was packed full of people, so my opinion probably doesn't matter a whole lot. But... This place loses two stars for its hipster quotient, those people are horrible. It loses another star for the stupid serpentine line to place your order, cramped uncomfortable seating, and placement of drip coffee dispenser in an inaccessible corner - due to that snake of a line. They _DO_ produce quality baked goods, but hell, that describes lots of places.  I really can't be bothered to deal with the aesthetic of this place, so I probably won't be returning....

I had heard from so many ppl that I had to try this place. The first time I went I got a tart.. it was delicious. However the real experience lies in the bread. The sandwiches are amazing. Their panini skills deserve some type of gold medal in foods. My boyfriend and I were talking about it the rest of the day. But 13 bucks for a sandwich is rough. $$$$$ Also, I recommend on Sunday getting a group of friends together, chill at Dolores park and then at 5:00pm heading over the Tartine. There will be a line so be prepared. But getting a loaf of bread is worth it. AMAZING! It was gone within 12 hours... ENJOY! -JF

To all who enjoy a fancy sandwich and a delectable tart, why are you munching on that pre-packaged sandwich from the grocery store? You need to get a delicious sandwich from Tartine. As usual my friend Nikki and I ordered waaay too much food, but it was worth it. We shared a a spicy turkey open-faced sandwich and pastrami sandwich, while angry people waited for us to leave (not a lot of seating). The spicy turkey was very flavorful although I wish they had heated it up. The pastrami sandwich had a delicious spread and could have been shared among three people. Both sandwiches came with a pickled carrot that also had a nice kick to it. Unfortunately we ate too much and had no room for any pastries but I feel like I tasted them through my eyes. I'm definitely getting a lemon tart and a Mexican wedding cookie next time

Love it, all of it...everything they make there is absolutely delicious! I would especially recommend their bread pudding with different seasonal fruits, the almond poppy seed cake and the shortbread. The coffee is good too, Mr Espresso. The line is always long, but always worth it. What is amazing to me is the girls who work there are always so friendly even though they are slammed with a line out the door all day long!

They keep churning out massive amounts of tasty pastries.  Is it so wrong that I dream of their bread pudding and can't stop talking about their flaky croissants? Their sandwiches are so damn good. My favorite is the prosciutto and arugula with provolone cheese. It's a big sandwich, so bring friends.

They say the bread makes the sandwich, and so it is no surprise that their sandwiches are phenomenal! I'm not a fan of sweets, so it's kind of weird reviewing a bakery -- but on the sweet note though I can definitely appreciate the bread pudding. Namely, I'm in love with their savory items. - All the grilled sandwiches are a win - I like the open face sandwich just a bit weird to hold - Quiche is quite good too, just make sure you get it extra hot Ordering from there is a little confusing. They take your baked good requests first and then you can pay for it and order your drink at the register Seating is a free for all, so it's smart to have a few friends save seats while the others order.

OK, I fell for the yelp-hype for this bakery and stopped there for a few takeout pastries and a cappuccino. The pastries: the croissant derivatives were excellent. We tried the plain, ham&cheese and the famous gougère - all were buttery, fresh, crispy in the right places and made us feel like we were back in Paris. If we had just bought these, Tartine would've gotten 5 stars. It was the other two pastries we tried that caused me to rate this only 3 stars. The quiche was boring with a burnt puff pastry crust that should have been a pate brise. The filling had almost no spinach but rather egg and cream only. The scone was, well, let's just say that it serves me right for ordering a British pastry in a French bakery. It was tough and dare I say, not really fresh. Go for the French pastries, they are superb! Oh, and skip the cappuccino, it was terrible.

I prefer the croissants at Boulangerie Bay Bread on Fillmore and Pine.  They are made with 100% plus-gras butter and cost less than the not-so-good ones at Tartine.  The humongous mutants at Tartine are nothing like real French croissants.   I originally went to Tartine for a baguette, since my friend who lives near there told me "Of course they have baguettes.  They're a bakery!"  No, they did not have any baguettes.   They did have a lot of American sweets in American portion sizes.   So, I'm still looking for a Parisian-style baguette in San Francisco (NOT sourdough, NOT with a chewy leather-like crust)

So I live down the street, and always pass by this place. Its cute and there is always a monstrous line out the door so i keep walking. Today, however, Lovefest was upon us and so the line was fairly short so i perused the fine and tasty looking deserts, tarts, and other cute baked goods. The staff were overly sweet and the charm this place has cannot be put into words. I ordered a mozzarella and tapanade sandwich (which was delicious). You may be asking by now... What the f*ck... why did you give them a low score? REASON: After waiting about 25 minutes for my sandwich i noticed the waitress take a plate off of a table, this plate had been sitting there for about 7 minutes and had been touched by everyone on the table. The waitress then put down a to-go box and removed the sandwich from the table, and apologized to the patrons seated adding that an employee in the back had boxed the wrong sandwich... I thought nothing of this until 5 minutes later when the waitress returned to me with my sandwich in a to go box.... the SAME EXACT SANDWICH that had been sitting on that table. THE SAME EXACT SANDWICH I HAD WATCHED THREE PEOPLE PAW THROUGH. A SANDWICH THAT WAS ICE COLD. The waitress didn't even bother to try and reheat it before she gave it back to me. The cheese had congealed into and angry hard slab, the tapenade had started to leak through the bread, and half of the sandwich was a soggy mess - held together by the now rock hard cheese. To say the least... I did not expect something like that to happen at such a charming place.  Most people would have pitched a b*tch fit but I lived in India and that kinda stuff doesn't bother me that much anymore... I give this place a 3 mostly because accidents happen and it was busy that day.  I am def not yet a fan. perhaps I will go back... if the line is short enough and the whim hits me. Edit - I have gone back, hence the drop in stars... After the last time I was here I told my self that it was a fluke, and they were going to et a second chance. After waiting for 30 minutes for my sandwich, which was absurd since I was one of 5 customers at the restaurant. The aloof counter attendant handed me my boxed sandwich - this time I checked before I left... They got it right this time! Then I bit into it.... The bread - which is supposed to be fresh - tasted hard and stale. The center of the sandwich was ice cold and the filling was sort of just thinly spread about the inside. The last time I was here at least the sandwich was hearty. This time it was as if they took two old pieces of bread, put the minimum amount of cheese on it, put an olive in it and passed it by the oven while walking it to me. Never AGAIN.

I have a HUGE problem with cafes and restaurants were the service is slow, the staff rude, and the food terrible.  Tartine managed to hit all of those categories. My girlfriend asked me to take her here for coffee, and while I'm a sucker when it comes to taking her out for coffee, I have little patience for bad service. I dont' know what it is about some restaurants, but it's almost as if the wait staff act as if you should be grateful that you are able to be served by them.  Can I just say inappropriate? Also the sandwhiches are TERRIBLE.  A panini where the bread has been soaked in butter instead of lightly brushed with olive oil?  I couldn't finish the overpriced thing, and tried to pass off the rest of it to my girlfriend (she was having none of it).  The coffee was also burnt and tasted like it had been sitting around for quite sometime (still better than starbucks, although here a large is a mere 12ozs.  I didn't even mind when most of it was spilled by one of my girlfriend's many mishaps).   I don't see what the big fuss about this place is, but with the bad service and worse food, I won't be going there again

I do love me some Tartine. Yes oh yes. But: might I suggest to the owners a little clean up of the joint? I don't expect it to be hospital clean with the constant and never-ending stream of customers it sees, but the place just looks...tired. And worn. And the bathroom? Yikes. Come on Elisabeth and Chad! You need to spruce up the interior to match the high quality of the incredibly delicious food!

My friend told me about this place awhile back and the first time I went I was amazed at how many people were willing to stand in such a long line for some pastries! The store front doesn't do a whole lot of TARTINE promotion. I guess it's their way of keeping it a local secret spot! I've tried the morning bun, quiche and chocolate croissant and they were all very tasty! I don't drink coffee or like hot drinks too much so I felt like a 5 year old because I ordered a nice big cup of milk, just MILK. The open faced sandwiches looked delicious but were kinda pricey, so I always cheapen out and go for the crossaint.. Four stars for this place because of the long lines, crowded shop area and lack of seating. But if you're hungry for some hearty breakfast items or pastries and willing to wait! Give it a try!

There is good reason why this bakery is rated so highly by so many. We tried several different treats: their famous pain chocolate, chocolate éclairs, and a black currant and almond tart (I forget the exact name!). We also had three different pressed grill sandwiches: the tapenade and mozzarella, the pastrami, and the ham and cheese. The treats were great and the chocolate dark and real. The sandwiches had perfect bread, crisped and moist at the same time. How can a crust be so right? The beauty thing is, if you are getting the goodies for take-out, there is a small organic grocery down the street to fill out the meal with fresh fruit, drinks, etc. AND, the bakery uses all recycled packaging for each well packaged item. Yeah!

How is it that I never wrote a review? I love this place so much!  I hate driving  and parking in SF, but I'll be sure to make a huge detour and circle for 15 min to find parking, just to come to Tartine.  I always pick up a Banana Cream Tart and a Lemon Tart.   Be sure to stop by Bi-rite for their salted caramel ice cream after you buy your pastries. BANANA CREAM TART ($6.50) : Most amazing tart ever! It's a huge flaky pastry lined with chocolate and filled with fresh bananas, banana cream, and whipped cream, and topped with some beautiful chocolate shavings. I really love their cream filling. I also like how the inside is lined with chocolate because it prevents the pastry from getting soggy.  It's a little messy to eat, but who cares when it's so delicious. If there's only one thing you order from Tartine, make sure it's the Banana Cream tart. LEMON TART ($6.25) : As much as I like Bouchon Bakery's Lemon tart, I actually like Tartine's even more.  Perfect amount of tartness, with a delicious thin shortbread crust. They put a nice dollap of whipped cream on the top too. BREAD PUDDING ($3.50) : Pretty good bread pudding served in a cute little cup.  One of the better bread puddings I've ever had, but in general I'm not a huge fan of bread pudding. LEMON MERINGUE CAKE : Genoise cake soaked in lemon juice and filled with lemon cream. I like the torched meringue on the outside, but I didn't like the cake itself very much. I wouldn't recommend this.   CROQUE MONSIEUR ($9.75) : I've only had this once, so I don't know if I happened to have a poorly made one.  Even though it's good, I found it a bit dry, and have definitely had better Croque Monsieur's else where.

There is always a line at this place, especially in the beginning of the day when orders are piping hot and fresh beyond belief.  I have had a few pastries and baked goods in my life but this has to be some of the best I've ever had.  Definitely a close runner up to the likes of Paris bakeries.   I'd grab a couple treats and enjoy one outside in Dolores park if no seats are available.  then you can enjoy your second in the comforts of your home as an after dinner delight.

this place is smart. i just don't think i'm the right person for it. brunch on a weekend usually comes with a wait, however this place was just too long for me. it gave me flashbacks of the club from the night before. the line scaffolded the front, it ran out the door and wrapped around the inside perimeter of the place. all you need is a velvet rope. brave that patience challenge and you shall be rewarded. the display case of freshly baked tasty pastries and the smell of made to order sandwiches brews in the air along with the scent of mochas and espressos. i had the pastrami sandwich. buyer beware- it packs a punch. the horse raddish spread on it wakes you up! it cleared up my stuffy nose better than any tea could. i was surprised by the first bite. it was however pretty good, i just wish i had a heads up. it was served on bread so big it was cut into thirds. i thought i was served in three halves. so i saved one to go for Dolores Park. i don't really have much of a sweet tooth but their morning bun was also delicious. soft fluffy inside, flaky outside, with enough sugar to be sweet along with your morning coffee. -back to smart- i think this place is smart because 1) the line manages itself- no need to sign up, just get in line. 2) people grab a seat after they order. they somehow timed it to work accordingly. 3) the signs they give people while waiting for their order says "thank you for bussing your table" people clean up after themselves BRILLIANT! until next time cheers!

This place is so good, I make sure to stop here on my drive from Los Angeles to Oregon. This place is so good, my friend's parents had me bring them a goodie bag of Tartine pastries from San Fran to Oregon. What can I saw...the Morning Bun is ecstasy. I would eat three of them if I didn't live in LA and care about being skinny. The orange cinnamon sugar on top is sublime. Love the bustling cafe atmosphere and the do it yourself vibe. Only downside is the fact that no one wears makeup in San Francisco. Get your yourself some lip gloss San Fran!

Simply THE BEST bakery I've found in California.  It's chocolate croissant is comparable to (if not better than) those in Paris. Yes you'll have to wait in line for a bit, but it's all worth it.   Must try *** Bread Pudding!  Fresh fruit toppings varies daily, not super sweet and fluffy textured brioche. Recommend **Cake aux Olives (bread with white wine, black olives, smoked ham, gruyere, cheese and fresh herbs) Skip: Museli (watery milk yogurt with grains and fruits that taste a bit stale) I'll go back and try their Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian cake next time.  The lady next to me was rolling her eyes up on every single bite she took.  I almost thought she was going to moan. Parking Tip:  Don't waste your time trying to find a street parking, it's such a pain.  Go to 21st and Bartlett Street's garage, which is only a 5-10 minutes walk.

What can I say, this place has become a local institution in a short amount of time. Their baked goods are spectacular and their croque monsieur is the best on the planet.  But I rarely go there.  The lines are obnoxiously long.  It's a big turn off for me.  People wait in line before the place even opens up.  You'd think it was Michael Jackson inside kneading the dough : 0 So I now just go on the off day or off hour, otherwise I just don't go.

Yes it always seems too crowded and unsmiling and just not worth the effort, but we should all treat ourselves more often to their pressed paninis, open-faced cheesy asparagus toasty concoctions, banana cream tarts, and croissants. Even if you're out of cash, just scrabble around for loose change and you can get a scrumptious 40-cent meringue cookie. I can't judge their coffee because I'm always too distracted by what I'm eating but it seems above average. Added goodwill for having a cute-as-a-button name that's French without causing awkward pronunciation dilemmas.

I've never had such delicious pastries as the one that I've enjoyed from Tartine, the exception being the ones my girlfriend concocts.  Seriously, though.  The croissants are heavenly, and my personal favorite is the lemon tart shortbread bars. Every time I'm in the City, I push for us to make a stop.  I'd even consider making special trips for it, but 80 miles for a pastry seems a little absurd.  If it were any other bakery the discussion would be over, but Tartine never fails to evoke a serious debate about a special trip. I'm seriously considering buying the Tartine Bakery Cookbook just so I can enjoy the recipes (with a little help, of course) from home without having to make the trek from Santa Cruz.

The line always sucks, but there's a legitimate reason for its existence. If all you want is a latte or some other caffeinated (or alcoholic) beverage, you can just go straight to the coffee counter to avoid the wait. Easy. However, if you're craving the orangy, sugary goodness of a morning bun (and you should be yearning for it if you've ever had one); or if you want to roll around in a pile of luscious bread pudding (which is a little strange, but to each his own), you'll just have to wait in line. Or wait ON line, as some of my non-Californian friends like to say. It's worth it. If you can't decide, just close your eyes and point at the glass. The other end of your finger will be zoomed in on something amazing. Just don't press your face against the aforementioned glass and fog it up as you moan, "Yummm..." They won't like that very much. Not that I know from personal experience or anything.

I started talking on my cell phone and before I knew it it was 7:32AM! (They open at 7:30AM). I got off the phone and walked back to Tartine and there was already a huge line around the block so I had to wait a good 10 minutes...and I thought I was getting a head start...  Madness...

Tartine is the greatest bakery in the country, hands down.  Everything here is divine.  I brought friends here yesterday and I think one of them said "I want to rub this quiche all over my body" and the other one moaned all the way over the bay bridge while eating her morning bun.  I have sent other friends here and the lemon tart inspired them to pull over on the side of the highway and have sex immediately.   I know several people who live in San Francisco who don't go here on a regular basis, which I think is a total crime.  If you are one of those people, you must go see what you're missing.

Tartine, how I love thee food, which makes living so far away from Bouchon almost bearable.  But your lines are so . . . inefficient!  I can think of at least ten ways you could improve your queuing system. 1. hire fewer hippies 2. make an iphone/android app for ordering 3. make an iphone/android app for paying 4. hire fewer hippies! 5. clone that one guy who was really fast at checking us out 6. get rid of the hippies altogether? 7. stop making the frangipane tart, it isn't yummy 8. make more goddamn pumpkin pie!  I stopped by three times for a slice of pie only to be told no slices were left, so finally, I had to just buy an entire goddamn pie so I could have the one slice - forever.   9. don't make people wait 30 minutes so the pie can cool down enough to cut.  I really could care less what my slice of pie looks like.  It all ends up mushy and delicious in my tummy. 10. hire someone to take orders from people who know what they want halfway down the line when it is winding out the door.  The eye candy when we finally reach the front is too distracting. Calling ahead to reserve bread is cool, and has been 75% successful.  One time, you made my fiance wait for no one in a line that did not exist for about 30 minutes, while the hippie behind the register snickered.

Oh, Tartine - can't you be a little more inventive? Yes, your items are very good and yes we bring all of our town guests here. But I hope you try some new recipes soon because how many gougeres and orange cinnamon rolls can one woman eat in her lifetime? Also, the service - why is it so slow? Really. I'm not angry, I won't stop coming if you tell me that it's just a game the counter girls like to play on groggy Mission hipsters. But I need to know what is going on back there because I_am_hungry. Finally, why isn't the breakfast food before the desserts? When you stand in line the staff tries to take your order before you can see what is available.  I'm too sleepy to do anything but point and I can't point to my item.  Seems like a design flaw.

I do not go to Tartine if the line is longer than the front door threshold. I have established that limit.  If I pass by and there is no line at all, I consider it a sign from God that I must enter and partake in Tartine communion, so I do.

Have been there so many times yet to write about them because I am afraid if I write more good things about them, then the line will get longer! This is my favorite bakery in San Francisco. Every time I walk in, I just want to tell the person behind the counter, "please, just one each. Yes you heard me. One of each kind." With my iron will, I suppress the urge to say that but one day....one day....when INS decides to deport me... OK, even I like every single thing in Tartine, I do have one or two favorites. The passion fruit cake and the lemon cream tart are  must-haves if you like fruity kind of cake\dessert. I think they have the best passion fruit mousse, better than the one from citizen cake. The hot-pressed sandwiches are yummy also. Very crunchy with a lot of cheese. It's a 4.5 from me also. The only deduction is coming from the coffee. Really not so tasty coffee. I would rather get coffee from Ritual or Dynamo or Philz Coffee.

I came here with a friend/fellow yelper, Olivia Tanquilut at 7:37AM. The store didn't have a big sign and we're both pretty blind so we weren't sure if it was it at first. The line definitely gave it away for us. It was cold and the line went out the door, but BOY WAS  IT WORTH EVERY SECOND! The workers were fast and the line moved quickly. I decided to get the morning bun since everyone on yelp raved about it, and the chocolate chip cookie because it was cute and HUMUNGO! The morning bun was MMMM..MMMM..GOOOOOD! I started grabbing at it right after I paid for it since it was still warm. I will never forget that great blend of the crunchy outsides and the fluffy insides. The hint of orange and cinnamon-ey taste in the fluffy area AND the surprising bits and pieces of caramel on the crust was just perfect! I killed that tasty goodness in 5 minutes! The cookie was pretty good, but for $2.25...MEH. It wasn't your traditional chocolate chip cookie. It had an interesting crunchy texture, but the cookie dough and the taste of nuts was a bit overwhelming for my liking. My friend just HAD to get the double chocolate croissant (double pain au chocolat) because she saw it on the food network, but I thought it was mediocre at best. Yes, the fluffy texture was great just like the morning bun, but it just didn't have enough chocolate to be called a DOUBLE chocolate croissant!! Maybe I was expecting too much from a $4.25 croissant; I thought it was comparable to the Starbucks version. I still want to try the tarts, bread pudding, and sandwiches so in the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger...I'LL BE BACK!!

There are a crap ton of people in here, and the reason for that is the tastiness of their pastries and bread.  My friends and I waited in a long ass line, with no hopes of finding a seat, for about 45 minutes.  I garnered myself a morning bun, a frangipane tart, and a masala chai.  All was good, especially the morning bun.  It had tasty orange/cinnamon sprinkled all over it with love, and I could taste the love. I meant to order the bread pudding that I saw several people order across the restaurant, but after passing by the pastry case I had completely forgotten.  Maybe next time... I may come back if I'm in the area, but I don't know what to do about that line!  I'm not sure if it is worth it.  Perhaps it would be best if I didn't show up at 1 pm on a Saturday...

OK, a rave review seems almost redundant but: 1) The coffee. Is fucking great. On my list of top 5 cups of coffee in the (said list being under construction in my head). 2) The bread pudding! OH DEAR GOD THE BREAD PUDDING... The fruit, the cream, the egginess... 3) The morning buns-- so buttery, sugary, cinnamony... 4) The sandwiches-- they're greasy, rich, flavorful, dense, decadent... and they come with those cute little pickled carrots. 5) Honestly, just standing in line staring at the pastries, cakes, cookies, food... is the most pleasant form of agony I can imagine. I change my mind 12 times while I'm waiting. OK, the line sucks, although it tends be a cheerful crowd, so long as the weather is good. Ideally, on a sunny day, you just take your loot with you over to Dolores Park, picnic on your morning buns and almond cream-filled croissants and.... oh god I'm drooling...

Dear Tartine, Your bread pudding?  That legendary warm bowl of lovin'?  Me likey.  I really don't mind what you throw into it - strawberries, currants, blackberries, apples, gobs of chocolate, caramel, a pluot, all of the above - I don't mind.  I will consume it.  And how. You've got killer quiche too.  Fluffy and creamy, with that nice flaky crust.  That deep dish serving makes other quiches look sissy. And your banana creme pie is tops.  Oh, and the pudding ... the lemon custard and morning buns!!  OOOH!  Hazelnut tart!!  Me likey too :) And no worries about the lines, the claustrophobia, and that strange hanging people artwork you had this past Thursday while I was lunching with my buddies.  I can live with that.  Just keep serving the sweets, please and thank you.  Double exclamation point smiley face Love, That crazy person in the silver BMW who keeps circling the block several times for the first available parking spot while pointing eagerly in your direction like a fan geek ... Me.

A while back I sort-of dated a guy  - just sort-of dated, you know? You know how it is.  Anyway, we went to Tartine on our second sort-of date, and that second date was pretty much the best thing I took away from our sort-of relationship on sheer merit of the food. Pros: This is some of the best food I've ever eaten, inside a bakery or out.  There are usually vegetarian alternatives to whatever meat dishes are offered.  Potentially flakiest pastry crust in the world.  Try some of their grapefruit juice, too; it's freshly squeezed and it's delicious. Cons: EXPENSIVE. Also, Tartine is always crowded, even in the wee hours of the morning; it's very popular and probably doesn't even need this glowing review. So yeah, I love Tartine.  Not just sort-of love, you know; this is the real thing.  I'm ready to commit to Tartine for the long haul.  Just us against the world.

Still a 5 star in my book. I've since tried their PLAIN and ALMOND CROISSANT, MORNING BUN, and FRESH FRUIT ALMOND CAKE.  These were all great, I'd reorder them all.   I must mention that good almond croissants are hard to come by.  Some places just cannot make these without the artificial flavor and thick gross filling.  This is not the case at Tartine.  There were no artificial flavoring at all or the gross thick paste.  Beware, their croissants are a decent size and are highly addicting. NOTE: Line do form before the place even opens on the weekends...trust me, I know from personal experience.  Take that and image the traffic this place has during the weekends.

Oh Puhleeze. Tartine is better than your average Mission bakery but it's certainly not the best in the bay.  It's like they take a delicious European pastry recipe and add 25% more butter.....  Maybe that's the appeal? When someone says to me "let's meet at Tartine" I think about eating some paper-towels before I arrive. Then there is the line and the crowd, like the Dutch tulip bulb craze in the 1600's........

I love this place (remind me to thank my sister).  Yeah, it takes a long time to get in (at times) and even longer to get a table.  I don't get why the coffee is at a separate station, and then you have to schlep all the way to the other corner of the room to get sugar and cream, but it is what it is. The bread pudding is excellent and the chocolate croissants rock.  I'm sure everything else is good, but those two are my kryptonite. Bottom line - highly recommended. On a lazy, sunny Sunday morning, there's no other place I'd rather be in SF.

My friend has been dying to try this place for a while, and today was her chance! She got a lemon tart, which was really expensive at about $6, but when we all got to try a little bit, I'd say it was probably worth those six bucks. I love lemony things, but another friend who doesn't tend to like lemony things that much even liked it, so that says a lot about this lemon tart. The crust was perfect and I think there was probably a bit of orange rind in the lemon filling too. Mm...so good. While waiting in line for the bathroom, we saw a lot of huge loaves of bread that looked soooo good. Should try those sometime! I think I still like Masse's Pastries in Berkeley better, though.

You know a place is good when you see the line come out, wrap around the building, and you can smell the delicious bakery as you walk by...mmm!!!  We came here to grab a light breakfast.  Too bad sandwiches aren't served till noon.  I wanted to try them.   The wait wasn't too bad either, but it got really long by the time we finished our order.  Got the pain du jamon, muesli, and bread pudding.  It's kinda weird because the cups are small and then the bowls are huge portions.   I had to grab the big ham croissant to fulfill my meat fix, but of course, I could not finish it.  The fresh fruit in the bread pudding was yums.  At first I wasn't thrilled that the muesli looked like granola cereal in yogurt, but I was pleasantly surprised with the bland yogurt, oats, and fruit.  Service was great, they got us a bowl of bread pudding instead of a cup, but only charged us for a cup.  Sweet!

I waited patiently in line for about 10 to 15 minutes from the time I arrived to the time I paid for my mother's lemon meringue birthday 'cake'. It was a spectacular surprise, although I had to fork 30USD for something I could have paid half that price elsewhere... needless to say, the quality was divine. It is heavenly fluffy and incredibly sweet, just the way you want your meringue and it still had a bit of a bite towards the end of it. I say if you enjoy well prepared desserts and don't mind having to wait in line, come in to Tartine and have a seat. There's outside seating as well on the side to enjoy a sunny afternoon for those lounging around although be forewarned, it is ALWAYS crowded therefore if you come with a group be sure to hunt down chairs.

You'll probably have to wait 10-15minutes and add 10-15minutes to look for parking around Dolores but it's worth it. You'll need the 10 minutes anyways to narrow down your order after seeing the food displayed before you. I just wanted to order one of everything. Settled on a slice of tres leches, chocolate eclair, and cup of brioche bread pudding. All so tasty. We ate the bread pudding first while it was warm - amazing normally I'm not a soggy bread fan but this I'd eat again. Tres leches melted in my mouth and was even good the day after. Chocolate eclair chocolate was perfect. Pair it all with a latte, that you can get conveniently inside the bakery itself. Perfection I tell ya, just perfect.

This place is my favorite bakery in the city, no doubt. I go there almost every time I go to the city. Love their cakes, their croissant, their quiche, their bread, the list goes on... Their coffee is decent too. I will indulge myself with a cup of latte and a delightful pastry every time I go there, not to mention get a few items to go. There is ALWAYS a line there. If we're lucky, the line isn't long, but it's worth the wait. So far I haven't met a living person who's been to Tartine and doesn't like it. :)

Too bad Yelp does not have half stars because this definitely deserves a 3.5, but it's not solid enough to round up to 4 stars. The line wrapped around the building when we arrived after lunch.  I was excited to see what all the hype was about.  I had some of my friend's morning bun and I ordered the chocolate cake with ganache filling.   The morning bun was disappointing and appeared to be overbaked.  The chocolate cake was moist and flavorful, but I'm a chocolate cake snob and this definitely would not make it on my list of best chocolate cakes of all time.  Don't get me wrong...I'd definitely go back, but just don't think its the best dessert place ever.

If anyone wanted me to list my favorite bakeries and patisseries of all time, I would say hmmm...La Doree, Pierre Herme, Paris Baguette, Cake House, Bouchon, all Japanese bakeries in Japan, a bakery in Copenhagen with the best cinnamon rolls (can't remember the name) and Tartine in SF.  Seriously!  La Doree and Pierre Herme were uttered in the same sentence!  There is something wonderful and distinctly American about Tartine.  The quality and execution of their baked goods is superb.  There is great attention to detail, for example, the morning bun, which is their cinnamon roll, has a fresh orange or lemon zest taste throughout, which is a great complement to the cinnamon and nutmeg. The baked goods are quite large, which is the reasoning behind my "American" comment.   My other faves: the gougere, which is like an asiago popover and very light and fluffy, it is probably my most favorite baked good there, the regular croissant, the bread pudding, and the spicy turkey and pesto panini.  Make sure you have enough time to eat here because you will most likely have to wait in line, esp on a weekend, and then wait for a table, unless you are efficient and have friends hold the table while you wait in line.  Also, try the coffee!  It's intense and delicious.

Again, so very tasty. This time, I got an eclair and a lemon tart. My boyfriend preferred the tart, and I preferred the eclair, but both were so delicious. Biting into the eclair was like biting into heaven, a very delicious, vanilla cream filled heaven. The cream that filled that eclair will haunt my fantasies. The lemon tart was a very well-balanced dessert. The almost savory whipped cream mellowing out the tartness of the lemon filling, and the crust provided some texture in an otherwise texture-less dish. Coffee was terrible though. It tasted burnt. Next time I come here, I'm definitely skipping on the coffee. Some side notes: -Tartine is incredibly popular and so it'll get crowded. However, if you go at less peak times, the service is faster. I went today at around 3 PM (thereby avoiding the brunch crowd), and I got my desserts quickly. I was even able to find a table inside to sit at! -The desserts are expensive, but worth it if you're willing to splurge. If possible, try to find someone to go with so that you can split desserts and not spend so much (although I found it was very hard to share the eclair, haha!).

Some people spend their entire lives searching for love. Some people try to find the perfect words to express it in books, song, poetry, etc. What many don't realize is that all you have to do is bite into one of those croissants at the corner of Guerrero and 18th to find it. In some ways, I hate my friend Jeanne Y. for introducing me to this place several years back. It's a total diet killer, but I guess I would have found it eventually. It's like a siren, except the dangers you are lured to are carbs (is there really anything worse?). So where to start? The croissants are amazing. I love them to death. The bread, especially when fresh out of the oven, is perfect. The bread pudding is delicious. I could go on, really, but pretty much every thing I've ever tried at Tartine is absolutely perfect.   I will say, though, that the one thing I actually did not care for was the morning bun. It was a little too sweet for me. Tartine Bakery, I would probably leave my boyfriend for you if you were a stunning French man.

How early do I have to go to get a morning bun!!! If they run out all the time, why don't they crank more out? Sadly I resorted to a plain croissant and a chocolate croissant. I think the reason why I wasn't a fan to either was because I heated them up a little in the microwave, about 20 seconds, and it made it all chewy inside of flaky. Note to self, heat up in oven next time. I felt that the croissants were too thick, and what I mean are the layers inside. But maybe that's cause of the microwave. Will try again next time, and hopefully will get the morning bun.

When I'm lucky enough to snag an outside table and chair & the weather's fine, it's kind of fun to sit outside with my French-British fusion afternoon snack (pain au chocolat & an Earl Grey) and observe the pastry frenzy going on inside this place.   P.S.  It is humanly possible to look anywhere near elegant while eating their flaky, chocolate-oozing concoctions?  So far I'm saying no, which is totally ok.

Thoughts as I break of a piece of my chocolate croissant that a co-worker brought in for being asked to come to work at 8:30am--after never having tried anything from this bakery: "The paper bag it came in is clear...... ummm.... thats a warning sign, I wonder how many calories..........." *Takes a bite* "OHH DAMN, WHO CARES...." EDIT: I didn't finish it, it was just TOO RICH... There was about a quarter left of it when it started staring back, teasing me if I was insane enough to finish the whole thing. Now it is 4pm and I am hungry, wishing I could taste that chocolate croissant once again.... =/

Is Tartine the universal code name for baked goodness? My brother somehow convinced me to navigate through the one way craziness of downtown to visit the bakery in the morning and I have to admit I'm now officially hooked to their lemon meringue cake. They are perfectly tangy, lemony, and plain heavenly. The soft sponge layers perfectly compliments the zesty lemon layers with just a hint of caramel. It's simply pure heaven. The other stuffs that we tried are also top notch. Honorable mentions goes to their warm, flaky croissants and their quiche. A must try for anyone in the area.

I love baked goods. Buttery, rich, flaky, and savory are words that elicit pavlovian-responses in me, and Tartine has obliged in spades. I suppose, unlike many people in the city, my first visit to Tartine was not influenced by glowing reviews. In fact, it was suggested rather spontaneously by a coworker who mispronounced the name as "Tartan's."  That said, I had no expectations, just the hope that the tiny bakery around the corner would be a place I could frequent. I now travel from Nob Hill to the Mission just to indulge in some Tartine-goodness from time to time. It's not a place I would ever want to abuse by visiting too often; but make no mistake, the urge is there. What I don't find compelling is the line I often have to bear just to get my eager paws on a ham and gruyere croissant, a morning bun, or some fanciful little cookies. Yea, the staff appears a bit stand-offish, but they've always been warm when it's my turn to order, and they're not to be blamed for wanting to keep things breezy and efficient when the line stretches up the street. And all that matters to me is how my world dissolves into bliss when I get a fresh croissant. Hundred-dollar phone bill... huh? Unpaid credit card bills... hm? Rent due next week... wha? Hammmmm.... cheeeeeese.... all melty and warm, just like a lover's arms. I once encountered a woman in line who was visiting on business from France. She was attending anger management classes because American standards of etiquette are more delicate than those of France. She then demanded that I hold her spot in line, hushed a fellow patron's dog, and sat at a table made for four all by herself. I never did learn what she thought of Tartine after her meal, but she left her plate clean, and I was to afraid to talk to her about anything. Tartine may not blow your mind, but it is a solid experience if you're looking for a pastry or dessert that is above average. Nasty and fabulous French woman aside, I often return, and have not been disappointed.

I was looking for a special place to get some goodies for my VERY pregnant girlfriend and picked Tartine's.   This review has been sitting in my "unfinished reviews" for over a month as I did not dare to post it...Dare I say overrated???  I have been fighting my inner demons on this one...maybe it was just the traumatic experience itself that left me feeling like it was overrated??? I admit the Mexican Tea cookie was DAMN GOOD- the best I've ever had probably...but everything else was MEH?  (I am surely NOT a fan of the Rochers.)  Maybe my taste buds were having an off day?  I mean...I did have to circle around for what felt like hours, looking for parking, in the BLAZING sun! I can't imagine enjoying a nice weekend brunch here...the place is packed with people breathing down your neck, and eyeballing you for your table...I know the girls behind the counter are busy, but for my first time there, I was bound to have questions about the goodies but their priority was just to move the line along.

If I closed my eyes and you put one of their CROISSANTS (http://www.yelp.com/user…) in one of my palms and a brick in the other, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Those things are heavy! They probably weigh (no joke) a pound each. Heftiness aside, they are pretty tasty. Very nicely browned and flaky crust (my favourite part - I've actually eaten just the crust of a croissant before), but a little too dense for me. I came here at 5:30pm one Monday afternoon and they were sold out of morning buns (makes sense since it was WAY past morning) and banana cream tarts. Sadness :( I would come in the morning, except that a little thing called "my job" gets in the way (need those regular paychecks to feed my pastries habit!) I also got their bread pudding with apples and rocher with cocoa nibs. The BREAD PUDDING (http://www.yelp.com/user…) was OK. It was sweet and moist, but kinda mushy and didn't have much texture. I prefer the dessert bread puddings I get at restaurants (especially with chocolate!) The ROCHER (http://www.yelp.com/user…) was actually really good. It looks like a lump of dried, cracked, white poop but tastes heavenly (it's basically a meringue). The bitterness of the cocoa nibs balance really nicely with the sweetness of the meringue. I'm pretty sure I instantaneously gained a few pounds after that croissant though...

I'm very wary of heavily rated eateries and am aware that hype does not necessarily guarantee a good experience. That being said, I was surprised, VERY surprised that I find myself wanting to go back again and again to eat all their delicious baked and bread-y goodness. Don't be daunted by the huge line out the door. It won't take more than 15-20 minutes and it gives you plenty of time to soak it all in and think about your order. For me at least, I need A LOT of time to think about my order so the extra wait is perfect. Once you get inside, you are greeted with beautifully made cakes and tarts, frangipanes, enticing pastries, scones and breads. Everything is made by highly skilled bakers hands who must really do some amazing baking magic in the back kitchen. Albeit PRICEY (expect to pay about $4 -7 per order), everything is beautiful, delicious and something worth savoring and experiencing. Here is a run-down of the shamelessly long list of things I've tried: Morning Bun -- a brioche-like sweet bun with a hint of orange and cinnamon. Almond Croissant -- amazing!!! This croissant is just so... so damn good. You bite into it and the layers just shatter because they're so delicate and flaky. The almond filling is velvety and chunky, not gooey and pasty like many almond croissants can be. Be careful though, once you have Tartine's Almond Croissant, it's hard to go back to anything else. Quiche -- you can taste the creamy egginess, which is a good measure of a high-quality quiche. Comes in vegetable or with ham. Croque Monsieur and their other sandwiches -- Made fresh with seasonal and local ingredients like cow-girl creamery cheese. They're all savory and delicious. Comes on their HIGHLY COVETED Tartine Bread Tartine Bread -- this is QUITE a loaf of bread. You have to call in and pre-order and pick it up at 4:30PM. There is no room for error for this order. Quite fussy right? But it's so worth it. The intense yeasty aroma, beautiful crust and unfathomable spongy, porous texture still haunts me today. Once you have this bread you can die happy. Frangipane tart -- almondy, fruity tarty goodness. I bought the mini sized one which is perfect to share with a couple people (or for yourself!). As you can see, I love this place. If I had the budget, the metabolism and just an ounce more of fanaticism, I'd probably eat here everyday.

I know Tartine, you have 3045 reviews...but this was a great intro to misty micro-climate SF and you served up some delectable coffee and pastries...so I'll be review #3046. Croque Monsieur...bonjour...ca va? Ca va bien! Chocolate croissant...yes please... It looked like it was going to be a standing room only situation but the ebb and flow of this place worked.

I was running late to meet up with my friends for an all-out foodie adventure. They had gotten to Tartine already and so I had my friend pick up a morning bun for me. The morning bun was so delicious. Flaky, sugary goodness. Even hours later when I brought it to my boyfriend to try, it was just as well. It has a hint of orange or ginger or something that makes it delicious! I also go to try the banana cream tart which is really hard to eat because the tart itself is a bit hard, but man, the cream is delicious. The bananas were good. The bottom of the tart has this chocolate caramel mix and that's good as well. I'll definitely have to come here sometime with the bf and try even more desserts.

Love this place.  I use to stop by the bakery once a month, on my way to get my dog washed.  Bernie's Grooming has since moved and now I have no REAL excuse to stop by here.  No matter what time you go, there is always a line and people just hanging out-don't these people work???  hehehe   Everything here is soooooooooo tasty and delicious!  No matter, I ALWAYS get one of their crunchy Scharffen Berger chocolate chunk cookies-they are HUGE!  The hot pressed sandwiches are scrumptious!  The pickled french carrots that accompany the sandwiches are perfect.  My sister is a big fan of the Olive cake-savory moist bread with white wine, black olives, smoked ham, gruyre cheese, and fresh herbs.  I've even veered from my normal bakery where I get my birthday cake (almost every year!) and have gotten one here-Devil's Food Cake, Valrhona dark-chocolate butter cake, layered with caramel and chocolate ganache.   Everything here from savory to sweet is AMAZING!!!  I could go on and on with what I've tried and eaten-best bet is to go yourself and GORGE!!!

Excellent! Everything is super fresh, tasty, worth the usual weekend long lines. It is not a place to hang out, being as busy at it usually is, but it is the best place to grab some tasty, fresh, well priced food. If you haven't visited, you need to bring your appetite and be prepared to eat!

I really want to love this place.  Maybe once upon a time it was great.  I still go there about once a week...just because it's on my way to work and I live close enough I can stop in when there's not really a line. Here's what's good: 1. bread pudding 2. cream 3. morning buns (when not burnt) 4. banana cream tart (not sure if it's the cream on top of it) Here's what can be improved (speaking generally for all pastries): 1. light, fluffy, flakiness 2. moistness 3. speaking specifically for croissants and morning buns, please don't burn them! I'm guess I'm thankful I don't love Tartine.  If I did, I might be 300 lbs.

Love, Love, LOVE the name!! Hate, hate, hate the wait! This is a lovely place with great eats and great potential, however I'm just not into the over-crowded "place to be" type of establishments. Especially when there's no where to sit. It reminds me too much of Cafe Fanny. Hey, I love good food but comfort is part of the experience. I wasn't comfortable at Tartine. I'd love to give it another try. And I might just do that.

I have two things competing for the opportunity to kill me first: cancer and cholesterol. Tartine Bakery is giving cholesterol an unfair competitive advantage. Fresh out of the oven ham and cheese croissants are the Angelina Jolie of foodstuff.  Their pillowy full lips and come-hither looks just scream "sex" so loudly I ignore the fact that they also scream "heart attack". The pastrami sandwich isn't doing my arteries any favors, but the crispy and chewy cheese encrusted bread on the outside and strong horseradish on the inside come together to make one of the most sophisticated and tasty pastrami sandwiches I've ever had. Then there's the Tartine bread.  It's only available after 5pm and quickly sells out.  It's worth whatever it takes to get a loaf.  You will be handed a simple brown bag and feel the warmth of the freshly baked bread inside.  You will feel the delicate perfection that is the thin crispy crust and fluffy chewy interior.  This is quite possibly the best bread in the world.  I whisk it home with excitement, counting the minutes until I can slather it with exotic high cholesterol French cheeses.     Tartine may prove to be the cause of my untimely demise, but they will put me to rest with a smile on my face.

Came here for a late lunch on a Saturday with some friends...  since we were starving we decided to try their Pressed Sandwiches as well as their desserts.   To start, because we were famished...   Frangipane Tart: Light almond-cream filling baked in a flaky pastry shell with seasonal fruit.   -- I gotta say, it didn't look THAT appealing especially since I was expecting fresh fruits, but the fruit was baked and it just looked dry.  Oh, how appearances deceive!!!!  The tart was flaky, but still moist and delicious!!  You can definitely taste the almond, but it wasn't overpowering and best of all, not too sweet.   The pressed sandwiches were all made with freshly baked bread, which was a definite plus in my book! Spicy Turkey Pressed Sandwich: Peppered turkey breast, provolone, broccoli rabe pesto. -- Spicy?  I must have missed it, but it doesn't take away from this delicious sandwich.  The broccoli rabe pesto with the turkey was just heavenly.  Only thing I would change about this sandwich is probably using a different cheese.  I felt the provolone got lost in the flavors and instead just made the sandwich a little muddle towards the end. Pastrami Pressed Sandwich: Niman Ranch pastrami, horseradish, gruyere -- Good sandwich, could definitely use a bit more pastrami.  The horseradish and gruyere were a good choice, but the pastrami itself, I've had better... so overall I wasn't too impressed with this sandwich.   Prosciutto & Provolone: San Daniele Prosciutto with dressed arugula. -- Probably the most unimpressive sandwich of the 3 we chose, then again it is just prosciutto & provolone. Overall, delicious place!  If parking wasn't such a pain, it wasn't hot as heck inside and crowded, I would definitely come back every time I visited SF.

Tartine is located on the corner and has no shop sign, which i found really odd. There's an ample amount of seating outside and inside. The line can sometimes stretch outside the door. Although the line stretched way beyond the door seemed intimidating, it went by pretty fast. There were tons of options. I limited myself to a few items. Since I wanted a taste of a variety of things. I ended up ordering  a croque monsieur, a morning bun, a chocolate croissant, a fruit tart, a frangipane tart and a cup of bread pudding. Everything was delicious! If you're not looking to overstuff yourself like I did, I'd recommend starting off with the morning bun or the chocolate croissant. YUM!

When I go to San Francisco, I have to go here at least once to get a chocolate croissant.  Tartine has my favorite chocolate croissant of all time, so far.   There's always a line, but the line moves quickly.  There aren't always chocolate croissants though because they often sell out, so I've been "forced" to try other things:  the morning bun (sugary goodness), the bread pudding (with different fruit depending on the season), the chocolate pudding (yum), the almond croissant (delicious), the plain croissant (also delicious), and the chocolate chip cookie (a little disappointing).  Surprisingly, I'm not a fan of their chocolate chip cookies; the chocolate chip cookies are tasty, but they're large, flat, and crispy, which isn't my preferred chocolate chip cookie style, and their chocolate chip cookies aren't so tasty that they're able to override my preferred chocolate chip cookie style.   I've also had some of the savory sandwiches, which are good, just not out-of-this-world good like the chocolate croissant.

The bread pudding is so delicious that after I moved away I would have dreams about it YEARS later. That and the sandwich with quince jam. Nothing in LA came close. Well, maybe Surfas. Can't say I've ever had a bad experience, save the long line every time. Still, totally worth it.

This place came very highly recommended, so it was not surprising that it was packed and it was hard to get a table. We each picked a different grilled sandwich, and we all very happy with them.

We got seating right away, too! although the line started snaking out to the sidewalk once we were seated. We had: Devil's Food Cake - seems super chocolaty sweet, but turned out to be perfect. Lemon Cream Tart - It's great, hands down Chocolate pudding - fine. Oh, and I love the latte on the bowl.... Great place and items for your Sunday afternoon in the Mission.

Did I miss something?  I don't see what all the fuss is about.   It wasn't the lines -- I went in the afternoon when there wasn't much of a crowd.  The table was a bit crowded, but that was okay, and I didn't mind busing my own table.  Maybe they make different products on other days, but nothing in the glass case jumped out at me, which was pretty disappointing.  I was so underwhelmed that when we got to the front of the line I had no idea what to order -- nothing looked especially appealing to me.  I wound up having a croque monsieur, a bite of my boyfriend's frangipane, and some coconut macaroons to-go.  The sandwich was okay, but I prefer the open-faced sandwiches at Boulange.  The frangipane was halfway decent, but nothing memorable, and I've definitely had better macaroons.   I would definitely recommend Boulange over Tartine.  They have better open-faced sandwiches, better pastries, and far better atmosphere.

I'd give this place 3.49. While the name suggests it's French, but many of their items are decidedly very American (moist croissants, cream pies, etc). I was caught off guard for that. Nothing wrong with American bakery staples, in fact their pies are pretty darn scrumptious. I was disappointed with croissants. So I'd go here for more "American" stuffs. Not my favorite bakery, but I'd give this place another try, if I can find a parking!

I have a love/hate relationship with this bakery.  I love their baked goods, especially the ham and cheese croissant.  The outside is buttery flaky and the inside is silky smooth.  Absolutely delicious!  I hate that I have to either starve myself for the rest of the day or do 2 hours of cardio just to work off the calories -___-"  If you like hot chocolate, I highly recommend trying theirs.  Perfect for chilly days.   The line doesn't bother me especially since I try to go during odd hours and avoid the weekends.

This place is good, but I just don't really get all the hype or the massive line out the door.  Seems like they're pretty famous for their bread pudding so I tried that thinking I can't go wrong since so many people were ordering it....DISGUSTING with a capital D.  I had to throw it out.  Yuck!  Way too soggy and sweet.  Maybe I'm not a bread pudding person. But I also tried their oatmeal something cookie, the macaroons, the lemon bar, and the pumpkin bread.  All good (Lemon bar was the best I've ever had actually), but nothing that marked it amazing or better than other bakeries I've been to.  And prices are outrageous!  $4 for a lemon bar?  $5 for a slice, a SLICE of pumpkin bread?  I've gotten a whole loaf of pumpkin bread for that much and it actually tasted better elsewhere.   So I recommend going here if you're in the neighborhood, but it's not a place that I would recommend going out of your way for.

This place isn't about out-of-this-world baked goods, but it is everything a bakery should be.  Most bakeries tend to cut corners, and give you mass-produced crap.  This place gives you something your good friend, who loves to bake, and does it well, would give you.   We walked in at 5 pm, and ordered the cranberry bread pudding.  The line was long, and we definitely had to wait for a seat, but the pudding, and hot chocolate were worth it.  The ingredients are fresh and high quality.  After walking past many bakeries in the city, I saw that this place had pastries and sweets made with love.  Definitely make the trip if you need to satisfy that sweet tooth.

Just can't imagine a more perfect desert place. 4 barrel coffee and fresh pastry. This place has the line that you would respect in a highly popular mission spot but they are very organized and the line moves at a decent pace. What I appreciate the most in a place (other than a good product) is employees who take pride in what they are selling. I had my eye on the Bread Pudding and a Lemon Tart. I asked the guy behind the counter to help break the tie and he told me that the Bread Pudding had been sitting around for a while so it is not a good example of it at it't best. He recommended the Tart, which was a bad-ass tart with a crispy buttery crust, creme, and a lavender flower. I enjoyed my tart outside on a beautiful day, with a perfectly made cappuccino. Yep, I know, life is rough.

Okay, so I finally tried the bread. I had no idea what I was getting when I ordered the bread, so when I got the giant roundish hard shelled loaves of bread I was a little surprised. I actually went into Tartine on two different days, Wednesday (to order in advance) and Thursday (to pick up), surprisingly, no wait at all. It might have been the bad weather, or just good timing. Even if there is a line, if you order in advance for pick up, you can bypass the line and just pick up your prepaid bread. When I picked up the bread (only available after 5pm) it was still warm. At 7.25 a loaf, a little expensive but a nice treat every so often. I tried the walnut bread, and I really liked it. My mom on the other hand, didn't like it so much, too hard for her. The crust of the loaf was hard and chewing the end piece made my jaw tired. But I have no problem with that, I once ate so many baguettes that it made my jaw sore.

Tartine really knows how to do charm. With the random bread art on the walls, the standing dining bar facing outwards, the cute little waitresses and the families and pets that frequent this place, I can't imagine anywhere I'd rather have breakfast on a Sunday morning. Croissant - very, very flaky and delicious. Slightly dry for my taste but still really good. Morning bun - holy crap this was delicious. Very rich and not too cinnamon-y. Bread pudding - my favorite thing we ordered. Warm, gooey, with fresh cranberries and pears! Croque monsieur - this thing is HUGE. They come in four varieties, but not all of them are always available. You will fall into a deep food coma for hours after consuming this. Maybe days. If you decide to eat at the bar by the window, be prepared for a lot of pointing, ooohing and aaahing, and exchanging awkward smiles and thumbs ups with random strangers. It's actually kind of awesome.

Heavenly. Thats really the only word to describe their country bread right out of the oven.  Crisp, sweet crust with caramelized flavors. Delicous hearty, almost gooey center. The aroma is intoxicating. Other tasty things: -tea breads: Rich, sweet chocolate. Citrus, sweet almond lemon poppy seed.  And banana bread, just the right amount of nuts and good banana. -hazelnut torte: The chocolate is rich and creamy. Crust is buttery and falls apart. Wonderful. -Shortbread: Its so crumbly, sweet, and buttery. Basically, the best bakery I've ever been to. Its that good.

A Sunday morning breakfast in the city is always a special thing, especially when it entails a slice of vegan carrot cake breakfast bread from Tartine. Very delicious baked sweets that range from giant chocolate chip cookies, to croissants, to walnut fudge brownies. The staff was a little pushy and they opened 15 minutes late, despite having a line of people 30 feet long. It can get cramped inside so take your delectable sugary sweets to the nearby Dolores Park for a picnic. Tasty place worth checking out.

Tartine, I really really wanted to like you. I did. But... you are way wayyy overhyped. Came here with the boy, while we were in the area, because we'd walked past it a few times in the past, and the aromas are mmm mmm delicious. It was a gorgeouss day in San Francisco, so we weren't too surprised that the line was long - way out the door. Parking sucks around here, so we just parked in one of the 10min spots in front of the bakery, while we stood in line. But.. .the line did NOT take 10 minutes to go through. Luckily, we didn't get ticketed, but honestly, I don't know why the line took so long. With the amount of people working behind the counter, I feel like they need to figure out a better system. I ordered a quiche and lemon tart, while the boy ordered bread pudding. They had a mix-up, because they didn't know that we ordered separately, which was alright, I suppose. My total for two items was $11 [I forgot how much his was]. We waited for them to heat up the quiche, which was nice of them. [Oh, and the packaging is pretty cute too] However, because there was no space, we just stood near the cash register. The boy leaned against one of the pillars, and jumped. We looked up, and saw that the pillar had definitely moved at least a foot [you could see where the top of the pillar was supposed to be, and where it moved to]. He hit it again lightly, and it went back into place. Um. We got out of there as fast as we could. I don't know how old the building is, but it definitely needs to be examined. We ate everything when we got home [well, I ate the quiche in the car, because I couldn't resist.]. The lemon tart was delicious, the quiche was good, and the bread pudding was... average. So.. in short: Ambiance? Alright. Hipsters galore. Building itself? Scary. Food? Not bad. Worth the money? Probably not.

So much more than caffeine at Tartine! Step out of the Mission and into Pa-ree! I have heard about Tartine for years but never made it in until now.  We dropped in after a heavy morning of vintage-store shopping on Valencia street.   I immediately spied someone eating an open-faced sandwich and announced "THAT's what I'M having..."until I looked at the menu.  And then began the delicious torture of choosing.  There were basically three "savory" options:  Croque Monsieur (open face sandwich with bechamel (white sauce) ham, cheese and asparagus; pressed sandwiches; and quiche.  All looked amazing. We were told that we could have the Croque "right away" but we'd have to wait 15-20 for the pressed sandwiches.  We decided to wait because we didn't have a table anyway and they looked so yummy. We finally got a table (I am giving 4 stars only because of the great difficulty we had to get a table) and our food arrived shortly thereafter.  I do love me a good exaggeration but I do believe it was the BEST pressed sandwich I ever ate. All three sandwiches were served on Tartine's own thick crusted bread and I think there was some cheese baked right into the bread.  My sandwich had chopped almonds, cheese, sage, lemon and olive oil and it was sublime.  My daughter had a three cheese sampler and I think hers was actually the best.  The husband had ham and cheese and it was wonderful too. The portions are huge huge huge.  We could easily have done with two sandwiches for the three of us and trust me, we are NOT light eaters.  But we happily got "to go" boxes." We also tried a coconut and passionfruit cake that looked more amazing than it tasted.  But I'm sure there are tons of good desserts.  The coffee was great and there is plenty of water too.  Definitely on my "gotta get back there soon" list.

I usually come here for a Pain au Jambon on the weekend. Sunday morning I showed up and I just couldn't stand the idea of standing in that line. It's actually never as bad as it looks, but it just bugs me... c'mon people, it's obscenely early on a Sunday morning... GO BACK TO BED! So instead I stopped by this morning -- Monday -- on my way to work. Lo and behold, I got movie star parking right out front and walked right up to the counter to order. I *almost* ordered a Gougere, but at the last minute decided that I needed my jambon fix. Oh, so good.

I love every last bit of Tartine.  The long line gives me plenty of time to contemplate the outdoor temperature; anticipate the mounds of pastries I can almost sort of see through the crowds of people; finally stare adoringly at said pastries; think through all of the possible items I might actually buy; order one of the very few selections I inevitably end up choosing between; and stare adoringly at pastries a little longer.   I've sat a few times, but mostly I stand at the bar facing the window while I slowly devour (if devouring is something that one can do slowly) whatever I've purchased.  The crowds, random conversations, street noise, the wait and the hassle of it all only make Tartine better.  Pastries like that (and by "that" I mean both that tasty and that chock full of butter) should be hard-won.

The wait: I got in line at 11:45am. I didn't leave the bakery with all my goodies until 12:45pm.  We didn't bother waiting for a seat because it was close to being "packed". The bf gets annoyed waiting in line but he sucked it up and devoured his goodies. The items we selected: 1] Frangipane Croissant (Frangipane I learned from Wikipedia means Almond filled).  It was a blueberry/almond filled.  YUM. 2] Chocolate Croissant. Melted chocolate in your mouth and BF said it was still warm. 3] Croque Monsieur -Open face sandwich made with our Country bread, bechamel, gruyre, thyme and pepper.  Topped with either smoked Niman Ranch ham or seasonal vegetables.  Served with house-made pickles. I liked the BF's sandwich more than this one. 4] Jambon Royale & Gruyere hot pressed sandwich.  YUM but raelly buttery and fatty. 5] Coffee and a Earl Grey tea. 6] Pickled and spicy heirloom carrots.  So good! Experience: My first visit to Tartine and I think they need a better "waiting in line" system. I didnt know there was a separate line for the "drinks". You can merely just walk up to the counter and order your drink while you wait in line for the pasteries.   Would I go back? I just wanted to check out to see what the hype is about since they have a cookbook out in stores and all.

I went here for the first time last Saturday. It's definitely a popular place. I can't say that Tartine rocked my world though lol. I shared one of the opened faced sandwiches and a pastrami sandwich with two other people. Yes, they were decent, but nothing I would care to eat again. I also tasted the eclair. The eclair was very rich and chocolaty. So it's good if you're into that kind of thing.   I feel a little cheated out of my first experience at Tartine. So I'll visit again and try different things next time.

For being someone who is not a super big fan of rich chocolate or super sweet dessert items, this place was really good. Parking was a b*Tch!! We probably made like 3-4 circles around the block until we found a tiny one. Either way, we made the car fit and proceeded to wait in line. the line was about 15 deep but being their for the first time, I knew it was worth it to wait. If the stuff tasted like shiet, I wouldn't think people would wait for it. So that's a plus! We ordered the meyer lemon tart, banana cream tart, and blueberry almond tart. The total bill came out to be 18 something since they were about 18 bucks. It was a little pricey but it was all worth it. The banana cream tart was so effing good! It was perfect. The bananas were fresh and not too mushy. The crust was nice and flakey and tehre was alot of crust. It wasn't too sweet where you feel like you just ate a pound of sugar. On top of it, they put large shavings of chocolate and it was so good!!! Then the meyer lemon tart had a few pomegranate seeds on it and this was not too lemony so it was awesome. The shell was pretty thin so it worked well. It was just heavenly while eating it. I loved it Anyhow, i think the drip coffee here is pretty good also since everyone had one. I'm cutting back on my caffiene intake so i didn't have it. I think it's a nice place to bring some friends and chill. will go back!

I love the almond croissant and fruit tart (raspberry is my favorite, but they only put on what's fresh).   Why is there always a line?  I bought their recipe book to avoid this but you'll see me back in line on the weekends. Great place to pick up goodies if you're visiting friends.

First visit:  coconut cream tart.  The tart filling was so delicate as to be almost flavorless and the candy shell so hard it shattered when I bit into it, sending flying chocolate shards and drops of filling into my lap.  Good times. Second visit:  cookies and chai latte.  Uninspiring, bland cookies and too much milk in the chai.  A second attempt at the chai (thank you) with less milk revealed an awful tasting chai base.  At that point I just threw it out and went down a few blocks to Mission Creek Cafe. I don't know what people are eating here that they think is delicious.  Maybe it's because even the semblance of a western bakery in SF gets ooohs and aaahs.  Not impressed.

YUMMY.  i ordered a croissant which had Gruyere, thyme and black pepper inside.  this was no croissant with a piece of hard cheese in the middle that had been sitting all day.  oh no dear friends, the cheese was magically incorporated with the croissant dough....but just in the middle.  so damn good. savory deliciousness.  i also got a latte which was on point.   no seating available.  place is tight so i took it to go.

Croque monsier. That's what I had. I remember cause I couldn't pronounce it. But, the harder it is to pronounce, the yummier it will be, yeah? I wasn't far off - the croque monsier was an open top sandwich with your choice of topping, and it was really tasty! Just by looking at the sandwich though, I thought at first that it'd be a bit too creamy for my taste, but it was just about right. I had the banana cream tart this time. Light custard, fresh diced banans, and caramel flavor mixed in the center .Quite good. Overall I'd say their pastries are decent (I've had better), and I left feeling more satisfied from the sandwich than dessert. Seating is quite tight - all the times I've been there, they've been packed with lines. It took a little waiting and maneuvering to find a spot, so be prepared to wait a little if you want to dine in. Otherwise, I'd say pick up some food here and chill at the mission dolores park - that'd make for a fine afternoon as well!

Phenomenal ham sandwich! Obsession-inducing coconut cream tart! Perfect handmade coffee! The baked goods will make you cry. My only complaint is that the double-size pain au chocolat is too doughy. They tried to deliver a super-breed pain au chocolat, but it just doesn't have that nice, light flaky thing going; it kind of clogs your gullet. It's like a dough football with a bit of chocolate lost in it. But OH, you've never seen a finer ham sandwich! And clearly I need to try other things on the menu, which is stellar. Do wish the prices weren't so high, but they earn it...

Tartine Bakery's Morning Sticky Bun w/a Cafe Latte would be one of my top 2 reasons I move to SF. Tartine is totally worth the hype and waiting in line, it moves fast, especially if you know what you want. A couple of things I've tried: coconut passion fruit cake - the passion fruit creme isn't as sour as most others, and leaves a refreshing feeling on your tongue that goes well with the cake/coconut flakes. mexican wedding cookie - not as buttery as most, very crumbly and delish. made with walnuts. bread pudding - not a huge fan of bread pudding to begin with, but i wanted to try it because everyone else had a bowl of it. suprisingly good, very filling though. besides the horrendous parking... this place is perfect! ::edit:: went back for breakfast. ham quiche: baked to perfection... the other quiche was just ok. morning bun: glazed with orange marmalade and sprinkled with a little sugar. w/a latte... mmm..

Bought the Tartine cookbook and it's wonderful.  We've tried 4 things so far out out of the cookbook and so far, every single one of them has been amazing.  My wife was a bit concerned that the recipes would be a bit too hard to follow but they're actually not.   I'm a bit of a croissant snob so I think the croissants here are just ok.  Still, I love the 'frenchness' of this bakery.  There aren't many places in San Francisco like it.

So my husband has a thing for chocolate croissants...he's crazy about them! When I saw the television show the best thing I ever ate featuring desserts. One of the chefs had mentioned Tartine Bakery supposedly had the best chocolate croissant EVER and sure enough they DO! I managed to roll out of be early Saturday morning to wait in line at 7:45am just to get my hands on a few pastries. YES I said a few...since I was going all the way there for croissants I might as well  sample more than just one item right. HaHa. So after waiting in line for about 25min it was finally my turn to order...everything smelled so heavenly and I wanted it all. What I really ended up getting was chocolate croissants (EXCELLENT), morning bun (EXCELLENT), scone (EXCELLENT), chocolate chip cookie (EXCELLENT)...lol yes everything I bought from there turned out to be so savory, sweet and so perfect! I spent the next two hours at the gym but it was well worth it! The pastries are a little pricey but a good treat once in a while! I will def be back again!

I'll try to keep this one short and sweet, get it? har har har   We missed our flight back to LA because we, or actually I, HAD to stop by Tartine Bakery before I left.  It's ironic because I'm not really a sweets person.  Was it worth it??  YESSSSSSSSSS.  Their BANANA CREME TART was quite simply amazing, unlike any pastry I've ever tried before.  I'll spare you the details because 'DIANA I.' described it so well below.  I wholeheartedly agree with her.   I also had their seasonal PEACH BREAD PUDDING with a glass of milk, and all I can say is that I wish I could have that for breakfast everyday. I'm looking forward to stopping by again the next time I'm up in San Francisco.  A bientot Tartine!

I thought this place might have been too hyped up, but it actually lived up to my expectations. This place is pretty noticeable once you see the long line of people waiting outside. It was a Saturday morning so it was to be expected. The line went somewhat quickly though so it wasn't too bad. I ordered the gougere and the morning bun. The gougere had a good flavor to it and wasn't too cheesy. The morning bun was okay, but it wasn't as good as people made it out to be. My roommate got the brioche bread pudding which for a girl like me who isn't normally a fan of bread pudding, loved it! Nice soft texture with yummy apples on top. Also tried some of her banana cream tart which was very delicious and decadent. Too crowded to really hang out there, but i would be come back to get some goodness to go.

Parking is a drab and there's never anywhere to sit... BUT WHO CARES?! They have MORNING BUNS! I went there for the first time this morning (despicable, I know).  I've seen the Tartine cook book around, and even flipped through it several times but never dragged my butt down to the shop (mostly because parking sucks!)   But when I made a breakfast date with one of my girlfriends, she suggested Tartine. YES! I'll gladly go. Boy, have I been a fool.   The morning bun is like nothing I've ever had--Crispy, flaky, caramelized on the outside and incredibly fluffy and croissant-like on the inside.  It's lightly sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar on the outside with a hint of orange.  I devoured that morning bun like no other (thank goodness I bought two!) I also bought an almond croissant, which I haven't eaten yet because I felt so compelled to write a review the moment I got home! The line is usually long (so I hear) but from today's experience, it moves pretty fast, so if there's a line out the door, do not fret. pssst, Bobby Flay has been spotted here with his wife...if it's good enough for Bobby, well, it's good enough for me.   I'll definitely be back soon to try more baked goods and hopefully find a seat to enjoy a bowl of coffee...yes, a BOWL of coffee.

My French-born grandmother once told me, "When you are een Parees and you see a long line outside a patisserie, you must know eet ees fob-oo-less." Well, the same thing could be said about pastry shops in San Francisco (only without the bad French accent)! I'd read about Tartine in a magazine and then on Yelp and being the rabid francophile that I am (eet ees, after all, in my DNA), I simply HAD to go there and try the much lauded banana cream tart. One taxi ride reminiscent of the crazy double-decker bus scene in Harry Potter later and I was standing in line, in the rain, on a drizzly, cold Sunday morning.  The locals had bed-head and were bleary-eyed but determined.  There was a palpable wave of excitement undulating through the crowd (yes, crowd...before 9 in the morning) and it grew stronger as it got closer to opening time. Finally, the girl inside unlocked the door and dove for cover as the ravenous, zombie-like crowd burst inside. All that waiting must have made me a little loopy because I ordered: one vegie quiche, one Croque Monsieur, one morning bun, one eclair, and two tarts (There were two of us). Everything was delicious.  Crazy, zombie-satisfying delicious.  Paris-worthy delicious. The quiche was light and mile high. The Croque was NOT a true French Croque Monsieur but had tomatoes on it and was open-faced on a baguette.  I'm a purist and prefer the traditional way but thus one was rather tasty. The eclair was outrageous.  Note: The pastry cream was much more liquidy, less pudding-y than I've ever tasted but it was delicious and flecked with vanilla bean. I do not care for banana but I did try a bite of the tart and thought it was good -- not as good as the coconut cream tart!  OMG! If Heaven had a taste, it would be Tartine's Coconut Cream Tart.  Light, flavorful and the crust is coated with chocolate!! Tips: Arrive early. Divide and conquer or you won't get a seat. Indulge but be sure to ask for a Togo bag or box as portions are generous. Don't venture on foot too far up 18th as the neighborhood gets decidedly dicey, especially if you're alone or female.

Morning bun - I lucked out and got a fresh one right out of the oven.  Oh my heaven.  It is so lucious, tender, melt in your mouth goodness with a hint of orange and sugar.

The greatest bakery in the Bay Area. Fantastic rustic-French pastries, bread pudding (sweet and occassionally a savory variety as well), simple sandwiches, tarts, and coffee. Cappucinos - second best cappucinos in the city (bested only by Cafe Trieste), but certainly best foam anywhere. You can take a knife and cut through the foam, it's that thick. I used to recommend going early to beat the rush, but Tartine is full from opening through close. Don't go expecting to hang out either -- eat, drink, and get out. The line snakes out the door and there's always a queue to get in and for seating. We're all waiting on another location to open to address the obvious pent up demand. How about several more locations - maybe one in Pacific Heights, one in SOMA, one in the Marina.

This was one of the first places I've ever eaten at since I moved to San Francisco.  When we got there and saw the line wrapped halfway around the building I thought, "the sandwiches better be made of gold!".  I have to say, it was definitely well worth the wait.  I had the Croque Monsieur, which was so creamy and cheesy.  I also shared a slice of quiche with my friend, which was also delicious. I'm generally not a big fan of pastries, but I have to say the eclair was out of this world as well.  Damn, I ate a lot that day!

I had been recommending this place to friends who visit SF - but had never gone myself, until yesterday. FINALLY! I braced myself for a line that wrapped around the corner, with people chanting "Tartine! Tartine!" but to my surprise, the Monday morning crowd was pretty subdued. We got there around 9:30 and hopped right into line, waiting only a few minutes before it was our turn. So many options, so little stomach space. I went with the bread pudding (only did a cup, shoulda chosen a bowl), my husband went with the coconut cream tart, and we split a croissant. The bread pudding was amazing. It had baked apple slices on top, and the bready part had a consistency that resembled flan (which I love) more than bread pudding. I loved it. It didn't go overboard with the sweetness, and the flavor was spot-on. The coconut cream tart was good, too, but more like a dessert than a breakfast. I loved the combination of caramel and chocolate lining the tart crust. MMmm...and the croissant - wow, all that buttery goodness. I can't wait to go again to try more things. I'm sure I will not be disappointed.

Oh Tartine, why are you in SF while I reside in LA. I suppose if it was acceptable to live in only spandex, we could have a closer relationship, but for now, you will have to exist only on random trips up north, following a week of healthy eating.   In the less than 48 hours in which I visited SF most recently, I was here twice.  Both times with a bag to go.  Not okay.  What was VERY okay, was the morning bun, the cake aux olives, the almond croissant, the quiche with swiss chard.  Oh, and the perfect balance of all came in a tasty little savory treat.  Gougere.  Seriously, you must go now. My only complaint.  The coffee is really only so-so.  That's okay, I should probably stick with water while dining on sugar and cheese.

A coworker recommended this place to me and after getting a sneak of the menu, it was on my must-see list while I was in San Francisco. And let me tell you, I'm glad I don't live near here because I would be a) poor and b) portly because i would be here all the time. No joke. I got the turkey croque monsieur and lemon tart and no joke, it was the most amazing thing I've had in a while. It's simple but the way it is presented and the taste is out of this world. But all of its sandwiches and desserts look amazing. And when I say amazing, I mean, you cannot possibly immediately narrow down what looks good because it all does. The outside has no markings as to the name, but you'll be able to find it because of the line outside. There is communal seating inside and out and it gets great light so you can easily take photos of your food. I do have to say, the inside is quaint but very small. VERY small so it can easily get warm and cramped. My only real complaint is the process of them taking your order. It's very slow and not very well organized. But despite this complaint, I still waited in that line and don't regret it. Also, be aware that it is pricey but I for me, it was worth it as a visiting treat :)

I'm on a sugar overload. All these sweets and my friend brings over another. A 9-inch banana cream pie. At first sight, all I saw was chocolate shavings riding on a creamy cloud. I cut myself a decent slice of pie and was overwhelmed by the layers of banana, chocolate and crust. This pie is delicious - the freshness of the banana and the the chocolate layer over the crust was the best part. Better not leave the whole pie with me, I'll devour it before bedtime. I like treats but don't know if I can afford this one on a regular basis. It's $38 for the pie - a hefty price tag for a pie.

I'm currently eating my way through the SF Big Eat food treasure hunt which lead me to the Morning Bun at Tartine. I have a lot ot say about the Morning Bun but first can we talk about the cafe itself cause this place is wonderful. You know when read some book and the protagonist is at a café having a "moment". This is THAT café.  It's a rustic, romantic, warm buttery spot in the middle of SF's unending fog. I felt that perhaps I would be able to speak french just by crossing the threshold. The morning bun was revelatory, soft and light with just a hint of orange zest. My friend had a ham and cheese croissant which was also delicious. We might've accidentally bought 4-5 other baked goods as well to "take home to my husband" I wanted to stay there for the rest of my life. I might move there when I'm retired. During a hard day at work I close my eyes and think about Tartine, it's my new happy place. Verdict: Go immediately. Eat anything and everything. Then tell me about it so I can live vicariously.

Completely overrated. I'm concerned for the people of San Francisco if they think this place is an amazing bakery. It's definitely good but by no means an amazing, wait 30-45 minutes in line, bakery. Boston has better places almost everywhere you turn. Okay, okay, to be fair we didn't actually try the bread...which they are known for...but what we did try wasn't special, at all, and MUCH better can be found almost anywhere here in Boston....so I stand by my comment of "overrated"...sorry San Fran...I dig your city but you guys need better taste in pastry and food.

The lemon tart - tangy with a buttery shell and the chai is spicy and good. And the bread *insert groan here* OMG the bread. Go. Eat. Rejoice in the tasty goodness.

It's the End of A Buttery, Golden Era Their food is just as good. Thier waitstaff just as hip. But their prices are now untenable. $3.25 for a croissant.  $6 for a small tartlet.  *$52* for a chocolate cake.  A cake.   Yes, I know the health care ordinance is adding to costs everywhere.  But at other restaurant they add a $1 to each meal.  This is a much larger hike than that. The croissant is grand.  But is it 200% better than every other croissant in town?  I'd have to go with no.  Plus you feel like you've swallowed a lard bowling ball after you eat one.   I can't do it.  I won't. Goodbye Tartine.  It's time to seek out new gustatory experiences that won't trample my dreams of fiscal solvency with their big French boots.

This place is a culinary art gallery -- perfectly crafted pastries, cakes, cookies and baked delicacies adorn a display case straight out of a magazine cover. And oddly enough, a magazine cover is what inspired me to go there. The latest issue of San Francisco magazine said that the grilled cheese at Tartine was a life-changing event. The second I read the magazine and looked up the menu, I said that it would be on the to-do list above an oil change and rent payments. Tartine had more hype than a Tiger Woods Mistress beauty pageant. So I go. I drove by on a rainy Saturday morning to see the entire sidewalk full of soaked customers, so I decided to do it another time. I'd planned to take a day off of work just to attempt to get there on time. Today, the line was short on a Friday afternoon, and the quite good looking, 99% female staff, made it look like I'd walked into an independent film bent on capturing San Francisco in 2010 for posterity's sake. I walked up, and a ordered my Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese sandwich, and a Pastrami sandwich for good measure. I'd made it here, why not make an event of it. I refuse to change my orders, getting an adequate judgment of their ideas of taste. I got my little letter placard and waited for my sandwiches. And waited. And waited. I was the last person to order anything off the menu instead of behind the counter for a good 15  minutes, and there were very few people waiting with placards on their table. I was basically the only one being served, waiting for my food. A good 30-40 minutes later, after the glow of being able to actually order from Tartine had worn off, and the charm of being in a quintessential San Francisco bakery had been replaced with reality, I'd become restless. 20 minutes, I would've possibly understood, but at 2:00 on a Friday with more people behind the counter than in front, I was dismayed. Then I got the sandwiches. They were brought to my waiting spot, and I'd taken them to go. On my walk back to my car, I took a bite out of the Goat cheese sandwich, and basically felt like San Francisco itself had been thrown into my mouth, perfectly pressed, on the greatest bread I'd ever sampled. I actually stopped while I was walking and started laughing. This really was that good. 13 dollars good? Who knows, but I was as hungry as a pickup truck at a gas station, and this was other-worldly. When I got home to a comfortable chair, I opened the pastrami. I figured I'd need a spot to sit to enjoy this. I opened it and saw absolute bread perfection, holding meat and cheese which looked like they could cure polio...twice. I took a bite, and puzzled, wait...horseradish? I forgot about that on the menu, but oh well, I really like horseradi.....what...is...happening? I then spent 30 seconds just staring at a wall, tears gushing down my face like someone had injected 150 CCs of wasabi directly into my brain, and stuck my head in a paint can shaker. I was floored, absolutely floored. I could taste one thing: my frontal lobe as it was melting through my sinuses. Some of the best ingredients ever sandwiched, rendered useless by a cheap, invasive plant root. I figured I'd gotten a bad bite, overwhelmed by mustard and horseradish, jousting it out in my mouth over who could fossilize my taste buds first. So, I ate more. One bite in there, with a reasonable amount of everything, tasted like a zeppelin ride over the city, wrapping a view of the entire peninsula into about 17 mandibular motions. From then, I stomached the rest with an inner conflict that the best sandwich in the city with a one bite exception...was now the worst I'd ever had.  How could the greatest of culinary hype fall prey to someone puttying my sandwich with horse-radish and mustard based industrial solvents? How did it happen? There's 1/3 of the revelatory goat cheese sandwich waiting in my refrigerator, most likely representing my last trip to Tartine. I was in a bakery, a damned near perfect one, and I had that warm bakery feeling; a color wheel of edible magnificence, dough being kneaded by licensed masseuses, the aroma of butter creme frosting wafting through the air like spring fog, and metal boxes full of hot air turning a mixture of boring ingredients into, for some, what are life changing delicacies. Alas, it wasn't meant to be Tartine. In another time, and another place, I shall find a place such as you which makes me yearn to come back and spend 30 dollars on two sandwiches. But the little things that make me want to come back to a restaurant, like service with a smile. Any service, really. And a Pastrami sandwich which I could rest on my apartment floor in a bag for 6 minutes without risk of it eating through the, box, bag, and floor, then going medieval on my downstairs neighbors couch. Next sandwich please.

They only get four stars because it is amazing but it is also annoying that I would have to wait sooo long to get something from the coffee shop closest to my house. croissants get them preferably the almond. brioche another winner. the mexican wedding cookie, chocolate tea cake and the eclair no thanks. skip em. I repeat croissant. the coffee is great but it is from Four Barrel and if in the area you can always go to straight to the source a few blocks away.

Why take the bus on a beautify day from downtown when I can walk there.  It's only a few blocks right?  My mistake, city blocks, yeah, after walking, what felt like 4.5 miles, I took the bus the remaining way.  Well, now I worked up an appetite.  Just as many yelpers described, there was a line to the door, but it moves quickly.  I had enough time to drool all over their showcase. I decided on two croissants, the almond (it's a must) and the chocolate (also a must).  The almond one was huge, flaky, covered in powdered sugar, and sliced toasted almonds on top with almost paste in the middle.   I will admit that it looked better than tasted.  It taste was good, just not great.  The component that was disappointing was that there was too much powdered sugar.  It masks the flavor the beautiful almond paste in side, the main attraction. The chocolate croissant was also a base-hit, but not a home-run.  It also had the same characteristics, large, golden brown, flaky, but when it came to the chocolate, there just wasn't enough. All in all, the inside is very neat and I could see myself eating, reading a paper or book, eating again, sipping some coffee, etc...  I would certainly be willing to try it again, but this time I would take the bus the whole way, it wasn't worth walking.  Enjoy!

How could you go wrong with 4.5 stars out of 2.7k reviews?! Being as I was on a mission to try as much of the 7x7 big eat SF list within a few hours, I knew this had to be my first breakfast spot! The morning buns were delightful! It was everything every reviewer said it would be, the perfect hybrid between a flaky croissant and a sweet cinnamon roll. The orange zest is a perfect complement! I also tried the lemon cream tart which was very tart of course. It was tasty, but the morning bun stole the limelight! I need to try their espresso next time! Be sure to try to grab a table as soon as you see someone getting ready to leave! It gets crowded.

It is scandalous that this place has anything less than five stars; ask any resident of Mission Dolores what the best bakery in the world is and you'll hear the same answer: Tartine. The croque monsieur, bread pudding, and morning buns are out of this world, and pretty much everything on the menu is just fantastic -- you literally cannot go wrong.

Amazing.  It has better croissants then ones I have had in France, I ordered 2 (one for later) and it was still incredibly crispy, buttery & fresh when I enjoyed it that evening.   The croque monsieur sandwich is great, comes with some picked carrots on the side, so delicious.  The baristas have it going on here too, they made me a great latte with the milk steamed correctly, this place has got it going on, totally worth the long wait!

I got hooked on Tartine months ago, after I had their bread at Delfina. With the exception of the frequently long line, I can't think of a bad thing about this place. The lemon bars with a pine nut crust are amazing, as is about anything they make with chocolate.   Lastly, if the bread caused me brain damage.....I would still eat it.   Note: Bread is only available after 3 or 4pm and only on Wednesday thru Sunday.

I'm writing this review based on service... and also based off my wife's review of the baked goods. First off... it was a late Wednesday evening and they were apparently closing, but hadn't locked up the doors yet. My cousins and I barged in and they promptly said, "we're closing!" I told the nice gal behind the counter that I was flying back to LA and I needed to bring my wife something... and she smiled and helped us gladly.   I picked a chocolate chip oatmeal cookie and my cousin picked out something else for my wife.  I have no clue what it was... something covered in chocolate. So there you go... fast... friendly service... even when closing. Now to the review of the taste... my wife said it was the best cookie she'd ever had.  OK... 5 stars on service... and taste!  WOOHOO!!!

This place is overrated. The lines are extremely long and you pay at least 20% more for everything than at most other bakeries. I've been here a handful of times and never been impressed. This past weekend, I came again at a friend's request, stood in line for 40 minutes, paid $6 for a fruit tart, sat down, and found a 2-INCH PUBE IN MY FRUIT TART!!!!!! EWWWWW NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN.

Oh Tartine... As though there weren't enough praises being sung.  In some ways I wish you didn't exist lest my waistline disappear forever. Seeing as it's labor day weekend and an opportune time to buy pastries galore with the assumption that there will be multiple other mouths to feed, I decided to acquire a shopping list of items from Tartine today.  Of those that I purchased and tried, from favorite to least favorite: Chocolate eclair: I'm not usually an eclair person but by some stroke of heavenly luck, a friend of mine is.  The first thing that comes to mind upon a bite is "goodness GRACIOUS that is some amazing chocolate." As noted on numerous signs, Tartine uses Valrhona in what seems to be all things chocolate there, and they certainly aren't shy about it. A thick, 1-2mm layer of dark chocolate blankets the top of each eclair and perfectly compliments the soft, smooth, pure vanilla bean cream that is fresh enough to still feel the very very slight crunch of the eclair pastry shell. This one pretty much blew me away. Lemon cream tart: Second chart-topper was the lemon cream tart. I've always had an affinity for these so it wasn't too surprising that I loved it. The lemon was bright and tart, the tart shell thin and sightly crunchy. Simple splendor. Plain croissant: HUMONGOUS and flakey beyond belief, this item was so good I finished it all in probably 10min max.  I devoured it so quickly I felt slightly sick. Considering that it's borderline dangerous I probably won't buy this one again. Chocolate chip cookie: the first time I had it, the cookie was so light and crisp it almost didn't seem like a cookie, but I found it powerfully addictive.  It's thin as two stacked saltine crackers and has random pieces of dark chocolate throughout, as well as bits of oatmeal and walnut. I didn't like the walnut so much but the cookie was still great - just need to watch when you get it because it seems to get stale pretty quickly (considering it's thinness). My second taste of the cookie was a bit stale, too much chew in the place of crisp. Morning bun: surprisingly enough, the morning bun Tartine is supposed to be known for was my least favorite of them all. It reminded a bit of a churro with orange zest at the center, which I didn't like much. The bun is light ad flakey as the making/baking process is probably similar to their croissant technique, but again, the flavoring was off for me. The orange was almost sickening, too syrupy and pronounced. That being said, I had my doubts whether I'd like a pastry like that, so if you're generally a fan of morning buns I can see that one being dream-worthy. Pounds heavier as I write this, I still must grudgingly admit: All. Completely. Worth it.

Bottom Line Up Front: Go. Eat. Enjoy Its that simple Pros: Best pastries/bread I have had this side of the Atlantic Cons: Busy. So so very busy. Like all the time busy. Prose: Like many other reviewers, I find it difficult to describe what is happening here. I suppose I could wax poetics, go into how the Morning Bun could slap the Existentialism right out of Kierkegaard. But no one, including myself wants to hear that. So I will just say this- Do yourself a favor, indulge everyday in the wonder that is Tartine Bakery. Because there are those of us not in San Francisco who wake with envious hearts, and unsatisfied carbohydrate full stomachs, who would sell their thumbs for a freaking morning bun!

As recommended by my San Fran cousin Paul, me and my BF stopped into Tartine on a cold and kinda damp Monday around 11:00am. I thought we would beat any lunch crowd but the place was packed and fortunately, we were able to snag an outside table. So many choices...we decided on the brioche bread pudding served with berries, a plain croissant and two hot mochas. The mochas were HUGE! Like a bowl of mocha soup really but I ain't complaining as it helped fuel a long walk later. The bread pudding was outstanding, I could have eaten large amounts of it and still would want more. The plain croissant was delicious - flaky and buttery but not the best I've ever had. We loved this place so much that we are planning on a quick stop on our drive back to Colorado as a much needed sugar/caffeine boost for the 20 hour trip.

I've been coming to Tartine for years now, and I thought I knew it, but last weekend I was surprised again by this fantastic bakery.  I had the **spicy turkey sandwich**, and it was out of this world delicious.  I had always shied away from paying $12 for a Tartine sandwich, figuring I'd let them specialize in just pastries for me, and get my actual sustenance elsewhere.  I guess I'm just an economist at heart, specialization for the win. What a mistake, because Tartine has definitely got a comparative advantage in sandwiches! ;)  The sandwich was so enormous that they cut it into *three* sections.  It ended up being lunch and dinner.  The bread is delicious, thick, and toasted, the turkey is top quality, and the cheese and spicy goodness is a religious experience. Here's a photo of that religious experience if you want to see what I mean: http://www.yelp.com/biz_…  And I almost forgot -- that little carrot there was also REALLY delicious.  A carrot!  I know!  It had been pickled maybe?  Or just soaked in something spicy?  It was really, really fresh and good, and I was not the only one to comment on it. Aside from the sandwich, as always I got two pastries because it's impossible to just choose one here.  My thoughts: -- Pain au chocolat -- this is the most delicious pain au chocolat.  It's made with Valhrona chocolate, and it's buttery, flaky delicious.  The chocolate is usually still halfway-melted when you bite into it.  Oh me oh my. -- Regular croissant -- Same as the pain au chocolat, but no chocolate... still, less can be more.  In fact, Charlie Sheen might call it bi-winning.  This croissant can shine even with its simplicity. -- Almond croissant -- Most almond croissants go overboard on the sugar and don't emphasize the almond enough, but Tartine strikes a much better balance.  It's not a marzipan croissant, it's an almond croissant, and I love it. -- Morning bun -- it's so moist, and with the typical cinnamon-sugar combo going on, but also a hint of orange zest.  Mmm! -- Bread pudding -- it will always be topped with a seasonal fruit, with chunks of bread that has so many wonderful textures, it's not even funny.  If the fruit is one you enjoy, this is the perfect breakfast, best accompanied by a bowl of *café au lait*. :)

Had I only ordered the Bread Pudding this would be a 5 star review. Had I only ordered the Three Cheese Panini it would have been a one star review. So three seems the way to go (for now). I hesitated to give three stars to a bakery that is probably full of all 5 star desserts and pastries but the sandwiches are on the menu and I ordered one so I feel compelled to include it. The pudding was light, warm and delicious with perfectly ripe fresh fruit scattered across the top. The whole pan behind the counter was really a thing of beauty. I had the cup size which was a generous portion for the price and I will definitely order it again in the future. The panini was not good. The bread was too thick and rather tough to bite through because the pieces were so thick. The cheese looked beautiful, thick and melted, oozing out when the plate was brought to the table. One bite and I was disappointed. While rich, nothing about the cheese really stood out. It was just hot, melted, oozing cheese. A one cheese sandwich with a flavorful extra sharp cheddar on bread half as thick would have made me a happy camper. And the sandwich was expensive. I'm sure I will raise this rating star by star after sampling a few more desserts at Tartine but for now, it is what it is.

Tartine is an amazing bakery.  I have been here at least 3 times and love it every time.  I recommend the ham and cheese as a standard delicious item (that is always on the menu) but also recommend picking whatever you fancy from their delicious selection of pastries and treats once you get inside (there will be a line, it will be worth it), or whatever else you find on the menu - like the ham and mushroom open faced sandwich.  Wish I could be more specific but their menu changes frequently and even though I'm bummed the previous items may not be there when I go again instead I'm pleasantly surprised by something new. Yay Tartine!

We made sure to stop here on a recent trip to San Francisco.  The wait wasn't too bad, so we were lucky.  I really wanted to try their bread, but we went on a day when they didn't make any fresh.

Can you say THE BEST, which is the proper nickname for Tartine's.  Sometimes in this life you do get what you pay for, and this place is soooo worth the money.  Save up for the best bread, best tart, best cake, best cookie, yum yum yum.  I've conducted a study, and my conclusion is that Tartine's is not only the best bakery in San Francisco; it's the best in at least 2 counties --  and maybe the best this side of Paris!

Perfectly executed baked goods. This is inspite of the whopping volume they produce. I only wish I could get a decent cup of brewed coffee. They use Four Barrel coffee, which is perfection.  Problem is the ratio of coffee to water, not enough coffee, and the brewing and thermal pots. What you get is a weak cup of lukewarm coffee.

Always, always good. Got another two paninis to share- ham and the prosciutto. Also, a chocolate croissant for my bro for later and a berry bread pudding. We ALWAYS get the bread pudding thinking we'll like it, but don't... I think I like my bread pudding more bready and dry and less eggy tasting. The sandwiches as always came through- hearty, salty, crispy, and delicious. The salty, sour, spicy, pickled carrots on the side help to cut the richness and I'd buy a jar of those on their own to eat. The croissant would have been better eaten at the bakery I believe, since it wasn't as crispy, more soggy, four hours later at home. But you can't have everything ;D More return trips to come- I will try everything! ALSO, stand in line for the restroom sometime. You get to watch the bakers work the gigantic ovens- pretty fantastic.

Wonderful bread pudding with berries. It was not too sweet or rich. It's a perfect "light" dessert. Hot sandwiches were good too, but it took them about 15 minutes to make them. Cons: Wait- It takes awhile to get to the front of the line to order, and then it takes awhile to get your hot sandwiches. Parking- It took about 10-15 minutes of circling the blocks to find a parking space. In general, food was fantastic. If I live closer to this place (like within walking distance), I'd frequent this place. I am not sure if it was worth all of the time (driving, parking, waiting in line, waiting for food).

I find it charming that you can drink coffee from a bowl. It reminds me of drinking hot chocolate from a bowl for breakfast at Colombian restaurants in Miami. Just drink it down and chug and chug and chug! Sounds like a beer fest, eh? Well it almost is - but without the hangover (when I last tested it at least). But San Francisco... you're lucky to have such a French bakery near a pretty park to relax on (Dolores). And furthermore, you're lucky to have a French bakery that serves a simplistic slice of bread topped with ham and cheese on top without another layer of bread - and yes, they charge you for ordering such a simple meal too! But, I assure you, forking over your life for this "croque monsieur" will get you into heaven faster than dying on the cross. Sorry Christians, but it's true! Okay, so it really doesn't cost that much, but it is definitely the best croque monsieur I've ever had... and to couple it with those crisp oatmeal cookies that has orange peel in them... can we say "mierde" together and just fly to France and slap the French asses for not spreading more awareness about these delicacies? I'm astounded that I would have to be in San Francisco to know about just how good they can just be! Now, if I can get the dogs out of Dolores so I won't have to live in fear of being licked upon while I'm drunk with some French love.... Note: Bread pudding could be better, a sandwich I had (mustard, ham and cheese) was not as good as the croque monsieur, but it's a matter of taste, and the rochers were a bit too sweet and airy for my taste. For desserts, stick with something tarty.

I just went here with a dear friend and I must say, this place rocked! We were quite decadent and shared three goodies between the two of us, plus had coffee and tea. I'm a fan of Mr. Espresso coffee, so that was great. The three yummies we had were the morning bun, the lemon tarte and the banana cream thing (apologies for not having the correct names). It was my first time. For health reasons, I can't have too many sugars, so I just took bites of everything. Oh my god! Everything was heavenly! I'm definitely going back again! Please note that the cafe is a bit small and can get a little crowded. I love that they are environmentally conscious. Finally, I hear that the bread goes fast!

My favorite bakery in SF .. Best almond croissant I've ever had. Best ham & cheese croissant I've ever had. Bread pudding is good (brioche and strawberries). They use dark chocolate for their chocolate croissants ... which is too bitter for me but some ppl like it. Minus 1 star because they don't always have what I want when I want it .. shouldn't they make this stuff round the clock? It's not easy taking off from work in the morning to get a batch of almond croissants and morning buns only to find that I drove across town and took off from work for NOTHING. boo. update 04/08/08 --- for the THIRD time in a row they've run out of almond croissants in the AM .. (by 8:30am!) .. once I called ahead and asked if there would be enough by the time I could get there (30 mins) .. they said yes but when I got there, there wasn't any left!!!!!!!!!! come on! it's not easy leaving the hospital in the morning to run across town .. only to be disappointed again and again. I'm going to take it from 4 stars to 3 .. sorry I love you Tartine, and I think you're the best ... but this is my way of begging you to make more batches ..

Two words: SUGAR. HIGH. I don't usually consume such mass quantities of sugar for breakfast, nor do I drink my americanos from a cereal bowl. But... when in Rome. Or, when in Tartine. Definitely more on the expensive side than not, but still delightful... especially when the wait person gave me a bowl of bread pudding for the price of a cup... well, it was a fluke. The new tray wasn't out yet and the bowl was the only available serving size... but I was still quite happy about it.

I upped it just out of feeling guilty and just loving this place..... I love love love Tartine.  I send everyone there and often dream of the croque monsieur, bread pudding, and morning bun.  But....last Sunday I diverged from my normal order and got a hot pressed sandwich.  It took 20 minutes to stick some turkey and cheese in between some bread and put it in the hot press.  And it was dripping in butter.  I will return to pre-made food there.  Super-disappointing for the rock star of my world.

Good, but maybe not worth the hassle. 1) Jambon Royale & Gruyere - Quite possibly the best ham and cheese sandwich I have ever had. Perfectly pressed/toasted buttered bread with delicious Niman ranch ham, gruyere, and tasty Dijon mustard. A pretty hefty sandwich, but they conveniently cut it in thirds. Took forever to come out though! To avoid a nasty parking ticket (I had already maxed out the meter with $1.50 for an hour), I asked them to box it up. Expensive though, at $10.25. I ended up eating it in my car as I drove through SF to GG bridge and then up to the Sonoma Coast. 2) Croissant - Not as good as I thought it would be. Large, rich, and buttery - yes. Delicately flakey? No. It seemed a little too doughy, but was good and better than most. Expensive at ~ $3 3) Friand - A nice little treat, kinda of like a really small cupcake. A bit of chocolate cake is topped with Valrhona ganache. Mmm...delicious. $2 4) Buttermilk Scone w/ currants - A pretty standard scone. I brought it home and ate it for breakfast the next morning. Did not dry out too much and was good. ~ $3 There isn't a whole lot of seating inside or out. They are a bit optimistic in trying to squeeze in four small chairs on one side of the communal table. Maybe if everyone is super skinny. Otherwise, prepare to rub elbows, literally. :P Come with lots of patience, time, and money. ;)

Great bakery, didn't really mind the lines, but the stinky homeless dude drinking a 40 that cleared out the main room kind of dampened the situation. I know its SF, but there has to be a point when people need to be made to leave...I mean this was an epic funk, real wrath of god stuff. Otherwise, food was great, would go again for sure. Got the grougiere, bread pudding, and a scone. All good, nothing amazing, but I felt the potential in the place.

Tartine lives up to all the hype and more! Some of the places people recommend end up being let downs, but Tartine is every good as people say. I'm quite skeptical of any sandwich that costs $8.25 but their Croque Monsieur is sooo worth it. I normally don't have much of a sweet tooth but I tried bits of their Devil's Food Cake, the Lemon Almond Poundcake, and the Banana Cream Tart and they all tasted scrumptious without the danger of being sickeningly sweet like some other bakeries. Here's to the hope that one day I get up early enough (or stay up late enough) to drop in for their infamous morning bun and croissants.

After listening to my roommate talk this place up the entire bus ride there, I was pretty excited to try the oh so famous morning bun. But we got there around 2pm, and apparently the morning buns sell out quick, like, in the morning... So instead I went with the Gougere which was actually pretty good. I think I was a bit underwhelmed because of missing out on the famous morning bun and instead going for something not so sweet, but I'd get this again. Tartine itself is a sight to be had. Its a cute bakery jammed packed with people. No kidding, we waited in a line around the corner for more than 20 minutes before we got to the counter and found out we had missed out on the mourning buns. But I'm giving this place 4 starts anyways because the Gougere was pretty good, everything in this place looked amazingly delicious, and people obviously love this place. Can't wait to get back some other time (in the morning) so I can taste the deliciousness my roommate wouldn't stop talking about.

My wife is a pastry Chef and has been raving about Tartine for well over a year now.   We tried to stop in a couple of months ago but the place was insanely packed, so we moved on...   Then last Saturday we had to pick up my sister in law at SFO so we decided to wake up early and drive into the City for breakfast at Tartine.  This time, my wife said, our plans would not be derailed. Sure enough, ther place was packed just like last time.  I dropped her off and drove around the corner to get a parking spot.   I showed up 10 minutes later and she was still in line.   We both waited patiently another 15 minutes before we were finally served, so the wait on Saturday morning was about 25 minutes... this is just FYI, though I'm not claiming this to be a scientific survey...   Anyway, moving on... I ordered the Croque Monsieur and my wife got a sandwich with asparagus and bechamel sauce.   She also bought us a bunch of treats and snacks to take home, including a couple of large chocolate chip cookies, an eclair, and an olive loaf. I was totally not impressed with the Croque Monsieur and in fact only ate about 4 bites of it...  Look, I realize this is SF and all but can y'all find some other bread than the Sourdough?   I don't know what the fascination is with Sourdough but it tastes like acidic toilet water to me...  Perhaps that's just my French genes showing through...   Anyway if I had to grade Tartine on the Croque Monsieur alone, they'd be getting a big fat 2 stars. The Eclair, which I tasted later, was pretty good with a nice coat of rich dark chocolate.   It was a good solid 4 star Eclair though it is easily eclipsed by the Eclair at Bouchon Bakery in Yountville, in my humble opinion. The Chocolate Chip cookie is 3 stars, but I'm rounding up the total to 4 stars since my wife likes this place so much... I'm not sure why since her pastries are far superior (in my not so humble opinion) and I know for sure that Bouchon Bakery takes this place to the cleaners...   Still, it's trendy and it's in the City, so I suppose that buys you some support...   My wife digs it and I thought it was decent...  Not sure I'd come back, though of course I probably will since you know the motto, right?  Happy wife, happy life.  ;)

This is the perfect French bakery, and I wish I lived closer to it to take advantage of its delights on a more regular basis. Because if you are driving and parking there, um, good luck. Still, it's worth it. I suggest Tartine as the perfect brunch spot, because it satisfies the sweet and savory cravings in every way imaginable. The brioche bread pudding topped with fruit is outstanding (do the right thing and just get the cup, not the bowl - trust me). And the double pain au chocolat (this is why you just get a cup of the bread pudding) is the best in the city. You know how every other chocolate croissant here has the chocolate chips in it, all hard and not melty and buttery (with the exception of Boulange on Pine)? Yeah, so this is not one of those croissants. And double in size, it is. Tartine is at its best on a warm day like yesterday when I was there, since you may be standing in a line that goes out the door, and sitting outside not because you want to, but because you have to. That said, be patient, take a deep breath, and soak it all in. France without the attitude - bravo.

My friend and I stopped by here for brunch around noon on a Sunday and it was packed! I had heard wonderful things about their pastries so my friend ordered the banana cream tart and I got the fresh fruit tart with strawberries and a hot turkey sandwich. They handed us the tarts first and expected us to find a seat to wait for our sandwich. Luckily my friend scored some chairs outside and we ended up eating the tarts while waiting. They were dreamy and fabulous. The banana cream tart is just how it sounds and pretty heavy. The fresh fruit tart was light and airy and an explosion of fruitiness on the tongue. The only downside was that it was hard to find a place to sit and they forgot about our sandwich which they finally got around to serving us when I asked somebody about it. The sandwich was really good though and my friend and I could only eat 2/3 of it. Luckily my boyfriend showed up and finished it off. The service was friendly and you are supposed to bus your own tables but I couldn't figure out where the bussing station was. Inside the restaurant was so crowded it was almost impossible to navigate around looking for it so I gave up and left my dishes on the table outside. Forgive me!

First time coming here - the environment is nice. People are lining up already on a Sunday morning.  I wait longer as a friend is coming late, and observe the lines go.  The line from the end of the first bench outside to getting your card/baked good only takes about 15-20 minutes. Not bad at all. Space eating here - good luck.  Better just take it to go and eat in Dolores Park, cause people need to be vultures when taking a table. Including me, the newb.  Sorry guy who was waiting before me...I didn't realize you were waiting for a table (you had no ticket nor food in hand!). I wanted a pressed Sandwich. You start that at noon.  I was sad.  Please, please do the sandwiches earlier on weekends. I'd give you the extra star for that. And getting extra tables outside please! My Shitake open faced sandwich was YUMMY though. A little over priced, but well worth it.  It came with Asparagus and the yummiest carrots on the side...the carrots were very sour with vinegar. YUM.  Next time I will try a tart... Side note - you have to bus your own table. Please do. It saves the people working there time and they can get to serving other people more! I found out when my friend told me to bus it myself, but I noticed that a LOT of people didn't.

hands down  my favorite pâtisserie in the city .I cant go there and not order a banana cream tart. The coffee is also brilliant- however make sure you order a double shot if you actually like your coffee to taste like coffee. the chocolate souffle cake is amazing also- made with scharffenberger chocolate

I stood in line with my mom on Sunday morning to try some Tartine pastries for the first time...My dad and my husband had to go find parking while we got behind the line. Luckily it was not as long as I expected...maybe 15 mins? Yay for making quick work of whittling down the orders. I got a few items... Chocolate Hazelnut tart Banana tea cake Frangipane (almond) croissant for my momma chocolate chip cookie for my husband nothing for my dad...avoiding sweets I get why people go stand in line now...

With top rating over fifteen hundred plus reviews, Tartine Bakery needs not my affirmation of its status as possibly the best breakfast / bakery in the entire country. This place is simply the best. You need not read this review to know what to order. Everything is great. Looking around the packed house will tell you the local favorites. Asking the helpful staff will get you the inside scoop on what's tasty today. Our venture started on a Friday morning at 11am, explicitly chosen to avoid the notorious Disney-ish lines. Nonetheless, the wait was well over 30 minutes with the queue out the door and past two store fronts. Mind you, this is in the middle of a work day. I cringe at the thought of the wait on a weekend morning. One patron even had her airline bags with her; whether it was a last taste of paradise or the first stop of the addicted, it was clear to see the zealotry that Tartine inspires. And it did not disappoint. We ordered pretty much everything: éclair, banana cream, hazelnut chocolate, coconut cream, breakfast pastry, open face sandwich, bread pudding, and ham croissant. Everything was awesome. Perfectly textured; incredibly balanced (not too sweet, not watery); beautiful presentation, hats off to Tartine for getting it perfect. I'm not a huge desert fan, but even I can appreciate a masterpiece. This place is a must try.

OVERRATED. Maybe I hyped myself up too much and had really high expectations, but then again the 3 other people that were with me on this eating adventure thought Tartine was a let down as well...but maybe we ordered the wrong things? Definitely not worth waiting in line for...if you are craving something sweet its more worth it to walk a block down and wait in line for Bi-Rite Creamery if you ask me. I wasn't in the mood for anything super sweet, so it was a total let down when the woman told me they had no more croissants...so in a rushed decision I ordered the bread pudding and a cappuccino.  First off, the bread pudding was not even warm! it was room temperature, disgusting! and to my dislike it was really wet, mushy and custardy...I like bread pudding on the dry side (more like a crumble consistency, which is probably not how its supposed to be made, but everyone has different tastes) The cappuccino was nothing exciting either.   My other friends got some kind of almond paste/berry tart, bread pudding, chai latte, and lemon tart.  Originally my friend that ordered the bread pudding as well wanted to get the Banana Cream Tart, but of course, they didn't have any. Of the tarts, the lemon tart was decent, but nothing I would go back for.

Had to update (not that Tartine needs more glowing endorsements)... got there at opening on Saturday and ohhhhhhh the morning rolls were so delicious! I still don't understand how you can get there at opening and then be asked to wait ten plus minutes for the morning rolls to come out of the oven (it's like...you're a bakery and you know everyone who comes in that early is going to want one of those things!) but no matter what, when they're on, they're on. And ohhh it's so good. I've also decided that their best bread pudding flavor is the nectarine-raspberry one. Enough tartness to cut the sugary goodness. Oh Tartine, if only you were calorie free!

Oh joy! Baked goods galore! It was my first time, and I think I went a little overboard. I got the morning bun, the berry bread pudding, and chocolate hazelnut tart while my friend got the spicy smoked turkey sandwich. Here's the breakdown: -morning bun: sugary, lemony, buttery bliss but slightly burnt on the edges -bread pudding: wonderful, especially fun to eat in the little teacup -chocolate hazelnut tart: "the tart to chocolate ratio was a little off" -spicy smoked turkey sandwich: love the bread, a little too cheesy, perfect pesto-ness, burnt crust= :(....and what do we make of the pickled boiled carrot?! nonsense. Overall, quite scrumptious. Next time we go, we're gonna go for the banana cream tart, quiche, and cheese bread thing, and the fruit torte. Then I'll be able to bump up my review to 5 stars! A perfect way to spend a warm, sunny Thursday afternoon!

A local took me and her mother here for breakfast today (Black Friday). I was dismayed to see the long line outside the door (guess a lot of people took off work today), but also relieved in knowing that long lines are a good sign. While you wait, you can watch the cooks mixing a huge bowl of several sticks of butter, or gaze at a pitcher full of eggs. When you finally get inside, your eyes gaze at the impressive display of organic, local and fresh pastries and cakes. We had gotten the croissant (it was half the size of my head, and the best one I've had my whole life), a ham and cheese croissant (amazing!), a morning bun (perfect chewiness with sweetness from sugar? and cinnamon), a charred swiss quiche (perfectly silky eggs with just the right amount of cheese), ham quiche (delicious!) and coffee. It was a grand breakfast, and I will definitely visit them again. Seeing as most, if not all, ingredients are organic, I was pleasantly surprised at the cost of the food. Really, it's no more expensive than Starbucks food, but this is so much more tasty and filling!! 5 Stars!!

The morning after my Gary Danko birthday meal we headed to Tartine for a quick bite before heading back to San Jose. We were unfamiliar with this part of town so we were not sure of the location but as soon as we saw the line we figured we had found it. It's much smaller than I expected. We ended up getting the apple bread pudding and the Croque monsieur which was cheesy, hammy ,tomatoey goodness on top of a thick, crusty, scrumptious slice of bread. The pudding was just ok the Croque was delish. I wish we had a bigger appetite. I gotta come back to try the huge morning buns and the croissants. Warning: the cute carrots that came with the Croque were damn hot!

Holy crap, i did not know there is 1800+ reviews already.   My four stars is solely for the bread pudding- definitely the best I've ever had.  The texture is custard-like and the bread is not soggy.  I drove an hour+ this weekend to get some.  Since the fruit toppings are seasonal, it was bananas this time- nothing too exciting.  It's so much better with fresh berries in the summer time!  Can't wait for the warm weather and some fruity bread pudding!

I had my first taste of Tartine bakery and know that next time I'm in the San Fran/mission area I'll definitely be back. The pastries were so good that I know without a doubt that I'll make it a point to come back. The bread pudding was amazing, perfect custard to bread ration with a little more custard =]. I could have done without the apples (the seasonal fruit) but they didn't stop me from scarfing/savoring every bite of the bread pudding. We also got the banana cream tart...all I can say is with fresh bananas, a thin layer of caramel over the chocolate covered tart base how can you go wrong? Sweets treats at Dolores park with the sun shining down made for a great Friday afternoon.

***** REVIEW FOR THE MORNING BUN ONLY ***** 4.5 Stars ***** I saw this on 7x7's The Big Eat SF and I had no idea what it was. Then I heard my friend talking about it and that sparked my interest even more. She wanted to try it but the day that she came, Tartine Bakery ran out. =( When I first got to the bakery, I saw a line of people waiting outside. Possible good sign??? Sure was! While walking to the bakery, I could smell the sweet aroma dancing in the air. Haha.. I'm such a dork. I know. Anyhow, I didn't get to read the reviews and wasn't sure what to order so I ordered just the Morning Bun. My first initial impression.. that's it??? This little thing for $3.75??? Can you blame me for thinking that?! Well, I took my first bite.. ouch! I bit the outer part and it was a little hard, but after I got through the first layer, OMG!!!! I was in heaven! I'm serious!!! The Morning Bun, to me of course, is like a combination of a cinnamon roll and croissant with a hint of orange. It was sweet, soft, and was slightly caramelized on top. I definitely suggest this to anyone who enjoys a sweet, light bun in the morning. I'll definitely come back to try the other stuff.. enjoy!

My favorite is the morning bun, a touch of orange in a swirl of gooey fresh pastry. All of the pastries are delicious really, buttery and light. I also like to get a small lemon cream tart or hazelnut chocolate tart to supplement my breakfast pastry. Finding parking in the Mission district is very difficult. And then there's the 15-20 minute line to order on the weekends. There are very few tables, but Dolores Park is a short walk away on a nice day. All this difficulty is worth it though.

Tartine is the model of what all coffeeshops that serve French pastries should aspire to be like. Except they should aspire to make the place a little bigger to accommodate their guests. This place is popular and it's always crowded but luckily the line moves rather quickly and it's always worth the wait. The coffee and pastries are above par. I just wish that they would let you order after you've seen all of the selections. I asked for a hazelnut biscotti before I saw that they had morning buns. I exchanged the biscotti for the morning bun when I got to the register and they did not make a fuss over it. I didn't get to try their coffee for health reasons but I ordered plain old steamed milk. The barista forgot my order but my friend was nice enough to remind him and it was served up in no time. Our wait wasn't too long and luckily we were taking our order to go because there was nowhere to sit. The morning bun with warm milk was delicious. My friend enjoyed her double latte and croissant that she always gets when she comes to town. I had a bite and I'd say they're the best I've had outside of Paris.

Their sandwiches are so delicious...perfectly crispy from the press...great balance of flavors...mmm.... I'm an avid fan of morning buns.  So I was very excited to try the infamous one from Tartine.  I gotta say, it was good...the sugary sticky center with a hint of orange was a nice twist.  However...I prefer La Farine's.  I think theirs are more light, buttery, and cinnamon-y.  Personal preference.

I've decided that I must open a bakery. This place is making a KILLING off of some eggs, sugar, and flour. Of course I'm kidding - this place serves up a ton of exquisite pastries that I know require a lot of skill, time, and TLC. I think if you want a good selection of items, you have to go at the buttcrack of dawn or something. I dragged my husband here ("You want to go all the way there to try some bread?!?"), and was sadly disappointed that they were out of almond croissants - the one thing that i desperately wanted to try. Sigh. Instead, I picked up a gougere (a gruyere cheese bread ball), a banana cream tart, and a lemon tart. The gougere was good, with a slight peppery taste - the husband thought it was interesting. The banana cream was good, but not great - more of a very mild taste. The lemon tart had quite a kick to it! It was good, and my sister demolished it quickly. Now... is this place good? Why yes. I would love to try their sandwiches and paninis. Is it worth it? Uhm, I dunno. There are a lot of bakeries that are good and cheaper (hello, 85*C, anyone?); BUT i guess you have to pay for the ambiance, not to mention a little bit of snotty service (yes, some of the girls here need to take the stick out - of course i can't hear what you are whispering when the music is freakin loud!) Would I come back? probably. I'm a sucker for baked goods. Plus, I need to try those freakin' almond croissants.

We were tempted to try a sandwich here but it's so damn expensive! I dropped $15 easy on a coconut cream tart, a slice of devil's food cake, and a masala chai. WOW. BUT, it was totally worth it. I don't know when I'll ever be back, now I'm regretting not getting a sandwich (although to be fair, we also weren't hungry whatsoever) The devil's food cake was made with Valrhona chocolate and was rich and deeply thick. It lasted me two days. I'd eat a layer every few hours and savor it. I love a good chocolate cake, and this one... I'd like to be thrown in the middle of a giant slice and be forced to eat my way out, mm. The coconut cream tart was also way better than I thought it was going to be, considering I don't like coconut desserts. It had an awesome shell of dark chocolate on the inside and caramel. So. Damn. Good.

It was 81F in the city today and instead of beach bumming, I had to finish a paper. I looked at my bookmark list and saw Tartine. Might as well head over, do some writing and check off a bookmark. There were a few other customers also studying and unfortunately there were no plugs in the dining area. No more laptopping at Tartine, I guess. But I will come back to read and have more of the coconut passionfruit cake I had. It was amazing! The thing was covered in shaved coconut and the passion fruit flavor was just right. I can't believe I ate the whole thing! I'll be back to try some items from their lunch menu!

Tartine has the charm and upscale feel of a Brentwood or Westwood, LA cafe- without the pretentiousness. Located on a busy corner, Tartine is so well-known it does not even need a sign outside. The line was out the door with families on Saturday brunch, hipsters, and the local flavor. When you finally get inside you realize this place is tiny- with a few tables and seating outside (luckily Dolores Park is nearby). The line serpentined between tables and the display cases holding the most delectable looking pastries and cookies the size of a plate. There was not much decor that gave this place a theme or "feel". Me and two girlfriends shared 2 paninis: provolone and spicy turkey ($13 each). Expensive for a panini you would think until you see that they are cut into threes and we were barely able to finish all of it. The sandwiches were a bit oily, but SOOOO crunchy and delicious. The broccoli pesto on the spicy turkey (which was not spicy at all) was marvelous and a new twist on your everyday pesto. DO NOT eat the carrots that come with the paninis....it was disgusting. My friends did not believe me and each took a bite and made the same face. Expected a good wait in line (you got plenty of time to be tempted by the baked goods), a wait to get your food, and to bus your own tables - cuz they are WAY too busy to do it for you.

There was a line out the door waiting for the bakery to open up at 9AM on Sunday. The line moved quickly and we got a glimpse of the backroom... very industrial. The pastries are about $7 each but well worth it. I got the banana cream tart which was one of the best pastries I have ever tasted. The whipped cream is so light and creamy, kind of like high grade Cool Whip and the the bananas and cream were perfect. The thick crust was coated with dark chocolate on the inside and there were huge chunks of shaved chocolate. I also got the bread putting which they spoon for your with fresh fruit on top. That was okay. It was too soaked for my liking. My sister got a morning bun which was good and my sister got the almond croissant which was very crusty and hard. For the true SF experience, you must come!

After having brunch at Bar Tartine, I had to make a pitstop here to their bakery.  It was just a few blocks down.  Better to walk than to deal with parking.   Of course, there was a line out the door when we arrived.  The aroma of the bread was so addicting.  I kept inhaling the smell and I couldn't wait to order!   We heard about their banana cream tart, but I didn't get it since I'm not a fan of bananas.  Instead, I got their morning bun, chocolate croissant, and lemon poppy seed pound cake slice.  I believe they use Valrrhona chocolate for their croissants.  It was the best chocolate croissant I've ever had!  The croissant dough was not like any other.  Very crispy, light, yet crunchy.  The morning bun was tasty as well.  Simple, but flavorful.  It had a hint of orange zest.  7x7 magazine recently posted their Morning Bun recipe on their website too!

This place has no sign! And was out of banana creme tart when we were there :( Sad times. Fresh fruit tart (raspberry and blackberry) was extremely delicious. I think I finally found one that can rival La Patiserrie strawberry tart from Epcot in Disneyworld, Florida. =] And it's $6.50 a tart.

This place is awesome. We visited when on vacation in San Francisco and just had to have a chocolate croissant, or 5. You can tell that a place is good if there is ALWAYS a line! That happened to be the case here. The shop is small and when you are waiting in line at times it gets difficult to manuvre yourself out of the way for people that are leaving, sitting down, or trying to get by. I pretty much felt like i was constipating the whole walkway in between the tables, no doubt i was. But everyone was quite courteous and calm, so it was no big deal. It was worth it as the croissants were delicious, and the latte was really good as well. I saw several people eating the brioche bread pudding topped with fresh fruit and it made my mouth water, so i had to get some. It was delicious! Eggy, awesome, sweet, tasty, fruity.... IMHO it was even better than the chocolate croisant.

You must try the coconut creme tart!!! It is coconut creme on a chocolate and caramel lined tart crust.  The crust is hard to break open with a fork because of the layer of chocolate. But once you break it up, the creme, chocolate, caramel, and crust create a sweet explosion in your mouth! The line on a Sunday afternoon was just barely out the door, but it moved fairly quickly and luckily, we found a place to sit down to enjoy it. We also had the berry bread pudding in a cup, which had great texture.

Stopped by on our mission to get as many of 7x7s 50 sweets to eat before you die.  We got the lemon tart and it was fantastic!  Not too tart and that bloop of cream/meringue/crack on top made it heavenly! There wasn't much of a line - it was about 2:30 on a Monday.  We were in and out but those pressed sammies looked delish...next time!

Lemon bar was okay, tasted a little eggy. Beyond disappointed with the tres leches cake - wtf was that? It just tasted like whipping cream shoved between cake layers. There was no rich tres leches taste at all. Croissants are perfect. Honestly - the bakery is beautiful a great location but I think it's a bit over-hyped...yeah I said it.

This place is freaking expensive - $40 for two sandwiches, a slice of cake, and two lemonades. But given the over 2k reviews (we're talking an Ike's Place level of hysteria here) - I had to go regardless of the price. I love Tres Leches cake, and I have yet to find a place that can match my homemade version (based on http://icuban.com/food/t…) so I had to try Tartine Bakery's interpretation. But it was lunch time, and no matter how insane my sweet tooth, I needed something more substantial. So I also got a sandwich with Prosciutto and Provolone. What's the verdict? The Tres Leches cake was good, but still couldn't match my homemade version. I found the coconut milk and cajeta cheese additions quite innovative - but ultimately it did not have the milkiness and moistness I expect from a Tres Leches cake. The sandwiches were better. The bread is amazing, as was the cheese and all the other ingredients. There was more butter in the sandwich than in Paula Deen's kitchen, but god damn the end result was worth it. Furthermore, the sandwich was huge - it actually lasted me for 3 meals. And I'm not a light eater or anything. Ultimately, the food was quite good here. But I can't give it 5 stars due to the high prices, so I have to drop a star due to the fact that a lunch for two will cost you the price of a kidney.

O-Bah-Jesus this place is such a gem! Another wonderful and necessary asset to the 18th and Guerrero collection. Whether you're having their fresh baked breads, Croque Monsieur, or Banana Cream tart, you are in for a treat. It's a great place to sit down, if you can, and enjoy what's in front of you. Hands down, the BEST Banana Cream dessert you'll ever have. Writing this review is already making me miss it.   Quick tip: Sometimes the line can look intimidating but it's not that bad. Hang in there and get that Banana Creme Tart! Also I heard you can make reservations for their bread online so you can skip the wait.

Over 2000 reviews already, but... just in case you happen to randomly stumble upon mine: Lucked out and stayed at a place literally around the corner one weekend in September.  Came on a Monday morning and avoided the weekend hoards. My friend got the quiche, but I still prefer real eggs (with white toast, bacon, sausages, and fresh OJ).  Speaking of which, their real OJ was spectacular, considering I was craving it all weekend (and Nob Hill Grille had let me down).  I got a buttermilk scone boxed to bring to a friend for breakfast, which he also thought was "bomb."  And I myself did not have an appetite, but didn't pass up the chance to finally try one of their items: the Mexican Wedding Cookie was f*cking fantastic, for real (how's the alliteration). If you hadn't heard, its a bit pricey here.  That little cookie was $0.85... Yea, don't go here grocery shopping (even though I heard the bread is amazing too).  I'd definitely come back to try more on the menu.

FABulous French Bakery that lives up to the hype. And is worth the line. Yes, I have found a bakery that I actually believe is worth the half hour line, in the scorching heat that took place that weekend I flew up. Everything they had was the real shit, from fruit tart to croissant and quiche to hot pressed sandwiches. I ordered a frangipane croissant with iced tea, and my friends had their quiche, jambon royale et gruyere, and berry tart. Everything was so damn good. My croissant, and I am quite picky about my croissants, was light, flaky, buttery in all the right places. The frangipane was well incorporated into the croissant itself, and it was well made. You wouldn't think that frangipane could be difficult to mess up, but trust me, you'd be wrong. I've had far to many disappointing frangipane tarts/croissants, so to find a bakery that could make it just right, was SUCH a relief. Now, this place is packed, so strategize if you are with a group of friends - take their orders while they hunt down an open table stake it out. Or else, you'll be standing with your plate of food, mingling by the counter for another half hour, and then your sandwich will get cold, and no one wants that.

So I left with a light wallet and a tight belt. Indeed, this place makes an array of super delicious and beautiful pastries and other baked goods. The prices are pretty darn high though. I enjoyed: -bread pudding-- would have been even better if served warm! got too sweet after a few bites, but probably good with tea. -hazelnut torte-- light and less sweet than expected (a good thing) -quiche-- served hot and toasty; a bit heavy after a few bites. -chocolate croissant-- very flaky, good texture. We couldn't get seats (on Friday 1:30pm), so my friend and I sat outside on a bench. Would love to try their bread and a hot-pressed sandwich next time; but, I'll have to re-fill my wallet again before my next visit.

I have to rave about how great their desserts/pastry are!! I'd say it's one of the best in town! Venue: Cute semi-small place. there's seating outside. Service: Very casual. You basically line up and order, they give you a number, you go find your own seat, they bring food to you. Food: - Banana Cream Tart 4" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - $6.50 I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this tart!! It might be my most favorite tart in the whole world!!! *hint* to friends reading this, they also make a full size pie for this.*hint*  ;) The crust is perfectly flaky. The bananas are perfectly sweeten and not too sweet. The Whip cream on top is perfectly airy. And the ribbons of chocolate on top is a bonus! GET IT! - Lemon Cream Tart 4" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) $6.25 - This one is good also but might be a little too sweet for me. Still good though. - Muesli (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) $6.50 bowl - Toasted whole grains, whole-milk yogurt, fresh and dried organic fruits and toasted nuts. I know.. sounds too healthy.. I wasn't a fan of this one. - Croque Monsieur  $9.75 - Open face sandwich with béchamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper. Topped with either smoked Niman Ranch ham or seasonal vegetable. They make their sandwiches super crunchy here. Very good but also greasy. Price: A little pricier than some other places, but well worth it. Overall: I will come back very often just for the banana cream tart.

I had the Coconut Creme Tart and I am happy to report, I like it alot! It's the same concept as the small banana creme one which I have been avoiding. My 1st experience with Tartine was the Large Banana Tart and it was BAD! The crust was thick and rock hard. I am happy to say, just don't get the large one get the Small ones! The crust on the smaller ones are not as thick and hard. I love the chocolate and caramel in the middle,mmm.. I ordered a Americano, strong but not hot at all. My friend's latte was not hot either.

Every time I step in here, I can't walk out of here with less than a shopping bag full of World Class Baked goods here!!! This time I end up with 3 Coconut Cream Tart ( they ran out of my fave Banana Cream Tart), a small Tres Leches Cake and 2 loafs of corn bread for stuffing for Thanksgiving. Everything was devour the next day and smiles all around. Possibly one of the Best Croissants outside of Paris in the Bay Area ?? I had quite a few in Paris myself... p.s. This was Carl's Bakery back in the day, as I remember, the Best sheet cake during the 70's!!!

Things to know when you get to Tartine: "Croque" is pronounced like "croak". It might be 10 am, but it's perfectly acceptable to order a piece of the coconut and passion fruit cream cake (seriously divine). You're going to wait in a shitty line regardless of the day and time. Comes with the territory. This is not the place to set up shop and read a book or work on a paper. Even though I saw people doing this, it just looked uncomfortable. Plus, there is little seating provided to begin with, so those who are sitting around pecking away at a croissant for two hours to give reason for their loitering are just being a-holes. Related to the last point, people will stare at you like hawks willing for you to finish your food and leave your table. Again, it is tight and cramped up in here, and while some people do order to go, it seems like the majority want to stay. Know what you want by the time someone takes your order, otherwise you're again being an a-hole and distressing the rest of those waiting in line. It's kind of pricey, but what's new in the world of gourmet sandwich and pastry shops. You bus your own tableware when you're finished, and there are bins on a rack behind the register counter where you place them. That's all I can think of for now. Everything looked good, but I decided on the mushroom croque, which was like an open faced sandwich, and a slice of the aforementioned coconut cake. Both were solid. It was a 16 dollar breakfast, which wasn't the most cost effective, but you know, when in Rome.

Pickled. Baby. Carrots. At such a renowned bakery, you'd expect the springy, moist, flavorful bread pudding to steal the show. Or maybe the morning bun... a deliciously fluffy and sweet non-sticky version of a sticky bun. Or even the crisp-on-the-outside soft-on-the-inside country style bread that the pressed sandwich came with. Heck, even the Mustard, Ham and Gruyere should come first in taking the proverbial cake. But it was the pickled baby carrots and its touch of acid to counteract the buttery, salty sandwich that really made my meal. Dainty in size and delicate in its soft crunch, this physically small yet epically important morsel of food made a brunch that was already one of the best in recent memory THAT much more enjoyable and THAT much closer to being perfect. 5 stars for, well you should know by now Revisit? A resounding yes!

4 stars solely based on the Banana Cream Tart. I was really surprised to see that there was already a long line out the door on an early Sunday morning, day after Christmas.  I guess everyone had the same thought, since we are already gorging for the holidays, why not a little bit more?   The morning bun was crispy on the outside but really soft on the inside.  It was buttery good but the main star of the event was definitely the banana cream tart.  A crust that is coated in dark chocolate is quite flaky once you are able to slice through it's hard outer shell.  This tart is filled with fresh sliced bananas and lightly sweetened pastry cream.  To top it off, there is a layer of caramel cream and shaved chocolate.  So light, so fluffy, so creamy, and a perfectly balanced amount of sweetness.   All in all, It took us exactly 45 minutes from the moment we stood in line, ordered, paid, and got our tarts, morning buns, and caffeine to go.  It is a bit of a hustle and bustle here at Tartine Bakery.  I'm not sold on the long line here just for some pastries.  The tart was definitely good but not worth the wait.  If for some miraculous reason I drove by and there was no wait, I would do a tuck and roll out of my car into Tartine's and get some!

I mean, the other 2,000 reviews are correct - they make amazing things.   My recommendations: the bread pudding is a relatively inexpensive bowl of amazing - get a large, and eat it while lounging in Delores Park.   The hot sandwiches are incredible, but (And?) terrible for you.  Don't assume that they don't do savory - they do it well. The 5th star is missing because I think the hype and line contributes to a bit of a price premium over other great / amazing bakeries - the food on it's own is clearly 5 stars.

Breads are not usually in my breakfast repertoire, but I had to go to Tartine Bakery for popularity's sake.  As a Yelper, how could I not go to a place with 2500 reviews? I would usually only go to a bakery for a very savory breakfast item, but in this case, they only sold some pastries and other baked goods.  Might as well eat what they do best. Oh man, the gougere was out of this world.  According to some research that I did, a gougere is a French choux-style pastry with cheese mixed in.  It was flaky, rich in Gruyere flavor, peppery, and light.  It was the perfect piece of baked flour, butter, and eggs. The quiche was pretty good.  It was flavorful, moist, and the crust was flaky and rich.  It did not have the typical quiche denseness, as it was a bit more refined. The bread pudding was alright.  It was very moist and sweet and had some fresh pears and blueberries, but it was sort of plain.  The syrup was nothing special, and the brioche was somewhat boring. If you come here, expect a line or no place to sit, but the pastries are worth the wait here.  They bake bread here, and bread you shall eat.

love this place!  being a pastry chef myself, I definitely want to open a place like this.  I love this that much I bought their book on the first month it came out.  :o) their banana cream tarts, open-face sandwiches and cookies were all good.  I also have to mention their croissants, bread pudding and choc cake were all great! okay, so they're a bit pricey but definitely worth it. I also told people who want to try this place to make sure they have a lot of time to spend... line is always long, parking is hard and place can be crowded... coz they're that good.

I've eaten at Tartine many times in several lengthy visits to San Francisco, and overall, I would say that there are extreme highs and extreme lows to the overall experience.  Their croissants and morning buns are stellar. The banana cream pie has been ethereal (but on a second tasting, it had a leaden, tough pastry), and I've had a handful of other great items from the bakery. The bad: a meusli that clearly contained nuts that had gone off, a bread pudding that was overcooked and gummy, the fore-mentioned dense crust of a banana cream pie, an INCREDIBLY ungenerous slice of tres leches cake (which was otherwise delicious, but was perhaps an inch wide in a to go box), weak coffee, and, dare I say it, an improperly baked loaf of their famously coveted, difficult to acquire loaf of a rye boule.  I am a baker, and it was clear that they hadn't proofed the bread long enough, so it was flat, had no oven spring, and was a leaden brick both in weight and in taste. The worst: the STAFF! Holy cow, is this an entitled bunch! Some are pleasant enough, but seriously, if they could be bothered to work a little faster, it might be a bit less of a drag to be there for everyone.  They seem to have no interest in being there, much less actually doing their jobs, and my lord they are irritating to watch as they slough to and fro.  Seriously, I know you work in a very popular place, but how about a little get up and go, girls?   Is Tartine a great neighborhood bakery? Yes it is.  But I probably would tire of the staff, the prices, the lack of generosity and the bakery in general if we lived here.  Visit, but don't worship - it ain't all that.

Wow, what a gorgeous little place, wow just another reason to love SF. I'm pretty sure the morning bun was on the Best Eats list for SF and obviously I'm going to have to try it! There was a line that went out the door, but I was told it'd be worth it. Yes everyone, the famous morning bun of legends was quite the treat! Coupled with a good cup of ol' joe it made for a fantastic morning. My other friends got two kinds of quiche of which I cannot remember but they were definitely delectable because there was barely any crumbs left afterwards. We had to sit in a big community-style table but that wasn't too bad. Not to mention the great and  friendly customer service here, I am in love. If you're in the area, hit this place up. You will not be disappointed.

As a pastry lover, I had to check or Tartine when I was in SF after reading the reviews.   I actually tried a bunch of stuff: morning bun, daily bread pudding, fragipane croissant, pain au chocolate, and the creme pie.  I've got to say, some of the best pastries I've ever had.  You can tell everything is fresh, but good God, this stuff is just awesome.  I will say that the bread pudding that I had was my least favorite of the bunch, but I'll give them a pass on that as I freakin' died when I tried the pastries.   If I lived in San Fran, I'd probably gain 20 lbs by eating here all the time, but it might just be worth it. Anyhow, a definite breakfast spot you must try if you're in the area, but be warned that the lines are long during the breakfast hours, but you don't want to to wait to late before going else the pastries aren't as fresh... dilemma dilemma .... [Update - April 11, 2011] Came here the second time, and to my disappointment they didn't have the chocolate croissant or fragipane croissant. Instead, I tried their cookies, the fragapine tart and the some fruit cake/tart.  It wasn't as enjoyable as my first experience, both pastries weren't as good as the pastries I tried the first time, though the cookie had a nice texture and crunch to it.

The last time I was here, I was disappointed because everything I wanted was gone. I decided to come in the morning and to my surprise, all baked goods were available and the line wasn't out the door. I ended up trying the morning bun and the pain au chocolate. The morning buns are no joke. The first bite is like a fresh churro, crispy edges, and soft and warm in the inside. I was pretty overloaded with sugar after the morning bun, but I had to take a bite off the pain au chocolate while it's still fresh. It was so flaky and buttery, and oozing with chocolate. Amazing!!!  Pain au chocolate has to be my favorite pastry and I think I found the best ever at Tartine's.

I love this place, but really the lines are just ridiculous! Came here on a Saturday morning (I know right...my own fault), and stood in line for almost an hour just to get my morning fix. You litearly move like two spots every ten minutes, which is not a lot. But onto the good news. The food here is worth the long wait. Had a morning bun, an amazing macchiato, and the open faced sandwhich with ham. It did suck a bit to get to the counter and order, only to have them tell me I'd have to wait another ten minutes at a table for the sandwhich to arrive as it was still coming out of the oven. The morning bun is going to be my returning favorite though. Not too heavy,  not overly sweet, with an amazing pastry dough, crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy inside. The open faced sandwhich was amazing too, with this small pickled carrot on the side which adds a lot of depth and flavor to everything. My advice, if you plan on comming here on the weekend, either arrive early, or arrive later so they serve their actual pressed sandwhiches (after 11:30am only!).

I finally made it here!! Came here yesterday with my bf, despite the heavy rain. Actually, with the rain, the line was definitely shorter than we had both anticipated. =) By the time we got there, they were obviously out of their morning buns-- will have to hit this place up again for that...however we had the banana creme tart and it was really light and yummy!!! I normally don't like banana flavored sweets (I like my banana in their original form), but I knew I had to try because of the reviews. Boy, I'm glad we did because it was delicious! We also shared their Spicy Turkey Pesto sandwich.  I love hot/panini style sandwiches and this was not a disappointment either.  It was a huge portion, so grateful that we shared it! My bf also ordered their chocolate croissant. I had a bite of it this morning and it was still good! He loved it and said it was one of the best ones he's ever had. That speaks pretty highly since he's tried so many different kinds. He also got the chocolate hazalnut tart-- which we have yet to try. It looks good though! So glad we finally came here, definitely will come back whenever I can.

Saturday morning. Long line wrapped around the corner. Earful of neighboring complaints later, inside the warmer bakery, the much coveted, much raved, ever-beloved treats of Tartine are embraced. 3 morning buns 1 bread pudding 1 chocolate croissant 1 banana cream pie 3 cups of hot blue bottle coffee Lack of seating doesn't deter any loyal patrons away from this popular spot. Quaint decor with seating well bombarding the lines of personal space, the window bar was the only vacant spot for 3. Lucky for us, it gave more space to share the carbohydrate indulgence, bad for the salivary glands waiting in line watching us feast.

Thank god I don't live any where close to this place because I would honestly be 400 lbs!  This place has the most delicious ham and cheese croissants ever!  I could have eaten the entire thing myself but had to share in order to try their other delicious items.  So first things first, get your hands on one of those.   Secondly, get your hands on the herb and gruyere puffed croissant (savory and delicious) a chocolate or almond croissant and the morning bun.  OMG I was in heaven.  It was a bakery buyers own little piece of heaven!   One thing to note is to get there early, they sell out of their hot commodities fast!

One of the best handcrafted-pastry shop in the city. I think their croissants are hands-down the best I've tried so far. The chocolate croissant is excellent! I like some of their cookies too, like the Mexican Wedding cookies and Rochers, for example. Once in a lucky while, they'll have a vegetarian croque monsieur with mix seasonal mushrooms, which is really tasty. Sometimes I like their bread pudding (although I find it to be a little bit on the overly sweet side, otherwise, it's really generous, fresh and moist, just how a bread pudding should be!) Their Banana cream pie and Frangipane Tart are also the duo that no one should miss! Everything here is almost perfect, just prepare yourself to join the parade of people in line to get their dolci or to wait for tables. So, stop reading these reviews, get your ass moving! Tartine is waiting!

This place was suggested to me by a coworker who gave it high ratings. I was having an all out girl day with my best friend who was visiting from out of town so, upon suggestion from my coworker I decided to take her here for lunch and dessert. It was VERY busy on a Monday afternoon around 1PM, but standing in line gave us time to look over the menu. We grabbed two chairs at a long table and settled in enjoying our Lemon Tart while waiting for our Sandwich. This lemon tart was amazing. It was a rich creaminess that was so silky on the tongue and I loved the fact that the whipped cream was not sweetened, it added a nice balance. Sandwich(s) were both amazing, and HUGE, I highly recommend the Mozzarella w/ Tapanade. Yummy.   The decor and general atmosphere was great. The service from the staff at the counter was friendly, warm and welcome evening in the hustle and busy of crunch time.   I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the area.

Delicious! I went in intending to try the goat cheese pressed sandwich but standing in line I saw something delicious go by and just had to have it. It was the Croque Monsieur that I tried. An open face sandwich with béchamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper and topped with ham, turkey or vegetables. I wanted the ham, but it was going to take an extra 15 minutes for the ham and I didn't want to make my friend wait so I got the turkey. It was incredible. The bread is sliced thick and toasted to a perfect crunch. The cheese goes well with the herbs and turkey. I finished off the entire thing. My friend had the Spicy Turkey which was almost as good. We tried the eclairs which were delicious. I don't always love eclairs because I am picky about the custard insides, but this one was well worth trying. My friend insisted that it was the best one she's ever had. The bakery itself was interesting. You get in line which usually wraps around the outside, order at the counter and get a number. Pretty basic right? Then you get your own silverware and water, again basic. It was the location of the silverware and water that was interesting. Its all on a rack behind the counter where you pay, right sort of in the kitchen. You also bus your own tables at the end and bring everything to bins right below the water pitchers. Very unique. Wonderful sandwiches and to die for pastries....you will see me there much more.

Was the masala chai good? Yes. Was the lemon tart delicious? No doubt. Will I travel all the way from berkeley to Mission st in SF just for it? Never! After viewing more than thousands of good reviews about this place,I was looking for a dessertgasm from this bakery.what a disappointment! Actually I am a bit worried if this is what people in SF think as the top bakery!? None of the dessert/tea I tried was bad,but I definitely had better ones,many times before! Maybe I should come in the morning to try the highly recommended buns? Maybe those buns do taste AMAZING!?! But well,even they do,I will not consider a bakery as the top one if it is just a one trick pony.

I have fond memories of Tartine - especially the chocolate pudding - but after living in New England for four years I have to say that I was underwhelmed upon returning last Sunday.  The line moved pretty fast but it took about 40 minutes for me to order something for a party I was attending in the South Bay. I settled on the frangipane tart (although I really wanted the coconut cream tart but the large has such creamy height that it didn't look like it would survive the car ride intact), but even after reheating folks weren't so impressed and were surprised it came from Tartine. I would say stick to the chocolate goods, and go for a break with friends when you're all working from home or something.  Otherwise, you might leave wondering whether the lightness in your wallet was worth it.

The gougere and croque monsieur are both delightful.  We also bought a friend a devil's food round cake (sweet, but maybe that's because I don't have a sweet tooth).  The almond croissant is also sweet.  This place has a lot of good stuff, but the wait is horrendous on weekends.  Sometimes I don't mind waiting (and it seems like a lot of reviewers don't either) but it's not just waiting.  It's packed both inside the cafe as well as on the streets in the Mission so you really have nowhere to go but get swarmed by a ton of people. Maybe it just bothers me because I don't have much of a sweet tooth and hate crowded places.

From what I've read, Tartine is the brainchild of a husband and wife pastry chef team and it's as solid as bakeries get in the city! I've been here twice and have had good experiences each time. Their pastries are awesome and so are the quiches. Light and fluffy just the way I like them. Some say that Tartine has become overrated over the years and I don't necessarily disagree. Although I must say that Tartine isn't at all a trend, the quality and effort that goes into all their goodies can be seen and tasted. With their upcoming restaurant expansion, Tartine will be around for a while and possibly become a household name. They worked hard for it! I'm excited to see what the new restaurant has to offers, read their book, and try out Bar Tartine one of these days!

Maybe I came too late... maybe all the good pastries were gone... but I ordered the Tres Leche Cake, while my friends ordered the bread pudding and the morning bun. The Tres Leche Cake was the best out of the three, but it was very very sweet. I couldn't get myself to finish all of it. It wasn't delicious enough for me to continue adding to the sweetness overload in my mouth. The bread pudding was really whatever to me, but my roommate liked it. The morning bun was also nothing special. Disappointed... but I'm willing to give this place another try.

Oh my God! You know that lame 70's song Feels Like the First Time. Well that's how I feel about Tartine's banana cream pie. The first bite is killer. Every time I purchase one, when I take my first bite, I just want it to be my first bite all over again. When it comes to timing, they can fall back a bit on their pressed sandwiches. We waited for a good 40 minutes. Had bought a piece of their olive / ham bread to tide us over - it was kinda strange. Wouldn't get it again. I'll always be back for more pastry though!

a friend took us here and i have never seen pieces of sandwich bread that big in my life. while we waited for the cheese/tapinade sandwich (which is a HUGE oily gourmet grilled cheese sandwich) we ate a cake that was gone in 5. melt in your mouth amazing. $14 sandwich, must be good. those words pretty much describe tartine. so what if i ate 2 days worth of calories in 1 sitting, it was worth it.

One of the few places I've been that lives up to the hype.  You can tell this by how crowded the place is. My friends ordered the bread pudding, the passionfruit cake, and other delicious goodies, which I unfortunately didn't get a chance to try.  Let me tell you, though, the Banana Cream Tart is out of this world. The tart is kind of difficult to eat because the crust is pretty hard, but the inside is filled with carmel and chocolate-y goodness. The cream is light and fluffy, just how it should be.   Recommendations: everything!

I've been to Tartine about 3 times now and that will be all folks. Maybe I ordered wrong? I should have gotten the croissants and bread pudding? Instead I tried the Banana tart, chocolate hazelnut tarte, eclair, geez what else- many of the pastries in the case... The crust and chocolate layer on the banana tart- is really HARD!  Your fork will need to STAB that sucker to get a chunk off! Took 2 bites of the chocolate hazelnut and it...well nothing, tossed it. Filling on the elair was bland. That was what was disappointing for me- nothing WOW-ed me. Everything looks soooo tantalizing, smells like the bakery gods made a perfume, the line is down the block, is there going to be a place to sit lala la la.....and it's just... fine.

The 5 stars are for the BANANA CREAM TART only! Because there really is something to be said about this amazing little pastry if: - it's the only thing I remember about this bakery, hence this review. - I had it more than two years ago and I still crave it from time to time. - I ask my friends to bring one back for me whenever they go to SF (I'm from San Diego). - I get sad when they don't follow through (which is always!). Next time I fly into the city, I'm taking a cab straight to Tartine and making up for lost time.

Ok, Ok, I admit it, I am a Francophile. Mmmmm orgasmically delicious Croissants and Fragipane Croissants only rivalled by those I had in France. Marvellous Pain au Chocolates and one of favs.... the little meringues aka Rochers with almonds. Good Cappuccinos too! MMMMMMmmmm Yummmy! Been going here since I moved to San Francisco 2 1/2 years ago and I have never not seen a line. There is no sign out front which is fine with me because if they did they there would probably be a longer line!

Super delish...but oh the line! I woke up super bright and early to see and taste what this place was all about. After waiting in line for an hour I looked at the menu and although I was super pleased all their ingredients were organic and local, I was a bit shocked by the price. However, the food more than made up for it. I got a croque monsuir with dried tomatoes (no ham for the veg.) and a pain au chocolat that filled me up for hours. I would definitely go back again but only if I'm patient enough to wait for the line to die down.

I'm wondering how come I'm giving them 3 stars, myself. Well, I've been hearing so much about this bakery that I was really excited when I tried it for the first time last year. After not having a great cupcake at Baked, I really wanted a good one. Tartine didn't have any the day I went so I went with a Mexican wedding cookie and a lemon tart. The cookie was way too dry. I liked my tart just fine though. My friend loved her nectarine and berry pudding. After all the hype, I felt kind of disappointed. True, it was better than Baked but my sweet tooth wasn't satisfied and around the corner I went to Bi-Rite. Note, the place is super busy, has a long line and it can be a pain to wait for a table.

Great pastries and cake, but I go for their completely over-the-top Croque Monsieur: a homey, reassuringly irregular mound of crisped cheese that you know has bread and either ham or shiitake mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes buried beneath. Both are delicious, a nice mix of crunch and softness. Hey, and coffee in a bowl!

Now this place... Absolutely fan-mother-flipping-tastic. The line is absolutely off the hook pretty much all day... but I would wait in it if it were double. Hands down, the best panini  I've EVER EVER had. They hit all the details right... enough olive oil in the bread (which was of the finest sourdough variety), grill marks not to light not too dark, prosciutto cut thick enough to feel substantial but not tough, and just the right amount of crispy vegetables and cheese to provide a refreshing mix of textures. ...and that's just the sandwich! The baked goods here were also incredible... I think we spent about $40 bucks on croissants, cookies, lemon tarts, etc. Everything that wasn't eaten was the next day's breakfast at the hotel!

The employees and bakers are hot.  AND they make the food which someone makes me hot.  I like that. Every year, I stalk tarine and see if its berry season yet so that I can stand in line and get a fresh raspberry tart. Most of the year they don't have them but they do have the best croissants in town. Im horrible at making decisions and am predominately an herbivore thus I generally stick to these two and dont feel guilty because they use quality/local ingredients.

Sad little story is that every time I want a almond croissant from TB, they run out or they look burnt... hmm I won-der. FOOD: * Lemon Tart - is perfect with whipped cream that's on top. The whipped cream cuts the tartness of the lemon curd. * Banana Cream Tart - is perfect again with its simple creamy custard smothering the slices of banana, and whipped cream smothering the entire top! * Devils Food Cake - bland * Berries with Bavarian Cream - was like a parfait AND it was to-die-for! (dramatic much... lol) DRINKS: * Latte - was smooth, just wish it was stronger. Almost bland. If you want tarts, cakes, and pastries that's not too rich/sweet Tartine Bakery is the place to go.

With so many great reviews, I figured I should try Tartine at least once.  So I ventured over there one Sunday afternoon and find a massive line at 3pm!  Ok, so a line out the door is somewhat encouraging, but not really that great when you're in the line.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, the setup of the place is not great.  Seemed somewhat disorganized, and very cramped. After what seemed like 20 or 30 minutes of waiting in line, I ordered a Prosciutto & Provolone Pressed Sandwich and a slice of Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian for dessert.  Let me just say the portions are huge!  The sandwich was definitely a size for sharing, and it was oozing with Provolone.  Personally I would've prefered less cheese, but overall a good sandwich.  The Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian was yummy, but not spectacular. Would I go again?  Maybe if I happen to be in the area, I will have to try the bread pudding, or grab another slice of cake, but I honestly don't think it's worth the wait.

The bread pudding is so money. I was in SF for a conference at the Moscone and was craving Tartine so bad that I commuted over during lunch for some pastries and bread pudding. Good thing it was a weekday so there was no line. Totally worth it. Tips: I'm going to carbo-load here next time I run Bay to Breakers.

My friends and I went to Tartine for brunch, and I was just a bit disappointed.  I had heard such great reviews, and I have a feeling I might've just ordered wrong. I got the peppered turkey breast sandwich with provolone and broccoli rabe pesto.  It was really heavy and oily, and it wasn't very flavorful.  I think there was a lot of provolone, and I couldn't taste the peppered turkey or the pesto. I did try a bite of my friend's morning bun, and it was really good!  It's just really, really sweet, so I'm glad I didn't order a whole one for myself. The bakery itself is really cute, and I love the neighborhood.  It gets pretty packed because it's so tiny, so it's not a great place to go with a larger group. I think I'm going to stick with the baked breakfast goods next time.

I've been here a couple of times now. The first time I went, they were out of morning buns. I tried an assortment of other pastries/foods including  the bread pudding, chocolate croissant, quiche, and pain au jambon. I thought everything was just OK. My second trip here I came extra early just to make sure to try the morning bun. In short, it's a 5-star pastry. You must eat it there while it's warm. Flaky and yet soft, it's a really sweet way to start your morning. I enjoy the citrus glaze on top as well for a bit of chew. This is pretty much all I will eat here, but it shoots Tartine up to a 4 star. Now if only Bi-rite was open early enough so I could get both..

4.5 stars....We came with my wife's friends, who are SF locals and know great spots.  Tightly packed, there is little seating and little room but the taste is big.  It is very cute and the breads and pastries are top notch.   But I think the savory stuff is just as good as the sweet....I recommend the Croque Monsieur and grilled cheese sandwiches.   You can eat healthier here if you want, but that is no fun, not for weekend brunch or for being on vacation.

Such a happy, bright place full of savory and sweet delectables. The quiche here is good, chocolate pudding is a must-have. So is their banana cream tart, bread pudding...basically anything that comes out of their oven =).

Ever since my company got me Tartine on my first day of work, i fell in love with it. I guess the only problem is the line is always too long when you can smell the deliciousness of the pastries but can't have them right away. I love their almond croissant, the crispiness of the outside and the soft sweet filling is just a perfect combination, although a few times I have been there they ran out of it. The bread pudding is also a must-have for me. Their change the seasonal fruit on top from time to time. It would be more to my taste though if it was less egg-y. Have also tried their banana cream tart, morning bun, quiche, chocolate eclair, apply puff and so on, all very good. It is a bit pricey and you have to wait for a bit long, but for pastry-lovers it is a worthwhile experience.

I have a love-hate relationship with Tartine. (Well mostly love, but I hate the crowds.) The pastries here are great. If you can wade through the crowd of locals and tourists and score a seat that isn't cluttered with people who forgot to bus their own table, you're in luck. Sitting outside on a warm, sunny afternoon with their Scharfenberger chocolate pudding is one of my favourite ways to spend an afternoon.

Amazing bakery and great brunch place! Bread pudding is lovely and many other pastries and cakes. Friend ordered a lovely passionfruit cake for her bday and it was DELICIOUS and tantalizing! Simply out-of-this-world! Expensive $4.95 per slice or 10-12 sliced cake at about $60-70! 3/10 Went with bf and ordered the passionfruit coconut cake by the slice and the banana bread pudding and I was a happy kid for the rest of the evening. :) Con: Not enough indoor seating/standing so we sat outside on metal seats and inhaled the desserts within minutes, it was 44 degrees out! Talk abt passion for dessert. Update: Tried the chocolate pudding/choco pot de creme in a container for $4.95 and it was really good, not super sweet but right texture and very chocolatey.

No real need to provide any more detail than the 800+ reviewers already for Tartine.

I'm going to hate on this place and I live in the Mission. Yes the chocolate croissant is great and everything else is good.  But its not orgasmic.  The line is ridiculously long all the time, especially on the weekends. Second, they always run out of stuff by the evening.  Tartine, you know you're popular, make more friggin food! And though it commands high quality ingredients, the place is expensive.  more than $3 for the croissant. Another overrated place that don't have business sense to make its operations more efficient.

I seem to only go to Tartine once a year, even though my friend lives above it. Could be the insane lines out the door past 2pm that keeps me away most of the time. Typically going for the quiche to-go, this time I was able to sit down and enjoy a nice ham croque monsieur to celebrate my best friend's move up from San Diego to the city. I couldn't talk the whole time. Face stuffed with croque. My banana creme tart is sinful and sitting in my fridge at the moment, since it was too much to finish in one sitting. I think I've gained 30 lbs. Fat and happy

How do I dignify this amazing gem with a review? I feel I am just not qualified to give an appropriate account of what one would experience here.... To start: yes the parking sucks and the line "looks" long. But the line moves fast and the second you are near the door any tension will melt away with that first inhalation of savory warm bakery air. It's truly an amazing place with a unique vibe that is hard to describe. Oh and the baked goods are ridiculous as well. I ordered a ham and cheese croissant for myself and bought a ton of baked goods for my fellow coworkers back at the office.  The ham and cheese croissant is the most amazing bread product I have ever consumed. This place blew me away for breakfast, I can't wait to try lunch!

You can smell the buttery deliciousness wafting out of this place from down the street!  It smells so good but you know it's gotta be sooo bad for you. I've been coming here on Sundays and the line is always out the door!  They always have multiple friendly employees working to help you out with your breakfast cravings.  The morning bun is my favorite thing here.  My sister favors the croissants but that morning bun is freakin delicious.  With a slight hint of orange, flaky and crunchy on the outside and soft and slightly gooey in the center, mmmmmmm. I've also tried all the different croissants - the almond one is probably my favorite of the bunch.  The ham and cheese croissant was too salty for me. I really should stop eating those morning buns...

It seems like a lot of (thousands) people love this place but my experience was not the best. I came here in the middle of the day (1:30 ish) on a Wednesday with 2 girlfriends for a small lunch/snack. So I got an open-faced sandwich which was really just a big slice of bread that had cheese and tomatoes and ham on top. Like a pizza but not. More like a toasted sandwich with one slice of bread (instead of two) on the bottom. The "sandwich" was not good. To be specific - the bread was too hard so it was hard to bite and when in my mouth it was cutting my lips and gums! There were not too much ham and the cheese was hard.... not soft. The reason being that this sandwich was probably made in the morning and have been sitting around getting old for hours before I ordered it. I don't know what I was thinking ordering a "sandwich" that I can point at behind a counter... it looked old when I pointed at it. Toasting it didn't make much of a difference, just warm but not hot. Surprisingly not hot because it took them 20 mins to get it to me... its not like they had to make it from scratch, they had to toast it! Very disappointed. Oh and seats are rare, you have to fight for it, or hover over someone as they eat and wait for them to leave. Weird. I will give this place another chance when I'm in the neighborhood again. Since sooo many people heart it. I will try the scone next time.

1000+ gleaming reviews can't be wrong: Tartine has been called the best bakery in the city/US/world by many a yelper and pro food writer. They aren't kidding about those scones and morning buns. Tartine is also a cool place to hang out and people watch if you don't mind the crowds.And they have this little community bulletin board that I think is a joke, whatever it's hilarious. A must for any visiting foodie or local looking for the best SF has to offer. PS. The best thing about those scones is the Devonshire cream and apricot jam that go on them.

EXCELLENT!   this bakery is awesome!  i had the muesli, an almond filled croissant to go, and a hot mocha with a shot of espresso and it was all so heavenly.  the muesli was perfect and fueled me for the entire half day - and the mocha...sigh.  wish i could have made it last longer.  if i'd known it was going to taste that great i would have ordered a larger sized cup.  note to self for next time.  buy extras for breakfast the rest of week! the service is fast, friendly and efficient - the cashier was so pleasant and kind she went out of her way to clear up the table for two so that my friend and i could have a seat.  that was very kind of her and it was super busy too.  the line at first may look intimidating but trust me it's well worth the wait.  don't forget to tip them at the cashier area either because they soo deserve it!

The guy working gave me the bread pudding I ordered FOR FREE since it was the end of the night. I warmed it up this morning and it's delicious. I guess it kinna makes up for the 20 minutes I drove around trying to find parking, but I hope to return someday.

Aw man, just thinking about my visit here makes me a bit sad. WHY? Because they were out of Morning Buns & the Banana Cream Tart by the time I arrived :( BUT, I was lucky enough to score a couple of the last Double Pain Au Chocolates left and mmhmm, it was amazing. Perfectly flakey & filled with chocolate, it totally cheered me up. We also ordered the house iced tea which was interesting, it had a note of ginger in it which was unexpected. I love Tartine's location-sitting outside on a Sunday afternoon was a perfect midday break. And I have totally learned my lesson, although I'll have to brave the lines, I'm willing to come early in the morning just to have a taste of the coveted Morning Buns. Don't wait til the afternoon to get your Tartine fix or else you might miss out on the best items! Major bummmer...

First, if you plan to park, bring a passenger to stake a place in line. I have been here several times after 10 am and it's always a 20 minute line. So if you drop someone off, it works out well...assumIng you find parking. But a consistently long line is always an indication of how good the grub is.  Whether morning pastries, lunch pressed sandwiches, or afternoon sweets, they are all incredible.  Personal favorites are the double pan au chocolate, daily fruit bread pudding and the spiced turkey Croque Monsieur. Get there really early to get the double pan (by 10 at the latest).

I've been to Tartine several times over the years and without fail, I always get the bread pudding (if you had told me as a kid that one of my favorite desserts would end up being soggy, sweet bread piled with fruit and soaked in its juices, I would probably have thrown up .. and then scoffed at you).  That is how good this place is (that it would make something that seemed so gross in my mind end up causing me to salivate everytime I think bread pudding). Anyways, the reason for this particular review is not even the bread pudding.  After YEARS of wanting to stop by for a fresh loaf of bread, I finally did it!  It's not easy to find myself in the Mission around 5pm but I had a half day at work and at around 4:30pm, I booked it over to Tartine.   Strangely, there was hardly any line but I struck up a conversation with the lady in front of me (who apparently drives up from the peninsula regularly to pick up bread here) and she gave me the scoop and what to get.  By the time we got the front, it was 4:50pm but the loaves were out of the oven and ready for the taking.  I got a loaf of country bread (and yes, a cup of raspberry bread pudding too) and immediately started ripping off strips (caution: I burned my finger the inside was so hot - be careful!) The crust is hard and thick but the inside is so airy and hot and makes for a perfect snack.  I quickly went over to Bi-Rite, picked up some camembert and had a delicious cheese sandwich over at Dolores Park.   Another experience to cross of the bucket list.  Yay!

3.5 stars. we stopped by here after seeing marvelous reviews. waited in line for 20 min like everyone else.... finally got to order:    +   orange morning bun -- apparently the must have is pretty good.. slightly crispy with sprinkling of sugar on top. liked the citrus-y flavor. it keeps pretty well for the whole day, too. =) perfect cuz we were walking around a lot & needed the calories.    +    pain au chocolat -- this thing is HUGE!! but unfortunately, it's dry and does not keep well. it also takes forever to get to the chocolate portion of the croissant. i prefer smaller croissants and while we did try to finish it.. it was just so dry that it ended up a quarter finished before being tossed. perhaps i had a bad one?    +   organic museli w/ strauss strained yogurt -- not memorable. museli texture & flavors got lost in the strained yogurt. yogurt texture was watery and thin. i liked that it's all organic .. but as a whole... it was okay (gave it to my portable trash can (hubby =P) who ate it all haha)    +   fresh bread pudding topped w/ sliced seasonal peaches -- this was the best thing cuz they were scooping out bread pudding fresh out of the kitchen. so that was a must have. it was actually really good with lots of egg texture and flavor, peaches and light glaze provided a subtle sweetness. (it looks more impressive as a dine in vs. take out). they serve four barrel coffee here too, just like proof bakery! parking is scarce ... but you if you snag one on the weekends, you're set (no limit on time)... which you'll need if you dine in cuz there is a LONG wait. dine-in is fairly crowded / noisy.. and the line to order is quite long (probably 15 minutes to get into the door). overall, pretty good... but i still like proof bakery (in atwater village) better. will there be a next time? maybe.. there are just too many yummy places to eat at in SF!

This bakery is totally overrated.  My friends and I were there last Sunday.  There was 8 of us.  None of the pastry that we ordered was good, they were all below average, so was the coffee.   Why was there such a long line waiting to get in?  My friends and I won't go back. This is another example of inaccuracy rating on yelp.

Been there plenty of times and never wrote a review yet, so here it is. Tartine is a great place with a variety of pastries and delicacies. When you come here either be ready to wait in a line that goes out the door or hope you get lucky and walk right into the shop. if you're with someone make sure to try to cop some seats before you finish ordering or else be prepared to stalk the next party you think is leaving because the place is pretty packed most of the time. The  best seats in the house I think are the outdoor ones. When I sit out there I feel like I'm in some place like Paris where you're enjoying your pastry while kicking back with the sun beaming down on you.. Anyways to the food.. the quiche's are awesome, their grilled sandwiches are yummy, and the espresso is so good, but my favorite thing when I go there is the bread pudding. It has a creamy smooth texture that tastes delicious and has a number of fruits that give it a delicate sweet and tart taste. I always order that every time I'm there. Tartine rocks!

The line is ridiculous, but it just goes to show you that we need more excellent bakeries in the area. You could open a tartine 2 across the street and it'd still be packed. We need more good pastries! Get with it people! Whenever I ever see a break in the crowd here, I stop and grab something delicious, because it really is that good. But I won't be waiting in that line. Oh yeah, I *highly* recommend the Frangipane Croissant, Bread Pudding, Croque Monsieur, Scones, all the cookies, and the fresh bread. I have never been dissapointed with any of the items though.

Tartine, I wanted to like you better than I do.  And I tried -- really I did!  But, to me, there is no there there as my old friend Gertrude would say. The first time I went I got the brioche bread pudding.  It tasted like an accident, I swear.  Not right.  We also got some sort of fruit tart thing (it's been over a year, so I don't remember what).  This also tasted like a mistake.  We couldn't find seating because of the mob scene of posers, so we were at home before we discovered the substandard taste.  What a disappointment. Despite that (after all can the hordes be wrong?  Maybe it's me!) I went back two or three times.  Everything was better, but not enough to make up for my first impression, or to make me willing to endure the "scene."   Sorry, Tartine.  You promise much that you end up not delivering.  I'm sad.

Feeling a bit of French nostalgia? The gougere (cheese puff pastry) and croissants (both chocolate and non-chocolate) are simply divine.     Pair either of these with an excellently prepared latte, and I'm in heaven. The food itself is worth the wait.   I only wish there was a little more dine-in seating.  As I muster the patience to eye where to sit, it is a necessary evil to revert to my "table vulture" college days, swooping in as quickly as humanly possible on any tables that happen to open up. For those of you who drive and are not sure you are French pastry enthusiasts, the requisite circling around the block to find parking then waiting in a line that starts out the door might not be your cup of tea (or coffee, if you'd rather).   But one visit might make you a Tartine convert for life.

I came in prepared for a long wait in line. There was no point of even thinking about getting a table since not even one person left while I was waiting. I didn't mind the wait though since I was able to sneak a peek at the bakers in the back. I was looking forward to trying a ham and cheese croissant, but they were out. It seemed like they were out of a lot of stuff. I ended up getting the spinach quiche instead, which ended up being a poor choice. It was a bit too gooey and bitter for my tastes. The crust was perfectly buttery and flaky though. I probably should've tried the Croque Monsueir. Maybe next time. The Scharffen Berger mocha was probably one of the best mochas I've ever had. So smooth and delicious, with a generous dollop of fresh whipped cream. I could practically feel the chocolate flowing through my arteries. For some ridiculous reason I did not get a coconut cream tart even though it was calling out my name. Instead I had an eclair which was fabulous. The custard could've been a little thicker though. The cashier that helped me was a doll. We had a nice little chat. I will definitely make the trip here again to try out some more goodies!

It is all great. My biggest decision is whether to get the quiche or the ham and cheese croissant in addition to my pan au chocolate.   One note, I actually don't mind standing in along the front window at the designated standing/eatiing area.  It is kinda fun for people watching, and it would be a good idea for you when you are hovering around my table.

Always delicious, never a disappointment. I am strictly speaking about the gastronomical gusto that Tartine packs in those amazing cakes (lemon meringue all the way around), bread pudding, quiches fit for kings and starving students, and paninis...however, the crowd could stand to lose a bit of that hipster-poseur-missionite-snobbery (yes, I said it, mission kids are snobs too) and just concentrate on eating that deliciousness that Tartine whips up. Solution? Close your eyes and enjoy the smells and tastes.

Tartine's display cases are not filled with the many assortments like you would see in a Parisian Bakery but don't let that discourage you.  Once you bite into any of their baked goods, you will think you are in France. My GF and I visited Tartine for the first time and these items ended up being our lunch and dinner.  Oh boy, was it good! 1 Banana Cream Tart 1 Rocher with Cocoa Nibs 1 Rocher with Almond 1 Almond Croissant 1 Gougere gruyere cheese and fresh herbs

Someway, somehow, we got a table here this sunny Saturday afternoon.  The food gods were smiling on us, or rather pitied my starving GF.  She had not eaten all day and was feeling antsy and faint. I reassured her it was worth the wait (to order).  I was sooooo right. The pressed sandwiches were crunchy and tasty.  But the desserts were outstanding!! All I got to say is: LEMON TART, biatches!!  Go get it, or anything that comes outta their oven. Worth the wait!! BEWARE:  The amount of cheese in their sandwiches have enough saturated fat to meet your recommended daily allowances for the next three days.

I was skeptical. All the accolades, the adulation, the superlatives. When the New York Times' Mark Bittman declared Tartine the BEST bakery in the entire U.S., I was agog. Surely you jest Mr. Bittman! But then I went to Tartine and was educated. Yeah it took forever to get the damned pastries (40 minutes!). And frankly, I'm not even that big on pastries, croissants and the like. But man, I'll be damned if those weren't the most delicious, flakiest croissants and rolls I've ever had in my life (I shudder to think of what the butter to flour ratio must be in their concoctions). Anyway, I've since converted to the Church of Tartine and will try to attend "services" on a weekly basis in the future...

My short-lived love affair with this place ended a while ago, and now the truth must be told.  After hearing about this place initially, I was very excited to try this out for the first time last year...and was not disappointed.  Their coffee was very good, and I sampled a couple of their pastries, which were good, but a little too sweet for my taste.  Of course others may feel differently. I went a few more times, waited in their super duper long lines and tried other items.  Was very unimpressed with their bread pudding. During my last trip I tried one of their tartines, and then it hit me.  Although the place is called "Tartine Bakery", their tartines don't even meet the grade.  Their bread, I hear, may be their saving grace, but the place thrives primarily because it is seen as a longstanding trendy locale.  From now on, I will only go if I happen to drive by and the line is short  and only order coffee.  I'll stick to my favorite tartine place located elsewhere in the city for both tartines and better quality and variety of pastries.

I am gonna add my 2 cents to the thousand reviews.  I love this place.  The panninis and quiche are delicious.  The croque monsieurs are good too even though they are not authentic.  The Scharffen Berger chocolate pudding is to die for.  If you love chocolate, you NEED to get this.  I usually get it in the to go cup because its so rich, I eat half of it and take the other half home.  The lemon bars are super tart, but I like them that way.  Bread pudding I can pass on...I've had way better, namely the one at Nordstrom Bistro Cafe! Yes, the wait is long and its sometimes tough to get a table, but I've always managed to get one inside, you just need to keep an eye out while you're in line.

Mmmhhh, going to dissent here. Oohhhh, that hurt (me, ducking)! I just don't get it. We stood in the mandatory line. My gf and I shared a key lime pie and a chocolate thingy. Neither was worthy of fighting over. I ordered a coconut thingy to go, for my husband, and when we opened the box at home, he had mistakenly packed a banana thingy. Which totally sucked. I just don't get it. Could someone be drinking the Tartine fresh koolade, possibly?

Really, this place doesn't need another review, but upon seeing the negative comments, I had to add a five.  this is not possibly the best, it is the best bakery in town.  yes, the line and wait suck, but the pastries can't be beat.   My suggestion:  can't really go wrong with anything, their specialty is the bread pudding, but I love the chocolate croissant.  Especially if you are lucky enough to get it fresh from the oven.  Quality chocolate, flaky and crusty outside, buttery, and absolutely decadent.   Avoid the line by not going Sunday or Saturday brunch time and then take your pastry over to the park!

Be ready for a 30 minute wait-- at minimum. The line gets long quick. There was so much hype about Tartine's bread pudding that we just had to have it. It was good. Not great. A little too mushy than we'd like. But from what everyone was having, everything look mouth- watering good. It's too bad we had really high expectations for the bread pudding.

I am in love. This bakery is soooo good. I had their bread while having dinner at Delfina, a restaurant next door to it, last night. It was the BEST bread I have ever tasted and I have been thinking about it every since! I don't know the name of it. But it's shaped kind of like a football (except flat on the bottom). But it's about three or four times the size of a football! It's huge! The crust is chewy, flaky and crunchy all at the same time. The flesh inside is full of air pockets and deliciously moist with a slight sour yeast taste. I just went back to get a loaf of that bread just now. Unfortunately, they bake it every night of the week EXCEPT Mondays! What a bummer. I don't feel so bad though. I got a croissant, which was fabulous! It is hard to find a really good croissant for some reason. But this one was French perfection. I also got a lemon tart for dessert tonight and a couple of pieces of quiche for breakfast tomorrow. I am in love with this bakery. They make very high-quality products. I am impressed and will now be a regular customer.

I called in sick to work just so I could visit Tartine Bakery.  After reading all of the reviews I was paranoid, downright scared that the line would stretch 1/2 a mile down the street and I would never, ever have the pleasure of tasting this establishment's tasty treats.   My email to work went something like this: Me:  Due to flu like symptoms, (translation: chocolate cravings) I will be unable to come in today (it's Monday, do you realize that most people will skip Tartine today and the wait will only be 20 minutes?).   I will be at home recuperating and resting  (I'll be stuffing myself with whatever baked treats I can get my grubby hands on).  I'll make sure to drink lots of fluids, (I'll indulge in every known variation of coffee/espresso that they have to offer) and I'll make sure to nap as often as possible.  (I'll probably pass out from a sugar/carbohydrate overdose so don't bother waking me. I plan on coming in on Tuesday (with a big smile on my face and a bag of goodies from Tartine that I'll devour at my desk). Have a nice day.   I indulged in a slice of chocolate heaven, an iced coffee and a great book.  I love the self serve approach to getting water and busing your own table.  I'll be back but I won't use a sick day.

Finally tried some new things here...always been wanting to, but always got stuck to my favorite ones. Banana Cream Tart: I thought the lemon cream tart has the best crust in the world, but after I tried the Banana Cream Tart, I discovered that there are 2 best tart crust in the world. It is so incredibly flaky, which is very different from the cookie-ish crust of lemon cream tart. The thin layer of chocolate stops the moisture from the banana caramel filling from softening the crust, smart!! It adds texture, and extra kick. The filling....can't describe it, so caramel-y and banana-y. Why so much whipped cream? Because it balances out the sweetness of the filling, how nice! I love the shaved chocolate on top too. The whole tart is a big box of surprises, texture, and dreamy-heavenly-creaminess. The fragipan tart was good but not my thing...it has the same filling as the almond croissant which I absolutely love, but this tart is just way over the top...too heavy and sweet... Pumpkin tea cake is nice and spicy. Possibly the best one i've had, except for the ones I make :-) Tres Leches Cake: pretty good, the cream in between the cake layers is very nice, not too sweet, just enough moisture. Not the best I've had, but among the better ones. Coffee: free refill which is great, tastes thin but big flavor! I've had almost all the sandwiches on the menu, not any single one of them is less than great. They are simple combination of the best ingredients. Isn't it the best concept ever? The muesli, I have to say, doesn't really taste like what I expected. I was skeptical about it since it's always been soaked in the yogurt in that big bowl in the cooler all day. I like my muesli crunchy. Finally tried, it's much light than I expected, and the crunchiness comes from the fresh apple, not the toasted oats, overall pretty straight-forward and possibly the lightest thing in the whole bakery. My favorite breakfast ever: plain croissant toasted (I buy 5 of them every time I come, weekly supply) in the oven 250 F for 10 minutes, eat it with Harvest Songs Rose Petal Jam...and coffee from Philz...that's what get me going every morning. I agree with the comment on the rude biker who parked the bike inside the restaurant. I HATED it. It's a table for people to stand and enjoy the food, not for your bike.

Let me preface this by saying that I at at Tartine for the first time a number of weeks ago. 'Twas before the end of finals and the blurr that is Christmas/the entire holiday season. That being said, you'll have to forgive me if certain delicious details are inadvertently omitted from this review. Tartine automatically gets 5 stars for me, because they were able to do something that no PLACE or no ONE has ever been able to do previously. But what would incine you, good reader, to read further if I told you this information now? Never one to give away my milk for free, I'll let you know why in exactly two paragraphs why Tartine warrants such blatant praise from yours truly. Myself and three friends luckily managed to grab a table not .00005 seconds after two old Asian ladies had stood up. We sardined ourselves into the chairs and waited for our food. And while we waited, we broke bread- specifically the gougère pastry (I believe?) which was spectacular. I had a Smoked Chicken (I think) sandwich, which (hah) was presented in four BIG corners. I could only finish three, being more than enough for a starving individual. It was absolutely delicious, and I savored every bite- something I rarely do. It honestly was that good.   Now what was in this delightful lunch item that made it so good? It was the broccoli and cheese paste that lined the pieces of bread. Now, I'm notorious for not eating anything green. It's horrible, but true. And I both ate AND enjoyed the broccoli paste. But here's the scary part: solid, unmistakable chunks of broccoli were in the sandwich, and I *still* ate them without fuss nor muss. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, THAT is why I give Tartine 5 coveted stars. No place or person has ever had me knowingly eat chuncks of a vegetable, and enjoyed it. Ever. *standing ovation*

I had read about Tartine Bakery on Yelp and I had always wanted to try it. When I finally looked up where it was, I was a bit confused because I did not remember it in the neighborhood. Turns out I had such Pizzeria Delfina/Bi-Rite Creamery tunnel vision that I never even noticed that Tartine Bakery was right on the corner. I had the delicious lime/passion fruit cake and it was sooo good. The lime makes it perfectly tart and the cake is moist as can be. My friend had the banana cream tart and she loved it. Half way through consuming it she noticed that there was caramel in the bottom of the tart - just when she thought it could not be any richer! Everything there looked so good, but the prices are a bit high. My only fear is that I will never come back because I will be tempted by the wonder that is Bi-Rite's salted caramel ice cream. Too much good food in a one block region.

I hate waiting in lines but Tartine is definitely worth the trouble.  Do yourself a favor and pick up some baked goods on your way to Dolores Park to enjoy on a sunny day. My favorite thing to get would be the Double Chocolate Cookies. They're small but sinfully decadent. My only complaint is about their Devil's Food Cake. This cake was served at my birthday celebration a few years ago; as it's been a while I don't remember what was wrong with it but I don't recall anyone enjoying it. We threw the leftovers away. Other than that cake, everything I've tried there has been delicious and they have a friendly staff.

Here are the things I tried: Bread pudding: I really liked it. I could taste the cinnamon, the eggs, and the milk, and big pieces of fruits definitely mixed very well with the custard. Chocolate croissant: VERY good, and it's something you've gotta try. It's true that you'll feel like you are eating a stick of butter, but I've haven't had a chocolate croissant that's not stingy on the chocolate. I'm very happy with it. It's huge too. I had to split it into two separate meals. Lemon bar: strangely, it's very sweet yet very sour and tart all together. It's very good. Lemon cream tart: it's not as sweet or sour/ tart as the lemon bar. It's still good, but I'd go for the lemon bar. My hubby doesn't eat sweets, and once in a while he'd have a lemon bar, but it's hard for him to find one that suits his taste buds. Even he thought the lemon bar here was good. Brownies: Not the best I've had so save the money. I would definitely go back for its other pastries. By the way, if you are trying to lose weight, don't go to Tartine. It's very generous on the goodies, which is the fattening ingredients :) I also went on a weekday cuz this place is famous of the line of people lining out the door on weekends. Even on a weekday afternoon, it was crowded. At least the wasn't a big line.

I can't give Tartine anything but 5 stars, even though I find their popularity ridiculous. The pastry is very good. The way people line up, however, one would think starving San Franciscans had been eating sawdust for years and brioche were only just now available. I disapprove of fussy mission hype in general. I don't disapprove of Tartine or their pastry. I bought several dozen wedding cookies from them for - duh - my wedding. They were not just delicious, they were photogenic. The staff were also very helpful, even though I was only buying little cookies. We walked in, picked them up, and got married - with cookies.

Although the place's busy with many patrons, this little cafe has an welcoming feel that entices you to linger and just enjoy and appreciate the simple things in life. Dont be discouraged by the long line, it does move fast! And yes Tartine's stuff does taste as good as it looks! You wont be disappointed.

The food isn't terribly cheap, but it's pretty damn good. Had the buttermilk scone with currants - not the best choice (I know, everything else is just so amazing!) but even then, it wasn't too bad :) The croissants = WOW & the morning bun... yum :) Worth a visit at least once (if not every week)

The desserts are amazing.  The sandwiches are HUGE.  The prices are fair by San Francisco standards. You know how sometimes you look at the lovely pastries in the glass window and everything looks perfect.  Then, you order one and take a bite to find that the visual aesthetics were better than the taste.  Not here!  Everything I tasted was worthy. This place gets crowded and parking can be a bit of a challenge.

Yes, thousands of fellow Yelpers rave about this place! How can anyone go wrong? Givens: *There will be long lines. *Seating is challenging. *Very crowded with limited space to even move around (fire code violation) *Bring plenty of money and try something if not everything! *Don't get discouraged by the prices on the menu. *Time dependent, you might have to wait up to 45 minutes if you order a whole bread loaf. The bread is warm out of the oven when it's ready. Is it worth it? Hell YES!

Yummy yummy yummy! This place was packed when we arrived around 10:30am for a late lunch. My friend and I ordered a cup of Muesli and (a cup of) brioche bread pudding to share between the two of us. Oh, and the croissant filled with ham. They mistakenly put our bread pudding a bowl (and I just realized now that I left it at home and will be at my boyfriend's house the ENTIRE WEEK great...), but charged us the cup size for their mistake! Score! I wanted a hot chocolate but ended up getting a Lorina Lemonade (a decision I later regretted). It was packed inside, so we had to sit outside, which sucked because all of the tables weren't receiving sunlight since the building was blocking the sun. Boo. And that is when I regretted getting a cold drink... The Muesli was delcious! We ate it up. It wasn't too sweet and it was just right. The bread pudding was also delicious, but I was hoping it would have been served a tad bit warmed. Same goes for the croissant. That was delicious, but warmed would have been nice. I do want to go back and try more like quiche, croque monsieur, the almond croissant...so, good thing I went with my friend! Now I have to take my boyfriend back. :0)

Perfection in the form of brownies. And the ganache-covered chocolate cookie.  (Chocolate souffle-like in texture) And even the chocolate chip cookie. So much more to sample. Even if it means twice the time working out.

I am always a fan of this place.  Gimme a bowl of any of their potpourri of espresso drinks a chocolate croissant (a spot inside on a rainy day) and I am a damn happy camper. One star off only because on the rare occasion I find a seat inside I got someones butt 2 inches from the back of my neck.  I may not be able to see it, but I know it's there, and it's just not sanitary feeling.

WOW!! That was the first thing out of our mouths when we finally made it here after hearing and reading so much about this place.  It took a picture of their morning buns to give me that push over the edge to get our butts over to Tartine and see what it's all about. So after a rather full lunch, ignoring all and any new years resolutions about eating healthy (yeah, forget that!), we made it over.   Small place, but it's chock full of goodies!  My eyes were frantically looking over everything, trying to figure out what I wanted before it was my turn.  Everything looked SO good!  We decided on the lemon tart, banana cream tart, ham and gruyere croissant, and of course, their morning bun. DELICIOUS!!  All the hype and recognition this place has gotten is very well deserved!  You really can't help saying "OMG, SO GOOD" after every single bite! And yeah, it's official, I'm coming back as often as I can, so seriously, goodbye resolutions!  I'm going to indulge myself!

The fruit tart was probably one of the best I have ever had. All of the fruit that was on it was sweet and ripe. It was just delicious. So was the Banana Chocolate Tart! The bread pudding was okay, my friend gave me a taste of her's and I was glad that I hadn't gotten it. The wait was long and the seating was limited, but I would defnitely go back there to have another fruit tart!

I tried ordering the banana cream tart and morning bun.  Both were not available. So i ordered the brioche bread pudding and a sesame loaf.  I wasn't a big fan of the bread pudding.  the consistency was close to flan...so it was kind of weird.  The bread was amazing though.  I've never had the inside of the bread with such chewy and melty texture before.

There's hardly any parking around so the best thing to do is catch the bus or walk here! .. anyway, i haven't really tried anything else i know the quiche is really good! the place is really small so if there is more then one person, then someone grab a table and someone stand in line thats your best bet! Enjoy! :] Oh btw, this seasons fruit for the breadpudding is banana, it can be kind of tart.

This is bad. When u heard so much about a place like Tartine, and seen so many good reviews about it, it's hard not to agree. But I guess my expectation for this place was too high. Nothing wrong, everything is made just right. But I didn't find anything exceptional either. Maybe next time?

Hmm.. I must say I was disappointed after eating here a bit. It was one of many culinary stops in SF. I got the bread pudding, and though it was tasty, it wasn't out of this world. It didn't even compare to the one I ate in New Orleans! Not even an inch. I guess my expectations were just too high. It's a basic bakery peeps, nothing to go crazy over.

Not only is Tartine on the 7x7 Big Eats list, but rumor had it that the line out the door often meant an hour-long wait. This means that what's inside must be good, right? Sadly, they ran out of the famous Morning Bun during my visit, so I didn't get to try the item everyone's been raving about. However, I loved their pecan pie... it was about as sweet as you could get without being TOO sweet, and I absolutely loved the pastry dough they used for the pie. I'd love it if they started making more pies in different flavors! I thought the lemon poppyseed cake was just OK, as it was a bit too artificially sweet for my liking and reminded me of the kind you typically find packaged in a vending machine. Tartine, please produce more Morning Buns each day! Nothing screams disappointment like arriving at Tartine to find that they're all sold out!

Long lines for food is a gamble. Most times it's unwarranted hype, but sometimes it's so worth it. For Tartine Bakery, the line of hipsters may lead you to think the former, but keep at it: a most delectable treasure awaits you. I highly advise bringing something light to snack on because the portions are colossal. I ordered the Pecorino & Almond Sandwich & that beast lasted for three meals ($12 well spent!). Mind you, I can fit a disproportionate amount of food & I came there hungry. So about that sandwich. The insides were all kinds of wonderful & they were hugged by gourmet Sizzler Cheese Toast! Pure bliss.

I will have to come back for the acclaimed Banana Cream Tart, as they were sold out of that and the sugar short bread cookies when we went. We did however, get to score some bread pudding.  If you know me, you know I love me a good bread pudding.  However, I didn't think this was good bread pudding.  =(  Disclaimer: I did eat this the next day as we had dinner reservations and had dessert there... so maybe it wasn't fresh.  I just found it to be soggy and a let down.

We came here on a rainy early Sunday afternoon. The line was out the door but we didn't wait that long. We got the following desserts and everything was De-Licious - Banana cream tart, coconut cream tart, Frangipane, and the bread pudding. The banana and coconut cream tarts were my favorite. The shell of the tart was light and flaky; the inside of the shell was coated with chocolate which added a nice crunch to it. The cream filling was light. So why not 5 stars? The cashier was extremely rude to one of our friends. He only wanted to use his first initial for his drink order and she did not like that. She asked him again what his name is and she said, can't you use a fake name? She did explain that it's easier for them to call out a name instead of an initial, but then she did her little huff and puff and rang him up. Who cares if it's an initial, we have to stand by the bar to wait for our drink anyways. Also, the seating is not the greatest. You just wait and hoover over people in the small space after you order to get a seat. So you can potentially be standing with a very yummy dessert but without a seat to eat it...

Crazy line outside on a Saturday afternoon (4pm) but with gd company the line moved fairly fast.. They ran out of morning buns and banana cream tart :( but the bostock (brioche bread w almond and orange liqueur) was amazing! Fluffy and crisp on the outside. The frangipane tart had a gd crust. A bit too much almond tho.. Was expecting crushed almonds (as in almond croissant style filling).

I picked up a passionfruit cake for my mom's birthday here on Thursday night! I decided to reserve the cake beforehand by calling so that I was sure it would be there at the end of the night. Their cakes and pastries are fabulous as all of the yelpers can attest. When I came in, they had a live band playing in the tiny, intimate seating area. It almost felt like I wasn't in the hipster haven that is the Mission but that I  teleported to a small, rustic village European bakery.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE  this bakery. It has the BEST CROISSANTS in all of the U.S.A. and possibly might be comparable to Paris (this is coming from a francophile).  I come from the east cost JUST TO EAT here once a year. Their croissants are BUTTERY, flakey, tasty...the BEST EVER.  Other things people RAVE about is their Bread pudding. They have different fresh fruits on it, depending on the season. and yes, it is irresistible. Other recommendations include, the frangipan (almond paste croissant), morning buns (buns encrusted with sugar and orange zest), chocolate croissants of course. If you want to splurge (get ripped off), consider paying for the croque monsieur, or the melted  cheese, béchamel conconction on their yummy bread.   It is yummy despite it's hiked up price.   this is one of my absolute FAVORITE bakeries ever. I'm not a savory fan but I know my friends love the gougère or the sphere shaped bread with melted cheese baked inside (hollow ball of bread with yummy cheese  and pepper taste) for those that are into that.   The down side is the line...that seems to get longer every year when I come back for my yearly croissant pilgrimage and yet...it is always worth it. Do not expect to get a seat, so get takeout and head to Dolores park nearby where you can meet hippies and listen to crazy hippy drumming while you are having your french breakfast picnic.

Food and baked goods are great. The low rating is for the egregious lines and wait time. It seems to be one of the least efficient establishments I have ever seen, which contributes to the long lines that don't move. I love the place, which is why I put up with the frustrating wait, but enough is enough. I beg the owner to come up with a way to expedite the wait time. You'll have more customers, and we (customers) will be much happier.

When I lived in San Francisco Tartine was part of my daily routine. A slice of lemon poppy seed cake and a cup of coffee became an addiction. On days when I was trying to be healthy I'd replace the cake with their fresh muesli. During peak hours the line would stretch down the street - but that seems to be the norm with most good food places in SF.

What more can I add to the 3,135 reviews before me? It's amazing what these guys can do with the right combination of the humble flour, yeast, butter and water.  Even the simple loaf of bread was good enough to make it to the 7X7 list (http://www.foodspotting.…).  As is the morning bun, which people would line up more than 30 minutes at 9AM on Saturdays for.   I personally am a bigger fan of their light and crusty butter croissant than I am their morning bun, and for that, I really don't have to get there until the line for the morning bun dies down (and the morning buns run out) at around 3PM. The cherry on top was the espresso bar serving the neighborhood's other most famous export, Four Barrel coffee.

Luckily, the line wasn't too long when I arrived at Tartine. Small and quaint. One thing I didnt like was that people in line were jumping for any open seat by putting their belongings down on tables. Oh, the croissants sont parfaits! Buttery, crispy, chewy... We got the chocolate chip croissant and the ham and cheese. They were both perfect, especially with coffee. I enjoy biting into perfect croissants and feeling/hearing the crunch! We also got the banana cream tart. The caramel inside is what made me go mmm. I got a muesli, and realized that I am not a fan of muesli. I like the crunch of American granola with my yogurt. The Morning Bun was my favorite! Not too sweet, very chewy, with what I thought was a tinge of citrus(?). Anyway, i want one now. I miss it, too bad it's a 6 hour drive...

My favorite pastry bakery and  cafe in the SF Bay Area (for bread, scones, and brioches, the Cheese Board takes top honors). Tartine has the best almond croissants on the planet.

I so wanted to like this place. I see the crowds on a sunny Sunday afternoon, I've witnessed the 5:00 pm rush for the freshly baked bread. I've tasted the cookies, croissants, and their lattes. I've even gone as far as bring family and friends to this place. Each time hoping that there will be some miraculous discovery of a tasty pastry. Unfortunately i feel compelled to write about how mediocre the goods are here. The last straw were the burnt ham and cheese croissants we had. Two stars for the lattes that come in a bowl, i like that. sorry tartine, let me know what i should be ordering. i really wanted to like you! ___________________________________________ UPDATE 9/23 So I've been back here a couple times now and I feel like I finally got it. As I sat there with my creamy chai latte, munching on my fresh raspberry tart, I finally got the wonderfulness that is Tartine. The cool breeze that swishes my hair as I take bite after bite of crispy and buttery shell that holds my fresh raspberries and sweet cream, puts me at ease and the warm smell of fresh bread tickles my nose as I sip my spicy chai. My friend got a cap and a banana cream tart that was delicious as well. So delicious in fact that I practically ate half, and by half I mean like 75% chocolate shavings and all. The cap was perfectly done, the natural sweetness of the bean was enough, no sugar necessary. Tartine is just simply wonderful.

At this point I only eat here when I have out of town guests, some of whom insist on eating here several times a day when they visit. Is the long wait annoying? I have never had a problem getting a table here, the key is to master the art of aggressive staring and quickly darting into a seat when someone is still in the midst of standing up to go. Many people are too impatient to wait so there isn't even that much competition, and generally everyone is polite. There is no better way to savor the victory of getting a table than by slowly sipping many cups of coffee, having a long chat with a friend, and devouring every crumb of food. I am very glad that they have added the new smaller size bread pudding, since the large bowl tends to take on the taste of scrambled eggs as it cools off. But seriously, how could you not love the food here?

Delicieuse. I would give a higher rating if I didn't hate standing in line with all those yuppies... if one can still call them that. They need a webcam, so one can check to see when there's not a line and then scurry over. Last time, I went and bought a snack at Tartine and then went to Dolores Park cafe to buy a coffee so I could sit there to eat.

This is a truly awesome bakery. Tartine's has by far the best flaky croissants and pain au chocolat in the city. For your savory needs, they have a delicious open-faced mushroom melt, and a uniquely tasty pressed cheese and membrillo sandwich. Scharffen Berger double-chocolate cookies and heavenly dark chocolate pudding are to die for. Espresso drinks are very good, and their mocha (also made with Scharffen Berger) is fantastically rich and chocolatey. Basically there's very little they make here that isn't superlative. Also, I ask you, who doesn't love checking out hot disheveled bakery chicks expertly applying chocolate frosting to a fancy looking cake? Nobody, that's who. That's gotta be worth 5 stars just there. Sadly, one star off for the ridiculously long lines and fight for seating.

Tartine is probably the best bakery in SF based on both things I've tasted from here and by the looks of everything in the case. The bread pudding with fruit is to die for, probably the best and most affordable breakfast on their menu. Window shopping here makes me want to try everything, the sandwiches, the pain au chocolat, the tarts, croissants, everything! That being said, the wait is sometimes out of control here. I've passed it up many a time walking by just because the line was at least 20 minutes deep. I don't mind the seating so much since it gives it more of a European feel but 20+ minutes to get a croissant!? I worry I might try to chew my ear off.

The line out the door explains it all.  The wait was about 20 minutes but we used it wisely.  First we scoped out the menu and pastry descriptions.  Then we scoped out the display case.  Then the tables next to us for what others were eating as well as potential seats.   Our game plan was to each pick one then share.  We came out with 6 pastries between 4 people.  And that's because when you cant make a decision, you buy both, or all 3.   Lemon Tart Almond Tart with currants Brioche Pudding with strawberries Ham and Cheese Croissant Chocolate Croissant Morning Sticky Bun And a mocha.  You add all that together and you get one MAJOR sugar high.  It hits you in the middle of your eyes.  It kinda hurts and makes you dizzy.  I'm so ready to do it all over again.

Went here with two friends this past Saturday and I cannot help but give this place 5 stars just for their PHENOMENAL bread pudding. I mean, the chocolate chip cookie we shared was OK and the latte I had was pretty good, the macaroons we got were pretty decadent too but the bread pudding has been haunting my dreams since Saturday. The three of us shared a bowl and we were practically spoon fencing for the last bite!!! I went here once before with the same friends plus others as Andy was on and on about their bread pudding during dinner across the street at Platanos. However, when we got there after we ate, they were out of the bread pudding!! So I had the Scharffenburger chocolate mousse and it was pretty good, but my latte was bitter as hay. I didn't write a review as I was hoping to go back and give Tartine a second chance with their bread pudding. Boy am I glad I did!!! Or perhaps I should be worried as I already feel addicted and I can see my hips grow grow grow!!! Either way, I highly recommend a visit to this place...one day, I'd love to try them out for breakfast...their croissants look SO flaky...yum. I'm totally going back for more...again and again and again. UPDATE 1.8.07: I've gone back to Tartine several times since my last review and I've been disappointed pretty much each time. The bread pudding is still fabulous although this past Sunday they had one with whole, slightly cooked cranberries and they were just too tart. The combination of the crunchy, tart fruit with the sweet, melt-in-your mouth pudding just didn't work for me or my two friend who were with me. This same trip we tried out one of the almond croissants and they are in fact very flaky and we did enjoy it though it took all 3 of us to finish it. I think it was a little bit heavy on the filling but still good. However, all that isn't enough for me to cut out the one star I've decreased my rating to - what did, is the fact that EVERY time I've been there and asked for a large latte with ONE shot of espresso, I end up with the exact SAME latte my friend will get with two shots - bitter, bitter, bitter. Plus, I can't have a lot of caffeine either so I can never drink it and end up wasting money - no more you wicked barristas at Tartine!!! I'll stick to getting my lattes at Starbucks where they listen to my customized order. Also, the sandwiches we tried a previous time just weren't that impressive and quite greasy for my taste, and the quiche my friend got on Sunday was a tiny serving and not very impressive in taste (or so he said).

Anyone who has any sense at all would give this place five full stars.  I have read a few reviews that are kind of malicious and petty about Tartine, so I will salute their efforts.   Their bread is excellent, it is worth the horrible parking and even worse the yuppies.  For a mere $4.95 you can eat the divine country bread for several days without it getting overly dry.   The other items I enjoy are the croissants, which are so buttery and flaky, you will swear that La Boulangerie's croissants are second rate . On the downside:  seating-not enough; self busing tables:  I think this is rather unsanitary and anti-atmospheric.  Besides the prices do not warrant this lack of a basic services.  Slow line:  Tartine needs to staff up.

Tartine is always crowded and for a good reason too. I finally had the chance to check this place out. I had the fromage blanc croque monsieur, which was absolutely sinful. In the heart of the Mission, under the warm Saturday afternoon sun, enjoying a croque monsieur is quite nice.

Man, I wanted to not like this place. I was determined to cry, "Overrated!" after I finally sucked it up and ate here a few months ago. My Creative Writing students decided that having our last class off-campus was a splendid idea (of course they did, they're high schoolers) and the consensus seemed to be that the Mission was "literary" (no one felt like going all the way to North Beach). Of course, these being private school kids they were way more Tartine-minded then say, Happy Doughnuts-minded so Tartine is where we ended up. The queue was long and daunting, but I was visually in love with the culinary delights in the cases. Sweet or savory? Sweet or savory? I went for savory (quiche) and got an iced coffee to wash it down. I actually ended up spilling my coffee all over the coffee bar right after I got it while I was putting on the lid, but luckily the staff was very nice and understanding; they quickly cleaned it up and made me another. The quiche was very good, but I wasn't entirely sold until my last two visits. I went a couple of weeks ago with a very nice Swiss-French gentleman and ordered a chocolate croissant, which rivaled any that I've had in France (he agreed). I went again a week later to meet a former student and had the bread pudding and just about died of over-indulgence--so good! So yeah, Tartine. Of course it's good. I'd give it five stars, but it is a tad too sceney for my taste and I've never been able to actually sit down in the cafe, which in the end is okay because Dolores Park makes for a perfect picnic spot. I also haven't tried the food food, so after a proper taste of everything I'll have to re-visit my review.

This is the reason you get up at 6am to work out, do triathlons, and watch what you eat.  Butter, my friends; this is the ultimate last whistle stop for gold bars derived from cows.  Frangipanne that are almost like marzipan, gruyere and ham croissant to satisfy your savory side, chocolate croissants that are melty and sensual to satisfy your (un)savory side.  Take home the cream tart.   Take home the cookbook.  Send it off far and wide to friends.  You'll be loved for it. Update: Try this place in the evening with the crowds have thinned out.   Have a tartine for dinner.

Bread pudding. That was what got me hooked on this place. I had that every weekend for two straight months. Now I have moved onto croissants and scones with a cup of coffee. I love coming here early Saturday and Sunday mornings to grab a good freshly baked breakfast. My friends and I always try to make it a weekly meeting point. The lines are long once it opens on the weekends, but during the week there is a good buying window during the mid to late afternoon hours. Plus I love the people working there. Very professional and down to earth.

Everyone talks about Tartine's greatness, so of course I had to see what the fuss was all about.  I'm glad I made the trip because its one place I plan to visit very soon. I loved the chocolate cookies and the banana tart. Obviously everything there was fresh so you can't really go wrong. Also the value was reasonable.  The small banana tart cost about $4, and it practically fed my whole family (we don't eat that much). Tartine only gets four stars from me because I thought there would be a bigger selection of deserts to choose. They did, however, have those yummy pizza sandwiches (I know I'm lame -- that's so not the way to describe it) and the different types of bread so I can't really say there wasn't a lot.  I'm a sweets person, so you can't really blame me...

I suppose after 762 reviews there's not much I can add, but I am adding anyway. Coming here was pretty much the entirety of my goals for my last trip to San Francisco. It did not disappoint. Even standing in line for 45 minutes made me happy. It was a sociable people-watching experience. Everybody was in that line because they knew great things awaited them. The bread pudding is the best thing in the world. I don't think I'm exaggerating. My only regret is that I ate too much sugar to be able to get ice cream at Bi-Rite afterwards. Oh well! Gotta save something for the next trek up north.

Aside from delightful and attractive employees, this place strikes me as more scenester than delicious.  Most people (particularly girls) I've met in this city wax about how terrific Tartine is.  I've now been a half dozen times, always with someone who attempts to convert me, and I've never been wowed in any sense. First off, the coffee is Mr. Espresso, which is sort of crap.  I am happy to walk several blocks to Ritual and take some of the best coffee I've had in my life.  I'm really disappointed with European-themed places that commit the same coffee mistakes as most American Starbucks-esque establishments.  You shouldn't be able to swim in your espresso. As for the pastries, everything is too sweet.  Croissants are too buttery and are often overcooked.  Nothing was repulsive, everything was tasty, but nothing was fantastic.  It's simple as that.  I'm beginning to think people in this city haven't had introductions to quality pastry. In short, not worth the wait, but I wish I could point you to a better alternative.

Lots of hype to live up to. Smashed sandwiches (aka paninis) are pretty much my favorite food in the world, so I was psyched to try their interesting combos. After hovering around for a seat, we crowded awkwardly onto the end of a table, which wasn't ideal but it worked. We waited for our sandwiches while exercising extreme impulse control by not dipping immediately into the luscious-looking desserts sitting before us. Our sandwiches came and they didn't disappoint although...not the best either. I love rich foods, but these were really rich. Like, I felt like I was at risk of a heart attack immediately after. Pace yourselves with these babies. The hearty sandwiches took the sails out of dessert a little bit; I thought the bread pudding was great but not fantastic. I think I'd like this place better as a coffee-pastry affair rather than a lunch deal.

I don't need to say much about this place with the oodles of already great reviews.  I'm only sad it didn't exist when I lived across the street from it years ago. If ever I want something extra special - I go here.  Popped by yesterday and picked up a banana cream pie - dee-lii-coius! Love the ambience of this place - always buzzing with people and loads of tantilizing bakery items.  Definitely a 5 star bakery!!

A few months ago, a friend of mine took me here because she had heard that this place was the bee's knees. I was looking forward to something sweet and refreshing after a frustrating day, and everything in the display cases looked delicious. So we selected a few things and sat down to enjoy them, but alas, there was disappointment. First of all, their hibiscus tea has spearmint in it. I love hibiscus tea, and I really despise spearmint. So it was quite a crushing disappointment to find that my refreshment was tainted with that evil herb. There is no way that it can ever be necessary to put mint in hibiscus tea, which has its own beautiful flavor that stands alone. Next, we had the coconut cream tart. I love flaky, creamy, caramel, coconut, so there was no way that this could be bad... except there was. The puff pastry shell has dark chocolate shellacked onto the inside, presumably in order to keep in all the cream and caramel. However, that chocolate was hard as a rock, and my friend and I were completely unable to cut through it with the flimsy spudware utensils that they have available. Short of taking bites or manually breaking off ridiculously messy portions, it is impossible to eat. The components were good, but  ultimately, we didn't eat more than half because it was all over the place. The last thing we had was a meringue, which was fine. I have yet to eat a spectacular meringue, and there was nothing wrong with it. But it wasn't amazing, and after the disappointment of the tart and the tea, eating the meringue felt a bit like defeat. I might return one day, but I feel that any future experience will always be shadowed by the memory of my sub par first visit.

Either I took my happy pills today, or I know a good thing when I see it.  Must be the latter, since I don't take pills. From the moment I walked up and saw a line of people standing outside Tartine Bakery, endulging in the wafting beauty that floated out of the restaurant, I knew this place had something special.   I'm a big sharer - so my buddy and I split the ham and cheese croissant and each had a croque monsieur.  Being French Canadian, I can't claim that I grew up in the streets of Paris.  But bear with me, I know a good croissant.  This place is outstanding!  The fresh pastries and awesome coffee were a beautiful reprieve from an often hackneyed eggy breakfast.  True, seating sucks...but I think it adds to the feeling that you walked into your French aunt's kitchen to break bread with the fam.   A perfect start to a sunny San Francisco day.  Who needs happy pills when you've got Tartine?

Now something I can recommend whole heartedly: Tartine Bakery I just drool a little when I walk into the place. I went overboard when we first went here; we ended up in a sugar coma.

My posts are getting shorter and shorter--sorry. All this eating, walking and partying with friends really takes it out of a girl! One of my last stops, before a birthday dinner for my friends at someone's house, was lunch at my beloved Tartine Bakery. Man, the lines at this place have gotten even longer! I didn't think that was possible. But, the wait is soooo worth it when you are talking about baked items this good. The reason I came: the "croque-monsieur" with ham, tomatoes, Bchamel sauce, cheese and their coveted country French bread (it sells out so fast you have to get their an hour before they come out of the oven--seriously). These things are just plain evil and I blame them for making me fat when I was living in SF (joking, of course). They are just insane and I love the pickled veggies that come on the side instead of chips. I also got a side salad of baby gem lettuce dressed simply. The perfect meal. I also grabbed some cookies as a thank you for my friend's roomie for letting me stay at their place and some coconut macaroons for the sweet fiends in my life.

Overrated.  When my sister comes to town we usually have an eatfest, which typically consists of some pho or dim sum consumption, some tapioca drink consumption and some baked goods consumption.  So why is it that whenever we go here all the hipsters are crowding up the joint and no one remembers their manners?  Well I ain't going to dwell on that part. Nothing I've had here is memorable.  To the point that I don't even remember what I had last time I was there.  I always remember what I've eaten at the Rigo-owned Boulangeries throughout the city. Standing in long lines for forgettable pastry is not worth the length of time it takes to find parking in the neighborhood.   But because I'm a baked goods weakling, I'm willing to give them another shot.  And maybe another one too.

I kept hearing about Tartine and even tried to go there one weekend afternoon but the line drove me away. I thought, can it really be that good?! I'm sure it's just hyped up. So my foodie gilfriend came into town and on her list of places to go...Tartine. This time I had a plan. Go early. They opened at 8 a.m. on Saturday and I figure 9:30 should be fine, not too busy. I was wrong. There was a line and we lucked out getting a seat. Was it all hype? No! I love this place and it has made my, before I die I want to eat something from here list. We had the bread pudding - oh my gawd that's good! Chocolate croissant - it was actually still warm and oh so flaky it all melted in my mouth. We couldn't help ourselves and got the coconut tart, chocolate banana tart, and croque monsiuer to go. It was so good we didn't want it to end. The coconut tart was my favorite and when I die I'm taking it with me, to the grave. It was crazy crowded the whole time we were there except there was a lag from 10-10:15a.m. Other than that line, line line. I can't wait to go back.

This place is on my short list of places that any visitor to SF should check out.  I've probably been here 4-5 times.  I'd recommend the morning bun ($3) and the bread pudding ($3 for a small portion, 5.5 for a large).  There is usually a wait in the morning but the line moves reasonably fast.  If you go in the afternoon, then you run the risk of them running out of the good stuff.   I've tried 1 or 2 of the croque monsieurs (open faced sandwiches) and they are ok but overpriced at $9+ and come with one miniature, lonely marinated carrot.  Also, the last time, the sandwich (which sits out all day), despite being tossed in the oven for a reheat, was partially cold and partially warm.  They also have fresh baked bread after 5pm everyday but I haven't tried it yet (the loaf is huge).  So go and get the bread pudding and morning bun (and maybe another sweet item that catches your eye).

I don't know if there is anything I can rave about Tartine that hasn't already been, um, raved. I must be honest, however, I used my secret Yelping  powers to give you the exceedingly rare six stars. Then I mulled it over and took one half star for running out of chocolate croissants so often and the other half because the layout still frustrates me. Five stars nonetheless for you my darling Tartine, my always-there-for-me feel good place. (In case you were wondering, heaven for me: a rich chocolate eclair with a cold, creamy center juxtaposed against a warm well-made latte in a bowl... ohhh baby.)

One sunny day, I waited 20 minutes in line. But I needed to try this place cause I hard sooooo much. I tried bread pudding, too much butter and suger in this bread pudding. They gave me a looot for $3. I also got a banana pound cake, which was also $3 and I thought it was expensive. This was also too oily and my paper napkin was soaked with oil after 2 minutes of holding with it. I think it was good but it is not worth going to mission and wait 20 minutes and having to eat standing up.

This place ALWAYS has a line, no matter what time of the day it is. And I can see why... I ordered their famous bread pudding and was surely not disappointed. It was yummy - and I don't even like bread pudding!! It is on the sweeter side, so don't eat this early in the morning unless you like sweets for your first meal (I sure don't). You get a pretty huge portion for just $3. I also got the chocolate croissant. Also very good, maybe not as fresh as I was expecting. But then again, I went to Tartine at noon, so the pastries may have gotten a little stale over time. Pastries are expensive there. My croissant was almost $4. Service is fast and friendly. The waitors/waitresses all seem so happy to be there. It's kinda shocking for me, actually. Word of advice for first-timers: To expedite the orders, some waitors will ask you what you want to order before you get to the counter. So, I chose what I knew Tartine was famous for (bread pudding) and a croissant. Every bakery has to have croissants, right? But then as I approached the pastry case, I saw so many other AMAZING looking pastries!! Ahh! I regretted ordering the croissant! I could have that any day, but I've never seen some of these other pastries and they all looked SO good. Thus, if it's your first time at Tartine, be sure to check out the pastry case BEFORE giving your order. You don't want to miss out on something good!

The only problem with this place is how popular it is and the long lines to get your hands on the wonderful pastries. The morning rolls (sort of like cinnamon rolls) were so flavorful. Oh, and the muesli was very good too, excellent thing to be offered if you want something a bit more nutritious early in the day. Good coffee as well. I'm going back!

I'm in love...again! Over the weekend my friend and went to Tartine to pick up a souffle cake for a friends birthday. It was my first time there so while waiting in line I got to check out what everyone else was eating. Besides the cake we ended up leaving with a banana tart that I'm still thinking of even now, a lemon bar and two super sized cookies. The lemon bar was nothing special and the cookies were yummy but had a slight burnt taste. The souffle cake had to feed twelve of us so we decided on the larger size thinking that the small was too itty bitty. Boy were we wrong. We ended up eating less than half of the super rich yet yummy cake. I can't wait to go back again and try the brioche bread pudding with fresh fruit and get my hands on another banana tart.

Ohhh my!  This place is FABULOSO!  I have only been there once, but I crave it every time I get close to San Francisco.  When I went I had the YOGURT AND GRANOLA, which was very good (lame, I know...I was feeling healthy).  Luckily, I had a bite of my husbands treats, he got the BREAD PUDDING, which is TO DIE FOR, and the ham and cheese croissants...which was crispy, buttery, and delicious.  I can't wait to go back for their sweet croissants and other amazing treats. The only reason way it gets four stars not five is that the cappuccino and coffee bar was slow, and very confused with the madness.

I was so disappointed by S Factor, I decided I needed to indulge. I consumed  about 5k calories here, and every calorie was delicious. Sadly, the line was too long, so I probably won't come here again. I got: the ham AND turkey croque monsieur -- I enjoyed the turkey over the ham. The ham was too salty for my palette fruit tart -- delicious! I would get this again -- my favorite! banana cream tart -- the bananas are fresh, the whip cream is light and not too sweet. The outside shell is crisp but not too hard. I'm not really into chocolate, so I didn't enjoy the chocolate shavings so much. bread pudding -- delicious warm or cold! chocolate chip cookie -- above average for a chocolate chip cookie, but I wouldn't get this again chocolate croissant -- crispy and flaky. high-quality chocolate that's not too sweet My pants were tight the next day, but it was worth it. :)

I felt like I need to be one step closer to pre-diabetes, so I went for my monthly dose of baked goods. Tartine was the choice bakery simply because their lemon tart is out of this world. I can eat three of those in one sitting, though I'd probably wouldn't since that would throw my one-meal-per-day diet out of whack. Everything about this bakery is just simply good.

I love this bakery! My favorites from Tartine most definitely are: 1. Chocolate pudding - so creamy, smooth, chocolatey, the fresh whipped cream and chocolate shaving on top really take it that one notch higher.  The best choco pudding I've ever had...EVER! 2. Morning bun - it comes out soft, warm chewy and gooey, the piece de resistance is the orange zest.  SOooo delicious!  Cinnamon, raisins and brown sugar are so typical, the orange zest makes it a stand out!  I can usually only eat half, I save the other half for later where it's just as delicious. 3. Almond croissant - warm, flaky, buttery, just the right amount of frangipane to make it a little gooey/chewy, definitely not too sweet.  Again, I can only usually eat half in a single sitting, and it's still really good later on as a snack. Other stuff: I've also had the lemon meringue cake (much too sweet), ham and cheese croissant (good, but not as good as the almond), the chocolate hazelnut tart (um, not so much, too thick and dense), mushroom quiche (it's aiight...I wouldn't waste stomach space on this again), bread pudding (I really didn't like this at all - kinda mushy, eggy and unimpressive), the scone (really unmemorable compared with the morning bun), and the jambon and gruyere sandwich (kinda salty, but ok). The 'not so much' list seems long, but overall this bakery blows the rest away.  You can definitely tell they work hard to make quality and delicious products, can't really ask for anything more.

Hmmm....1337 reviews. Seems like this place is pretty popular! (end sarcasm} I decided to check off another item on the 7x7 100 things you need to eat/drink in SF before you die and go to Tartine Bakery for their morning bun. If you've read any of the other reviews on this place, then I'm sure you already have a good idea why you should try this place out, but here's my take on it - I came here early, before it opened and there was already a line out the door. Ooooo...one of those places in SF! (The line persisted by the way during the entire time I was here, about an hour or so) It was a wonderful sunny Sunday morning. The sunshine poured through the windows at this place. We got a morning bun, a cup of bread pudding, a cheesey bread thing, coffee and a cafe au lait. Yup, carb overload. I'm not afraid of carbohydrates, let's just put it that way and you can't be if you come here. Everything was good and I especially enjoyed my morning bun and cafe au lait. I love places that serve coffee drinks in big bowls! The morning bun was moist, gooey and crispy at the same time. I was surprised by the hint of orange. This is a nice place to treat yourself with some sweets. They definately know what they're doing in the oven.

It's pretty good.  No denying that at all.  Probably deservedly among the top 3 in the city.  But when absolutism comes into the picture, one can't help but admit that it's only that... not divine, better than sex, or worthy of worship, etc. etc. The outstanding (so good they should carry an addiction warning): - Bavarian fruit cake - Banana cream tart - Chocolate eclair - Fruit tart (with vanilla bean custard) - Hot chocolate - Walnut & Country (plain) breads.  Btw, these are not whole grain OR whole wheat, but what the hell... apparently you only live once. The decent (can be hit or miss): - Chocolate chip cookies (maybe they ARE perfect for those that like them this way) - Bread pudding - Sandwiches The outrageous (as in: I can't believe people wait in line and pay atrocious prices for these): - Shortbread - Their wine & beer selection - Couple of other pastries that I forget the names of... All in all, it's my favorite bakery, and a great place to spend the afternoon (and I do...many, many times).  It's just not the best for EVERY thing.

One liner:  I fell in love with this place about a month before it opened and the sex is still great. This place is my favorite authentic-feeling French Bakery in San Francisco.  When they first opened, they had all these supermodel thin looking girls there and everyone was dressed in Mission chic vintage.  About a month later, plumpness set in and they had to rehire "normal" staff to lower the turnover of hysterical modelettes. Now this place just feels comfortable.  They are making mint too with the line out the door on the weekends. The best:   * Bread like an armored rugby ball that tastes the best * Croissants that explode in a symphony of flakes when you break them * Amazing chocolate mocha (super tiny too!) * Croque monseiur and madame * Morning buns done extra right * Bread pudding in huge helpings (the best value per calorie) Pro Tip:  Call and order bread ahead of time and skip the lines.

I'd heard of Tartine and stumbled upon it during a Friday stroll in my neighborhood. I got there just before 5pm, and there was a line almost to the door. Not sure how long it took, maybe 10 or so mins? I didn't mind because I needed time to check out the goods and wasn't in a rush. Not being a huge fan of pastries and sweets, I ended up getting a chocolate-walnut thing (not sure if I'd call it a cookie) and the goat cheese sandwich on walnut bread. The chocolate-walnut cluster thing was pretty gooey and yummy. It was pretty rich so I had to eat it in small bites throughout the afternoon. The goat cheese sandwich was yummy, but was TOO much. I got three HUGE chunks of sandwich (thats six slices of 1" thick walnut bread). It was basically bread and goat cheese, and too hard to eat without pulling apart the sandwich halves. Since I wanted a real sandwich I ended up going to DPC up the street and buying ANOTHER sandwich, which was more than bread and cheese. However, I saved my goat cheese sandwich and ate it in small chunks for three days. It makes a yummy snack...not so sure about it as a sandwich. I'd go back to try other things only if I was in the area and the mood.

Well, don't I feel like such a conformist with this post. Delicious! The turkey and broccoli pesto panini is great, but all of their panini are HUGE, and would definitely be good to split. .... especially so you can leave room for dessert... like apple bread pudding.

Yes, only 3 stars. Why? One reason. The staff tend to have an attitude. Why? Who knows, but it gets old. I lived one block away and never quite understood the stand-offish and hipsteresque vibe, but whatever. Great pastries, snobbish staff. Which is too bad, because it makes everyone in line way too pushy and somewhat panicked. Sometimes I just want to yell: "EVERYONE JUST RELAX!" If they could just loose the "higher-than-thou" mentality, I'd probably say this is hard to beat. Sadly, they don't really care, but they make really good almond croissants.

4 1/2 stars from 1000+ reviewers??? Impossible! I suspected I was totally being set up for disappointment. But Tartine didn't disappoint -- each and every morsel of our assorted breakfast goodies was absolutely amazing. But I can't stop thinking about the croissant aux amandes, which was a lovely flaky, buttery croissant made even more amazing with a sweet and crunchy almond filling/topping. I would love every morning if I could wake up to that!

I shall wait patiently along the sidewalk like all the others for in the end it will be rewarding.  So shall you!  I usually come here with 1 or more friends so I can share as I like so many things on the menu.  I love my MUESLI so I must have a bowl for myself.  The BANANA CREAM TART (with dark chocolate lining all along the inside of the crust) is to die for.  I can do with less cream, but that's why I usually have friends to share the guilt.  The BREAD PUDDING is also amazingly yum.  The CROQUE MONSIEURs are good savory dish and it comes with pickled organic carrots.  Yum, yum, yummmm... I love how they use ORGANIC and LOCAL produce as much as possible.  I also love the fresh flowers adorning the tables.

I'm pretty sure my heart skips a beat whenever I'm within a few blocks of Tartine Bakery.  I've owned their cookbook for sometime now, and am constantly drooling over all their pastries, cakes and cookies.  The evidence of Tartine's goodness is in the line that wraps around the block on weekend mornings... I was finally able to go to the bakery about a month ago, where my eyes immediately glazed over and my heart went a-pitter-patter with happiness.  I immediately had to wipe up my drool off my face.  Some personal favorites: Jambon with Gruyere (Panini) - it's big enough to share with a friend - there is so much cheese and and the grilled panini is perfectly crusted (and buttery-licious).  It even comes with pickled veggies!  Swoon. Gougere: A mini-chocolate BOMB of delicious. Any of the tarts (particularly lemon tart). If you love pastries, stop what you're doing now and GO to Tartine.  Every bite is worth the wait in line.

I had breakfast in the morning here and a round of bread in the afternoon. My breakfast was perhaps the best meal I had in San Francisco this trip. I tried 6 different dishes here, the highlight being the Croque and Chocolate Vanilla Pudding. The Croque can be had a few different ways: plain, ham, cracked egg and mushroom. I had it with ham. It was savory and delicious. Not to be missed. The Chocolate Vanilla Pudding simply was divine. I still remember every bite. I also had the Morning Bun, croissants, Chocolate Hazelnut tart and the Banana Creme Tart. While pretty good, not stellar. In the afternoon some truly fantastic breads are also available. Tasty with a nice crust and soft interior. The only complaint one can have is that it is quite crowded since the food is so good. There is a line to enter and order your food. Once you have your order placed finding someplace to sit is a cutthroat affair. Tartine is not to be missed.

What can be said that hasn't already been said about this fantastic bakery?  Best. Croissants.  Ever!!!   We used to frequent Tartine when i lived in SF, and then had to make special trips across the bridge when my wife and I moved to Marin.  Now, having relocated to Seattle, I had an excuse to come back to SF to visit friends recently, and we made a required Tartine stop.  I bought a bunch of goodies to share with them for brunch; light flakey croissants and the incredible cinnamon rolls were two huge hits.   Everyone was amazed at the quality of the baked goods.  I was surprised they hadn't been to them gem in a while.  Go early, get in line, and enjoy.

I feel like I made an amateur move by getting the chocolate croissant even though I was told to get the bread pudding. But everything worked out fine after a fairly long wait in a line that stretched to the next door neighbors. My cafe au lait was a bit on the cold side too but found a spot to sit and had a wonderful time chatting with a friend.

Finally gave this place a try after reading the reviews on Yelp. I ordered the banana cream tart as well as a coconut cream tart. OMFG, are they delish. I ate half of each tart....in one sitting...it was so good. I probably could've devoured both tarts in one sitting. The fillings were very smooth and flavorful without being too sweet. The crust is very flaky, and the bottom is layered with chocolate...then the filling which is topped with whipped cream. i also swear there was a bit of caramel in it too.. yummm. I just wish these tarts were cheaper! However, the quality is probably worth the $6+. I came by around 3:30 on Friday and there were about 10 people in line. Service is pretty quick, so no worries there. I will have to come back at an earlier time to try the Morning Buns everyone is raving about!

I love everything from their freshly baked pastries to their open faced sandwiches and coffee! My go to items are the fruit tarts, coconut creme and banana cream tarts! And if you want something rich and comforting their chocolate pudding is perfect! These items can be shared but once you have a bite of any of these you would want it all to yourself! Well, the portions are big so better to save some for later! The morning buns and almond croissants are quite delicious even on the next day. I've also tried their pressed sandwiches and they're also very tasty. Great place to chat up with strangers sharing your table or sit outside with the sun out. I could have given this place 5 stars but it's very easy to cough up your whole wallet as the items don't come cheap.

This place will trigger Kid-in-a-Candy-Store Syndrome. I oohed, awed, and drooled over all the goodies on display.  If the staff wasn't watching I probably would have tried to snatch some of those delicious looking baked goods into my bag. Instead I opted for purchasing a morning bun and a massive gougere.  The gougere was a cheesy delicious (hollow) bun of goodness.  A bit pricey at around $4.50 (I believe) but would be a nice snack if you were in the area.  I didn't get a chance to eat the morning bun until the next day but it was still a great treat with all it's cinnamon-sugar yumminess.  The bottom part of the bun where all the sugar has pooled, baked and caramelized into some sort of chewy, sticky concoction was worth the $4.50 alone. My friend sampled the quiche and a cafe au lait which she deemed as excellent choices.  I got a kick out of watching her lap out her coffee out of a huge cup like a cat.  Is that how the French do it?

Bread pudding is too sweet for my taste. Waiting is usually long. My survival mode was turned on and when the server asked me what to order: "the largest bowl of bread pudding that you have, please" and then, I spent my time trying to finish the nice-but-too-sweet bread pudding and try to swallow it down with a glass of water. A small order of the famous bread pudding is nice but not too much. And yes, definitely will be back to try the morning bun....

I was never a fan of Mr. Pizza Man, but my friend insisted that the owner's bakery was much higher quality than his pizza shops, so I gave it a go. First off, this place is not for the claustrophobic, but the ambiance makes up for that. All the staff are dressed up like extreme caricatures of Mission Hipsters. It's actually pretty cute, they go all out, from the greasy $300 haircuts to the handlebar mustaches and even Ben Franklin spectacles. I didn't even know that was a thing. I got an eclair, after my namesake. It was tasty, but seemed a little overfilled with that goo. I could have just suckled the nozzle of their pastry bags for the same effect. But tasty, nonetheless. They only lose a star for making you carry your precarious coffee teacup through this jumbling crowd of people. I can't imagine no one has been scalded/sued here before. Seems like there must be a better way...

The lines at this place are LONG.  Bring a book to pass the time while you stand in line for your pastries and coffee.  Because the lines are so ridiculous, I'd recommend taking your food out, and eating in Dolores Park which is a block or two away, for a more relaxing dining experience.  Otherwise, if you dine in, you will probably have twentysomething hipsters giving you the stink eye if you linger at your table. As far as the food goes, I really liked the large, flaky, buttery, croissant and was less impressed with the almond frangipane tartlet, which was on the dry side.  The cakes look fabulous but everything is kinda pricey, even for a French style boulangerie/patisserie.  If you must experience the San Francisco phenomenon of waiting in line for your weekend breakfast food, Tartine isn't a bad place to do it.  There are better places, but there are worse places too.

This bakery is incredible!  A must-do if you are in the SF area.  Easy location near Dolores Park.  Beware the line can be long and curl around the side of the building.  It is well worth the wait though.  The smell of fresh baked bread and pastries rushes out of the doors, which helps make the line go faster knowing you have so much to look forward to.  It sure tastes as good as it smells!  Go early, as they only bake a certain amount for the day.  After 5 pm fresh bread loaves are fresh out of the oven. We had the famous morning bun, which is kind of like a mild, not as sweet cinnamon roll and croissant all in one.  It has a light cinnamon coating inside and as you take bites you will get hints of orange - it is AMAZING!!! It isn't too sweet either.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with granulated sugar on top.  Mmm.  We also got an almond croissant, which was awesome.  It was hard on the outside and soft inside as well, but was like no other croissant we have ever tasted.  Most croissants are very buttery - this one was not.  It had a layer of almond paste inside and the top was decorated with toasted almonds and powdered sugar.  This was the absolute best croissant ever!!! We went back the next day for more - this time we went at the latter part of the day and they ran out of almond and chocolate croissants and morning buns.  We ended up getting an amazing roll with gruyere cheese, thyme and salt and pepper inside. It was really good. Need to go back for that croissant though.

Pretty sure the people watching is the best part--Tartine is like a hipster fishing hole. I don't mind paying a premium for super popular, supposedly super good bread, sandwiches and pastries, but man... The Croque Monsieur was just ok, actually barely passable. Was told to buy some sourdough because it's THE BEST in SF but there was none for sale and none baking?!? Confused and disappointed was me. Took home a roll w/ Gruyere and cracked pepper for the fiance and it was the best of the items but still...no thank you.

Browsing through my reviews, I noticed that I have never reviewed this place.  Not that my reviews are anything but me babbling about how much I love sugar and everything else come second. Anyhoo...I've been here hella times for the AMAZING fresh MORNING BUNS that are literally TO DIE FOR (come early cause they run out), as well as the CROISSANTS (both almond and the ham/cheese), the INCREDIBLE BANANA CREAM TART and also the berry brioche BREAD PUDDING...and of course the quiche.  Been here much? uh...chea! This review is for the... ***AMAZING DELICIOUS LEMON CREAM TART*** Those that know me know how much I LOVE lemon desserts. I've never tried the lemon tart. I would always get their lemon BAR. Hella-Hella yummy btw. But HOLY HOLINESS! This tart is gooooooood. It's like the fancy mother in her nice heals compared to the young lemon bar. Naturally, I like more of a thick buttery and flaky pie crust, but goddamnit!!! The lemon cream was soooooo smooth...sooooo creamy... and sweet and tart at the same time. O' TARTINE.

WTF!!!!!!! I don't get why people like this place. The food is HORRIBLE! I went once 3.5 years ago and didn't get it then. I went again this last weekend. With a friend we ordered some cheese bread I don't remember the name, some chocolate cake like substance and the bread pudding. The bread was about the blandest cheese bread I've ever eaten. The chocolate cake was dry and the bread pudding was really eggy and flavorless. I can only guess that it's peer pressure that keeps this place going. People vote it up to feel cool about knowing a unique place rather then whether or not the food is good.

I've had the morning bun and the bread pudding here and enjoyed every single bite. The place is usually packed with the line going out the door. If the morning bun was warmed before they served it, they'd probably be to die for. But the bun wasn't warm so it tasted just alright. The bun itself was almost the size of my hand. The orange cinnamon sugar was delicious and finger licking good! I liked all my fingers after I was done. The food here is undeniably good but for the price tag, it's more of a treat than a staple. I will be back though, to try the cakes. Word of advice to people who go to get coffee, walk directly to the coffee/espresso counter to the right and skip the crazy line on the left!

I need to come back!  There was so much good stuff here and I just wasn't able to try it all.  Ugh. Croissant - very good and moist and buttery Mexican wedding cookie - a solid performance Dark chocolate chip oatmeal with nuts - not that great, it was super thin and super crispy which is just not how I usually like my cookies so I'll skip this one next time On the list to try: the sandwiches, the tarts, and the morning bun I was a bit disappointed in the wait staff though.  They were the unhappiest people on earth.  The system is that one guy puts your stuff in brown paper bags and puts them on a table behind the cashier.  Then the cashier rings you up.  As I was in line I thought "wow, all those identical paper bags stacked up on that table - pretty impressive they can keep track of which bag belongs to which customer"  well nope....they can't.  They messed up our orders and proceeded to give us dirty looks for it as we paid. Booo.

Came here in high anticipation of their pastries but, as a native SoCal girl, I've got to say up front that Tartine has nothin' on Porto's. That being said, their lemon tart is really, truly amazing. Just the right amount of zing in the cream that was complemented by their perfectly baked crust. Their less-than-stellar eats were the fruit tart (which only had raspberries and blackberries and ZERO glaze), bread pudding, and coconut cream tart. Don't get me wrong, they were decently good but not good enough to wait in line for. In the end, the lemon tart definitely won over my heart.

Just stand outside and you'll get a pretty good sense of why it's consistently rated so high. We came here around 11:30 for a brunch/lunch-ish thing and although the wait was long, the tables freed up pretty quickly. Food: Chocolate croissant - deliciously puff and the pastry was soooo mouthwatering delicious. The chocolate inside was bittersweet, which gives a great balance to the pastry. 4/5 Lemon tart - OMG. I've never had anything so good and I don't even like lemon desserts. The crust was very buttery, the lemon filling was just the right amount of tart, and the cream dollop on top really rounds out the dessert perfectly. 5/5 Chocolate hazelnut tart - It's like a brownie in a tart shell! The hazelnuts on top added to the whole tart and you can really taste the hazelnut flavor. 4/5 Croque Monsieur - It's an open face ham and cheese sandwich that is out of this world. My mouth still waters from it freshly baked out of the oven. 5/5 Pastrami Pressed Sandwich - The pastrami was so juicy and the horseradish gives the whole sandwich a great kick. 5/5 If you want to get coffee or drinks only, bypass the long line and go directly to their drinks counter in the back. The pressed sandwiches can take quite a while, so just to forewarn those that later on want to complain about the wait. It was well worth it. LOVE this place. Oh and FYI- prices are definitely on the high side so it's not something that I would frequent even though I'm living in the city. It's more like special occasions prices.

So back in my first review, I talked about how my friend introduced me to this place along with two other places and that every time I think of either place, I think of her and the adventures we would have together. She couldn't get enough of their croissants. In fact, when she moved to Paris, she said the croissants here were almost as good as the ones there. Maybe even better... that conversation was like two years ago. I've only been here four or five times, the most recent being last week. I had bookmarked this place a long time ago and left the following note: "Great food but hipster heaven." Now after going back, I have to retract that statement. Last week, it was more like yuppie heaven and former yuppies who are too old to be called yuppies but still have the superiority and money of one. Then again, I went before noon and as we all know, hipsters don't get up until noon just to be ironic. (I kid, I kid... I don't think anyone knows what a hipster is anymore and just like to throw it out to anyone who's pretentious... but that's not really the case... and I prefer hipsters over yuppies any day.) To be honest, there was a mix of people there, as you would expect from the gentrified Mission nowadays. The croissants are fucking awesome. That almond-filled frangipane (or something similarly spelled) croissant is great and the regular croissant is still really, really good. The food is five stars for sure. The major problems I have with this place is that it's too popular. I know, how can you really blame a bakery or any establishment for having quality products and having loyal fans? The thing is if a place is really popular, the smart entrepreneurs will find a way to upgrade their service by either relocating, hiring more help, or redesigning so that the place is more efficient. The line is just uncalled for. If I have to wait in line for more than twenty minutes, and still not even be able to find seats, then I'm sorry... that just doesn't cut it with me. Sure, the people who work there are cool, but that place is just too cramped for the amount of people that come here. They're lucky that their food is just really, really great. I just don't like the fact that I can't sit down and enjoy their food right away. I'll still come here whenever I'm in the neighborhood that early or when I need to introduce friends to their products, but I'm in no rush. When I go to Tartine, I buy a lot of stuff because I know I won't come back for another year or so and I need to get my fix satiated... and coming to Tartine is definitely an experience with both good and bad mixed in. If you don't mind long lines and love great pastries and desserts, this place is great. And even if you don't, I'd suggest going on a day when your tolerance level is pretty high (or when the line isn't ridiculously long) because it's worth it to go at least once.

This is another one of those places I have to ask "Why the constant line?" Yes, it's the only place of it's kind in the neighborhood.  (Read ... any pastry chef worth their muster could make a killing anywhere nearby.)  The pastries are good, but just good.  My bread pudding is way better.  Table seating is extremely limited and to be truthful the outdoor seating is crappy.  Crammed onto the sidewalk at the corner of busy car traffic, constant pedestrians and smelly bums is not a pleasant place to eat even if the food is good.  I really don't get the fascination.  We always get ours to go that is if the line isn't insane which is not often.  It's also not cheap. The service is at best abrupt.  I get they are constantly busy and the crowd can be annoying.  How long must one stand in line before they can make a decision about ordering?  Still, it doesn't excuse the need for smiles and a welcoming attitude. Given that it's the only business of it's kind for quite literally over a mile around, it's better than no french bakery in the hood.  I really do wish someone would open some real competition nearby.  It would ease the crowds and cause Tartine to step up its game in terms of food and cost.

Everyone knows this place is the best. Don't let the long lines scare you, it goes quick. Make sure you get the bread pudding, and if you're lucky enough to be there on banana day get ready.

I saw this place on Food Network's The best thing I ever ate. The Pain Au Chocolat was featured on it as the best thing this one Chef ever ate. Well I love CHOCOLATE and Croissants so this was a must try for me. My boyfriend and I got here around 11am on a Thursday. The line wasn't too bad but it was a little bit out the door. Seating is limited. It's very much like a coffee shop with an amazing bakery inside. Of course my boyfriend and I tried the Double Pain Au Chocolat. I also ordered two regular croissants to take home for my parents. OMG. To Die For! It was so crispy and the chocolate was divine! It was really flakey and I got it all over the place including my hair. So ladies, be careful! LOL. It was very buttery and it had the perfect amount of chocolate to croissant. I just wish it was warm. I loved it and I cant wait to be back and try all their other yummy goodies.

Okay so they changed their wall decor.  I was a little sad by that, but that also might've been the rain. ANYWAYS, that was all whisked away as soon as I got my croissant.  Seriously their croissant can pick me up from any bad day, SO GOOD.  If I lived within walking distance to Tartine I would die an early, buttery death.  Hear it, smell it, pull it, let your eyes do the tasting, and then cut out all other senses and eat it. If there is anything you try at Tartine, get a croissant.  If you don't like croissants, this should change your opinion.  If you still don't like it, there is something seriously wrong with you - get it checked out. Rainy days, whatever. I got my Tartine.

I've been wanting to come here for so long... Approximately 5 years now. And I can't tell if the suspense has been built up for so long that my taste buds were expecting something spectacular or what. But I cant help but say that I was slightly disappointed. I'm definitely gonna need to try Tartine again and this time try several options... The one dessert I did happen to try while on my virgin trip was the banana creme pudding tart. The actual creme and banana was enjoyable, but I found the crisp shell way too hard. Perhaps I came too late in the day?? (3pm) and perhaps the dessert had been sitting out for way too long? Who knows... The shell was so crisp that every time I tried cutting into it, the flakes would pop off and shoot off onto the table and worse, sometimes the floor! I wound up eating the tart as a bowl with a spoon... :-( Guess I'll just have to come back again!!

Line started outside the café when we first arrived, but we only had to wait for approximately 5mins before we got to order.  So it was a short wait. I got the Chai Latte and mushroom with tomato quiche.  The quiche was not bad and the Chai Latte was pretty good.  Not too many places served Chai Latte, so I was really happy to find out they served it here.  The Latte was served in a large ceramic bowl (not cup).  It was really nice and comforting (perfect for our first stop in sf). My friends got the fruit bread pudding, morning bun, lemon cream tart and the chocolate croissant.  They all seem to like it a lot.  The environment was casual and relaxing with a lot of sf locals.  One side note - they had this really cool "bread" chandelier that I could not stop staring at the entire time... lol.. I wish I have one in my house.

Totally worth the 15 minute wait!!! I'm really sad that I missed the morning buns. So sad..... But the rest the stuff was sssssooooo friggin' good!! The place is a little small so don't plan on actually eating in the shop, especially when there is a huge crowd which is often. The scone was delicious!!! The croissant was delicious and flaky!!! I want more!!!! The tarts all good!!! They were perfectly flavored and sweet that it wasn't too empowering. The lemon meringue to me was the only thing i didn't like. It was salty so that was weird to me..... I can't wait to wait another 15-45 minutes to get more delicious pastry items!!!!

I'm a pain au chocolat kind of guy, but since lots of people rave about the Morning Bun, I had to give it a go. Sooo delicious -- flaky layers of pastry with drizzles of light sticky drizzles of cinnamon and sugar. With a nice cup of coffee and a little time to drift and people watch, it's a wonderful way to start the morning. I have also tried the banana cream tart here. Unbelievable!! The banana custard is lovely, but it's the surprise at the bottom of chocolate and caramel that takes me into dessert ecstasy. Oh... my... gawd...

This place is so famous - I had to try it on a recent trip to sf. Unfortunately, I went here in the afternoon (after lunch and bi-rite) so there wasn't a huge selection of baked goods to take home and we weren't in the mood to sit down and have coffee/order things. But I did take home some brownies, biscotti and other goodies and it was loved by all. I need to come back to have the banana cream tart and the morning buns!

This place was packed on this Sunday rainy afternoon. The rain had briefly stopped for an hour or two and I would have thought people would have stayed home and relaxed. Apparently it did NOT stop this place from filling up and having no sitting room. Coconut cream pie I like to give this a 6 stars out of 5. I love coconut and I can't say I'm too big of a cream person. This one hits the spot for me and ME LIKEY. I think this was my favorite item. Banana cream pie This one deserved a 4/5. It was good but not Coconut cream pie fantastic :) Now I'm not saying don't try it, just make sure you try the other pie first. tres leches?? This cake was ok for me. My friends liked it a lot more than I did. This didn't seem like anything special to me. I'm just glad someone else liked it. Overall I like this place a lot. I will definitely visit again if I am in the area. The sandwiches look pretty good. I might have to try that next time. Until next time ....

Decadent doesn't even begin to describe Tartine Bakery. This place is paradise; everything they make is so amazing! Granted, there is probably enough butter in all their baked goods to give you a heart attack, but you only live once! You gotta try all their cakes, pudding and bread. I've not had one thing there I didn't like. Most recently, my friend Dustin and I spent a rainy day here with a slice of tres leches cake and two glasses of sparkling rose (that's right they serve booze as well). PERFECTION! Of course something this good gets super busy, and they do run out of things. Nothing unmanageable but just food for thought. Tartine Bakery is simply the darling of the Mission. ~A

Tasted my first bread pudding here. It was good but after a few bites, it got a little too sweet that a friend and I didn't even finish the one serving. Was looking forward to Banana Cream tart but I guess they don't make it on Mondays. Morning Buns were good. That I really enjoyed, specially while they're warm. This place gets crowded so come early or if you plan to come around lunch time, make sure you're not starved or you'll pass out while waiting in line.

The line was super long but went by pretty quickly!!! so that was a plus.  I'm not a big fan of pastries but since this place was on the top 100 places to try in SF, my bf and I decided to try it.   THE MUST EAT: 1. bread pudding (not too sweet, not too bready, not too much pudding, just the right amount of fruits and delicious in every way.  I got the cup size and they give you so much. ) 2. Morning Bun (just the right amount of sweetness, i liked the crispy shell the most) 3. fresh squeezed orange juice (literally tasted like i was eating an orange) THE "YOU CAN DO WITHOUT": 1. the chocolate croissants (nothing special, it was super flaky though if that is what you like) overall: pretty good, it was worth the wait ( i waited ~15-20mins)

Without a doubt, this is THE best "French" bakery in San Francisco. It is more likely the best in California and probably one of the best in the entire country. Yeah it is that good! Here are a few of the amazing items they offer: - Loaf of bread. They make about 170 of them from Wed through Sun. There are just amazing & I do get mine every week. - Croissants. They are literally to die for :D. They are buttery, crispy, hot out of the even... everything you are looking for when you should get a croissant actually. - Double pain au chocolat (or pain au chocolat). They are a good alternative to croissant and are as amazing. - Morning buns. if you are more in a salty mood they also offer amazing quiche and open side sandwich. But you should come back for their pastries! Quality if definitely part of this place. And there is two great book about this bakery you might want to consider if you want to know more about them:   - Tartine (http://www.amazon.com/Ta…) - Tartine Bread (http://www.amazon.com/Ta…) No wifi here but I think the only think you would like to think about when you are there is to indulge and enjoy the food you just get isn't it? Disclaimer: I'm French :-) ============================== Pros: - Best bakery EVER! Loaf of bread, croissant, pain au chocolat. The list is almost endless... - Well located. Close to Bart and to Dolores park. What a better location to enjoy a nice pastries on a sunny day with a beautiful view on the city? - Friendly staff. Line move fasts actually. Cons: - Huge lines, especially during peak time. - Place is too small if you would like to eat he, getting a table can quickly become a challenge. - Parking can be also tricky is this area of the Mission. Cedric's secret advice: - best time of the day to go there and avoid the crowd? out of peak time. So either very early in the morning (before 9am) and mid-afternoon (3-5pm) during weekdays. And definitely not on weekends! - how to get you bread every week and avoid lines? Give them a call before 3pm the day you would like your bread and then pick it up after 5pm. You can then bypass the line and go straight to the cash register :-) Cedric's favorite combo: - A slice of their Sesame bread, put in a toaster for a minute to get it warm, and then topped with Nutella :-) YUM!

Went here on Friday afternoon for lunch.. The place was busy but moving right along.. We had 2 pressed sandwiches: jambon royale and a sopressata with fontina.. Both sandwiches were amazing and large..I purchased the coconut cream tart  and the bread pudding which I had to eat later because I was full. The desserts were absolutely amazing! I am looking forward to the next time already...

After hearing all the hype about Tartin Bakery we decided to take a morning drive to see why everyone is giving 5 stars to this restaurant. Finding parking to get to Tartine Bakery could be a mission but we were able to get here during the weekday right after the breakfast crunch. This bakery was choked full of tourist, hipsters and locals enjoying a cup of brew or a morning pastry. We ordered the Croque Monsieur with sliced turkey breast and sun dried tomatoes it was one of the better ones i've had but a few of the pastries can be overwhelming and over rated as well. We also order the Banana Creme Tart which was good but the crust was so hard you could only eat the Creme inside, I'm not sure if it was suppose to be this way so that you can put it in the palm of your hand or it was just sitting out all morning. Everyone who has given this place a 5 star rating has never been to Thomas Kellers Buschon Bakery which is simply amazing if you have had the chance to try it next time you are in Vegas or NYC. All in all I gave this a 3.5 but I would have to come back again to try the rest of the buzz. Also don't forget to Bus your own tables since there are no waiters at this establishment! We had to pour our own water, Seat our selves, Put away our dirty plates and wipe our own tables.

Went to this place three time this past year, the most recent was two weeks ago. I could have given this place three stars because of the long lines (at least 1/2 hour wait), hard to find free parking and a few items were not that great (morning bun, frangipane tart).  Raise it up to 4stars because of the freshness and price.  I had the eclair before which was really good and cookies (save it the next day and it was still moist and fresh). But the five star (you have to be there early, before 11am) is the Double pain au chocolat . . . claude van DAM! Flaky, crispy, buttery crust on the outside and rich chocolate inside.  Excellent!

If I could walk in and out of Tartine in 10 minutes for a morning bun, they would get 5 stars.  I would go every day for one until I weighed 300 pounds.   Their Mexican wedding cookies are also worth dying for. But frankly nothing else on their menu that I've tried (latte, gouchere, and bread pudding) is worth waiting for.  The space is also impossibly small, so good luck getting seated if you have more than 2 people in your party.  Either way, you'll get cozy with someone at Tartine (either in line, or sharing a table with someone).

Hands down one of my favorite Bakeries in the CITY. Coming from a baker's POV they do all their stuff just right! I've gotten the lemon tart, hazelnut tart, devil's chocolate cake, morning bun, ham and cheese croissant, banana cream pie, and the chocolate chip cookie with oatmeal. Their morning buns are too die for! Crispy on the outside and soft and warm in the middle! Yumm! This must be eaten the same day, its not good the next day. The banana cream pie is soo good, with slices of banana in the pie and a flaky pie crust. Cannot go wrong with that. If you get anything chocolate at their place, it's going to be rich and decadent. It's more of a dark chocolate taste vs. milk chocolate. Get here early, they tend to run out of things quick and their is always a line! Been here many many times when going to the city!

My bf's fav chocolate croissant ... They open at 9AM on Sunday, which I thought was a little late for a bakery and apparently everyone else did too and wished they were open earlier because when we arrived at 8:30AM there was already a line about 15-20 people deep.  Standing in line and being tortured by the smells of sugar and butter was just cruel so by the time we made it inside we were ready to order everything! We even endured an awkward moment when we ordered the remaining 4 chocolate croissants and everyone behind us in line suddenly became not so friendly =) -Double pain au chocolat $4.25 ... the best thing and a must get ... perfectly flaky and copious amounts of butter! -Banana cream tart $6.50 ... you have to get this also because the banana tart was probably the best I've had ... it's delicious! -Hazelnut tart $?? .... good but if you have to choose go for the banana cream tart. -Lemon cream tart $?? ... also good and an alternative if you're not a chocolate kind of person.   -Chocolate chip cookie $?? ... meh ... it's a thin crunchy kind of cookie, which is not what I prefer so it was my least favorite.   By the time we left with our goodies in hand the line was SOOO LONG ... down the block ... must of been 40 people deep! The line seemed to move quickly so if you've never been I'd still highly recommend suffering through the wait.

Not for the carbo-phobes!  This place is carbohydrate heaven.  Breads, pastries, cookies, etc. etc. etc.  They have it all at this place and EVERYTHING looks really good.   I did not feel like spending my life savings on eggs, flour and water, so I opted for one sweet and one savory, a slice of the ham quiche and a chocolate croissant.  Both were crispy, light, and excellent.  I also got to taste the croque monsieur and morning bun.  Both of those are definitely on my ordering list for the next visit, along with the lemon cream pie and the giant chocolate chip cookie.   The place is definitely a little on the pricey side, but everything I tasted was amazing.  I guess you cant put a price on amazing right?   Parking is ridiculous, especially on the weekends.  Delfina and Bi-Rite are right around the corner and are just as popular as this place, so there is definitely some competition for the limited street parking.  Bring a friend, drop them off to wait in line with your order, find parking and meet them inside.

I hate to hate on such an establishment but it really does baffle me why the line is so ridiculously long here. We arrived on a rainy Sunday at 11:30 and there was a line out the door. Not unreasonable but I expected it. I made the tartine bread pudding and it was really good but I really wanted to try the real deal. We ordered a cup of the bread pudding, the morning bun, the pain au chocolat, a quiche and the croque monsieur. We were given a separate plate for the morning bun, the p.a.c, the bread pudding and then our coffee order arrived. The problem is, there were no seats available. So we were balancing our plates when our quiche arrived too. I definitely got to practice my waitressing skills. Finally we found a table that was available and sat down although given there was a backlog of eat-in patrons, we felt compelled to eat quickly. The morning bun was... good. The pain au chocolat was delicious and flaky. I was really excited to try the bread pudding but after holding it for so long it was good but not as warm as it should have been. The quiche was artichoke and the crust was light and buttery. My favorite dish was the croque monsieur. It was freshly made and the gruyere and bechamel combination was heavenly. Their brioche is light and flaky. Yum... The people there are super friendly given the circumstances. I'm sure they're used to the weekend rush. In conclusion - if the weather's nice, take your food to go. Better yet, if you live in the neighborhood, take it home. However, I would probably not make another weekend pilgrimage back if I had to sit in the cafe.

Amazing...  amazing... amazing... The food was incredible. We went because my wife was starving and we just bought a car and were in the dealership for HOURS. This was just down the street. The food - incredible. The only negative - the long wait (but EVERYBODY was here to buy food) but the food was soooooo incredible, natural/organic and tasted truly amazing that I can't not give them 5 stars. We had the lemon meringue cake and the paradise fruit covered in coconut and cream cake... holy sh** they were sexual. Fluffy and melt-in-your mouth amazing. We also had a mushroom and a smoked ham croque (sp?) open-faced sandwich on their incredible crunchy/toasted bread. Unbelievable. Well worth the wait as was obvious with everyone else in line.

I usually come here around 9am on a weekday and most of the time theres a line almost out the door. Everything here looks so delicious, I want to try everything! I usually order the morning bun, fruit bread pudding, some kind of cheese with bread, quiche or almond croissant.  They're all pretty good but for some reason the last few times I ordered the almond croissant it was very burnt on the top and the last time I went there I actually checked before ordering the croissant and every single one of them were burnt on the top! I don't know why...... maybe they should check their oven. all in all this place is still pretty damn good but it is also pretty damn expensive

I've heard so much about how wonderful this little bakery is.  San Francisco cafes have great ambiance, but sometimes lack the food quality that other cities might have.  I really miss Almondine and Levain Bakery in New York.  I was hoping for a taste of that with Tartine.  Once I got to the front door, I could already feel the trendy vibe.  The lines were long, and many of the items did look appealing.  It didn't help that there weren't enough workers or that flies were making these baked goods look a whole lot less delicious.   I heard that the large chocolate chip cookie at Tartine might be one of the best in the entire city.  My friend was so excited about the crispy exterior and gooey interior.  It was important that I didn't come late because oftentimes the cookies don't taste fresh, so we wouldn't be giving them a fair chance.  The problem with this cookie is that it doesn't matter if you're a soft or hard kind of cookie lover.  This 28 year-old kitchen tile with chips inside of it was one of the worst "sweets" my friend has ever had.  It's unbelievable that people would rate such a disgusting cookie as one of the best because it is large.  The dirty tile was so thin that the width didn't seem to matter.  Your teeth would fall out after the first bite.  Don't intentionally make your cookies stale just to be trendy!  The ingredients apparently did not taste fresh either.  Unfortunately, the service was not that efficient or welcoming to make up for it. The only reason this place gets two stars is because the cafe looks like a fun spot to people watch, and some of the other items might be better.  I'm not sure if I really want the fly hand-me-downs though.  Try Specialty's or Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous...

I have been planning to go this bakery and finally made it on April 27 2012. Line was long but moving fast. My friends and I ordered:  pain um jambon = excellent, bread pudding = best I've ever had, banana cream pie = to die for!! Unfortunately the following were disappointments: double pain au chocolat =over baked ,taste a little bitter and the chocolates were outside of the crust, morning bun = dry and over baked too, LaFarines' ( in Oakland ) is better, lemon bar = overly sweet!  I'm still a fan and will be back to try other bakery goods, especially their breads.

Is writing a review of Tartine Bakery required for Yelp membership? It seems like it. I've never had anything here I didn't like. That qualifies for as good as it gets, right? Granted, it's well nigh impossible to find parking around here and the seating situation is a every man for himself ordeal, but that shouldn't take away from the awesome baked goods they pump out here. I guess the great thing about Tartine is that you're meant to take it with you, and you can head over to Dolores Park and eat it there if it's sunny. Otherwise just roll up with someone else driving and do a hit-and-run Tartine run. The croissants are tres bien. The almond croissants are also tres bien. The chocolate croissants, while also being excellent, could do with a little more chocolate inside. It's not like I'm expecting a whole chocolate bar wrapped in buttery, flaky dough, but more than a few morsels would be great. The banana cream tarts here are fantastic. I'd fight a wolverine if it came near me while I was eating one. The gougeres are almost incomparable. The pressed sandwiches will not disappoint. If you're reading this, you're not really deciding whether or not to come here, so what's the dealbreaker? You don't like the Mission? You feel like the feng shui of this bakery is wrong? OK, I don't want to hype up this place too much if this happens to be the only review you read on this place, so my overall evaluation is, "yeah, if you're in the area, go ahead and drop in."

I know everyone raves about their morning buns, but alas I have not had a chance to try them because I am obsessed with their croissants that I never care to order anything else.  I've had both the regular and the almond and they are both excellent.  Light and flaky and so wonderfully buttery--they're so good...it hurts.  I know I need to branch out and try other things on the menu, but really, why mess with perfection? If I could have a Tartine croissant and a Four Barrel coffee (which they also serve) at least every week, I'd be a happy camper.

This place already has 3080 reviews, well, I'll make it 3081! Came here today for the first time with a friend at about 11am, and definitely braced ourselves with having to wait. As we drove by, we didn't even look for the "Tartine Bakery" sign, as the buttery aroma in the air led us to this gem! Turned the corner and got parking less than half a block away! What luck! When we got there, we weren't exactly sure if we were at the correct place, as there was absolutely NO line. Looked at the glass and saw a bunch of morning buns! We were definitely at the right place! The girl that placed my order and worked at the register were nice, no complaints! What I Ordered: -- Double pain au chocolat: called double for a reason. 2 semi-melted chocolate panels in the croissant, providing chocolatey goodness in every bite. The croissant was extremely buttery and flakey. Warning! Don't order this if you're on a date  and are trying to be presentable, the flakiness of the croissant will get ALL over the place, and stuck in your teeth! If you don't, proceed and don't worry, everyone elses is exactly the same! Best croissant I've ever had, seriously. -- Morning bun (x2): The outside is hard and reminds me of a palmier cookie, possibly because its essentially the same concept, and crossed with a cinnamon bun which you'll see more of as you spiral and reach the middle. It had a very light taste of orange zest, and I think it would've been better with more of it. -- Rocher with cocoa nib: It was fun while it lasted. Meringue with cocoa pieces. Don't think I'd get it again, though. -- House iced-tea: Tasted like an iced chai tea, minus the milkiness. YUM! I anticipated to eat all of this during our sitting, with the exception of 1 of the morning buns purchased for someone else. Let's just say, I overestimated myself and ended up boxing all but 1 of the items, oops!  I'm definitely a sweets kind of girl, but will try something savory during my next visit! :)

Note: this review is only for the take-away morning buns, not for the experience of actually sitting down and having coffee/food.  I took off a star simply because every time I've walked past at a normal "coffee" hour, the place seemed so packed it wasn't worth it to stop in. There are a few bakery items from the Bay Area I miss dearly, and tops on that list are morning buns (which are starting to spread in popularity across the US, thanks to Starbucks) and Dutch Crunch Bread. Anyway, the Tartine morning buns in question were also "scored" (yes, scored) right around opening, so there weren't huge lines to contend with, and they were hot and at their peak of awesomeness, although I would gladly eat a 3 day old one.  They were, in a word, epic.  Unlike the goods sold by other fine purveyors of morning buns, Tartine's have a distinctive orange-peel flavor, something I have not encountered elsewhere.  Swirls of light, fluffy, buttery croissant pastry enrobed in the perfect mix of cinnamon sugar, candied orange peel, and general deliciousness...  Yes, they are crazy pricey for what they are like everything else in this gourmet corridor (Bi-Rite, I'm looking at you), but I haven't found a breakfast pastry that quite matches its awesomeness yet....

I don't get uber psyched about baked goods but I came here in need of an afternoon pick me up and got a chocolate eclair intending to save half of it for my bf and ate the entire thing it was so good! Still dreaming about it... They know their stuff. It helps that they always use Vahlrona chocolate. They staff are friendly and I like that you bus your own tables.

The sandwiches seemed a bit pricey, but it is SF and everyone seemed to enjoy their sandwiches. So I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. I came mainly for sweets and tried the Lemon Cream Tart & Banana Cream Tart. I loved both, but the Banana Cream was especially amazing! Even hours later the crust was not soggy and I liked that. I can't wait to make another trip :]

So very, very good. Every time we go it is a SERIOUS struggle trying to decide on what we should get. We've tried the... morning bun - soft, sugary, with a hint of orange, caramelized at the bottom to add to the amazing goodness, in short: to-die-for croissant - good, standard croissant scones - we got two, and ate them on the car ride home banana cream tart - can I just say that ALL of their tarts are perfectly baked, crispy and deliciously hidden with chocolate? yes, this one is no exception frangipane tart - so yummy, would buy again lemon cream tart - love lemon-filled-anything, this is a definite must And we will be trying much more... The only thing we were a little disappointed about was the fact that we couldn't buy bread in the mornings (only after 5pm...). It also sucks that every time we go we get stuck in front of a really pushy, uptight customer who is waiting for his/her turn but you can tell they are FURIOUS that we are marveling over the delectable pastries. However, these downsides could never keep us away from the morning bun.

Let me say it is worth the wait. I've been hearing review of tartine forever and I finally got to go myself. I went at 1:30ish in the afternoon on a Sunday expecting the worst for the infamous line that I have heard all about. It wasn't that bad at all! Only to the doorway and we got our food pretty darn fast. Yes it was later in the afternoon but still everyone always complains about the line. I got the morning bun and quiche. I've heard wonders about their bread pudding but I'm not a huge bread pudding kind of gal so we ordered differently. As I was walking up to the cash register I saw the bread pudding, just looking at it has changed my mind for next time I go. I looks so damn good I need to have a bite of that in my mouth. The morning bun was good, I wish it was warm though. Anybody know if they will warm it up for you? The quiche was also good and savory. I'm also not a huge quiche fan but I ate that up fast. The girl was really nice and said since the quiche slices were so small she would give us two. We opened the box when we sat down to eat and holy crap those pieces were not small! We also ordered just a regular coffee. I wouldn't typical review this but I was shocked. The coffee came out of those self-serve coffee containers. My experience with those is that the coffee is gross and luke warm. This coffee had a nice flavor and nice and hot still!

This place is a victim of "too much of a good thing." Yes, they have probably the best pastries and sandwiches money can buy, however this has created long lines for customers and a superiority complex among the staff. I come here once in a while for a special treat, but it's certainly not a place I'd like to frequent regularly.

Even just thinking about their Morning bun makes my mouth water and not in that way your mouth waters after a bad bout of food poisoning.

The Croque Monsieur strangely came with sundried tomatoes and with barely a lick of mustard, so I think 'ham sandwich' is a more accurate description. The lengthy-but-quick line that snaked past the crowded tables was a bit of a turnoff, and not really conducive to a relaxing breakfast. Still, bonus points for being a proper bakery and having all the pastries I miss so dearly.

Tartine is ALWAYS crowded. Partly for the food and partly because it's just trendy. I found it to be hit or miss, but when you get the good stuff, it's heaven. I love the scones, almond croissants, morning buns and green salad. The cakes looks terrific, but I've never had them. While the pain au chocolat have great chocolate used in it, the pastry itself isn't the same melt-in-your-mouth delicate like the ones I've had in France. But really, how often do you get the perfect one ouside of the country itself? I also think they're heavy-handed with the bechamel sauce and it kinda ruins the sandwiches. Other than that- if you can find a place to sit and enjoy your meal- it's worth the wait.

Unbelievable - you haven't lived until you've eaten here.  The place easily pulls off the food/taste/feel of an authentic French bakery. I think you would definitely be hard pressed for a similar bakery in the city; trust me - it's all worth the wait - my favorite is probably the mexican wedding cookies - I actually would recommend the sandwiches too, but you need to be a fan of cheese if you order them.

I am jaded, I will admit it right here-but nothing comes close to the Morning Bun-NOTHING! (not my exceptional baking skills, nor my moms or nana's for that matter!) Tartine bakers use an incredible real orange glaze with mini-disco sugar laid in between the layers, and when taken with a freshly made latte, is pure heaven on the tongue. The chocolate eclairs are fabulous-the pastry is perfection and they use a semi-sweet dark chocolate which I prefer-my only complaint is that since I am eclair queen and have had them here and abroad, I would think the custard should be thicker. When slurping up the eclair, it shoots out because its liquidy- Just give it up on finding a seat- its not worth hovering over the lucky ones who managed to find seating. I don't mind waiting in the ten minute line, and I certainly don't mind parking my butt nearby or walking to the park with my baked treasures.

I don't care if the line is long, I don't care if you think I am wrong, Tartine has the baked goods I desire, my passion for pastries has never been higher, I love this Bakery for all that they make, When I get here early - their goodies I take. Seriously, I love you Tartine.  I just found you and I know now that I won't lose this damn 15 lbs for a really long time... but that's cool.  If you stop making the Meringue with Coco Nibs I will hunt you down for the Slaughter, oh, um... I mean - Yum!  Way to go! Also must mention, the bread pudding is lovely in the morning with the fruit on it - but the savories... oh just kill me with a bite of anything in my mouth.  Sigh - Bliss.

The croissant with almonds was superb. The sandwiches yummy and the chocolate pudding - heaven! The not so good thing - the latte...cold and boring. not a good thing. I would have given this a 5 stars had it not been for the latte.

This place is flippin' amazing. So amazing that I actually read Kate K's entire review wondering why she didn't give it 5 stars and I gotta ask... Did ya try the uhhhh... food? I really do not enjoy waiting in lines - in fact I hate it. Fighting for a place to sit in a dinky restaurant with zillions of other people watching the tables with hawk-like countenance... Not for me! Once my teeth sink into that first bite of a Tartine quiche it all washes away... The coffee is - I think - the best I have had in the city yet. Every single item I have purchased from this place has made me blurt out some form of expletive upon the first bite. When I am sitting there with my fresh baked snacky-treat of wonder and some piping hot coffee, I am in another world far from anything fake or mass produced. Worth the wait or any possible stress this restaurant could possibly exhibit. Top notch and a must see if you have never been. Stop in even if only to gaze with wide-eyed wonder at the treats that lie safely behind the glass case.

Okay, so I had been waiting in line so many times to walk away disappointed - never making it inside, as I would not even consider waiting in line for pastries... yes, staring into the window, watching others laugh and giggle as they devoured their tarts, cookies and other delectables... but, this time, I did. And when I entered the doorway (after a 20 minute wait outside), I could smell the sweet and savoriness of fresh bakes goods.  We had the blah svoudngoidig or something like that.  I had the vegetable one (shitakke mushrooms) and dried tomatoes... mmmm, mushrooms. I would wait again.

I've been to Tartine 5-6 times now and have never left disappointed.  On the other hand, I have arrived disappointed by the ubiquitous line that seems to flow out the door, but that's more my timing than the fault of Tartine's.  If you consider going to Tartine, try arriving before 11am, that way you can avoid the line. At Tartine, you can get a great meal for two people for less than what you would spend at most diners in the city, and mind you, the majority of those diners couldn't match the quality.   A Croque Monsieur (Ham), a jambon croissant, a chocolate croissant and a cup of coffee will run you around $20 and you and your mate will leave decently satisfied. Places like Tartine always amaze me.  Their quality allows them to charge 20-30% more on most of their items without affecting their receipts at the end of the day, yet they choose to remain at a great pricepoint.  It's great to have options if I wanted to only spend $4 on a nice breakfast.  $3.25 for a Sausage Egg McMuffin or a Jambon Croissant with gruyere for $2.95? Personally it's difficult to beat the combination of delicious, consistent and reasonably-priced food and Tartine Bakery is a great example of that.

Get here early. Wait in line. Order a croque monsieur (ham, not veggie, pigs were made for eating) and some super buttery yummy bread thing (double chocolate croissant is my recommendation).  The quiche is so fluffy and good too. Find the nearest place possible to sit down and eat, even if it the median of Geurrero St. Enjoy enjoy enjoy. ____ 3/10/08: The brioche bread pudding wasn't to great.  I can't put my finger on exactly what it was, but it just wasn't great.  And the coffee that sits around is kinda meh.

[5-What's Not To Love?] Oh, yeah... the lines and the total lack of parking if you're coming from anywhere other than a hipster-pod. However these issues are not Tartine's fault. Merely the price one has to pay for a delictable double pain au chocolate, a wicked selection of pastries, and Scharfen Berger hot chocolate that is better than what is served at Scharfen Berger's own Cafe Cacao. I love Tartine unconditionaly... going so far as to have my last birthday dinner there. And while my companion and I did indulge in a cross section of sweets, it was the pressed sandwiches that made the meal. And those spicy little pickled carrots that come with croques and sandwiches! Ah! You can't always find a seat, but who needs one when Dolores Park is just a block away? Tip: get there at 7:30 when they first open for the most awesome breakfast breads you will ever encounter,

The first time i came here i got 3 orange morning buns and a slice of pumpkin bread. All of it was gone within the hour. The second time I bought 2 more orange buns, but was generous and gave one to my roommate. And was therefore able to eat dinner when the time came.

Crazy, crazy lines, no parking, and slightly expensive.  Nice presentation and good pastries.  Not a lot of space but the staff were friendly enough.  Although I hate those tip jars at places when the staff isn't waiting on you and you're supposed to bus your own tables.  It's great that they also have biodegradable utensils made from potatoes, but they sometimes break on you.  Delicious lemon cream tarts and slammin' bread.  Decent paninis that are a bit expensive and only has a carrot for a side.  Nice to go to if you're at Dolores Park and going to Bi-rite Creamery. Just took a star off because they raised their prices even more (March 2008)!  Staff was also not very friendly.  A new skinny blonde looked new and tired, ready to go home, but don't work in service if you don't like people be-yotch!  Maybe she was hungry.

Something about this place annoys me. I don't know what it is. Maybe the crowds? Or the lack of space? Or the poor layout (makes it really hard to decide what you want when you can't see anything until about two seconds before they ask you "what can I get you" and you feel pressured to order because the line is so long, but you have no idea what you really want, so you sort of just pick. Or you get annoyed by the people in front of you who won't just pick and take forever to choose, and the line keeps growing behind you. But I digress). Anyway, everything I've ever eaten here is REALLY amazing, so that's the good thing. For me, definitely worth a visit every once in a while, but I'd probably end up snapping if I went there regularly.

The atmosphere is perfect, the staff is cute and friendly, the drinks are delicious and the pastries are to die for. I am obsessed with their bread pudding, and their mocha that is made out of bitter chocolate melted into hot milk with an espresso shot in it, and topped with creme freche in case that wasn't indulgent enough for you. But all this of course attracts all the people that make a crowd, and there is often a long line and very limited seating. I often end up sharing tables with strangers, which I don't mind but others may. On sunny days, though, they have outdoor seating.

Not true in all cases, but often when there's a line out the door, there's good reason. With Tartine, the wait is thankfully worth it. They get five stars not just for their execution of the classics, but for imaginative offerings as well. Standouts on my recent visit were the frangipane tart, the ham and tomato toasts, and the cake aux olives. Generally I need to be pulled from the counter in a situation like this, because really, there's nothing to stop me from ordering, other than the prices. Where Tartine is concerned, I've forgotten the bill by the first bite. Don't go if you're in a rush. And bring someone to talk to or something to read.

Ahh, the fabled Tartine, we meet at last. The line was just out the door on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. Sure, it's not the swiftest moving line, but I appreciated the wait because it gave me a chance to figure out what I wanted to eat. We also saw a guy walking down the street with an enormous red velvet/gold encrusted crown on his head. What? Like you've never seen that before? My friends and I settled on the Idiazabal & Membrillo pressed sandwich, which is lightly smoked sheep's milk cheese with quince jam melted between two crispy slices of country bread. It was cut into 3 pieces, one for each of us. If you've never experienced jam + cheese (whether it's brie or goat cheese or blue cheese) on bread, I command you to make yourself a hot sandwich with those ingredients right now. Weird combination, but oh so right on your tastebuds. We also shared a bowl of the bread pudding, which was more than enough for three people, after eating the sandwich. We finished up the apple slices and left a good portion of the eggy custard portion of the pudding; just too heavy for us. But don't get me wrong, it is delicious. Hmm, I think I would've liked it nuked in the microwave for a little bit though. Last but not least, we each had a Rocher with cocoa nibs. I love meringues, so this was right up my alley. We were lucky enough to grab a table, so we were able to eat all of this in the comfort of seats. I also got two Morning Buns to go. I ate one later that night and then the other one the next morning. Yes, my pants do feel a bit tight, thanks for asking. They taste like palmiers to me -- "elephant ears" (but they remind of a butterfly or a heart), those flaky, folded puff pastries coated with sugary goodness. The Morning Buns are crunchy on the outside and get softer as you get to the center. I ate mine in a circular fashion, so I was able to unravel the bun bit by bit. Ugh, now I'm hungry. I hate when this happens.

I love this bakery/restaurant and I a really glad that it is a popular as it is, but that becomes my problem with the place. Don't get me wrong, the food both sweet and savory, is wonderful... But the people who go, I don't get. Everyone there seems to be surprised that there are other people in line and that the tables are crowded. This would not be so bad if the customers were not so snotty about it. So by all means go and enjoy some of the best treats in the city, but don't give me stink eye because the line to order is right on top of your table.

I love this place - hands down my favorite food to get before 12:00PM.  Plus, it's proximity to Dolores Park combines with the great job they do on to-go orders makes it ideal for picnicking! Favorites: bread pudding (especially the apple), almond rochers, quiche, morning bun, mocha, croissants. The line can be a detriment, but usually I just read my paper or chat with my friends.  Plus, there's a big communal table so I never feel bad about going alone and hogging up one of the few tables they have.   I do need to try the cakes soon - the lemon meringue cake looks delicious!

I know it's a tourist season already, but that doesn't mean that Tartine can hike up the price of pastries of less quality. What happened to the moist scone with crunchy sugar? it's all dried up and not sweet at all. What about my all time favorite morning bun? Why are they all dried up and taste like a cheap fried cinnanon donut? How about almond croissant? I can taste raw egg, not custard, in the filling. Don't scare me, Tartine. I can't live without your pastries, so clean up the bad act!

My favorite thing to do for breakfast -- wake up early when all of the Mission and Castro are still hung over, walk right into Tartine because the line doesn't start until later, get a croque monsieur for breakfast and whichever delicious pastry screams loudest at me from behind the counter as a treat for later. I'm tellin' ya, don't let all the whining about the wait and cost keep you from having the delicious food and pastries.  Time your arrival to miss the line and don't think about the price until after you've taken your first bite.

Yes, there's always a line, but it moves pretty fast--or maybe I'm just lulled into a zombified state, as I gape at the frosted cakes and pastries in the glass case. Either way, time passes happily. Only three stars because not everything is good. No complaints about the service. What I've tried: Devil's Food Cake: really good. The browned-butter aroma of the caramel between the layers of dense, dark cake and thick chocolate ganache takes this simple but satisfying dessert to another level. My only complaint is that the layers of ganache are too thick, making the cake overly rich. Lemon Cream Tart: not so good. Though lemony and tart, the filling is also cloyingly sweet. Fragipane Croissant: pretty good. Exterior has a nice crunch to it (plus, you're not showered, with each bite, in an annoying flurry of confectioners' sugar and sliced almonds), the frangipane filling is delicate and not overly sweet (just right), but the croissant is much too big, and so the filling gets lost--unless you take the top half off and eat the two halves separately, which is what I did. Bread Pudding: ugh. Maybe I just don't like bread pudding that's lukewarm and has been sitting around in its own fruity juices for a few too many hours. I found the texture wet and soggy, while the taste was bland and lacking in richness, as if they'd used too many egg whites or milk instead of cream.   Some tart with a frangipane filing, topped with berries, almonds, and streusel: completely blah and unmemorable.   Cake aux Olives: hmm. Okay, I didn't actually eat this, but I peered at it while waiting to pay and it had a disturbing shiny, gummy appearance that wasn't appetizing.

Been taken there by my friend K. Gray ;) She knows I love me some sugar and sweets. Nice choices, at first you look at the display and its just overwhelming (I start to have an anxiety in all bakeries anyway). FInally I had some kind of custard  and croissant + coffe - fresh and tasty, that kind of meal that would make your day or at least next few hours. The only thing to warn you all about is that sometimes there is not much space, so you might end up sitting next to the geek with a laptop or an old lady with her grandkids running around.

The first thing you notice walking up to Tartine is the delicious smells wafting out. It was pretty busy when we went on a Sunday afternoon, the line was out the door but we were putting in our orders within 20-30 minutes.  A lot of delicious looking and smelling pastries to choose from.  I got the chocolate souffle and the hot-pressed spicy turkey sandwich, both were very yummy.  My friend got the sandwich with the jam in it and said that was delish. Overall just a wonderful, simple place to grab some food.

I just went to this place today after a million time that I drove by and ALWAYS saw a big line that discourage me to try it. Now I understand why. Their sandwiches are the Best, never tried something so tasty. I had the pecorino and lemon: really really good! I know that I am not the first and I won't be the last writing a review on this place, but I still like to give my opinion, especially when is very positive.

Cute corner bakery shop. We went there on a pouring day, walked 4-5 blocks to get there, but it was worth the walk. :) We had the famous bread pudding cake and tried the coconut/lemon cake. It was perfect - not too sweet, not too dry..just perfect. I would come here everyday if it weren't so far out for me..

Owwhh the BREAD PUDDING is .............  *I can't even find a word to say* Sometimes it gets packed easily during brunch & lunch, but I still have no hesitation to go there. Luckily I always find a table and parking (although it is like finding a needle in haystack). Love to sit outside with friends, enjoy the beautiful weather, seeing people & dogs around goes by, eating the scrumptious dessert and quiche, sure it feels great...

I gave Tartine three stars based upon the cramped conditions and almost frenzied environment that is Tartine.   If you ride BART specifically to get here I would suggest you get off in the Castro (bus or train) and walk over from there.  The neighborhood from the MIssion train stop is sketchy especially if you go the wrong direction. OK-back to Tartine.  We were stoked to eat here and on vacation.  We arrived rather naively near lunch time and encountered a crush of people so dense that normally I would just walk out if I were home and not vacationing.   Because the crowds were so great we were literally given the ultimatum of eating croque monsieur (or nothing) because they refused to serve anything else.  This really perturbed me but we had already waited in line and what else are we going to find in this hood? So, two croque monsieurs later combined with a free strangely tasty pickled carrot and 2 baked goods from the case and we had our lunch for about $26.00. Strategy for visiting here:  If you are 2 people together then one should stake out 2 seats (you have to share tables) and the other should place the order and pay.  If you don't you are VERY screwed and eating while standing up.   TIP:  Get your grub to go and walk over to Mission Dolores and have a nice quick lunch on the steps before entering this glorious historical mission.  You are only a short walk from Mission Dolores so make your trip worthwhile.   The food here is very very good.  The baked items are super.  If you are a Type A east coaster like I tend to be then you may want to pop a Valium to prevent a massive melt down while navigating this too popular location. Anything as successful as Tartine would normally prompt the owner to expand or perhaps streamline their business model.  I wish I owned this little gold mine because I think I would eventually have a Tartine on every SFO corner.

This is one of my all time favorite places in SF. Seriously delicious, seriously well made food.  If you can miraculously find parking and brave the ridiculous line, Tartine will not disappoint.  It is every bit as good as it's hyped up to be.  You may have to have a knife fight to get a table at this place, but trust me, it's worth it. I had a quiche for lunch and my friend had a panini.  Both delicious, but the stand outs of course were the pastries.  We selected a few but the one that is totally seared in my mind is the luscious lemon creme tart.  It is literally the best I've ever tasted - including the second runner up at Chez Panisse.  The standard baked goods such as the croissants are so perfectly executed.  Buttery and flakey.. oh. Food orgasm. Side note: ever come across that beautiful coffee table recipe book at Costco or something?  It's worth the investment because your attempts will come out pretty darn close.  The ingredients are no different than what many standard baking recipes call for, so I guess it's all in their technique.

LOVE the bread pudding....although I wish they have a microwave so it could have been heated up instead of luke warm.   I suggest coming here on a weekday because there is NO LINE!  Also, give one of their sandwiches a try.  I had the soppresetta, which was dreamy and well worth the wait (they take about 10 minutes).  It is HUGE, so maybe be prepared to share or make two meals out of it.

Can you believe that I've lived in the SF area for 11 years, yet I only discovered Tartine less than 6 months ago? Blasphemous. What else can I say about a business with over a thousand positive reviews? Their lemon squares strike the perfect balance of tart filling and buttery shortbread crust. The chocolate croissants (made with Valhrona chocolate, no less) are the closest I've had to the amazing pan au chocolat I was lucky enough to experience in France. And that bread pudding...oh that bread pudding. I could sing songs about that bread pudding, it's that good. I've been known to order a bowl-sized portion to go, eat half of it, and chuck the rest in the fridge to eat cold the next day. Yes, it is even amazing cold. If you take me to Tartine drunk, I may very well burst out into song. Just warning you. PS Take your goodies to go and have a picnic at Dolores Park.

What's better than Tartine on a Sunday afternoon with your friends?  I'm sure everything here is a must try - but here's what I've tried so far: bread pudding, banana cream tart, meringue, almond croissants, and the chocolate souffle cake. Be prepared to stand in line - but not to worry because it will be worth your wait.  The place was packed, but thanks to Dolores Cafe down the street for accomodating us. Bi-Rite Creamery is just down the street...just another reason to go to Tartine.

Hooray for Chocolate Eclairs! They have the best in the city, hands down. Worth the wait in line, yes. Don't ever try to get a table.... You'll end up disappointed over something that isn't a very big deal anyway. Their shortbreads, (other)cookies, croissants, and especially their lemon tarte... Yum. Their hot chocolate is okay, but that's only because I make my own hot chocolate the way I like it. Ya know, I'm picky about that sort of thing. Go there. Do it.

Sat outside here with my friend and a dog and enjoyed an awesome sandwich in the sun! Had the pastrami panini, and was pleasantly surprised to see it was actually more like a sandwich and a half! It had three pieces to it instead of two. I liked how the mustard was already cooked inside the panini, and the pastrami was super tasty!! For dessert I had the coconut cream pie, which was out of this world! It had a layer of chocolate between the creme and the pasty which was to die for. Would go back in a second -- also they have the mexican cokes there, an added bonus :)

Morning bun, I love you! Sugary, sweet, sticky and oh so lovely with unexpected bits of orange zest. I went here for the first time on a Monday morning. (*Note-after 1030am the line is ridiculously long!) Almond croissant was HUGE!  Crunchy and crumbly sprinkled with powdered sugar and almonds with delicious almond filling.   As Arnold Schwarzeneggar said..."I'll be back."

There's no better indulgence than a crispy, flakey, hot-out-of-the-oven double pain au chocolate croissant from Tartine -- melts in the mouth, especially if you dunk a corner into their house made chai!  Actually, maybe a toasted slice of their sesame bread with jam or Nutella may be a close runner up.  Or, one of their many other pasteries or saveries made to perfection.  I'm hooked on this place and have been on a mission to try one of everything - with no disappointments.  Product quality is a major plus.  Here's my overall assessment (pluses, minuses, and tips): Pluses: - Items freshly baked continuously throughout the day - Excellent value ($3.50 world class baked goods) - Warm, social atmosphere - Hip, friendly staff Minuses: - Long lines & wait (during peak times) Tips: - The best times to avoid lines are on weekdays -- early mornings (before 9am), mid mornings (10:30-11:30am), and afternoons (3-5pm). - For fresh bread, you can place an order by phone, usually the same day, and pick up bread around 5pm.  Bread can be purchased in half loaves. - If you love to bake, the beautiful Tartine cookbook provides the same recipes used at the bakery.  There are recipes of all levels of challenge, ranging from easier ones, like the bread pudding and tea cakes, on up to more complex feats like Bavarian cakes and croissants!  I've tried several and can attest to bakery-like results when I follow their recipes.

Several people told me that they had the best almond croissant they had ever tasted, so naturally I had to verify this for myself.  I was expecting a line, but luckily when I went at 9AM on a Monday there wasn't much of a line. My sister ordered the almond croissant - flaky and buttery without being too sweet.  It was perfectly flaky and straight out of the oven.  My sister said she couldn't decide whose almond croissant was better - Tartine or Boulange in Cole Valley (she said Boulange's was sweeter, more dessert-like). I was underwhelmed by the vegetarian quiche I ordered - I could only taste the creme fraiche and eggs.  The eggs were very fluffy but the crust just was alright.  My dad said his ham quiche was too salty. My mother's bread pudding was delicious but it was so rich that she couldn't even finish the small cup. I would come back for the almond croissant.  The tea cakes also looked delicious.

Top tier: Devil's Food Cake Brioche Bread Pudding Croissants (regular, chocolate, and almond) Bread (after 5PM only) 2nd tier: Morning Buns Brownies Quiches Sandwiches Mid tier: All other cakes Cookies All Tarts Low tier: Coffee That said, Tartine's 2nd tier food is better than every other bakeries' top tier.  So really, the list should have started with "God tier."

The best bread pudding I have ever tried. The thin slices of peaches just give it that extra added touch of yum. I'm not sure how they get the brioche/challah bread to stay so moist, but whatever they do, it turns out perfect. The price? Just about 6$ for a bowl big enough for three people to share. Everything in the bakery looked so good that I can't wait to go back and try something new.

Oh, TARTINE...how i love thee, especially the ALMOND CROISSANTS!!! The buttery and flaky croissant is filled with frangipane cream with brandy and topped with toasted almonds and powdered sugar. It is absolutely to die for! Tartine is notorious for long waits (at least 45mins out the door), so arrive early for the yummy goodies!

Came here on a Sunday afternoon, waited in line, and ordered the Jambon Royale & Gruyere (ham & dijon mustard) + a hazelnut tart + iced coffee. The sandwich took forever (ok they were busy), but it came out all fresh, toasty, and crisp. And it was hugeeee! There were 3 portions and I saw other couples sharing, and then even taking a piece home. The ham was salty, the bread was chewy and sweet, and the cheese and honey mustard added additional flavors. The pickled carrot they give you looks like decoration, but it's actually really good! The hazelnut tart is okayyyyy (could be more chocolatey). It looks better than it tastes, but since it looks so good it's still pretty delish. I kinda liked the communal seating arrangement and bussing your own tables! The whole place was really cool + hip.

I finally made it to this place after wanting to for over a year.   5 stars for the crossaint...the best I've had since Paris!  SO worth the indulgence! 5 stars for the banana cream tart...I'm not a fan of bananas but after having this tart it may have changed my mind! 4 stars for the pressed sammies...tried the prosciutto and provolone one and it was good but not out of my mind good.  It sounds pricey at $11.50 but this sammie is big enough to serve 2 and even possibly 3 if all girls. 2 stars for the unfriendly wait staff and the pretentious crowd who linger around hogging tables when other customers are spilling out the door!

A quick stop into Tartine is a right of passage. And one that took me 2 years to check off the list.  But the magic finally happened this afternoon with two friends.  Over gigantic lattes and sparkling pink lemonades, we savored croissants, sandwiches, and delectable desserts. Things got interested when a (hopefully drunk) couple in the middle of the place started acting like porn stars, making out as if it were going out of style.  But, hey... it's San Francisco!  We're a liberal kind of town, right? Tartine is tiny, so good luck finding somewhere to sit.  The line was never any shorter than out the door during the entire 90 minute period we stayed.  But then again, the appearance of demand is probably what keeps this place is business, right?! I had the prosciutto-provolone panini with arugula.  Amazing.  I got not two but three slices of sandwich.  Each slice was practically one entire sandwich.  I was stuffed after two of them and I brought the third one home.  It reheated particularly well. I don't know that Tartine will be my "go to" place going forward during my spontaneous cross-town trips from the Marina to the Mission, but they have a wonderful sandwich list, some world-class baked goods, and a cult-like base of patrons that will make you feel like you've just got to wait in line for 20+ minutes to grab hold of that buttery, flaky croissant.  (Hey, it's all worth it in the end, friends!  Eyes on the prize!)

3 words for this place - Banana Creme Pie!!!  That pretty much says it all! We have gone in on a Saturday afternoon, be prepared to wait in a long line so don't go if you're in a hurry. The place is super small, so don't expect to eat there either. We ordered a bunch of stuff to share among 4 people - lemon bar, lemon meringue, some wedding cookies, a chocolate chip & oatmeal cookie and the banana creme pie. The favorite among all of us were the banana creme!  I found the lemon bar and meringue were way too tart, it does have a really good lemon taste, but those were never my favorites to begin with. If I were in the area next time, I'll go early in the morning to avoid the rush.

Dining at Tartine can be a frustrating experience. You'll almost certainly be standing in a line snaking through a very crowded restaurant. When you finally order you'll be given a numbered flag with which to stake out space at the packed tables. Real estate is at as much of a premium here as anywhere else in the city. Prepare to feel like a buzzard, waiting for the last gasp of other diners' croissants. Plus, when we finally got seats, we were packed in tight and subjected to gusty door openings and closings. But oh man is it worth it. By a huge margin, these are the best pastries I've ever had. It's absurdly good. I bought a whole bunch to take back to Chicago. If I came here again though, I'd just get a box of pastries to go.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE TARTINE!  I seriously think about it at least once a day.  I would marry the banana cream pie if I could, the cream is pure lusciousness - they whip it to perfection.  I have freaking high standards for whipped cream and I give them a 10 freaking +.  10. 10. 10. 10!!!   You really can't go wrong with anything here.  I even wanted a wedding cake from here, but they don't deliver and the cake i wanted (passion fruit bavarian) won't stand up to heat so well and I'm having an outdoor wedding in August.  =( Well, why the 4 stars?  Well, it's the damn hipster staff - too cool for the patrons.   Maybe too busy being hip?  They are just not helpful, stand around, look at with you this bored stare etc etc.  You name it, they do it.

WTH would give this place only 1-3 stars?  Tartine is definitely in the 4-5 category only.  Although there's always a line outside, it's well worth it.  There's also so much deliciousness on the menu that it's actually good you have some time to wait, and peruse the menu and what other people order as well. I'm so glad this place isn't closer to my house, I'd be 200 pounds.  During my most recent visit, I shared the a croque monsieur, spicy turkey sandwich and three delicious treats.  Everything was amazing, right down to the pickled carrots.  It's a little pricy, my friend and I came in for breakfast treats and walked out with $40 worth of food.  It was definitely enough for the meal and then snacks throughout the day! A SF establishment, don't allow the crowd to deter you.  Oddly enough, every time I get up and order when I have my # stick, there's always a table that opens up.

Finally made it to the famous Tartine bakery.  Since we're not from SF and the line is so long, we decided to get quite a few items (even though the items are quite pricey for my budget).   Bread pudding cup ($3.50) - delicious!!! soo soo moist, great flavor, and not too sweet. Morning bun ($3.75) - I don't get they hype on these.  Just alright to me. Coconut cream tart ($6.50) - delicious!!!  and looks delicious too.  the crust is super flakey and not too thick.  the filing is rich and not too sweet.  and the tart is topped of with roasted coconut shavings.   so delicious.  have to try the other tarts next time.   Chocolate chip cookie (?) - delicious!!!  very thin, crisp, buttery, melty chocolate. Even though the lines were long, and the customer service rushed/lacking, we'd still go back cause the food is delicious.

Also the best damn lemon tart I have ever tasted. They say good food starts with good ingredients and this epitomizes that.  Just go man!! Jeez 2000+ reviews for this joint it's that good.

With over 2,000 reviews, one piddly little person (me) could not say it any better than the previous reviewers.  But I'll try.   I live in LA but my heart is in San Francisco.  Even then, I make sure I visit Tartine every time I come to town.   I love the hustle and bustle, the visible bakery gnomes working in the back, the pastries perfected.  I have never had anything sub par.  The lemon bars are super tart, rich, and delicious.  The banana cream tart warrants a trip to SF all on it's own.  The gougere annoys me because I never know how to pronounce it, but I brave the embarrassment and order it every time.   Sure, the servers take themselves a little bit too seriously and I never really feel cool enough to walk in there, but c'est la vie!  I will gladly sneak in and sneak out if it means a meal and treats from Tartine.

I have no idea why, but I was sort of disappointed.  I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time and I finally came here on a weekday around 2:00.  There was no line and I was able to find parking on the same street. At first I thought sweet! Found parking right away and no line! My lucky day! Since I couldn't decide what to get, I got several items to try and to share with the family.  I ordered the small bread pudding, banana cream tart, chocolate hazelnut tart and frangiose tart.   I did not like the bread pudding at all.  I'm not sure why, but it wasn't very flavorful.  The bread pudding was with apples.  Banana Cream pie was good and not very sweet. Chocolate hazelnut tart did not have enough hazelnut flavor asides from it being on the top.  I think it would be best if hazelnut flavor was mixed in with the chocolate in the tart.  Of the four pastries, I liked the frangiose tart the most.  There were lot of almond and was flavorful.   I'm not sure why, but I guess I just had a high expectation for this place.  They didn't have the morning bun that I wanted to try.  Maybe next time I'll go try that and their cakes.  I still want to give this place another try.

I'm getting stingy with my 5 stars, but this one deserves it. Love it!!! Great bread. Very subtle nutty flavor. The pastries that I've tried are all outstanding. The lemon tart and the banana cream tart are both tops. Nothing here is in your face. The flavors and textures are subtle and never overly sugary. I also like their coconut macaroons, but I don't recommend buying the pre-packaged version. You need the freshness, so buy the macaroons there and eat it there. Can't wait until we go back again and try more items.

This place is absolutely FANTABULOUSLY AWESOME.  FANTABULSOME? It was the four of us and if we hadn't gotten there pre-1130am we would have done further damage to our bellies and wallets.  We got the croque monsieur, the brioche bread pudding with fruit, the gougere, the morning bun, a croissant, and of course some coffee. The croque monsieur was the best i've ever had, oui oui, and the brioche bread pudding was fabulously carb-loaded and yummy.  The gougere might have been the fave with a choux pastry like thing filled with bechamel sauce or cheese something delicious like that.  The morning bun was yummy but I liked the other things better.....i know i know. Oh yes, and the coffee was delicious.  And the weather was so amazingly sunny and warm.........not that that affects the food or anything.  but the food coma becomes a better experience.

I am a fan but I don't think its worth waiting an hour for a coffee and something sweet. The coffee is good, the croissants are light, airy and very buttery and exactly what they should be. One friend had the bread pudding and while most of it was excellent the bottom was like others said, soggy. Another friend had a brownie and it was sooo dense it felt less like a brownie and more like a bar of chocolate.  While that's always a good thing, just don't call it a brownie, its not one. I love that there are free re-fills on the coffee, that makes a HUGE difference to me as I can drink allot of coffee. if there is no line I always want to go here, but I hate lines so never go here

Baked GOOD heaven. I was lucky enough to come here for the 2nd time ever. When you walk by and into the bakery you will see a crowd. Then you will see a lot of Ohhhhhh... ahhhhhhhhHHHH .... ShhHHHHHHHh.. O faces because they are in cloud 9 pastry land. Bread Pudding ($4) - F*$#@ AMAZING - Never knew bread pudding can taste so good. They toss in a couple of fresh fruits in there (blackberries and redberries) Hazelnut pastry thing with nuts - $5 - If you want a actual hazelnut taste on a soft but firm crust with NUTS on top THEN you will be BLOWIN' AWAY. Coconut passion fruit -  I was iffy about this one, but I was shocked how good the two ingredients goes so well together. Come here for incredible good pastries. I don't need to tell ya. You can see by the number of reviews...

Tartine has ruined me for all other bakeries. Things I love: - double pain au chocolat - If you love chocolate, you must get one (or two.. or three). Delicious buttery flaky croissant goodness with dark chocolate. And it's huge! - almond Croissant - probably tied with the ham and cheese croissant as my favorite. delicious almond filling. - ham and cheese croissant - worth getting fat for. it tastes like they use a stick of butter, plus cheese and ham. yum! - morning bun - slightly sweet with a touch of orange and cinnamon - banana cream pie - not overly sweet but still delicious. you can tell they use top notch ingredients in the cream. Misses: - fragipane tart - wasn't too impressed with this. Too sweet and I'm more used to a more marizipan-like almond paste. - chocolate chip cookie - it had a weird crunchy texture. I'm more of a chewy cookie person. - the bread. I know people rave about Tartine's bread, but I found it to be overly burnt and nothing special.

I've heard great things about this place so I decided to check it out for myself. I arrived around eleven in the morning and I had to wait in line for about ten minutes. There's outdoor seating which seems nice, especially when the weather is favorable. Inside, communal seating is the deal. I ordered a morning bun and a double pain au chocolat. Lucky for me, a fresh batch of morning buns came out of the oven when I ordered. The morning buns are delicious, I'm usually content with milk and cereal for breakfast, but I wouldn't mind eating these buns every morning. Not overly sweet + a hint of orange = YUM. The double pain au chocolat was great as well. So flaky and if you're a fan of dark chocolate then you'll probably enjoy this treat. I spent eight bucks total which is little pricey for me considering I only ordered two pastries, but they were both delicious so I shouldn't complain.

So many items to try and they're all finger-lickin' delicious!! Since 2200+ reviews are posted already, I'm going to spare you the long review and avoid any repetition, but there are 3 things to remember: 1) Croque Monsieur (9.75) 2) Pain au Jambon Croissant (4.75) - they sold out on these goodies quickly. 3) Bread Pudding (3.50/6) Come early and come hungry!

First of all, PARKING is a biatch there and thankfully I had a "drop-off" driver to go p/up the "BANANA CREAM TART" 9" (yes their largest that feeds 8 people for $40 and you would have to order at least 2-3 days in advance). Anyhow, a friend recommended to order this dessert and honestly, OVERRATED!  It was quite RUNNY inside where all the gooey caramel, MELTED custard & bananas hovered each other, yet no solid bound to glue everything in one place.  I enjoyed everything (whipped cream, chocolate pieces, bananas, runny custard & caramel) even though it was runny except for their pie CRUST.  Too HARD & THICK NOT light, crispy & airy; definitely had better.

Loved this place!  awesome pastries & hot drinks! The only downside is that parking is hell in Mission (but some of the best restaurants are in that area), and because this place is so popular, there's a long line & you're lucky if you can find a seat.

How do I review this food mecca without giving justice, or offering an alternative perspective to the other thousand reviews? I will say this: I am a scone person, and I love their buttermilk scones. Très Leches cake is divine and how-very-Mission-of-you. Love the pickled carrots that accompany the sandwiches. Thanks for using Four Barrel coffee. I also love the atmosphere--they are always playing my favorite music, and I am a freak for the many vases of flowers that surround the café.

I'll keep this short and simple...If you don't know what to get, definitely try the -Bread pudding (with brioche bread) -Lemon tarts -House coffee -Morning buns I love the food at this place and pretty much the reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is the poor attitude of most of the servers here (with the exception of a couple).  Just because people will come back for the food doesn't mean you should have lackluster service consistently at all times of days (to name a few: 7:30am on a wednesday, 12pm on a monday, 1pm on a saturday, or 4pm on a sunday).

When I went to Tartine, all I ordered was a croissant. The croissant was crispy and flaky which is how I like my croissants! The only reason I'm giving Tartine 3 stars rather than a 4 or 5 is because 1.  The croissant was a little pricey in my opinion. 2. I can't say that I absolutely love this place based on one visit and only purchasing a croissant. (Maybe after a few more visits I'll edit my review). But if it helps, my roommate thinks Tartine has the best croissants in the world and absolutely loves this place!

The pastrami sandwich has MUSTARD in it!  No mention of mustard on the menu.  Good thing I like mustard.  I like the selection of baked goods, but the staff there are TOO COOL for school.  I preferred if they would chat with each other AFTER they took my order and money.  I felt like I was in their way.   I'll go back! I prefer my pastries served without attitude.

I feel like I haven't tried enough to give a real review, but from what I've experienced so far, it's quite good! I had a bite of their coconut cream tart, which was filled with light, smooth cream and crisp pieces of toasted coconut. I don't like coconut, but I still found the flavor quite delicious, without an overpowering coconut flavor. The bread had already sold out by the time I came, but I hope to go back and try their morning buns!

This bakery was featured on America's 10 best bakeries on Yahoo and I had no idea it was so close to home!! After going to two different ice cream shops (loved BiRite and Humphry!), my friends and I had to take a break from the sweets. My friend mentioned Tartine so we stopped by. It was a little hard trying to figure out where it was because it didn't have a big sign for their bakery, and what's even more interesting is that in the front of the door is written Carl's on the floor. I didn't understand that part. Maybe Carl owned it? Or a long lost lover? Who knows! There was a line out the door and sadly enough, there was a sign that said "Sold out of Bread today". Sigh. Guess it just wasn't meant to be. However, we did order a Lemon Cream Tart, their popular Morning Bun, and a croque monsieur. The Croque Mensieur was really good, but even better when it's hot. Their morning bun was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, of course it would have been better if it was hot. Lastly we have the Lemon Cream Tart. It was definitely lemony, a perfect dessert to end a heavy meal! Service was quick and there were 3 tables outside and a couple of them inside. Prices were a bit on the expensive side, but it is definitely worth a try!

I love Tartine! I heard about the morning buns from a friend and could not wait to try them! The line was far out the shop on a sunday morning around 9 am... I hate waiting but this is a wait I will never regret and will wait again if it means more morning buns :) Waiting in line looking at all the treats left me with a watery mouth and eyes bigger than my stomach :) I finally got to the front cashier and ordered a banana cream tart, morning bun, chocolate croissant, and a ham croque madame. I did not eat all this alone just FYI haha I gladly shared :) the morning bun was sooo delicious my favorite bite was the gooey center yummmmmm!!! Can they overnight these amazing buns to Hawaii??? please!!!!! OH and one more thing, seating is a nightmare here. Beware of seat stealers!

My pastry savvy friend recommended this place to me mentioning the Banana Cream tart and the morning bun. Lines out the doooooooooor. After finally making it inside (which was after a ten minute wait - the cashiers move as fast as they can) I was completely overwhelmed by the choices. You have your typical morning pastries, savory breads and fancy desserts in addition to some hot breakfast entrees and coffee bar. Picked up a roll with baked cheese in it, a medium portion of their bread pudding and a chai latte. THE BEST BREAD PUDDING I EVER HAD. First of all anything with Brioche, I am a sucker for, so please, i'll take a hearty portion of the Brioche bread pudding. Soft but not mushy and a ton of favor, thanks to the sliced peaches on top. My roommate shared her Banana cream tart with me- I'm not particularly a fan of bananas or chocolate but I polished the rest of that thing off for her. I don't know if anyone could eat one by itself because of the richness but sharing is caring. Keep in mind that if you are looking for a place to dine and lounge for awhile, you should be prepared to wait for a table, and a small one at that  but Tartine definitely lives up to the hype.

Worth the wait in line! You must try their Morning Buns and Bread Pudding ... the staples that keep me coming back.  This bakery epitomizes SF (in the mission).  If you appreciate quality over quantity, have a preference for organic, and desire the perfect pastry...TARTINE is the place.   I've also tried the Tres Leches Cake, which I thought was a little too sweet for my liking.  Their savory items such as the Croque Monsieur and Quiches are good picks if you don't prefer sweets.  Also, don't expect to get a table as this place is normally packed on the weekends.  Nonetheless, still worth the visit!   Yuuuum, I'm already craving the morning bun...

Banana creme tart (~$6) with dark chocolate. Lemon tart (~$6) with a dollop of unsweetened white cream. Simply amazing! The desserts are enough to share for two so bring a fellow sweet tooth ... but you might just want get one each and dig into both! If I had a family to feed, I would order the big pastries such as the Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian or the Tres Leches Cake. The long wait and limited seating (hopefully it is sunny out so you can go out to Dolores Park!) is worth it. If it's your first time there, it might be difficult to decide what to get as there are throngs of people blocking view of the pastries and desserts. Although I have only tried the desserts, I also see plates of quiche and hot pressed sandwiches pass by. I will definitely have to try some of these sandwiches (~$12): Idiazabal & Membrillo with smoked sheep cheese with quince jam Pecorino & Almond with sheep cheese & almonds with olive oil, lemon and sage Sopressata, Fontina, Brocolli Rabe Pesto Prosciutto & Provolone with arugula Croque Monsieur ($10) with béchamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper

i LOVE TARTINE. I come here all the time especially when I have the time to leisurely sit and chat. Whenever I come here I would most often get the: 1. Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian: I love passion fruit and anything with passion fruit. It's a hit or miss for some. Sometimes its deliciously moist and sometimes i've had it where the cake was dry. But you must try! 2. Banana Cream Tart: Delicious! caramel, chocolate, flaky crust, bananas and whip cream. I always get this 3. Bread Pudding: Always so tasty, not heavy and i love the seasonal fruit 4. Ham quiche: Light and very flavorful. It's to balance my sweet meal 5. Ham & cheese croisant: Flaky, buttery and oh soooooo good! Others i've had were the morning bun, lemon tart, chocolate ganache cake, and some cookies. I didn't like these as much as my favorite items. Place is small, there's always a line out the door but it moves fast. It's hard getting a table but if you wait around you can catch one or just pack it up and walk to Mission Dolores Park and have a picnic. It's beautiful up there especially if you walk to the Top left corner of the park, there's an awesome view of the city.

Crowded all the time and small so you have to fight to find a seat but OMG oh so worth it. I got the morning bun, lemon tart and eclair. WOW I am salavating just thinking about it again.  The food was so good, rich and light at the same time.  Perfect and cannot be described only your taste buds can understand. So just eat it! My advice is to avoid the weekends because there is without fail a line wrapped around the block from Sat morning to Sun night.  I went on a Thurs and no line went straight in. But if you are only here for a weekend then get up early and go line up and try as much as you can.  It is soooo worth it!!!

You can't hate on a place like Tartine! If you're lucky enough to snag a morning bun or loaf of bread straight from the oven, then you know that Tartine is worth the wait. Don't let the line snaking out the door scare you away- it moves pretty quick. Service is polite and efficient. The only negative is that they run out of items (especially the morning bun and the bread), so placing an order in advance is key if you're not up for purusing the available goods.

Their croissants are good, scones, yummy, but their morning buns are my #1 thing.

I cannot say much that has not been said before.  You will wait in line.  You will eat the best pastry of your life.  The croissants are crunchy and moist in the center.  They are also HUGE.  I purchased a sampling of snacks today that consisted of the fluffiest lemon tart I have ever had, the tastiest cream filling in the eclair and fantastic banana tart that had much more than bananas. I do not think there is a miss in this place.  Definitely worth a trip for a little butter indulgence.

Tartine was everything it was cracked up to be. A long line of morning goers awaiting bakery heaven. A delicious morning bun that was in turns flaky, moist, and chewy with hints of orange and cinnamon. A croque monsieur with thick bread covered in Gruyere. And a quick walk to Dolores park to enjoy it all in the sunshine.

Tartine is like Mecca in San Francisco for lovers of pastry.  What did I love here?  The ham and cheese croissant, so flaky and buttery, no skimping on ham and cheese, and almost as big as my head!  I regretted seeing all those lovely bits of pastry fall away as I bit into it.  Sigh...  And yes--the brioche bread pudding is more moist than most--but I loved it and much prefer this to the dense style.  The contrast between the bright, perfectly sweetened berries and the creamy, soft, almost souffle-like bread pudding was outstanding and beautifully balanced.  Frangipane tart was very good but paled in comparison with the other items.  It's probably a good thing it's not easy for me to get here. :)

After getting there this morning before they opened, the line was already around the corner. The line went very quickly, we ordered a Almond Cream croissant and open face breakfast sandwich with turkey, cheese, asparagus, and carrots. Super good and coffee was good too! I loved their Almond Cream croissant, reminds me of Upper Crust Bakery in Austin! I think we will be back tomorrow morning for breakfast before our flight takes off!

I'm no expert at making or eating pastry's but Tartine Bakery left me speechless. The banana cream tart was refreshing, creamy, and the crust was flaky topped with thin sliced chocolate rectangles with a little bit of powered sugar to top it off. It was hard to eat with a plastic fork they gave me but I couldn't wait to taste it so I just grab it and took a big bite into it. The first bite you can taste the sliced bananas, little hint of caramel on the bottom and of course the crust which had a buttery taste and flaky texture. I went on a weekday around 2pm so the line wasn't long at all but if there was a line I think it would be worth the wait. Everything is made fresh and the selections are top quality.

If you see a constant line outside, then you know that place has got to be good - and Tartine is surely that.  Their baked items are so fresh and so tasty.  The almond croissant is so tender with crispy edges.  Absolutely delicious.  Another gem is their croque monsieur, especially the spicy turkey.

I wanted to give this place a higher rating, I really did! When you stand in line , you can smell the nice buttery aroma, almost like it's teasing you.. you can smell the butter, the almonds, the cheese, the pastries being baked it just smells like it's the best pastries in the world! and if you have to wait in the long line like I did, just by the smell it seemed like it was well worth the wait!  so just from the heavenly smell while in line I thought 5 stars!   so yes it was finally my turn to order! I I see everyone who was eating in with a Banana Cream Tart, so DUH I order one too! its obviously good since everyone is stuffing their faces with them!  and Since I was taking my pastries home which was atleast 40miles away I order 2 Banana cream tarts, ( incase it was super heavenly, my husband would get his own, because I dont like to share! lol) BANANA CREAM TART-SMALL  $7 - good but not , I'll drive all the way back stand in line great! ham and cheese( gruyere ) croissants $5.50 it was big! ( buttery flaky, but not OMG I NEED to spend almost 6 bucks on another!) frangipane croissant   $4.5 ( flaky , buttery, but where the almond filling? ) double pain au chocolat $ 5 ( not so great.. ) Chocolate Soufflé Cake slice - $5.50 ( my daughter said it was great,, I didn't try) so , since it was way too expensive in my opinion, I'm not much of a fan as I thought I would be. Yes their baked good are great. but its not as great considering their prices!  I would give them 5 stars had their prices represented how their pastries tasted. They need more UMPH! if they want to charge that much. ..

Copy and Paste...this is what it comes down to when writing a review for Tartine.  The pastries are just out of this world.  I was on my foodie quest in the Mission District of San Francisco and I happened to stay right across the street from this place.  Despite my close distance to the bakery, I still ended up standing in that horrendous line, but it was worth it...those flaky chocolate croissants and that banana tart!  I'd stand in line for probably an hour for them....they're that amazing!

I ordered the spicy turkey sandwich, a lemon tart, and 2 cookies. Total $22. Turkey sandwich was tasty. Toasted bread with ooey-gooey cheese. I like the spicy pickled carrot on the side. Lemon tart was very yummy. One of the best I have had. 2 cookies were crisp, but nothing too special. Factoring in the long line, the lack of tables (first come first service), the lack of service for dine-in eaters (self-bussing of tables, getting own utensils, etc.), Tartine comes out to be a 3/5 stars. I would come back but am not in a hurry to.

It took me a while until I actually went in, despite having walked by numerous times, but my roomie had been talking about it forever and we wanted to grab something to eat - so hello tartine. the space is pretty small and it can be tough to get a table/seat, but the food is delicious and just walking in and soaking up the delicious smell makes you want to buy everything. They have amazing and creative options, so everyone will find something and once you've tasted tartine you will go back for more. this bakery is divine!

Tartine is OK. The morning buns were delicious and I'm glad I got to try it at least once, but if I lived in the city, I'd probably try to find another joint. The lines are too long and definitely way overpriced - and probably a bit overhyped.

Where else can you get the buttery, flaky croissants, and decadent pain au chocolat?  Too bad it moved (for me) from its previous location in Mill Valley, and miss Christine from France who used to work there, but I still make the pilgrimage by crossing the bridge. Sure, it is not the place to be if you are counting calories, but for one of these unapologetic moments, their creations are absolutely heavenly. Come back to Mill Valley!

Outstanding, beautiful, authentic french "tout beurre" style pastries. Where can you find croissants this good in the US? Try the creamy quiche and croque monsieur sandwiches on Tartine's house baked bread, as well. They are luxuriously delicious. Desserts like merengue rochers with almonds or cacao nibs, chocolate torte with gold leaf, or passionfruit-filled cake will break your heart. Get a latte to drink there, and you'll be holding a beautiful bowl of coffee that's actually worthy of the pastries here. Sit and savor it at the large table near the door and meet someone new. Well worth standing in line for. Take your time to savor your treats at the outdoor tables and watch the 18th St. gourmet ghetto crowd go by.

I'd love to give this place 3 1/2 stars but decided to go a half star up instead because I don't have that choice.  When I started going there 2 years ago, this place was great.  Every pastry was absolutely stellar and perfect.  It was a real gem and locals' secret. I went recently, in the evening, on a Saturday night and was surprised to see a long line, not of punky, tattooed locals, but Prada-wearing Euroflash and camera-wielding tourists.  Weird since the Mission is still so grunge and alternative everywhere else.   We bought cookies, eclairs, a chocolate tart, some meringes (we go crazy at bakeries.)  I have to say everything was delicious but not as good as I remember.  It just didn't have that *loving* *homemade* *French* touch that was once there.  It's still worth going to but not as good as you would expect it to be considering the hype. If you want true French style pastries, go to Napa.  I haven't found anything in CA that even remotely comes close to Bouchon Bakery in Yountville.  Bouchon is still a bit more American (portions are small but larger and a bit less delicate than a real Parisian bakery) but it is absolutely and totally out of this world delicious, even after all these years. Hmmm...should write a review of Bouchon Bakery...

Don't plan on sitting down to eat here on a weekend.  Hunting for a table just isn't that enjoyable.  Just get your food and go sit at Dolores Park. That said.  You must get a gougre, a morning bun, and a small mocha.  It will leave your body wanting more.  If more is needed.  The chocolate croissants are amazing if they are warm.  The tarts are a plain good, nothing special there.  The croque monsieur are beyond good, but make sure you are going on a run later that day to help keep your heart pumping.

I'm picky about baked goods.  Most of the places in this town are a lot of hype and bad chocolate.  Tartine is not one of them.  The fine craftsmanship shows in everything they make from their cakes, to a wonderful croque monsieur.  Yes, the line is always long and can make you a tad cranky, but believe me it's worth it.  Great coffee too! It's hard to get a seat there so I usually get things to go-- I have a hard time dealing with aggro foodies jockeying for tables. Tip:  If you want a birthday cake plan at least a week in advance to be safe.

This is truly one of the gems of the culinary experience in san francisco. From their delicious tarts to almost perfect quiche, tartine offers a fabulous dining experience for someone in the mood for either a simple launch or bakery based breakfast. Every thing I have had at the place is awesome. I do have to agree with general consensus about the time delay. Since it is so popular, the line can get a little overwelming. Do your self a favor and go on week days rather than weekends or holidays.

This place is so good. The croissant au jambon was crispy, savory, cheesy, and buttery. The bread in the bread pudding was like a firm, delicious caramel custard with strawberries in it.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much bread pudding I got.   Everytime I eat from this place I wonder how it is this good?  I need to try everything on their menu.

Great coffee. My espresso machine is getting its valves spruced up at the moment, and I'm more than happy to walk the extra few blocks out of my way to get my caffeine fix here. I've never eaten here, but I've sat and sipped espresso while companions have, and they seemed happy, and everything looks and smells fresh and appetising. The queue is scary on weekends, but this seems de rigeur for anywhere in this town that can operate an espresso machine. Weird that there aren't more of them...

Tartine has really good bread if you wait for it to come out at 5pm.  They change bread types every day.  The crust is just perfect - crispy but not too hard - you can only get this type of crust with the right oven.  The inside is really soft, but not the way Wonder bread is soft - the bread has a really interesting and varied texture.  A lot of people say re: Tartine, that you can only get this type of bread in Europe, or in Paris..  I don't know about that, but I can say the bread is very good. I also tried their croissant and bread pudding, will go again when I am in the Mission.

Everytime I go to Tartine, I wait in line....Fortunately, the line goes right in front of the desserts.  I always go in with a game plan, but then I freeze.  What should I order?  Should I get the bread pudding, quiche, or one of their croissants?  Usually I end up taking one of the above.   P.S. If you think there is a better bakery in San Francisco, please drop me a line.  I need options.

I have to laugh at the previous review who said this neighborhood seedy. Seedy? No way. I mean, I guess compared to Pac Heights it may seem seedy but it's totally not seedy. It's safe, cute and not 100% gentrified yet (thank god). I really like Tartine. Last time I was there I had this French bread pizza delight. It  was French bread layered with sun dried tomatoes, ham and some kind of cheese. It was orgasmic. It was one of the most ununusal, most delicious baked goods I've ever had. Loved their flaky, buttery croissants too. The wait is a bitch, but I knew about that before going. It's tiny, cramped and crowded all the time. For me though, it's worth the wait. There are so few places that make baked goods consistently well. Tartine is one of those places.

Ever since I was brought here for breakfast by my local friend, I've been missing the ham and gruyere croissant like nobody's business!  It was deliciously flaky, buttery, tender, savory, and cheesy all in one magic hot pocket. I know that if I look hard enough that there is a NYC bakery that can do a comparable job.  For now, I'm still on the hunt. Other items I've tried were the signature morning rolls, which were so-so.  The coconut cake was lightly sweet and delicate.  After my visit, my friend gave me a copy of their cookbook for my birthday.  The lemon bars are now part of my repertoire.

OH MY HAM AND CHEESE ORGASM . Yes... YES.... YEEEESSSS!!! And my friend is one of the bakers there- can't beat that! I only gave Tartine 4 stars, because I once was allowed to pre-order 6 ham and cheese orgasms, waited 40 minutes for them to come out of the oven....burned. BURNED, and they wouldn't let me have them! I had to drive all the way back home with plain croissants (not toasty warm out of the oven) and two ginormous cookies - which hardly seemed worth the hour and a bit I waited there for the good stuff. My disappointment was so great, that I've not been back since. So, only 4 stars, my love, Tartine.

Tartine lives up to all the hype, the long lines, the hard to park neighborhood, the long wait for a table.   It is all worth it.   Their baked goods are out of this world - passionfruit coconut cake - yum, coconut cream pie with chocolate at the bottom - yum, croissants, rolls, cookies - yum, yum, yum.  And if you want to grab a sandwich and coffee or salad - those are also very very good.

Excellent bakery! We had quiche and croque monsier, followed by lemon tart. Just amazingly delicious. The only down part is that it is very crowded and impossible to find a parking spot. But it pays off all the pain once you take a bite. Take Bart to go there and just walk around. Mission is an interesting place to be!

I've been going to Tartine regularly for the past two years, and have always left full, satisfied and happy.  I've always had a little bit of trouble finding parking and seating, but that's really just a part of life if you're used to driving around to small bakeries and restaurants in SF.  Just be patient, and everything will work out.   Worse case scenario: you can't find a table, so you walk a couple blocks north to Dolores Park and have a great picnic!  This is one of those bakeries where literally EVERYTHING is delicious, rich & fluffy.  You simply can't go wrong. The only reason I'm giving Tartine 4 instead of 5 stars is that upon my last visit I noticed the prices were much higher, and the lines much longer than I remembered.  $6 for a small tart, and $3.25 for a plain croissant seems too steep unless I have friends/family in town and am looking to impress with local fare.  And it's such a pain to wait in line on a weekend morning for a couple small treats...seems worth it only if you're buying a large quantity of their signature dishes that you really cant get elsewhere.   So take my advice. If you make the trek to Tartine, don't go for the simple stuff, go for the gold that isn't sold just anywhere.  My favorites are the scrumptiously warm bread pudding with seasonal fruit, meringues with cacao nibs, chocolate cake, quiche, and gougere au fromage.  Bon Appetit!

Read that this place received an award for best bakery in San Francisco or was that California, I don't remember. The bakery was extremely crowded it was difficult to pick something out since there were hordes of people behind you. I only ordered a lemon bar and a loaf of the sesame country bread. I think the first thing you noticed about this place is the pricing. Pastry here was definitely not cheap. $3.00 scone and $3.50 lemon bar were not my idea of a cheap snack. However, they were good. The lemon bar on the other hand was extremely sweet, like biting into a cube of sugar. The loaf bread though was more reasonably priced at around $7-8 and it was huge. I felt like I was carrying an infant around. But a reminder, this is not your typical loaf of bread you buy at Safeway, so you need to finish it quick or it will turn to a piece of rock. I would like to give it 5 stars but the price was a bit of a turnoff but I will need to go back a couple more times to justify that. Overall, pastry and bread was good. Crowded and limited seating. Good location but a bit difficult to find parking.

This place is always crowded, but it's worth the wait! Both the vegetarian and meat quiches are divine. I don't know what this other thing was called, but it was ham, tomato, cheese and other tasty bits toasted on some kind of bread (I know, terribly vague I'm sorry! I didn't order the food!). Wow. SO GOOD! Their breaded pudding is supposed to be awesome right? I haven't tried it yet, but I definitely will one day. You should definitely come here for a taste. All their stuff is very very good. Seating is limited, but usually while you wait in line tables will free up.

Tartine is everything it's billed to be: o) Delicious. The pastries speak for themselves. In addition to looking gorgeous they are delectable. They do a good job keeping the sweet things from being overwhelmingly so. The sandwiches all come on wonderful breads that really add to the experience. o) Crowded. I live a half block from Tartine and you can almost set your watch by the crowds. On weekends, it's always busy. At lunch, it's busy. In between lunch and dinner (say 1:30p-4:30p) there is a window during which the wait may only be a few minutes. The problem with the crowds is that while Tartine is absolutely yummy, waiting 40 minutes for a sandwich or a tart seems a bit excessive. Exacerbating this is the feeling that the servers are never in a hurry. o) Expensive. $10.50 for a cheese sandwich is too much. I'm fine with places taking a long time. My problem with Tartine, and the reason for the 3 star review is that the service could be so much better if they committed to getting people in and out of there more quickly. They haven't, and so most trips here are an exercise in frustration for me. That's partially my fault, partially theirs.

The sweet tooth in some calls for chocolate, and for others, fruity candied delights.   Pour moi?  There is nothing quite as dreamy as Tartine's toasted almond Rochers (meringue cookies).  Warm nutty bits folded into a light, airy swirl of sugary meringue.  So take that wax paper in your hand, ms. bakery counter girl, and scoop me up a dozen to go. STAT!

I've read about this place on SF Gate many times and when I happened to be walking by one night I had to stop and try it out.  My friend and I came at just the right time (6pm)  because as soon as we sat down the placed filled up (some people shared a large farm table) and the live music started.  There were three ladies playing a bass, accordion and violin.  They were very hippy chick and set a great vibe in the place.   My friend and I decided to share the Mozzarella  and tapenade sandwich.  The bread was amazing!  It was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy and soft closer to the filling.  I can't wait to go back and try the pastries next time!

As a bakery I'd say between 4 & 5 stars... BUT, this is really more than a bakery, they serve food as well, and that is the problem. While the bakery goods are very good, and at times even excellent, and the coffee is top-notch (good ole Mr Espresso, none of that nose-in-the-air Blue Bottle stuff here), the savory items leave a lot to be desired. The sandwiches are HUGE (which is good) but also very greasy and lack in subtlety.  As sort of a Mission version of Berkeley's Cafe Fanny they have managed to avoid the pretentious staff issues that mat Fanny -- but, they also seem to have missed to delicacy and quality of Fanny's food. So, go for breakfast or a mid-morning coffee... but, for lunch, there are better options.

Any place that sells bread pudding for breakfast is a winner in my book. I was a bit dubious about all the hype, but it was TOTALLY worth the hike through the rain. This is not a frou-frou bakery. No crazy works of food art here. Solid, quality french style pastries at typical prices. You probably can't go wrong here, and I can't wait to go back and try more things. Ambiance is a bit lacking, as the place is small and crowded, but how can you not be happy with croissant in hand? Go outside and roam the neighborhood instead.

3.5 I expected a lot out of Tartine reading all of the yelp reviews so i was slightly disappointed that this place didn't blow my mind.  a good bakery, but i was expecting fireworks to explode after trying one of their baked goods after reading these reviews. Friday morning we still had about a 20 minute wait.   Morning bun- good, perhaps might have been better if it was warm.  surprisingly not too sweet with a good hint of orange.  the bun was way over hyped for me and since i dont have much of a sweet tooth, i wasn't 100% impressed. Croissants- plain was really good.  i slightly prefered this to the morning bun since it was nice and buttery.  chocolate- ok, better if it was warm. Gruyer- a baked roll-ish type good with grueyer cheese and cracked black pepper.  a tad too peppery, but overall very fresh. very little table space here so grab a table fast.  you get your own water and plates and clean up after yourself.  and the workers are still snooty.  Some seemed very annoyed if you weren't sure what you wanted and a few didn't want to give anyone the time of day.  definitely not a place you feel you can sit awhile at- with tons of people standing around waiting for a table, you feel the pressure to wolf down your pastries and get out. it's a must do on many lists, i would come again if i was in the area but perhaps not make a trip out specifically for Tartine.

4.5  stars Get in line because you are beautiful and your palate deserves an organism. By the time I got to order, I was dingo hungry and decided, hell...I am going to order a LOT and figure out what is good/bad in one trip. 1.  Croissant-Buttery, Crispy, Flaky, Delicious. 2.  Chocolate Croissant-The above, but with a perfect amount of deep, dark chocolate. 3.  Spicy turkey with roasted tomato flat sandwich-the fire roasted/seasoned tomato make this a winner.   4.  Prosciutto and Provolone (Arugula..mmm., this was a staff choice)-The Arugula really brings out the subtleties of the prosciutto....and damn, they melt on the provolone...it is gooey and delectable. 5.  Coffee-Got me hyped up enough to write this when I was done eating.  Not sure if they change their blends, but this mornings was a smooth S. American blend...probably Columbian, or Brazilian.... I am kidding...it was good though. :) 6.  Fresh squeezed grape fruit juice-If you don't like pulp, pass.  I loved it a laht. 7.  Oatmeal cookie-Small, expensive, but pretty much the only oatmeal I will ever eat.   The line is long.  The food ain't cheap.  But it is one of those places that you have to visit in this great city of ours.  Great job Tartine B!   4.5 stars (only cause I hate lines and I had to grind two dudes to get past the line and get some drip coffee)

Just returned from a 3 week trip to France and I was craving for a high quality croissant in the morning.  This place has the best croissants in the  Bay Area ... I would say Tartines is just as good, if not better than the famous Laduree in Paris.   Even though my craving for a croissant lured me to Tartine, I ended getting what I usually get there ... the bread pudding with fruit.  It was fantastic. My favorites at Tartine: Bread pudding Croissants Eclairs Chocolate pudding The place is always packed and after you have taste their goods, you will know why.

Yum, yum yum! Tartine is delicious! I went there for the first time on July 4th, and even though the place was packed, it was worth the wait. I got a chocolate tart and a brownie. Both were moist, delectable and (surprisingly!) affordable. The bakery itself is beautiful and welcoming, clean and minimal. Very earthy and simple. The staff was polite and thin! I guess they don't get a discount... Because it was so busy due to the holiday, I'm sad that I didn't get a chance to sit down and eat more (yes, I know I sound like a fat kid. It's impossible not to be at this place!), but I know I'll be back. Dieters, stay FAR AWAY from this establishment. It will be your undoing.

Here's the scoop on Tartine. Their baked goods are AWESOME. Only problems are that 1. You can get really old waiting in line. I have seriously waited in line for 20-30 minutes before. It's crazy. 2. Far worse than the line is the attitudes of the people behind the counter. Basically they are snooty hipsters that treat you with complete disdain and attitude. Part of the reason that the line gets so long is not just that it is popular, but that the counter staff drags along at a snails pace while simultaneously treating you like crap. So that being said, baked goods - awesome, vibe and wait - really, really AWFUL. You make the call.

Friendly and competent staff (plus a few hotties). Good, well-made espresso beverages. Some people hate on Tartine because they don't like waiting in the line or because they are trying to be counter-culture.  They are wrong it really is that good.

This place is a staple for out of town visitors.  Aside from the massive line, there is nothing wrong with this bakery.  Seriously.  Try anything off the menu or sample anything in the case and you will be pleased.  More than pleased.  Happy.  Peaceful.  Filled.   I am a hog.  There, I said it.  Therefore I find it totally appropriate to order a chocolate eclair at 10:00 on a Sunday morning.  The problem is that every time I get in line, I tell myself I will try something new, or get something savory, but by the time I order, my mouth takes over and blurts out "Eclair!".  It is mouthwatering. The sammies are good, and the ham and cheese croissants are fabulous.  Even though I am veg, my friends are kind enough to share the veg friendly corners. If you have not braced the line, do it.  It is so worth it.

This was delicious!  I was so excited to venture into the Mission just for this bakery but it was well worth it-- I will be back here again.   Luckily when I went, there was no line at all.  I was completely surprised because it was lunch time (1pm on a Wednesday).  I guess I was pretty lucky.  I ordered a turkey sandwich with broccoli pesto which was so different and quite a tasty sandwich.  I also ordered a piece of chocolate bread which was decadently rich and Delicious.  If you're a chocolate lover then this is the dessert for you.  Although I really do wish I could have tried the bread pudding.  It looked so good! A word of advice:  the sandwiches are huge!  You could for sure split one with a small salad and be completely satisfied.  I can't wait to go back and give the pastrami and bread pudding a try!

When is obscene amounts of desserts and baked goods not a good idea? Exactly. It's ALWAYS a good idea. Which is why when looking for my next apartment, proximity to Tartine Bakery is going to be pretty high up on my list of requirements. You may consider this crazy but I just consider it practical; Whether I have friends in town, am feeling sad and in need of a pick me up, am happy and need to celebrate, or am meeting someone to catch up over coffee, I always seem to end up at Tartine. Why, then, should I live so far away!? I can't seem to think of a good reason either. So here's to one day being your neighbor, Tartine. In the meantime, I will continue to make the trek to come visit you, wait in your long line and then sit in bliss while I stuff myself to the point of discomfort with all of your delicious treats.

The morning bun was AMAZING - even the next morning after a night of refrigeration and subsequent re-toasting, it still had the delightful flaky crustiness. The bread pudding was a bit too eggy for my tastes, but was definitely not too sweet, which is good. Was not a fan of the Three Cheese sandwich, but the freshly baked walnut bread was delicious with cheese from the Bi-Rite store down the street

We came in on a Saturday morning at around 9am.  We ordered mainly pastries to tie us over while we did an urban hike.   Let me tell you that the dessert case that held all the goodies looked amazing.  The cookies and cakes looked so delicious!   Anyway - on to what we got, chocolate croissant, gougere (sp?), and a currant scone, a latte and an iced tea.  The total damage was about $17... not too bad considering what we got. Drinks were standard... although my friend got a non-fat latte and the barista used whole milk.   Chocolate croissant - still warm!  So flaky and warm, it melted in your mouth.   Currant scone - I didn't try it but my friend loved it. Gougere - gruyere cheese, thyme and pepper baked into what looked like a giant bun.  However, the inside was hollow, it was interesting and had it been warm, absolutely delicious. Overall - I'd recommend this place, I want to go back and try the sandwiches.

Oh country bread you are the best bread in the world. I can't say I am a huge fan of their pastries and such because they are merely distractions on the path to country bread. The country bread is what its all about. You can get a decent pastry many places. I happen to be a fan of Destination myself. But you can only get this amazing bread at Tartine. I don't have anything to prove by standing in line. I refuse to wait in line at amusement parks but I am more than happy to patiently await my turn to get my starch of choice. The bread, 'nough said.

This is probably the only place I can think of that I would give a 6 star rating to if there was such an option.  My wife was introduced to this place by her french canadian friend Michelle.  Those Canucks are pretty sophisticated with their food and dining expectations, so she usually knows what is good.  We got there late on a Sunday and the line was long but not the wrap around the block insane mid morning lines for this place.  I was sure that the hype would be unfounded.  Holy crap was I wrong.  I am not a pastry person.  I much prefer salty snacks and all, but man are those pastries freaking crazy delicious.  We also had a soup and sandwich, and the soup was bowl lickably good and the panini was huge and fantastic. I thought the prices were going to be massively expensive for a little miniature sweets like Fleur de Cocoa in Los Gatos, but not so.  The prices are super reasonable and the portions range from large to huge.  Go, wait, wait some more, eat, smile, rejoice.

I went here at night, and it was still pretty busy. The bakery is pretty small, so you're almost forced to wait in line right next to people dining there. We ordered items that were already ready, aside from drinks so we didn't wait long to eat. But if we had, it would be worth the wait. The coffee and tea was very tasty. My husband and I bought their chocolate chip cookies (I wish I took a picture) that were already packaged to take home. They're the thin, crunchy chocolate chip cookies. They seriously tasted the way they looked. Fabulous. They were crunchy, yet soft in the middle. Just the right amount of chocolate chips, not too much and not too little. My mouth is salivating just thinking about it. I can't wait until I'm in the area again to go try more things.

This place is amazing.Okay, the line is frickin long consistently but that should say something. There's minimal seating depending on when you come, of course. The croque monsieur with provolone and prosciutto was really really good. i don't know how just a sandwich is so good, but it is. GET IT. The sandwich's bread is just perfectly toasted complemented with oozing cheese and perfectly salted prosciutto inside. And then you can get eclaires for dessert. who can argue with that? ps parking's a bitch  too take muni if possible.

If your in the mood for some good breakfast treats, phenomenal bread and taste of pastries that just overewheml your tastebuds, tartine in the Mission is the place. With so many options, fresh made breads and heavenly flavors, its hard to say no. The quiché of the Day had sundried tomatoes and ham. Delicate and fluffy eggs coated the roasted veggies in a flaky yet sturdy crust. Delicious. The  lemon bar was citrusy and tangy, not too sweet and went fabulously well with a cafe latte. The only drawback was that they offer no flavorings for the lattes which didn't work so well for a sweet vanilla craving. The food is so good that they can get away with it! The croque monsieur was amazing: country crusted baked bread, wild mushrooms, sundried tomatoes With eggs and gruyere cheese. Probably one of the best croque monsieur I've had, even better than the ones I've had in Paris. I was eyeing the bread pudding topped with local apricot and peaches.. crust just oozing with hot steam as the tray came out of the oven. A bustling local spot, With lines out the door, grab a morning bun before they run out!

Disappointing, esp. after reading reviews.  Our SF apt is 2 blocks away.  Went there 3 times during our 10 day visit.  Doesn't measure up to Clear Flour back home.  We had croissants, scones, bread pudding, sticky bun, yogurt w/ museli, quiche, chocolate croissant tea and cafe au lait. The croissant is one of my favorite bakery items, so I'll start there.  The dough seemed correctly prepared, but incorrectly cooked.  Finished product exterior was burnt on bottom yet inside was mushy, even after letting sit for 30 minutes to let cool after they served it to me (right out of the oven).  They apparently should be cooking at lower temperature for longer and letting rest before serving. My SO makes excellent scones that are light and flaky (after 10s of tries).  While these were clearly better than 99% of the rocks that American bakeries produce, they were still a bit ameturish and nothing to write home about---moderately flaky, moderately dense. Bread pudding (apple for us) was one of the stars for us.  Moist, not overly sweet, great fruit topping that wasn't overcooked (good texture).  Quiche was good, but far from Thomas Keller's level of creaminess.  Sticky buns had an extra layer of raw sugar on top (besides the caramel) which made them hard to eat.  Yogurt museli was awful---thin yogurt with soggy, tasteless granola. Such a mixed bag that I can't imagine recommending it to anyone.  We also hit Thorough Bread and Pastry and Acme Bread and found both to be superior.

Jeebus. I've been here twice around 6:30pm and they've run out of morning buns, chocolate croissants, and everything else that I wanted to try :( the first time I just walked out since nothing looked tempting (and nearly $10 for a savory sandwich thinger? omg) but the second, I opted for a coffee, a mexican wedding cookie, and a chocolate walnut cookie. Everything was seriously delicious. I was going to take it to go but then saw the inviting community table and took a seat with my book with the other loners who were sitting at the table with their books. The mexican wedding cookie was a little too over-powdered for my tastes, but the inside was perfectly textured- not dry but not moist either, just the perfect amount of crispness! nom nom. the chocolate walnut cookie was delicious too.... it had an interesting flavor since there wasn't TOO much chocolate and walnut balance was great. Next time I come by Tartine.... please have chocolate croissants and morning buns!!!!!!!!!!!

I wanted to try something different than the regular stuff at Boulangerie, and after hearing all the rave reviews I was fully expecting to have a new contender for the best bakery in San Francisco. LOL NO. The customer service is so bad. One guy behind the counter was chit chatting to some girl  about some band. When I asked her if she was in line, she scoffed and said "YEA I'M ORDERING." Sorry, I didn't realize the workers don't actually serve you. THEN we ordered our pastries and the people behind the counter literally sat there dazed for a good minute or so staring out into space...so weird. The pastries were burnt. They were nothing special. The chocolate croissant had the consistency of the croissants at Costco, yea you know the ones, only with only a few more flakes and bittersweet chocolate in the center. The almond crossant was better, but still burnt on the top, and the price was pretty high for the product. I should have never strayed from my beloved Boulangerie, never again.

Sorry to say, I'll never come back again! I've been longing to try Tartine Bakery ever since I read their cookbook, but my visit today turned out to be a great disappointment... I'm still pissed at myself for spending $20 at this place today... - 0 stars for the mozerrella Mozzarella & Tapenade sandwich. Man, that sandwich was disgusting, it's like two slices of cheese pizza piled on top of each other, greasy, no flavor, and expensive.  This is the worst sandwich I have had in the bay area, it's that bad... - 4 stars for the pastry: they have a wide selection of fine-looking and tasty pastry, but well.. it's not worth $6.5 for a fruit tart/bread pudding.  I'd rather go to La Boulange or Bouchon... - 0 stars for the service:  a loooooooonnnnnnnng wait and bad attitude, enough said

Stopped here for a late breakfast on a recent trip to SF.  It was a weekday and on the late side, so the line was quick. We ordered a combination of breakfast items including pain chocolate, bread pudding with strawberries, and a quiche.  All of the items were well done and incredibly tasty.  The food was so good, my wife had to get an extra pastry to go.   The coffee was also very good and all in all this was a great morning (albeit full of calories) stop.

I was watching the Food Network and Tartine Bakery were on a special called, "Top 10 Bakeries in the United States". Tartine Bakery was place #6, if I recall. After watching the show, I decided to go up there. Oh! My! Gosh! Their Tres Leches cake is INCREDIBLE! I haven't had anything so tasteful in my life. I was in heaven after my first bite of that cake. I went back another time and tried other cakes and treats, and I fell in love with this place. You can have your eyes closed, choose blindly, and still have the best treat ever. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the city or if you're visiting. You will not be disappointed.

Finally bought into the hype that is Tartine. It doesn't even have a freaking sign in front and yet you just. know. What to look for: young hipsters, aging hipsters, yuppies, yuppie moms, yuppie expectant moms, all on line for over-priced yet quite delicious morning buns, croissants, etc. I went here with a friend for lunch and was immediately taken aback by the high price for the pressed sandwiches (over $10!) and immediately asked the woman behind the counter if they "came with anything" and she gave me a weird look and said "nope." My friend ended up ordering an olive tapenade sandwich and I decided to go with the "less expensive" zucchini quiche. VERY glad I did not get a pressed sandwich and also glad I am incredibly aggressive when it comes to table-hunting because that place was packed with a near-constant line out the door. Anyway, back to the sandwich! It took like half an hour to come out and it was a greasy, olive-y monstrosity. OK maybe I'm biased because I despise olives, but my friend didn't enjoy it that much either. So maybe they give you a pretty big portion, but it's almost all bread. All the grease combined with the strong flavor of the olive and anchovy tapenade was not very pleasant. We did however enjoy an almond croissant and a lemon creme tart in the end (after I stood in line for another 15 mins). So, all in all, I would say that you should go to Tartine just to see what all the hype is about, but if you hate waiting in lines and can't even imagine paying over $10 for a "pressed sandwich" or croque monsieur, this is not the place for you. I think I'll be back someday, maybe just for a coffee to-go and a dessert or pastry.

Tartine KILLS me. So glad I live on the east coast. For now. My perfect death would come while slouching on a chair outside Tartine, with a major LDL block in my aorta, a chunk of a custardy Tartine gougere lodged in my throat, and my fist squeezed around a macaroon. I feel that everyone would accept this more easily than if I died in any other way--- they'll expect this of me, it'll be easy to let me go because they'll know that death came to me as bliss overruled my biology. Nah but forruh. The staff is quick and efficient and the place is always bustling with San Francisco's most adorable young families. Unbeatable bakery, and they just put out a cookbook bursting with valuable secrets. Boyfriend just made their signature shortbread-- it brings tears of butter to my eyes.

OK. First off I would like to say the food itself is worth 5 stars, but the service sucks! All of the workers I have encounter there that day only one girl behind the espresso bar made me feel welcome. I was in Hayes Valley and wanted a place to eat. For some reason I thought of Tartine, so I googled it and my friend and I was exactly 1 mile away. We walked there to find a long line out the door, but we were already here might as well try it. I wanted a Banana Cream Tart, but they were out so I settled for the Coconut Cream Tart. It was HEAVENLY! I also pre-ordered half a loaf of walnut bread to be picked up at 5 pm (3 hours later). There wasn't any place to sit, so we had to order to go. When I wanted to know the different flavors of bread they offer the girl had this "OMG. Do I really have to tell you the flavors" look on her face. I thought that was uncalled for. I just wanted to know the damn flavor of the bread so I can order it. OK. My friend and I walked around the Mission and came back 30 minutes before 5 pm to pick up our  bread. Yes, we had food in our hands because we hungry, and finally there was a place to sit inside. We sat down and started eating our food (outside food and our desserts that we ordered at Tartine). While we were eating I can see the worker staring and talking about us (I was facing the mirror, so I saw whatever was happening behind me as well). I know it was rude of me to bring in food, but we really were hungry. If the bread came out sooner we would have left and eaten everything at home. Anyway, the whole time we kept getting constant stares at the two workers..  ugh.. I was so annoyed. Overall, the service was ehh... but the desserts and bread was absolutely delish! :) I would definitely come back for the food because that overrule the customer service.

One of the most hyped up places to eat in San Francisco, not to mention the country. Yes, this is the bakery that was deemed "Best Bakery in America" by the New York Times food review. The best bread you'll ever eat in your life, but it sells out quick . Cookies, cakes creams and pies, croque monsieurs, muesli, savory and sweet buns and delicious Four Barrell coffee. Check out the Wine Bar and the espresso counter. Don't leave without a sugar rush. This is my favorite place in the city, just watch out for the homeless folk when you sit outside, they WILL steal your morning buns. PS- there's no sign out front, just look for the line around the block.

Delicious, quality pastries/breads/desserts. Well thought out and well-made. 1.) Service: typically has a long line unless you go at random times during the workday, but the line goes by fast. The workers are pretty straight to the point and not overly nice but not rude or anything, they're just cheeeeeel! Parking I'm sure is a little bitch, but it's so close to the J, Mission street, Birite, Dolores Park so it's super central and the walk shouldn't be an issue. 2.) Prices: quite pricey for pastries, but it's quality. They use fresh ingredients and what not! Yet I wish things like the morning bun were like...warm. 3.) Banana Creme Tart: Delicious! Looked at the yelps and saw that this seemed to be a winner winner chicken dinner and plus I love these little bad boys. The crust was VERY hard to cut through but was VERY delicious - wasn't too sweet or overly buttery, it was just right. It had a very nice taste. The bottom layer was lined with dark chocolate and caramel...SUPER RICH! The banana cream itself was very good but I felt like I tasted more whipped cream than the banana cream/bananas but then again it could just mean the banana cream is more subtle, which is good. But this was a delicious one! Super rich...split it with my friend and we were super full after. 4.) Morning bun: Multi-layers little cinnamon-croissant bun thing! The inside is soft, and the outer layers are nice and crispy and flakey! You get the best of all different worlds - it's soft and bready, but the top is flakey and buttery. I liked it. But it didn't fit my taste at the time but it was still delicious. 5.) Short bread cookie: AWESOME! Perhaps one of the best short bread cookies I've ever had! Great texture. Its the kind where you bite into it and it just crumbles into your mouth. Next time I really want to try the sammies and the coconut creme/lemon cream tarts!

I get a little sad every time I think of Tartine Bakery being thousands of miles away. Every chance I get to go visit family in San Francisco, I stop by this bakery. The line is pretty much always out the door but it moves fairly quickly. I think in total we waited 20 minutes. Between my fiance and I, we grabbed an almond croissant, chocolate croissant, lemon curd tart, and bread pudding along with an espresso and coffee. The little sugar cubes that they provide for the coffee is darling. Back to the food, the almond croissant we got was 'to go' but I guess it doesn't travel well. Throughout the day it became hard and a little dry. Sad because we brought it back for family. The chocolate croissant was not as flaky as I would of liked. It was still good but I probably won't order it again. The lemon curd tart was to die for. I wish I can get one here on the east coast. The little flower garnish on top is cute. The curd is rich, creamy, perfectly sour and well balanced in sweetness. Lastly the bread pudding was really good too. I wasn't a fan of bread pudding due to its consistency but Tartine swayed me. The bread, I think it's brioche?, is a good choice.

Delicious sweets and hot pressed sandwiches (which are huge!)  Very simple fare, but strong flavors and premium ingredients = yum!   Favorite hot pressed sandwiches:   - Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese on Walnut Bread - Mozzarella & Tapenade (fresh mozzarella with house-made niçoise olive and anchovy puree). My only complaint is only kind of a complaint...  the portions are so large, and the tastes are so simple, so sometimes I get a little sick of whatever I'm eating.  It seems a little unfair to complain about large portion sizes, though, so I usually just fix this "problem" by eating half of my sandwich there, and saving the other half for later.

Popped my Tartine cherry just last weekend after hearing raves of reviews from friends. We waited in line for about 15-20 minutes to place our order. I think it was the delicious aroma of the bakery, but I got into a frenzy and ended up ordering about $25 worth of goodies for myself... The morning bun was delicious! The orange glaze really makes their morning bun different from others. I also tried their ham and cheese croissant, which was absolutely fabulous. I have never had such a beautifully textured croissant. It was flaky, crunchy, soft, and moist all at the same time! I ordered shortbread, mexican wedding cookies, coconut macaroons, and their chocolate nib rochers. I think that their pastries are a lot better than their small desserts. However, the mexican wedding cookies are pretty fantastic.

Wow, I thought the cakery in Burlingame was good, this place is even better. Their croissants are to die for.  Crispy and flaky on the outside buttery on the inside.  yum....   Their pressed sandwhiches are really good too, probably because they drench the bread in butter or olive oil.  Whichever, it is yummy. The chocolate croissant is good too if you like solid chunks of chocolate in there but  I'm not a big fan of that, it's like eating a chocolate bar for breakfast.  The scones are decent. I like their latte as well, served in a nice big bowl.  Great place if you don't mind the line.

4.5 stars.  If only I came here when I was HUNGRY.  I had the lemon tart and ham & cheese crossiant.  Both were really good!  The crossiant had just the right flakiness, softness, and yummy buttery goodness.   There was a line out the door but it wasn't too bad since we were first timers and it gave us some time to figure out what we wanted to order.  The place isn't very big and we were lucky that a table opened up right after we paid.

After not leaving fully satisfied the last time I came to Tartine, I must say now that I am a definite Tartine lover, like the rest of San Francisco is. Came back here last October with my mother and had to battle the line and customers to find seats. I swear it is like going into battle trying to get a seat in Tartine! lol. Anyways, we ordered the Banana bread, which was  dense, moist enough and delicious! Couldn't forget the morning bun, frangipane croissant, and double pain au chocolate. This time I knew not to get the bread pudding and am glad because I came for the right stuff this time! We finished every single one of those breads and pastries! All were fresh, delicious, sweet and filling. I'll be back for the Country bread... that is if I can get my hands on some when they come out, fresh and hot from the oven at 5 pm. I have a feeling this time it will be more than a battle to fight for those.

First time I visited their was a line out the door. When there's a line out the door at a bakery your instincts tells you that it's worth the wait and boy oh boy was it worth the wait! I came here for lunch and decided to order their Croque-monsieur with a berry tort. How can I describe the Croque-Monsieur? The bread crunchy, moist and baked to perfection. Served with warm ham and cheese this open faced sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, very comparable to the croque-monsieur I had during my last visit to France (which says a lot). The berry tort was also delicious. The berries were plentiful and the cake was baked just right! Moist, juicy and berriful with every single bite. Just a pleasant Tartine experience and I can't wait until my next!

I HAVE ANOTHER YELP ACCOUNT - JUST MOVING ALL OF MY REVIEWS TO THIS ONE... I'm off on Mondays so I have a list of places to visit while I have no child and free.... Stood in line to see what the hype was about for Tartine.  I recently watch the new Food Network Channel that the bakery was premiered on.  I get excited when I see places in my city that I can visit. I looked and looked for parking.  But I got lucky before I gave up... Beware!  It is right on the corner of Guerrero and 18th Street;  this is a busy, busy area especially on the weekends with great weather (Dolores Park is a block away!) I stood in a line that went out the door so I was super anxious to see what they had to offer.  The prices are high but hey...enjoy life right?  The eclairs are yummy and the croissants are outstanding!!!

Wow! I was like a kid in a candy shop when I came in here for the first time. I read the menu over a few times, scanned the pastry case back and forth, and changed my mind about a thousand times before I could decide on a few things. Yes, I got more than one thing. I wanted to try the sandwiches while I was here, but since they were backed up, I couldn't order one. I decided on a piece of almond, poppy seed pound cake, a chocolate croissant, and a cheese gougere breakfast pastry. Don't worry, I shared with another person. Word of advice, if you want morning buns, bread, or sandwiches you've got to get there when they open. Also, you may have to wait in a fairly long line, but it moves semi fast. Definitely want to make it back to try the morning buns and sandwiches.

Pastry heaven = Tartine's Bakery I superlove their Banana Cream Pie, Morning Bun, and Chocolate Chip Cookies. Amazing cakes and pastries, totally worth the wait.  If you are in the area at 5pm, check out the fresh artisan bread!!  Hot and fresh, you'll prolly eat most of it on your way home.  The next day, pop in the toaster and serve with butter - indescribable goodness all over again.

The morning buns live up to everything people say about it. I think they have one type of bread for all their sandwiches, a country bread, which is one of the best breads in anywhere. The sandwiches are rustic and delicious. The pastries are out of this world. Pieces are really huge though, which I guess is a good thing for most people, but kind of too hard to finish.

I loooooooooooove their frangipane croissant, morning bun, cardamom bun, and frangipane tart!! (I have had an almond croissant that is better than their's, but as of this moment it is no longer or not yet available...). Their coconut passion fruit cake is pretty good too! However, their banana cream pie is sub-par. Crust is too hard and too thick, too much whipped cream, too much chocolate on the crust and it tastes shitty. There is not enough pastry cream or bananas. I still have to try so many things here 'cause they all look and sound so tasty! Hopefully they don't turn out like the banana cream pie...big disappointment. Make sure you go quite early in the day otherwise they run out of all the good stuff ESPECIALLY the frangipane croissant. Those four things I listed in my first sentence have the best value (of what I've seen anyway). Everything else seems kinda small and expensive... A note of caution. Do not go expecting an excellent cup of coffee to go along with your pastry. On two separate occasions, I have had two terrible cups of coffee. They had a hint of burnt and a strong taste of sour. It is disappointing that an excellent bakery has such poor coffee. Regardless, the pastry manages to shine above the bad coffee.

Awesome grilled sandwiches. Just wish the place wouldn't be so tied and crowded and they would close the door when it's chilly out.  Guess it helps to turn the tables around faster.  Will be back on a sunny day then I can sit outside and also sample the many yummy sweet treats they have.

Well, that was quite an adventure-- trying to find this bakery!  Parking is nearly impossible to find, but I was not going to miss out on a chance to try a place that has been deemed by "foodies" as THE PLACE to go, in San Francisco.  Lucky us, we scored a parking spot and picked the ONE day that a crew was jackhammering outside the bakery.  Unless I'm blind, there is NO SIGNAGE saying that this is Tartine Bakery!  It was mid-week, about 9am when we arrived.   We made our way in, and I was expecting a snooty staff, since so many reviews said that this is the case.  Nope, didn't happen. Amidst the ear-splitting jackhammering, I told the young man I was a Tartine Virgin, and he patiently told me to take my time.  I zeroed in on the Orange Morning Muffin, then got a slice of ham and leek quiche and a coffee.  The cashier was super friendly, and apologized for the noise.  We scored a small table.   Let me tell you-- that morning muffin was worth the parking hassle.  It was warm, tender, crunchy, chewy, with a perfect blend of orange and cinnamon. Heaven! We had to get a second one. The coffee was perfect.  The quiche-- well, that wasn't my favorite.  The custard was light and airy but had a strange "bitter" flavor to it.  Is this the best bakery I've EVER been to? No. But, if I could get my hands on that morning muffin recipe, I'd love to make some at home.  I'm glad I got a chance to come here. If I was in the neighborhood, I'd have my husband circle around, while I snag some more morning muffins.  Oh, I took photos of the cakes, which looked beautiful.

I came Yelp to check if anyone has experienced "unpleasant customer service" at Tartine.  I am relieved to find out I am not only one to experience. If customer service is good, I would have ordered more. If a girl behind the counter asks me "would you like to have anything else?", I would smile back with another order. I feel sorry for Tartine to lose a business opportunity. Tarts were wonderful as usual, but memory of unfriendly customer service added bitter flavor.

Who doesn't love Tartine?  This is the best bakery in SF!  The BANANA CREAM TART and ECLAIR are a must try.  I've tried some other things, but these two are the ones that stand out the most.  Don't come here for the hot pressed sandwiches.  They sound better than they taste.  This is a dessert place and you should stick with the sweets.  Although it may be a bit pricey, it's definitely worth the money.

Is there nothing that isn't SUPERB in their bakery case?  My friend and I pulled up nearby Tartine, early one Saturday morning and the line was already quite long.  As we pulled into a magically available parking space, directly across the street (seriously?  this was a sign!) he said, "Don't worry about the line, it's worth it."  Now, don't get me wrong, I trust AJ implicitly when it comes to most things food oriented, but I've seen lines before, waited in them and felt horribly ripped off by my meal after having wasted time.  I kept my misgivings to myself and we lined up as the pleasant aromas of the bakery wafted out the door and down the street. Once we got to the Bakery window, I started to get pretty excited, because I could see these giant vats of cream fillings and pastry puffs waiting to be filled with pure delicious.  That's when I started to have a crisis...whatever would we get?  I mean, how was I to choose just one...or two of these lovelies???  I shouldn't have been concerned...we ordered just about one of everything! A coconut creme tart, bread pudding with fresh peaches and blackberries, ham and cheese croissant, quiche, morning bun, chocolate chip cookie, lemon bar and probably some other stuff...it's been a few months since this trip and I'm writing from memory.  We headed up to Twin Peaks, enjoying the misty morning and chowing down on our FEAST. The best part....when I arrived safely home to Seattle, some 14 hours after ordering, and devoured the most amazing lemon bar, I've ever eaten.  Any bakery item that can survive a day of sitting in a car, and being smooshed on a plane and still taste the way that lemon bar did is AFUCKINGMAZING.   The line and then some was well worth the wait.  The fact that I can write this review, months after my visit and with total clarity (and a real jones for a lemon bar) has got to count for something!

Well I don't think Tartine is any hidden secret, with lines out the door this place is a go-to place for all things pastry. They have the best {HAM AND CHEESE CROISSANT} there are so many layers in this little beauty it is so amazing. They are well known for their {MORNING BUN} but I actually think they have some other more delightful things. I also love their {BANANA CREAM PIE} soooo yum!

Stop burning the crossaints already!!! I mean, I'll still eat one, they're still better than most, but would really love to have one where I don't have to shave the entire bottom off and shave some of the top. And cool it on the Dijon mustard! Especially when there's a lite mustard request, I almost want to start a petition for a lighter dijon mustard standard. Probably wasting my breath on this one, but you girls are miserable there, I've been coming for years and most bakeries have a revolving door of young kids working their way through, then onto the next. When's your next? Come on you're getting up their on years and can't be doing this forever. Can you?  Please tell me you have a plan for yourself, cause I don't wanna see a senior you behind the counter...you'd all be unbearable. I used to let your bad attitude slide cause I brushed it off as young and didn't know any better. But you're all getting up there, and you've had many years to hone your service attitude. If you think this is acceptable, I then understand you havnt jumped ship cause who else will have you, tartine on your resume is like a red flag, high risk alert. Unless you're a baker, you're up there at god level for us all!

TARTS: Banana Cream tart (4/5): There is literally more whipped cream than banana custard. However, I love the chocolate on the crust and the thick crust which is ever so difficult to slice through. This glorious item is usually sold out in the afternoon. Coconut Cream Tart (3/5): Again, I'm a big fan of the thick crusts, but the coconut itself tasted light and artificial. Lemon Cream Tart (5/5): The tart didn't look as fluffy as the other two and I put off purchasing it until my 4th visit there. I love how the thin crust wasn't flaky but was substantial enough to contrast with the creamy lemon. The lemon itself had such a zesty, powerful flavor that it reminded me of some of the lemon bars I've eaten. Tartness + dollop of whipped cream that was absolutely devoid of flavor = heaven Frangipane Tart (4/5): Crust is croissant-like, but much tastier than the croissant because it has more almond cream Chocolate Hazelnut Tart (3/5): very rich and satisfying, a little dry CAKE: lemon meringue cake (3/5): the cake itself was lemon-infused with two layers of lemon curd. It was covered with meringue that was too sticky and solidified after awhile. passion fruit lime bavarian (4/5): Light like a bavarian should be but with strong passion fruit notes. So Tropical! I couldn't really taste the lime, but the toasted coconut on top was super crunchy. tres leche cake (3/5): It was moist and very fresh, but very ordinary. It is not your traditional Mexican tres leche cake if that's what you're looking for. fresh fruit bavarian (3/5): A seasonal cake that  contained blackberries and raspberries of monstrosity! Very light with not much cake. Think English trifle. Lemon bar (2/5): very ginormous lemon bar for $4. Its crust was too dense, flavorless. The lemon gelatin on top was overwhelming/thick/sticky Bread pudding (3/5): They bake it in  large trays and the fruits used in the pudding vary Rocher (4/5): very airy, comes in cocoa nib and almond flavors For their savory items, I like their croques and quiches. CUSTOMER SERVICE (0/5): Like recent reviews mentioned, the cashiers seem like they were all selected out of Grouches 'R US. Usually service doesn't bother me that much in terms of bakeries, but I never want to deal with their attitudes so early in the morning. They are even so inattentive when taking your order that they often mess up.

I first came here for the morning buns, and they were really good. Then I discovered the éclairs.  OMG, they're out of this world.  By far the best I've ever had (although granted, I've had very limited experience with éclairs).  The cream filling is smooth and vanillaey...they're coated with Valrhona chocolate...  I LOVE THESE ECLAIRS!  If I were to die in a freak bus accident tomorrow, I'd die happy, having had an éclair from Tartine. Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit.  But the éclairs are amazing here.

I've been addicted to the Coconut Cream Tarts in here for years. The eclairs are also exceptional. It's always too hot and claustrophobic to stay in to eat, but as a take-out bakery, Tartine's amazing. The staff have always been very sweet too... Except for that dude with the beard and 'comedy' round glasses who I dealt with last week... He was unhelpful when the woman in front of me asked him a simple question (he mumbled something and immediately walked away from her, much to her frustration), then straight up ignored me for quite a few minutes despite not doing anything else in that time other than staring at the ground and slowly wiping the counter in front of him. It was weird, given how great the service usually is in here. Not cool, but not even Glasses Man's stinky attitude will keep me from my coconut tarts. Absolutely delicious. And clearly incredibly complicated to make. Good work.

I thought okay an eclair super easy... apparently not. It was burnt. I don't mean pretty dark european style it was freakin burnt. The filling was literally vanilla pudding, but they used real vanilla bean so I guess that helps justify charging $5 for the damn thing. I went in before when the line was really long and didn't even see anything that looked good I don't know- I might give it another chance but only if someone else were paying lol

Oh Croque Monsieur!   Only you can steal away the love of my husband from me.  Lucky for you, I love you also.  So warm and buttery.  So tasty and tantalizing.  We can't get enough. We were just in SF for a week and had breakfast there four times.  The croissants are to die for.  The chocolate one is the best i've tasted.   The place is tiny.  Eating there isn't too comfy for a bigger group so we just ordered to go.  The line moved fast everyday.  In four days, we tried the quiche, fruit tart, shortbread cookie, shitake Croque Monsieur, ham Croque Monsieur, croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning roll.  The only thing did like was the morning roll.  Our fav was definitely the Croque Monsieur and croissant.   Skip on the coffee.  We just went to Peets. Sure wish they had one here in Honolulu. Au revoir Croque Monsieur!  Until we meet again.

Back in the bay area for the weekend and heard good things about Tartine. As advertised there was a line out the door, which only enhances the anticipation of getting inside and seeing all that they have to offer. Once at the counter, I ordered a double pain au chocolate and the croque monsieur. The chocolate croissant was flaky, full of rich chocolate and absolutely delicious. Equally amazing was the croque monsieur (an open faced sandwich that included: ham, gruyere, sun dried tomatoes and becahmel). The sandwich even included a seemingly normal, yet spicy carrot on the side. You serve your own water, bus your own table and the place is incredibly crowded but the food makes it all worthwhile. Definitely worth a visit!

It's not a place I would go to sit. And I actually don't like that it has gotten so popular (we're talking 3000+ reviews here on Yelp) that you have to wait in line into the street and they get away with mediocre service. However, none of the above can really matter. But before I explain why, let me first introduce myself: I consider myself quite a bit of a croissant connoisseur and I've eaten croissants around Europe, including but not limited to Denmark (very strong fresh bread culture in general) and Paris (which should be the Mekka for croissants) and of course in New York where I live, both in real french and other frankophile bakeries. I generally appreciate almost all croissants. Even the mediocre croissant is ok with me. I'm not a hater! Doing a good croissant is after all an extremely difficult thing, and all effort counts in my book. Three factors make a croissant: the ingredients (primarily butter. No substitutes!!), the way they are made (kneading, folding, cutting) and how fresh they are baked. The first one is easy: it's merely a choice of using real butter. The second is difficult to learn and very time consuming, but if the other two factors are met, even a beginner will be able to do a mind blowing croissant. The third factor is usually the hardest. After they are done they have such a limited shelf life. My comprehensive and life long (although non-scientific) research shows that croissants are best within the first 30 minutes after they leave the oven. If we consider that an index 100, then between 30 minutes and two hours they drop to around 80. At four hours most croissants are well below 60. Most places here in New York get them fresh every morning but at 11am it has already been at least 4 hours since they came out of the oven. This indicates that it is virtually impossible to get above index 80 unless you bake your own croissants on the premises throughout the day. This, of course is exactly what they do at Tartine. And since the other two factors: proper ingredients and baking technique are impeccable, the croissants at Tartine are exactly the way they should be. Even if you have never tried a croissant in your life, I am absolutely sure that your body will instinctively know that this is it. This is the croissant that the men in Plato's cave saw. You'll realize that there can be no other way. Buddha, Jehova, Allah, Thor, Zeus, the Jewish and Christian God and any other Gods you might believe in will probably disagree on many things. However, the Croissants at Tartine is not one of them. They were most likely the result of the first intra-religious joint-venture. No sadness and no pain will survive a confrontation with the divine. This is the pure Form of the Good.

I shouldn't fail to note that the staff is so friendly in spite of the continuous line of people they need to deal with.

I will start out with the good and when I say good I mean it.  Out of this world bread pudding and the bread of the day is heavenly if you get it still warm out of the oven ( it had better be for almost nine dollars a loaf) I always like lots of outside seating, too bad it's such a dingy area with far too many trendier than thou hipsters.  But that is through no fault of Tartine.  I was a native of almost 50 years and finally had to bail as the Mission became too cool for me.  In my eyes if you run counter to the norm you are an individual and that is pretty cool in my book.  Masses covered in body art and skinny jeans has become a uniform.  People should try being original and I don't mean by getting some ironic tat on your lower back, but I digress.  The minuses have me looking elsewhere for an optimal cafe/ bakery experience like say, Rustic Bakery or La Boulange in the North Bay or Acme in the East Bay. First of all Tartines' prices are ridiculous, just read these reviews management, and a slight adjustment is all that it would take.  A four dollar half-assed Cap was a waste and if you are gonna charge that much make sure your barista knows what the hell she is doing.  I had one with the lamest foam I have experienced outside of Seattles Own ( to be expected at a bookstore chain and for $2.50) and the coffee that I've had has been unsatisfactory to say the least (bring your own from any of a bunch in the vicinity and get quality at half the price).  The open-faced sandwiches looked delightful, a work of art even, but for those prices you may want to frame one and hang it on your wall.  The fact is they have all the trendy, exotic, unheard-of natural organic ingredients that I applaud, minus the Niman Ranch DEAD PIG but I have had sandwiches with more taste at ultra untrendy Mays or even at Safeway (horrors!!) and I wasn't stuffed to the gills with $13 worth of bread.  Also their lemon tart needs an infusion of the essence of lemon as my mother in law insisted on getting one for a recent party and it was truly uninspiring.  Apparently citrus is not their specialty.  Regardless I have had a quite a few items on the menu having gone with groups and have come away pretty unimpressed.  The fact that it is usually too crowded and I must trek up to Dog Crap Park makes the Tartine experience that much more unappealing. So in conclusion while I cannot dismiss Tartine entirely I would suggest that you move to a nicer spot, like the Outer Richmond or out of SF for that matter, lower your prices so that people who actually scrutinize their purchases will patronize your establishment (everyone in SF isn't a young urban idiot with little more to worry about than rent and what new place of the moment to get sucked into, and skinny jeans and yoga pants of course).  Find a few counter people who dropped out of Peets University and who don't take themselves too seriously, remember you guys are selling fancified donuts so you aren't all that.  Otherwise just be happy that you aren't in the North or East Bay where there are some nice alternatives and they aren't out to gouge you for every crumb you have. PEACE. PS  Veggy Yelpies, truly mad props should be reserved for restaurants that stick true to the ideals of vegetarianism.  A dead animal is a dead animal no matter if they are "free range", "grass fed" or forced to live their whole life pumped with hormones, force fed and living in their own waste.  Just sayin, I hope you didn't choke on your five dollar croissant.

I am conflicted about reviewing Tartine because I don't want to contribute to making the lines longer, but at this point the secret is clearly out. Food snob brother, spent many years in Paris, came to visit me out here, I already loved the place but decided to test it on him. Two of us wandered over at about 3 on a Friday afternoon (best time to go), he went back EVERY morning for the duration of his stay. I'm a morning roll girl - the only thing Tartine has ever done wrong is run out of them.

The baked goods are out of this world here.  The morning buns are amazing but sell out quickly.  The croissants and sandwiches are sooooo good... and don't get me started on the banana cream pie which I have never been a fan of, but man, theirs is like a little piece of heaven.  The crust is amazing, then the next layer is a layer of hardened chocolate over top of the crust, then the bananas and cream filling, then whipped cream, then shaved chocolate.  Amazing.  I have never eaten anything here I was not impressed with.  I have been on a tour of bay area bakeries lately and this puts all of them to shame.   It is crowded and sometimes the staff can have a bit of an attitude.  But once I get my bakery fix from here I can easily overlook all of that.;)

Finally got a chance to check it out today. The croissant is good.  The crust is darker than I'm used to, like Semifreddi's, but does not taste burnt.  The crust is more chewy than La Farine's.  La Farine's croissant has a crust that is perfectly delicately crisp (when the climate is right); it is unrivaled in my experience.  The flavor is nice--not overly buttery like Semifreddi's.  It is $2.75, but it also feels heftier than La Farine's or Bittersweet's or anywhere else that I can think of.  What surprises me is that, despite its heftiness, the croissant is not dense.  There is some elasticity to it, but not as much as La Farine's, which makes La Farine's so pleasurable to break apart and eat. The eclair was impressive.  It is probably the best I've had.  It does not taste of sugar, like most places do.  I could actually taste the chocolate of the coating (Valrhona) and the subtle vanilla in the custard filling.  No overpowering flavors.  The texture of the tender choux pastry was just right--not too crusty, and not soggy.  Also, the choux pastry appears to be the one-piece kind where the custard is pumped into it at one end, not the kind that consists of top and bottom halves like a sandwich with the filling in between.  The latter is bad for any eclair considering the mess it lends itself to making.  Very good.  It did not feel heavy, but the proportion is filling.  Two can share. Also noticed that they have pastrami sandwiches.  They say that they serve it on bread that they make themselves.  I hope to give it a try soon. 8/22/2007 update I went back and tried their pastrami sandwich.  The texture of the toasted/pressed bread was too much for me.  It's too crusty and chewy and overwhelms the tender pastrami, which did have a nice flavor.  Nice pickled carrots though--has a nice spicy flavor.  The sandwich is very filling, so don't expect to be able to pack down dessert. 8/28/2007 update Ok.  I am really impressed now.  Yesterday, I had the smoked ham quiche, the devil's food cake, and the banana cream pie (small).  The quiche was very good.  Nice fluffy thick egg filling and the ham (Niemand Ranch) was not too salty.  Perfect, crispy, flaky crust (although a bit charred in spots).   The devil's food cake bore a very good chocolate flavor and did not taste sugary.  I wasn't in the mood for it, but I had to try it anyway because it's so difficult for me to get to this place (and then have to wait in a long line for 30 minutes).  I was impressed with the quality.   It could really be shared by two because it is a bit heavy. The banana cream pie was what really impressed me.  I had never liked banana anything.  I saw the impressive crust and the cream and the chocolate shavings, and I decided I had to give it a try, too.  After the quiche and the cake, I was stuffed.  I had bought all three items at once because I didn't want to wait in line for 30 minutes again if I turned out to be in the mood for it.  So, I had it five hours later.  It sat in the car for five hours, and I was still impressed by it.  It had the same kind of crust as the quiche and remained crusty and flaky because of the smart baker coating it with a layer of chocolate before placing the filling.  Right amount of caramel did nicely for the banana.  And the chocolate shavings on the top was delicate enough to break gracefully and not make a mess when I dug in with the spoon. The 30-minute wait was not a joke.  I waited in line 30 minutes to place my order and no table was available.  I was glad I ordered all three items at once.  When I finished my quiche and cake (and sampled a few nibbles of the pie), the line was just as long. 8/29/2007 update The Croque Monsieur is a thick slice of their country bread (thick crust) topped with Bechamel and cheese plus an additional item (tomatoes was the item on this day).  It was good, but I can't say it's worth $8.25. The coconut cream pie was very good.  Damn good crust again (see above review re the banana version).  Could be even better with less caramel.

OK, maybe I need to scroll through the reviews more thoroughly, but I am utterly floored that there's no mention on the first page of Tartine's chocolate souffle cake. Sure, the croque monsieur is wonderful, but the chocolate souffle cake is beyond words. It is simply the most intense and satisfying chocolate experience I have ever known. It is something you eat with your soul, not just your mouth. You don't simply taste it -- you become it and it becomes you, like some sort of Zen ritual. The downside? They don't sell it by the slice. On the bright side, the six inch cake can serve about 10 people because of the concentrated nature of the chocolaty goodness. Take it to a party and I guarantee you'll be invited back.

The best bread pudding. The best croissants. The best chocolate cake. The best frangipane tart. The best country bread (either the regular kind or the one with walnuts) and a damn good cafe au lait in a real bowl like at home. Basically, the best boulangerie for breakfast or afternoon sweets... And, yeah, I'm French: I've done them all! Note: It's a 5-star rating for the food only because I live nearby and always take it to go but they indeed have a problem managing their growth. If I had to eat there every time, I think the crowd would spoil a bit the experience. But if you can get one of the two tables outside... Aaah, merci Tartine!

This place has the best croissant in the City.  Period. But be warned.  They have major production issues.  To whit:  Friday morning, 8:30am.  Out of plain croissants, out of chocolate croissants, out of ham and cheese croissants, 1 scone left and two morning buns left.  25 minutes until the next batch of croissants are out.  You could very well stand in line for 20 minutes and not get any of their great pastries.  Since they are a bakery, you would think 8:30 am on Friday morning would be a peak period right?  Maybe they should plan better?   This happens WAY too often. And makes me very sad.

One of the most mystifying social phenomenon in San Francisco.  Somehow this bakery has managed to convince/fool throngs of followers that it is good.  Do they pump mind control drugs into the street outside that forces people to wait in the long lines?   I have tried the bakery on four different occasions and every experience has been substandard.  They literally served burned meringue and charged a premium "we're a trendy foodie destination" price.  I have completely given up on them.   I couldn't categorize anything I've eaten from Tartine as much better than average and on two occasions below average.  Organic ingredients and hipster crowds eating charred paninis doesn't equal good food. a HUGE disappointment, that just keeps disappointing no matter how many times I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Never again.

Two years ago, I was visiting a friend in S.F. when we decide that a French bakery would be ideal for breakfast.  We did a random search and Tartine came up on the list.  When faced with the prospect of Scharffen Berger filled double pain au chocolat, we were sold.  The line was out the door but we somehow managed to procure a table and have the most wonderful flaky breakfast treats. Last week, I came to visit the city again and Tartine was a must hit!  We made the mistake of going late on a Sunday and I watched with dismay as the last pain au chocolat was taken by the person in front of me in line.  That is when I spotted the fluffy gougeres in a plump stack.  I now have a new craving which I will definitely satisfy on my next trip to San Francisco.  Tartine's gougeres were so savory and light that my breakfast didn't last long!   Delicious once again, Tartine!

My criteria for a five star rating? Planning the next trip while still at the restaurant/bar/store/club/whatever. Tartine warrants a five star review. I have tried several things from Tartine (mainly because my friends are delightful and love to share): bread pudding, pumpkin bread, the morning bun, quiche, croque monsieur, and the almond croissant. In general I love bread pudding, but wasn't totally enthused about the banana pudding- too much chocolate and carmel and overall sweetness for me. However, the other fruit-based bread pudding that was brought out after the banana looked fabulous. The quiche was phenomenal; the lightest and creamiest ever. I took a bite and was actually shocked by the flavor and texture. Mmmm. The other highlight was the almond croissant. It was airy, almondy, and moist. One of the best I have ever had. Five stars Tartine. I am already planning my next trip....

I showed up on a Thursday morning, which (apparently) is the "bring every child you know to Tartine Bakery Day". Annoying, to say the least, and it put the servers in a bad mood, too...because not one of them was pleasant to anyone else in line. On the upside, the croissant was buttery and delicious, and the latte was creamy and smooth. Check it out if you have time and there aren't 72 kids running around screaming and crying.

On a limited time line....  Destination, airport. No time for a nice breakfast so logic would dictate that a bakery would be quicker. Searching for a spot my eyes dart across my windshield to activity in front of the bakery.  Was there an accident and people were indulging their curiosity and sadistic nature?  I am not so fortunate.  If that was the case I would be at the front of the line waiting for the doors to opened.  After a 20 minute wait to enjoy the quiche, bread pudding and hot chocolate I had 15 minutes to get to the airport . If the flight was missed it was well worth it.

I started going two wks after they opened and since then I have converted many many people to this mecca.....NYT named it best bakery in the USA in 2007.  PLUS, last summer I brought a Spanish friend that lives in Paris and she was impressed with the croissants. PLUS PLUS when SoCal lack of good food places parents come into town, we hit it big time....So it's not just me making it up that this place is the BOMB. Everything is really really good and fresh, but I have my favs. I always get the ham and cheese croissant......with once in a while the bread pudding or/and morning buns or quiches. YES, the line is intimidating but doable if you go with an open mind and a little hungry cauz when you get to the front to order you WILL be hungry. LOVE it!!!!!

This bakery is fantastic.  Highlights include the bread, the pressed sandwiches, the pastries, the tarts, the bread pudding...etc. My only complaint would be the service which ranges from apathetically polite at best (and at average), to downright surly (and occasional) at worst.   Customer service is truly not a priority here, and it always shows. But hey, you don't come here for the customer service, so until there is an alternative it is best to suck it up and deal.

The cakes and cookies are fab - I like the hazelnut meringues and biscotti especially, but I went there for a lunchtime sandwich, which was not good. 1. The bread was cut too thickly 2. the whole thing was drenched in oil, making it uneccesarily heavy and greasy. I was able to eat less than 1/3 of the sandwich and I felt quite queasy. 3. It was very expensive - $13 for a sandwich! My advice - stick to the sweet things and give the sandwiches a miss!

This bakery was hyped up as much as possible....read numerous reviews in 7x7 and even a snippet in GQ magazine...all raving about the morning buns. Finally decided to wake up early on a sunday morning, in the rain, and headed down to the mission for this exquisite, amalgamation of flavors concentrated in doughy goodness. This morning bun is truly one of San Francisco's great items to eat. Period. Also tried the croque monsieur with smoked Niman ranch ham, and I also highly recommend this as well. To describe the country bread they use, it's crunchy on the outside and soft/mildly chewy on the inside with a sourness that is not overpowering. Excellent bread to go along with the combination of the ham as well as the gruyere and tomatoes. Also purchased but not yet consumed include: chocolate croissant, eclairs, banana cream tart and lemon cream tart (desserts to share at a later meal).

I used to come here a lot with my sisters. If any one of us came back to San Francisco from college, vacation, etc., we usually made a trip out to Tartine to catch up on the news and gossip. Love the: Meringue Cookies Bread Pudding (get a small, plenty for two people cos it;s so rich and creamy) Banana Creme Tartlet Passion Fruit Cake Over the years though, it's gotten less and less exciting to go there because of the huge lines and the lack of a sitting space. I still recommend it, but the thrill is no longer there.

It's a good thing I don't live too close to this place .... it's a formidable opponent to my (already fragile) self-control! Any bakery that uses Valrhona chocolate in its Pain au Chocolat obviously takes its craft seriously .... an absolute winner in my books. Lose yourself in the warm, freshly baked morning buns, frangipane croissants and ham/cheese croissants .... gorgeously crisp on the outside, soft and buttery on the inside ..... Hold on, I need to wipe the pool of saliva off my keyboard.... It really is worth the wait to sample the pastries here, you can almost taste the love that went into making them!

I love their Lemon Cream Tart and Banana Cream Tart.  The lemon cream tart is just a perfect blend of sourness and sweetness.  I'm generally a big fan of lemony stuff and this is the best lemon tart I've ever had.  The lightly whipped cream on top of the lemon cream helped to dilute the sourness.  Just perfect. As for the banana cream tart, it's huge that i like it because I usually don't care for bananas.  i hate the fruit and i steer clear from any banana drinks.  But their banana cream tart is different and I love it: the banana cream isn't overpowering; there is a thin layer of chocolate that lines the inside of the tart (in between the tart and the banana cream) which makes a huge difference.  I'd definitely get it again. I didn't like their Frangipane Tart though.  I don't know what to make of it.  I didn't like the almond slices in it nor the pastry.

Tartine is so good, I don't even know if it is worthy of review!  The only downside to this incredible bakery is that now, no other baked good compares (well maybe Arizmendi, but they're different). Clearly, I love Tartine - I'm a dessert, cake, baked-goods addict and it fulfills all of my needs!  When friends and family come to visit, a trip to Tartine is top priority.  In fact, the only thing my dad wants to do in San Francisco when he's visiting from Wisconsin is eat morning buns at Tartine - go figure. I could go on, and on and on... but that would be boring so here's a list of my favorite things: Bread pudding - heaven (and potential heart attack - be careful!) - I recommend getting it when topped with bananas and chocolate (not a very frequent combo) Lemon tarte - the best lemon "thing" I've ever had - the lemon filling is to die for.  My friend and I joke that it tastes incredibly light and airy so it must be good for us! Banana cream pie - mmmmm! Quiche - their quiche is probably the best quiche I've had.  It's very creamy-tasting, but also feels pretty light.  I love the earthy flavors of the veggie quiche - I think they use thyme and sage. And for those who prefer something a little more healthy - the muesli - I occasionally get the muesli to counteract whatever other sweet I'm eating.  The yogurt is plain and soupy - just like I like it - very European.  I love the coconut flakes and the apple that give it just a little sweetness.  I recommend pouring lots of honey on top! Enjoy - nothing you order will be bad!

I don't know how they did it, but the greatest asset this place has going for it is the incredible-never-ending-line outside. This is probably because of its high traffic location, and the incredibly small interior.  The line is a self-perpetuating beast.  There is a reason night clubs don't let you in even though they're empty... just to make it seem oh so cool. I caved to the peer pressure voice in my head.   It's hard to give this place an objective score.  The baking is pretty good.  Lots of butter and eggs make anything pretty good.  Is it all it's cracked up to be? The jury is still out on that.   I'm sure the city has many excellent bakeries that deserve our business but don't have the hype.  That said, Tartine is a good place to impress out of town visitors ;-)

Stopped in here while visiting my BFF who insisted we must have dessert at this James Beard Award winning bakery.   I really wanted the soft gingerbread since I'm obsessed with all things of the ginger variety but instead, we ordered the chocolate hazelnut tarte and the banana cream tarte to share. the hazelnut tart was delicate with the perfect juxtaposition between salty and sweet. the real star imo was the banana cream tarte. sweet, creamy, light... you must try it when you're in the city or you simply have not lived.  so decadent...  i'm drooling just thinking about it!!! nsfd - not safe for dieters.  LOL.

We've had many things at Tartine and a few of our favorites are - meringue cake, morning buns, bread pudding, rochers,  sandwiches, frangipane croissants, and banana pie.  Everything is very rich with loads of butter,and the portion sizes are generous for most items.  We even made a special trip to get the fresh baked bread that comes out of the oven late in the afternoon, and that too was fantastic  - crusty crunchy on the outside and the inside has lots of air bubbles characteristic of nicely made artisan bread. I'd give them a five star for the food, however, they run out of many items at around noon, including those yummy morning buns and frangipane croissants, on the weekends. Since people make a special trek to the shop driving for over an hour to get there (like us), and the demand is so great, why can't they make enough of the best selling goodies!!

I drove around for an hour to find this place because of the rave reviews.  I left after ordering 1 of each: morning bun, frangipane croissant, eclair, and cappuccino. In a word, uninspired.  The morning bun and eclair were quite good.  The eclair especially so.  The croissant was huge and looked beautiful, but was all flake and no softness, no chew to it at all.  It literally fell apart at the touch through and through.  The cappuccino was bitter and why when there are 6 customers waiting for their coffee is there only one barista who is apparently taking her hollygolightly time?  i get that it's quaint and all, but honestly, the shop is tiny, there isn't a lot of room for customers to be piling up while the single barista is lackadaisically preening.   Not to mention that I spent $17 for three pastries and a coffee.  For my money, the croissants are cheaper and much better at Boulange.  And I need to find a place that will make a pecan sticky bun worthy of crying over.  The Tartine morning bun is good, but it's got this distracting orange flavor to it and no pecans. And the boulange sticky bun is terrible.  If you're in LA and want a fantastic sticky bun, go to Europane in Pasadena.  Their's make me cry with serious happiness.

What's your mood, Tartine makes a yummy pastry for it.  It's hard to find good savory pastries, but the olive cake and the croque misseur made with Humbolt Fog cheese are great to have along with your eclair or Caramel coated chocolate tart.  The pastries are subtle and delicate with great texture (i.e.flaky to the person who just complained about crumbles).   I love everything about this place, except of course, the line out the door; it looks terrible, but I always make it through in pretty good time (i.e. it keeps moving).  I wouldn't go there for the coffee, but it's Mr. Espresso, pretty good.

The Frangipane (Almond) Croissant is the best ever!  It's crispy on the outside, buttery and almondy on the inside and so soft.  It's so much better than the one at Bouchon Bakery.  And order Frangipane anything, because the tart is just as good. The Banana Brioche Bread Pudding with strawberries is good too, although not as life-changing as the croissant. Croque Monsieur with Turkey, Gruyere and Seasonal Vegetable (we had asparagus) was nice, but we only ordered it because they were out of the ham (which was the most popular and probably most delicious.)  I loved the crusty bread and well, everything because who would've ever thought of putting asparagus on a sandwich! Cappucinos and lattes are nice and huge.  Don't skip that. Yes, the line is long, but there's a good reason.  Don't be like the people I always see that can't wait and leave and miss out on the best bakery ever!  The line moves pretty quick.

Forget the Morning Bun that everyone raves about... yeah it's good, but it's not "roll your eyes into the back of your head and act like Meg Ryan from 'When Harry Met Sally' good." No, for that, you need to order the pain au jambon- Niman ranch ham with Gruyere cheese in a croissant.  That is the kind of food that wars get fought over.

My Format: Price, Atmosphere, Selection (of products), Customer service, and Final thoughts. Price (5 Stars) Most of the treats in here are a little on the pricey side for what you would pay normally for them in a common bakery. But this is no common bakery and the treats are anything but. The price reflects the ingredients and craftsmanship put into them. $3-4 for something super sugary and highly fattening. Millions pay the same amount for Starbucks stuff, so why not these...? I never spend more tan $12 or so anytime I visit so it won't break your bank. Atmosphere (5 Stars) Always lively, inside and outside seating, a stone's throw away from Dolores Park. Staff is friendly and informative. Selection (5 Stars) Everything a bakery can make is made here. Pastries, cakes, cookies, fresh bread (made fresh at 5pm i hear, expect a long line) along with other stuff like coffee and dutch chocolate pudding. Customer Service (5 Stars) Friendly staff, always more than 2 people working cause of the busy nature of the place. Final Thoughts... This place keeps me coming back to S.F. time and time again. I stop here prob 75% of the time I go to S.F. The eclairs are divine and my favorite. Truly a landmark eatery that you should visit at least once. The only complaint I might have is the lines, but its just that good.

This is the best bread you will find in the city. Only served from 5 PM until they are all out, it is best to call them ahead of time to get an advanced order and just pick it up right at 5. Some of their bread (and only $7 for a loaf), some cheese and wine from the bi-rite market next door, and you have San Francisco on a platter. I have only had the coconut cream tart and it was fantastic. I will be looking forward to getting the banana cream tart with shaved chocolate on the top. TIP: be sure you have time to wait in line on the weekends. The line can be up to 30 minutes Also the prosciutto and provolone pressed sandwich with their bread is the best sandwich you'll find in the city. A must place to eat with friends/visiting relatives!!!

After all the great reviews I had to try it.  I had consumed a giant burrito for lunch (I couldn't help myself) so when  I got to Tartine I wasn't starving nor did I have a huge sweet tooth.  So instead of the famous tarts I decided to get a sampling o some of their smaller desserts. I got the shortbread, biscotti, a lovely white puff looking item, a small chocolate cake type item and a cafe au lait.  All were great and the perfect treat for a Sunday afternoon.  I can't wait to go back and sample more of the scrumptious desserts.

Tartine is one of the best bakeries I've been to around the country (mainly the cities of SF, LA, Boston, NY, Portland). I've tried a lot, and this is one of the few that I both remember, and make a point to return to whenever I am in San Francisco. I've never shown up for lunch, just breakfast. And I usually get the Morning Bun and Bread Pudding. You can purchase their cookbook, and make the bread pudding at home (very easy). The morning bun isn't in there though, so you have come in to get it.

Hey, I know that SF is expensive and I'm prepared to pay for food/services/experiences of note, but this was a sandwich and it certainly wasn't worth $13.

So, I haven't gone to this bakery, but my cousin brought their Banana Cream Tart for our dessert tonight and that alone is worth giving this place five stars! The crust was so flaky and it was lined with dark chocolate. The filling was not too sweet and soggy. It has to be THE BEST Banana Cream Pie I've EVER had! I will definitely go to their bakery/cafe location some time soon to try their breads, sandwiches, and to get another one of these Banana Cream Tarts!

Customer service makes it or breaks it. I gave this place 4 stars because of the food, not the service. The service would have been 2 stars. I saw the morning bun on the 7x7 100 things to eat in SF, and really wanted to try it. So my coworker and I traveled and adventured there one day. Upon arrival, the lines were ridiculously long. It was insane that so many people waited in a line for pastries, but it was well worth it. The guy was somewhat friendly, recommended an almond croissant or tart because they ran out of morning buns. But it was delicious nonetheless. The girl who rang me up was so rude. I mean I never bought bread from here, so I just wanted to know what was the most popular type of loaves!?!? Was it that hard to tell me the different kinds so I could make my decision? I mean she could've just rolled her eyes (that was fine) but she didn't have to look at me like I was stupid too. Geez. Anyways, my friend and I had also ordered a loaf of bread each, and the girl said we could come back to pick it up at 5PM. Since we were hungry, we had gotten lunch at Pizzeria Delfina to go. We returned back to Tartine to pick up the loaves, but since they were NOT ready, we had to wait. Along with the box of pizza in my hand, I had also purchased an almond tart from them as well, so two boxes, and you know.... the pizza box is not small nor was it cold. So I did not mind waiting, but I figure kill two birds with one stone, eat the pizza and get rid of the box.  It's not like I was only eating the pizza, but I was also eating the tart while waiting for my bread. (Sounds fatty, I know.) I thought it was kind of rude because the employees not only gawked like they never saw a pizza but showed how annoyed they were that we had brought outside food when we were waiting for our bread as well. By 5:10-15, I went to ask the girl if my bread was ready, the girl said, "Oh let me go check" and then went to go look for the bread. This was the same girl who told me to be back by 5PM to pick it up, and darted her eyes at me while I was eating my pizza. They couldn't find it at first, and then a guy found it after they searched more extensively by 5:30. Overall, the bread was good, fresh and warm right out of the oven. The customer service needs work, never work in the food hospitality field if you cannot offer customer service.   That's all, happy eating! :)

MMm...and that's basically what you'll be saying while eating here. Went here for lunch: Quiche and Banana Cream Tart (and a Lemon Tart to take home) All delicious and melt-in- your mouth. I'm taking away a star because seating is HORRIBLE and also the waitresses seem very (-_-) not happy? I can't tell. They don't have expressions. Perhaps just this day....but it would've been nicer if they smiled.

Things you must do before you die: 1) Eat at Tartine 2) Buy the Tartine cookbook 3) Create every Tartine concoction 4) Eat Tartine everyday *drooooool Ok - for real. This bakery is one of the few that are doing things right. Their breads are simply delicious...and the coffee is quite nice as well. Things to try: Morning Buns Bread Pudding Quiche (just do it) Etc, etc, etc...

There's a reason why I bring visiting friends from the East Coast to this place: because it's freakin' amazing. They lament that there's no equivalent in their neighbourhoods. That's because San Francisco's pretty great. While it is a little difficult (and painful) to go into Tartine with my moderately high gluten intolerance, I just step up the classiness a bit by eating their Valhrona chocolate pudding...for breakfast. It's better than (insert some nasty action here). And it definitely doesn't hurt that they serve Four Barrel coffee alongside their offerings. I can only stomach a little bit of gluten, so I sneak a bit of Morning Bun when I can. Yum.

Really tasty pastries, especially the chocolate croissants and lemon tarts, but I think their sandwiches are the real star here. they're unique and just delicious. try the Spicy turkey with the broccoli pesto.... amazing! There is always a pretty long line, the cooked food takes a bit of time before its brought out to you and there's not a lot of seating. That being said, the wait is totally worth it. yum yum. It's gonna be a regular stop for me on my trips to San Francisco.

Wow! Now I see what all the fuss is about. This place always has a long line stretching out the door, and it's worth every minute of waiting. The cakes are quite amazing. It is absolute torture when you reach the part of the line where they're on display behind the glass of the counter. These are *really* tasty cakes with great presentation. The sandwiches are just ok, which is a shame, but I won't let that hurt the review. Both of ours had way too much cheese on them, and the portion size was too large to also have a cake, and being a heated sandwich wasn't appropriate to box up and eat later. I think I may have had the best mocha I've ever had in the US. I could see her making it: milk poured in carefully and slowly, mixing. She asked if I wanted whipped cream on top. "Why not?" I say, expecting to see her grab a can. No, instead she puts two spoonfuls of thick, proper whipped cream on top. It looked like a work of art and tasted incredible. If you're ever in the neighborhood, don't get put off by the line. There's a reason people are willing to wait that long.

Favorites include Double Pan au Chocolat, Buttermilk Scones, Iced Chai Latte, and Soy Lattes. I also own a copy of their bread cookbook, which is incredible. One day soon I hope to make it at 5 PM to grab a fresh loaf of the Country and Country Walnut bread that's fresh out of the oven.

My five stars is really for their pastries.  They are unbelievably great!!  I have tried their grill cheese sandwich, but was disappointed.  However, I am not a fan of these kind of sandwiches, so my opinion might be bias.  So enough of my disclaimer, let's talk about this place. Food: Banana Cream Tart is my favorite.  The crust is amazing crispy.  The chocolate flakes/shavings on top gives it a nice mix on the taste.  The filling has real banana (I think ^_^) and not too sweet cream.  I had the banana cream pie in Mission Pie, but I have to rate this entree better.  Morning Bun is another good pastry.  It has a light sweet that I can probably eat without liquid to water down the sugar.  It also was surprisingly crunchy or crispy like eating toast.  Most buns that I have tried are a little soggy or soft in the middle, but it wasn't the case for Tartine's Morning Bun.  (Maybe, I bought the right bun.)  Coffee/Esppresso is ok.  I had better coffee in Blue Bottle.  However, presentation is impressive, such that latte is served in a bowl.   Ambiance: Honestly, the atomsphere is not great, and I couldn't find a restroom.  However, it is categorized as a bakery, not a restaurant.  If you go to most bakery, they mostly share the similar feel.  The lines can be brute that goes outside of the bakery.  I recommend order more than one item.  You should order stuff to-go.  Probably for dessert tonight.  It would make the wait worth it.  However, I have been in worst lines such as Brenda's. Overall, given the fact this is bakery, it is one of the best bakery that I have tried in SF.  You should always expect a wait (including the rain).  The taste is worth the wait, but also order to-go.  Get a tart to-go and eat a fresh bun in the morning.  Happy eating...

OME if you with any one Handicapped  or over 75 yr STAY A WAY .  We went  on Oct 1st at 2:30 after a great outing to Bi Rite where we where treated like great Wow what a difference a 1/2 a block means.  to Tartine baker ok cafe No not with out closing the place and retraining the staff. Some should be let go. One we got there on a hot San Francisco afternoon that is rear in SF.  As we where walking in we saw a seat  right I front of the Door great. As we where trying to here down 3 of Tarine employes went between the 88 yr old Handicapped women and my self. They  where running food  out. So it is more impotent to run cold food out then the well being of there long time customers ( maybe there replacing the old customers with younger ones) I do not know bit that not  right at all. Then I went and ordered the line was long, there where maybe 9 employes on the cash register and more milling a bout. I ordered the food and was told it would be 20 or 30 for my food. But 20 or 30 for a grilled cheese come on.  The owner should train there staff. I could get my food faster if I went in the back and made it my self. I say that because I see there staff milling a bout looking for something to do.   After about 25 minutes we got a very over price slab of bread with a maybe 3 .oz of host cheese, and not hot i guess the unpeeled baby carrot and the slices do browning apple was a garnish . That is not what we where shown at the CIA wen I went to cooking school.  I wish it stopped there but it did not. My 88 yr old Handicapped friend had to use the handicapped accuse able restroom. With is really a storage closet, after getting a round the Dinning room where there no room. Where there is just not room for her walker and no Staff member could help. We enter the bathroom on the left side there are stacked kid high chairs that I had to move my self then the mope and brooms that I had to more. To no so prize to not toilet set coves ye would I think that would be imported to the Owners.  So we dealt with it. But the best part was wen we where coming out of the so called restroom/ broom closet. I asked the Man cashier for a glass of water for my friend we pointed to a pitcher of water. Then went back to his cell phone. At that time it was more impotent for him to be on his cell phone texting then helping a long time customer.  I LIKE TO WORK AT tartine BAKER AND CAFE I WOULD BE PAID TO BE ON MY CELLPHONE F THE CUSTOMERS. NO THANK YOU  I LIKE THE CIA way the costumer is in portent that buy food the staff then make money. With out the customer there is no   Tartine .

Had dinner in the area so decided to stop by and grab some desserts for home.  I really wanted to get the banana cream tart but they were out!  Settled on a lemon bar and lemon tart.  Both were excellent!  The Lemon Bar was nice and tart which I love!  The Lemon Tart was a little lighter with a dollop of whipped cream on top.  And the tart shell was nice and firm.  A nice contrast to the creaminess of the lemon filling.  Can't wait to go back to try the banana cream tart!

Was down at Bi-Rite Creamery and walked by... Nate C.'s girlfriend needed a Tartine fix so we both walked in.  I could smell the deliciousness from down the street so definitely bought a couple of the small $1.50 pastries. I don't remember all 4 of the pastries I got.  There where only two that were really tasty, the coconut macaroon and the oatmeal cookie.  But they were delicious enough to give 4 stars for.  I think there was a little bit of ginger in the cookie which definitely added some depth.  I also love coconut so I'm a little biased on the macaroon. I think I need to go back and try some more things but for now, 4 stars for the two pastries that were delicious and cheap enough for me to try without breaking the bank, although for $1.50, I wish all 4 had been memorable.

During my short stay in SF I ended up going here twice, yea I'm pretty surprised too.  Waiting in line is almost a treat, makes you reconsider every food choice you thought you decided on.   The part I don't like is glaring at people trying to establish who's place you are going to take.  The first time I was able to easily squeeze into seat right after getting my food but the second time I actually had to ask someone if I could have their table after there were done.  Translation: "Come on seriously, get the hell out, you have been finished for some time".  The dude gave me the "you're an ass look" while the chick agreed it was time to go. The grilled sandwiches are surprisingly large.  The coffee is self service as is busing your own table.  Nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd... the bread pudding, this helps a lot... simply delicious.

Had some time to kill before some dinner reservations in the city, so hubby and I decided to stop by and try Tartine. It was 4:30 p.m. on a Saturday, and I wasn't prepared for such a long line out the door! I thought, 'wow, this must be good!' I waited about 30 minutes. I wanted to get a couple of pain au chocolats, but they were sold out. Also wanted to get the banana cream tart for my husband, because he loves banana pies, but they were sold out. Settled for a small coconut cream tartlet, 2 Friands, and a croissant. The croissant was huge, and would have been really good (it was buttery, flaky, and crispy) but some inattentive baker allowed it to burn and there were 2 scorched spots on the bottom that made it bitter and ruined it. The Friands, which are labeled as "chocolate bites covered in ganache" were like a little mini flourless chocolate cake and were dry. Hubby said that coconut cream tartlet was "okay", so wasn't impressed overall. I still like La Farine way better and don't think this place is worth the wait. The croissant would have been good if it wasn't burned, so giving the extra star because I think that was a fluke.

I drive by this bakery all the time and finally got a chance to try it.  I came on a Friday night and there wasn't much of a selection left.  I never thought I'd spend $15 on 2 pastries and cookies, but I would have to say it was pretty damn good.  With the exception of th cookies which were okay.  They had cherries in them and although I like cheeries, I'd prefer them not in my cookie.

Tartine rocks for the pastries. This is THE place to get birthday cakes.The coconut-passion cake raises my rating to 3 stars. I wish I could do more. For the rest: bof! I am sorry but the croissants are te-rri-ble: super heavy and the butter as a weird after taste. I tried a couple of times, never managed to finish one. Coming from France I know what they are supposed to taste like. This is not okay. The Tartines are way too salty. I tried and tried because I was a neighbor and my friends kept on dragging me there. 3 stars is all I can do. Too bad. I really don't understand the line around the corner at lunch time.

A friend of mine recommended this place. The place wasn't hard to find despite the lack of signage. It was a loud morning because of the drilling of the construction workers just outside Tartine that day. I said "NO" to myself right away until I had a bite of their morning bun. It was heaven! I brought a lot of the morning bun to the east coast and didn't share a piece with anyone! That's how greedy it'll make you when you try it. My husband and son had the ham quiche and I would say I would stick to the morning bun. This is definitely going to be one of my to go place when I visit SF again.

When I first heard of Tartine from people in the 'hood, I thought there was no way this place would be that good. The line to get in, the attitude from other customers, the religous following it had from the foodies, it all turned me away for almost a year. Then one day, early, in the middle of the week when there was no line, I tried it. It was great! The food really was that good. I was absolutely shocked. There was a genuine reason all these people where willing to endure the "tartine gauntlet", to snack on some truly amazing food.  Love the food, but avoid it on the weekends when things are just too crazy. Addendum: How could I forget to mention the Tartine pick-up only location that is going in just down the street? For those of us who would rather grab some treats and head somewhere less cramped, help is coming soon.

This bakery is so good I moved to the neighborhood to be near it. I'm not kidding. Although my thighs are wishing we'd chosen a different neighborhood, my taste buds couldn't be happier. It's true the lines are long and a fair amount of jockeying for position, hovering, and patience is recquired to get a table.

It's yummy.  Full stop. It is worth the wait. Everything is good.  Even just the smell walking by. It is not a "restaurant."  It is a bakery with some tables.  Seating sucks, especially on the weekends.  If you're determined to eat in, be ready to bus somebody else's dishes.  There is no waitstaff here.  Just counter folks. That said, let me repeat.  Everything is good.  All of their goods are as full of butter as they can possibly be.  LOVE IT.

Yeah, yeah.  Everyone loves Tartine.  Or finds it woefully overhyped.  Or thinks the molasses-slow service, sidewalk-spanning lines, or (sometimes) snooty employees cancel out the sheer deliciousness of the product served.  I say, so the fuck what?  Don't go if you're in a hurry. I love their pumpkin tea cake, mini thyme-gruyere gougeres, and meusli with yogurt.  But the fact that they're the only place in SF (as far as I know-and please, please, correct me if I'm wrong) that serves a sandwich with BROCCOLI RABE, sopressata, and fontina on it earns 'em five stars in my book.  Which, incidentally, is a cloth-covered pea green notebook flecked with food stains from errant cauliflower florets and leaves of kale. On a recent visit, two of  my friends ordered the above sandwich while I opted for prosciutto, provolone, and arugula.  Somehow, only two sandwiches came to our table (we were all on separate tickets) and I was left waiting for 20 minutes.  Upon investigation, a member of the waitstaff emerged shortly to apologize and explain that my order had been lost in the shuffle.  Already downing a piece of sando from my dining companion's plate, I said it wasn't a big deal.  When my food finally arrived, brought by another gracefully apologetic server, they gave me a full refund and offered me a free cookie.   See?  Tartine is awesome.

I adore this spot. As a young woman, it lures me by being an adult candy store with much refinement.   Beautiful decadent deserts that scream with delight, wonderful open faced sandwiches that can create a collision with all of your senses ( my favorite is the shitake mushroom with fromage blanc), lovely iced teas (hibiscus), gougeres, bread pudding, all those cakes, and cookies and sweets.  Beautiful artisan goods and  ingredients, I just can't say enough.  18th and Guerrero corner is definately my spot of indulgence. Again this spot is another reason to why I love San Francisco.   By the way, the ham and cheese croissant with gruyere and black forest ham?  Oh and please don't forget the chocolate croissant with the wonderful sticks of artisan chocolates inside.

Well, tell you the customer experience - I went in, there was a small band playing chill out music, so it's a very cool welcome in the Friday afternoon - I told a hot chocolate, lemon tart and banana tart, all awesome, especially the tarts, it lightened me up when I was dry out after a day's walk BTW, the environment is cozy and people there are cultural too.  Have wine to drink as well So I will definitively go 2nd time ...

Luscious quiche, flaky pastries, delicious coffee and a long lineup of customers to match: Tartine is worth visiting, but come early and come hungry. The breakfast pastries are a hearty size, and baked freshly every morning. Be prepared to squish into a table between other noshing customers, but it's OK. Once you start eating, you'll forget everyone else is there. For breakfast pastries and coffee, or something more hearty (like a Croque Monsieur or sandwich), it's difficult to do much better. All their goods are baked fresh daily, and ingredients, including flour and eggs, are organic and local whenever possible. We arrived on Sunday morning at 9:00 a.m. for a 9:00 a.m. open. There were already about 50 people in line ahead of us. We ended up eating at around 9:30 after a rather chilly wait on the sidewalk of Guerrero St.  If you want to be first in, come at least 20 minutes earlier than opening. Outside seating is also available.

Fanbulous! This is my favorite place to bring family and friends when they come to visit me in San Francisco. Pretty much everything I've had is just heavenly, but morning bun and bread pudding are my fave. Parking can be difficult but that's the City for you.  And the long line can certainly test one's patience, but definitely worth the wait.  Small price to pay for the slice of heaven....

Probably get some hipster hate mail, but was not terribly impressed by the bakery.  I will go back, though, cause I hear that their bread is pretty solid.   Had some mexican wedding cookies.  Good, but my mom does make them better. Had an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie.  The chocolate in the cookie was amazing, but the rest of the cookie was eh. (raisins go better with oatmeal cookies than chocolate) Had some shortbread that was absolutely superb. I'll have to buy some skinny jeans for the next time I go so I can get friendlier service. My rating could definitely go up after trying some other items.  Probably being a little hard with my rating because of my expectations.

this is the third time i went to Tartines. I went with some friends for a light dinner and small dessert.  As usual, i was impressed by their amazing food. My friends ordered the sandwiches, which were hot and delicious. I was fortunate to have a sample of them. They told me thumbs up on the food. I had dessert before dinner. I order two meringue cookies that was light nougat and almond which was light to the mouth and very sweet with a strong taste of almonds. I also ordered a friad (spell check?) that i must admit was not as impressive as the meringue cookies. But it was still very good. For the dinner part i had a open faced sandwich with spicy turkey. The only downside to this was they overcooked it, but they admitted to this and apologized by giving me their pudding for free. Both were still good, especially the pudding. I think it was because it was free. That is one of the main things i like about Tartines. It is a very down to earth place and they always have given me special discounts. I love that place not only for its excellent food but also it's homey service. It really makes for a great meal and I always try to turn people on to the amazing place that is Tartines.

So finally I tried Tartine last week. It was good, indeed. BUT! The portions are too big to be authentic. Many yelpers say the pastries are like in Paris... hmm, I would say twice as big. Why is that matter? Well, when you have a croissant twice the right size you cannot have that particular fluffiness. The dough is great but it's too dense. A perfect croissant should be feather light and flakey. Despite what I just said, I still think they have one of the best croissant in SF. I also tried the famous bread pudding, which was tasty and contained lots of fresh fruit. But where is the brioche in it? It was almost only the pudding. For my taste it was not well balanced. The bread completely disappeared in the custard. I loved the fact that it was light but I missed the crispy golden top... Maybe it's just me. However, the chocolate hazelnut tart was excellent! Moist, pure dark chocolate in a thin crust! It was a real heaven! My husband who is French had a croque monsieur, which he enjoyed but found it too big and heavy because of the bechamel-like thing under the ham. He said he's never seen that in France. Which is OK, this croque is Tartine's own interpretation. So again, it was good but half the size would have been more enjoyable. I enjoyed a cup of cappuccino which was excellent: strong espresso with a amount of foamy milk. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the freshly baked country bread that we took home. It was right out of the oven, steaming hot! I would say - without exaggeration - it was one of the best bread in my life! At home I cut a slice and when took a bite... It's hard to explain... It was sooo delicious! The crust was so thick and crunchy and the interior was so yummy fluffy with lots of holes... No doubt, Tartine's bread is excellent! The verdict: This place has many drawbacks including the long waiting line, the lack of seating possibility, and in my opinion the too big portions (I prefer to taste several small things rather than being full with one), but despite these, I would definitively go back because almost everything they have looks and the ones I tried tastes really good! On the West Coast, probably the best bakery!

Tartine is great but they seriously do not know when and where to stop! they overload everything, so you feel as if your sandwich is just saturated fat over saturated fat over saturated fat inside some carb! I HATE how I feel after I eat it, as if I consumed two pounds of butter marinated in heavy cream! I love most of their desserts, and their sandwiches have great potential if they simplify them a bit! I wish they would stop overdoing it! I love their éclairs ...Their coffee is great, and I love their espresso. Their staff is efficient, and for the most part friendly. (yes I agree with the "annoying people" comment)

Macaroon- dry. Don't buy it. Banana Creme Tart- delicious if eaten correctly. I didn't like my first bite because I only scooped the upper portion and got a mouthful of frothy cream. But after I was able to cut my fork through the tough crust (use a metal fork because my plastic one broke), the combination of the cream plus a banana piece plus the crunchy, chocolaty crust was delightful. Open wide! I really wish I could return to try the bread pudding. A couple next to me was eating it. Loudly. And complimenting every bite.

Maybe it's played-out to say this, but I LOVE Tartine.  I came here when I was younger, unaware where I was, but loving the pastry.  Then I had an internship at a production company, and they asked me to pick up morning buns.   When I got to Tartine, the line was out the door, but I waited and got myself an extremely hot, gooey, orangey morning bun and it was definitely worth the wait. Now that I work in the Mission, I have to stop myself from coming here every day-- it's slightly expensive.  Still, I've tried a good portion of the menu, and these are my recommendations: -morning bun, obviously -croissant (really perfect) -cocoa nib meringues -sandwiches are amazing (if you don't like picked things, beware of the innocent looking side carrot), I had an olive tapenade/ cheese sandwich here that was pretty tasty I didn't really enjoy the bread pudding because it was too sweet for me, but most things are too sweet for me.  I've never bought a cake here, so I don't know about that, but I'm sure they're great. coming here is always a pleasure

I had read so many great things about this place and it is on 7x7's 100-Places-To-Eat-In-SF so why not?!? Apparently the bread is worth the wait, and wait we did. The line was out the door and it only got longer. I then realized that the fresh bread we wanted wasn't going to be available until after 5 pm. Quick look at the watch - 4:40! Would the bread be ready in time before we got to the register?? Oh, it was a nail biter but we made it and piping hot from the oven, nearly burning my hubby's arm and side. We also ordered the bread pudding and eclair. The bread pudding was delicious. Rich and not too sweet topped with fresh berries. You could taste the sweetened condensed milk (at least that's what I got out of it). The eclair was eh, as I think the pastry got soggy from the watery custard. The custard had good flavor - light, full of vanilla beans and not too sweet. If only the pastry had been a bit crispier, it would have been perfect. 1-star deduction for parking. It is easier if you park a couple blocks away and walk there. I also didn't see a sign for the place but we figured it out since there were large groups of people milling around out front. They should also work on their customer service. The cashier looked like she really didn't want to be there (no smile or anything) and was half baked. Not to mention in the middle of our transaction, no words, just turned around and left us there. Plus, she was interrupted 3 times by colleagues, asking for ice, etc (weren't there other people they could ask? like ones who weren't in the middle of helping customers).

I have a huge crush on Tartine! I want to make butter babies with this place! My smitten-ness has lead me to exhibit classic crush behavior: Exhibit A: I plan morning meetings so as to eat hot, AMAZING morning bun. Exhibit B: I go for the DELICIOUS spicy turkey sandwich when I have a slow lunch and a good book. I time the crunch of the pickled carrots to my page turning. Exhibit C: I take outta-towners for teatime eclairs. Exhibit D:  I have canceled brunch reservations at popular restaurants because I would rather put a ham & cheese croissant to my lips. Exhibit E:  I hired the band that played their regularly (Gaucho) to play at my wedding. Finally, I took home a token so that Tartine can stay with me always - the BEAUTIFUL COOKBOOK. (That last one sounds creepy but it was the best idea yet!)

I have to agree with everyone here. The croissants at Tartine are pretty damn delicioso! I used to live around the corner from Tartine and made my way through their door only a handful of times. The Lemon Cream Tart was pretty amazing. Top with unsweetened cream to cut the sweetness from the lemon custard. The Devil's Food Cake is well, how do I explain? Valrhona dark-chocolate butter cake, layered with caramel and chocolate ganache? I love you. My only negative thought: their hot pressed sandwiches are yummy but extremely, extremely greasy and floating in butter. But minus that, all the sandwich combinations are delectable.

Blah, Blah, Blah - Insert usual "Tartine is amazing(ly crowded)" comments here. If you don't like standing in a line or you don't like butter go find a starbucks someplace. The quiche and morning buns are _truly_ exceptional. I dream about them sometimes. You should really try them if you're in the neighborhood before 10am when the line seems to suddenly double. I'd love to give Tartine 5 stars if they would stop overcooking everything from time to time (especially their croissants). We may have to agree to disagree on this front though since Elisabeth & Chad have a James Beard award and may take the very reasonable position that they know what they are doing...

The one positive thing about being furloughed one day a month - I get to go to Tartine during the week in the mornings when it's not quite so busy!  (And I do make an effort to do this!)  I have a hard time deciding what to get and am rarely able to hold back on just ordering one thing. I have to get a morning bun...if not to eat at that moment, to eat when I get home or even the next day. (It's almost as good the next day if I warm it up properly - add a little moisture & warm it low in the toaster oven.) The seasonal bread pudding is super yummy.  It's on the softer side. I'm not a huge fan of apple skin in my sweet/baked goods, but it's still pretty good. Berries and peaches are the best though. For me, the gougeres are almost as good as the morning buns. They're warm, cheesy, peppery - slightly creamy in the middle. yum. YUM. Before I had one, I saw Elisabeth Prueitt make her quiche on Martha Stewart. (I don't regulary watch it, but happened to see that she was on & did see it!) She made it look so easy & quick, but obviously delicious.  The quiche is good. Again, it's on the softer, creamier side (like a good quiche should be), and oh-so-tasty. I've tried a couple of cakes and various outings and a few cookies here and there. I have nothing bad to say about any of their food whatsoever. The line might look long, but they know what they're doing and the line moves quickly. (Well, it can only go so quick - which is why i like my furlough day.) My mouth is watering just thinking of all of the goodies at Tartine.

I don't mean to be a Debby Downer, but this place just isn't worth the wait. After living around the corner for several months and always seeing lines spewing out along Guerrero, one Sunday morning my boyfriend and I woke up early to try Tartine. About $17 later, we strolled to Dolores Park to enjoy our chocolate croissant, bread pudding and museli with a cup of coffee in hand. Our favorite pick was the chocolate croissant, because, let's be honest, who doesn't love something that's pure butter and and chocolate. The flakes melted in my mouth. Definitely stick to the croissants here. We found the bread pudding to be much too custardy and bland. The museli to be down right unappetizing, but shame on us for ordering museli at a bakery. Our second and last visit was to pick up some tarts to celebrate a friend's birthday who doesn't consume dairy products. After waiting in line and asking what tarts they had that didn't have dairy products (butter was okay), the helper laughed at us and said, nothing, this is a bakery. How rude!!! Lucky for us Bi-Rite was half a block away and was able to both meet our request and pleasantly serve us. I won't be going out of my way to visit Tartine in the future.

Lots of visual eye candy, stainless kitchen hardware and not enough substance. Does not even come close to Bake Sale Betty,  Fanny's,  or the Cheese Board. Lenox Mass. training is not the Berkeley Gourmet Ghetto. The morning buns are far superior at La Farine, the croissants are served without jam and butter (lame) and I make better cafe au lait at home with our espresso machine. My home made pizza with dough from Trader Joe's is far superior to their a.m. croque monsieur. Considering that it is in the Mission, and there are not many other places like lt there, I guess it is acceptable to take your parents to or out of towners  ( a place like Fishermen's Wharf). Definitely not a place I will be going back to. I've had better breakfast fare at the The Inn in Williamstown, Mass.

I also make sure to grab some chocolate croissants..the best I've had in a while. They're super fluffy with just the right amount of chocolate..a marriage of chocolate and croissant..what's better than that? Their bread pudding is also divine.

Today I went to this popular bakery on my second time after I hadn't been there for long time. Because first time, I took an eclair and coffee, it was less than ok.... chocolate was too sticky and chou was lil soggy. However having been watching long long line everyday made me want to try one more time. then now really understandable why they can make crazy line! Banana chocolate pie is so amazing! airly whipped cream, crispy dark chocolate, savory pie dough, melty caramel, sweet banana and castard..... hummm yammyyyy....... but coconuts passion fruit cake was ok. I thought white flake covering sponge cake was white chocolate, but actually it was coconuts flake, which lasted like paper in my mouth. Wish it would be white choco. That would be perfect! Anyway defenetely I will go back to get banana pie!

Delish!  I went on a Saturday morning with a friend visiting from out of town.  We had to wait in line for about 5 minutes, but it was beautiful outside so I didn't care.   Since I was feeling a little indulgent, we each got two things plus lattes.  Overall the food was good, but the pain au chocolat was the best.  It was still hot and melty in the middle.   The cafe was packed inside, but just as soon as we paid for our food a table opened up.

Everything Tartine makes is solid gold. The croissants are fluffy, crunchy, and buttery all at once. The morning buns are sweet and chewy, with a hint of orange. The coffee has never let me down, plus if you get a latte they serve it in a bowl (tres chic! ...Unless you're prone to spills.) ...And don't get me started on their desserts! I mean, sure, almost everything Tartine offers could be considered a dessert depending on the time of day or if you didn't know better. Once you try their proper desserts, such as the chocolate cake or the lemon tart or the fruit bavarian, you'll realize the only place for their sweet cafe items is on the breakfast table. "Decadent" barely comes close to describing Tartine's desserts. I drool at the mere thought. The service is usually very good. There's always a line but that doesn't phase me because the servers are very good at keeping it moving.

I somehow have avoided the ridiculous lines for this place, which probably has something to do with the 5 star rating! Their open faced sandwiches are kind of expensive until you realize they can feed two people! The croque monsieur is perfect, and I've been to Paris! Their brownies made with Valrhona chocolate are super dense and rich, which means I can't eat it all in one sitting; a good thing in my opinion! My absolute favorite thing has to be the banana cream pie with the surprise chocolate and caramel inside. Orgasmically good. I need to try these chocolate croissants everyone raves about.

This place is absolutely fantastic. I came here with a friend (who got there before me and spared me the need to wait in line). We shared two morning buns, a ham-and-cheese croissant, and some cranberry bread pudding. The morning bun was coated in this sweet orange glaze that was excellent: not too powerful but certainly not too light. The best part was the very top of the bun, which had this crystallized crust of the glaze. It was unexpected and delicious. The croissant was definitely the highlight. At first I was disappointed because there isn't a whole lot of ham and cheese, but the cheese is baked inside the croissant so that the bread is itself crusted in smoky cheese. All in all, it was fantastic. The bread pudding was pretty meh, but I'm also generally not a huge fan of bread pudding. It was standard fare as far as desserts go, but I did really enjoy the cranberries. Ultimately, I won't let the somewhat mediocre bread pudding deter me from giving Tartine 5 stars.

I wish I could give six stars.  Best bakery - ever.  The choclate eclairs are a life experience in decadence; the quiche is amazing.  It has a slight lemony flavor because the use creme fraiche.  And their baked goods are not just great replicas of French style pastries - they are done in their own unique style.  Tartine is about darker crusts, lots of crunch and texture.  We stopped here because we figured such a little place with such a long line would be worth it - and we were right.  Wait in the line - you won't be sorry. And yes, amazing coffee.

I'm off on Mondays so I have a list of places to visit while I have no child and free.... Stood in line to see what the hype was about for Tartine.  I recently watch the new Food Network Channel that the bakery was premiered on.  I get excited when I see places in my city that I can visit. I looked and looked for parking.  But I got lucky before I gave up... Beware!  It is right on the corner of Guerrero and 18th Street;  this is a busy, busy area especially on the weekends with great weather (Dolores Park is a block away!) I stood in a line that went out the door so I was super anxious to see what they had to offer.  The prices are high but hey...enjoy life right?  The eclairs are yummy and the croissants are outstanding!!!

My partner is an avocational baker, so Tartine was a "must" on our visit to SF. It reminded me a lot of the Cheese Board's pizza café in neighboring Berkeley - noisy, crowded, wait for a table, spartan, good food. We had panini sandwiches (Humboldt Fog and Sopressata, respectively) - both were scrumptious, with Sopressata the top fave. (The sandwiches were massive - when we go again, we will order one to share and have them cut it in 2 or 4 pieces.) I had hoped to get a pain au chocolat - but silly me, I waited 'til after our sandwiches, and they were all gone. He who hesitates is, indeed, lost. We did come back for bread at 5pm, and scored a delicious walnut loaf. Yet another definitive SF experience... ADDENDUM.  During our lunch visit and a subsequent drop-in, we purchased a loaf of walnut bread and several pastries (yes, I did get a pain au chocolat, and my head is still spinning). All the baked goods were absolutely superb - I give the bakery 5 big, buttery stars!

AGHHHHH!!! I FINALLY WENT TO TARTINE. It was about 40 outside, and I could see my breath in the bakery, but it was SO worth it. We got tons of pastries, sandiwches, and wine--totally worth the long wait. And even though our bill was high, it was a great value for everything we got! I think I actually prefer the pastries at La Farine in Oakland, but the sandiwches, wine, and hipster-watching make this worth the trek. Bravo!

Popular is putting it lightly. I did not have the pleasure of sitting for a lunch rather I picked up some pastries to go. I got a croissant filled with meats and cheese which was crispy, flavorful and aesthetic. A few bites of sweet shortbread which crumbled to the bite while hitting a satisfying consistent sweet note. I can only wonder what the lunch menu tastes like.

I really wanted to love this bakery after all the overwhelmingly fabulous reviews. But alas left unsatisfied in the creativity and quality.  The line was out the door but as previously mentioned moved very quickly, so I ordered after only a 15-20 min wait.  I ordered the mushroom croque monsieur, coconut creme tart, and bread pudding.  The croque monsieur was not a classic croque monsieur, but rather an open face sandwhich.  It was one thick slice of bread topped with a meager dabbling of cheese and mushrooms. A classic croque monsieur has more than enough gruyere melted to make it sumptuous; this version was not. The coconut creme tart was straightforward cremey whipped creme with cocunut pieces.  One unexpected touch that I appreciated was a layer of caramel in between the tart crust and creme.  I've never seen that before. The bread pudding by the time it came home, maybe it was too long,  was soggy and bread not dense. Too bad. Next time maybe I''ll choose better.

Do I bother writing a review, since the 3000+ above mine say it all? But I must add my own because Tartine needs to know they are loved and respected. My husband and I got there 20 minutes after they opened on a Sunday, and alas- line out the door and no room inside. BUT the line went fast, and after seeing the croque monsieurs, I knew I would wait forever if I had too. BUT, sigh- they ran out and we had to wait 15 minutes for a new batch. We had a long day of touristing, so we just got the almond croissant, gougere, chocolate and jambon and got out of there. They looked and smelled sooooo amazing, we stopped on the street, ducked under a cover and ate them standing up, in the RAIN! All were great, but the jambon - ham and cheese (swiss? gruyere?) I don't know and don't care, but I DREAM ABOUT THEM!! We're going back to SF in a couple of months, and I know we'll be back in line!

Overhyped.  And before everyone gets their shorts in a wad and starts responding craziness like "you obviously don't know good pastry"--let me start by saying:  My sister was a pastry chef that graduated from the San Francisco Culinary Academy and I have had many unbelievable confection creations.  That being said, on a recent trip to SF, my son and I were so anxious to go to Tartine. I had the shitake mushroom brioche and lemon creme tart.  He had the open-faced chicken and pesto panini and chocolate torte.  The crust on the tart was too much like a Catholic-communion-wafer and the lemon tart lacked ANY soul. The chocolate torte was very good which is why the bakery is getting the second star.   Both sandwiches were absolutely burnt to a crisp, totally charred. The gruyere atop was rubbery from the overcooking. This was probably because the cashiers were unbelievably disorganized.  They were snotty and kept giving out the sandwich I ordered to people who ordered after me. When I pointed this out to the cashier, she kept saying "yours is coming" without ever looking at my number.  When she finally realized the mistake, they hurried and burned a couple of sandwiches to give to us. And people say L.A. waiters are snotty.

at tartine, it's no holds barred for even the slightest of cautionary eaters. you might as well go BIG (gastronomically) and indulge. the croissants are to die for - get the chocolate croissant if you love chocolate. the hazelnut tart has a kick that is a bit overbearing... i have pretty high sugar tolerance and it was still overwhelming. lastly i tried the banana creme tart. although i usually don't prefer anything banana flavored  for the most part, the dark chocolate lining along the tart is a verrrry nice surprise and blends well with this banana creme pie-wannabe. don't get intimidated if the line goes out the door. the interior is pretty small so it'll naturally expand outdoors; it goes by swiftly and you can take advantage of the time queuing to dwell on what you want since the selection is so vast inside. service sucks though. the worker was rude and seemed vexed with the THREE questions I asked regarding the banana creme tart's contents. if I'm paying $40 for the thing, i'd like to make an informed purchase. then the cashier who rung me up was too busy engaging in personal conversation of her own.

Delicious Food Madame la Tartine, Very delicious food, however, beaucoup, beaucoup trop dispendieux! beaucoup trop cher! I bought a few items at your joint: one cookie, one gougère, one lemon pie and one Sopressata sandwich and the total surprised me! I also ask to place all these wonderful items in the Tartine's cotton bag like the one found at grocery store for 2 bucks, but... when the lady told me it is 40 bucks for the cotton bag I resisted... Tartine has delicious food but, at what price!!!  I guess this is California rule!

Everyone mentioned how much they loved the bread pudding here so I decided to give it a whirl. I was a bit disappointed at their bread pudding as it was all crumpled up and smashed into pieces. Not much of a bread pudding but perhaps maybe that's how they make the bread pudding out here in San Francisco. I still love Chicago's bread pudding.

The Double Pain au Chocolat was sooo freaking good, the best chocolate croissant I've tasted so far, definitely lived up to the hype of Dave Meyers on the food network  show "Best thing I Ever Ate." An employee suggested I try the Ham & Cheese Croissant, though I had one bite of it, that bite contained lots of good flavor. The one thing I was really upset about was the well crafted artsy cappuccino, it was super sour I don't know what that was about.

Found this gem after searching for a place that has good almond croissants because it's my mom's favorite breakfast pastry and she's hard to please. We tried  La boulange, but it failed in comparison; the almond croissants are the best of the best here. Just the perfect amount of almond filling and the oh so delicious and flakey crust! Even thought we came for just the croissant, waiting in the long line the first time Don't plan on coming here ordering one thing. I tried that and ended up with a bowl of bread pudding with fruit compote, two slices of quiche and some macaroons. ...and some pound cake/lemon loaf slice. Worth the wait in line. In fact, I've even come back many times after before opening time just to be first in line to order and most importantly.... get a table!

Delicious sweet-tooth haven attended by many a tourist and staffed by prim, but polite, (and sometimes beardy) hipsters. Try: Mexican Wedding Cookies. Just $0.85 to look like a coke addict with all that powdered sugar covering your face--man, it's just so good. They offer a plethora of baked delights, with croque monsieurs (Americanized) and the like. Eating inside is kind of a crowded experience, but if you're lucky enough to find a table outside, it's lovely. Or, walk to Dolores Park. Who doesn't like pastries in the park? No one.

Tartine's line can be long every day. There's not much way to avoid it. The heavy butter croissant is a classic, and the hot chocolate is creamy (great for winter). An artistic trendy place and a neighborhood favorite for breakfast. Very good french bakery with its own twist. Expensive. The cookies are thin, dry and crunch. Not much space inside, not much tranquility because if the long lines, and outside seatings are occupied forever. Good for quick stop, individuals and sometimes couples. But not groups

we came here on a friday morning and the place was packed!  dont people work?  we stood in line for about an hour before finally getting to order.  then waited another 15-20minutes before finally eating!  a lot of waiting.  this bakery is not cheap either- we bought assorted pastries and lunch for three for about $60-70.  yeah.  i know while there we had two hot pressed sandwiches and a chocolate criossant.  the next morning we had the morning buns and croissants.  the hot pressed sandwiches are HUGE!  they are so big, they are cut into three pieces.  its plenty for two people.  if its just one of you, you might want to opt for the croque monsieur.  small and open faced.   i got the proscuitto and provolone.  there was so much bread!  they onlt had a couple of slices of proscuitto in there so the ratio to bread wasnt that good.  i ended up eating it like an open faced sandwich and was stuffed at the end. the morning bun when reheated in the toaster oven was sugary , crispy, soft all at the same time.  it was yummy but very heavy.  like a brick in my stomach.

WOW. I am so glad my friend took me here because I absolutely loved Tartine! We came early enough so that the line wasn't too long and we ordered the most amazing things. We had the morning bun, the bread pudding, the lemon bar, the almond lemon poppyseed cake, and muesli. I would say the best thing out of our breakfast items was the morning bun. It was warm and covered in sugar and delectable. I want one, or 7, right now. The bread pudding was yummy, the lemon bar had a brown butter crust and it was perfectly tart and sweet, the almond lemon poppyseed cake was delicious, but I wish it had a tiny bit more almond taste to it, and the muesli was ok but I've never been a fan so I can't fairly judge it. My orange juice was absolutely out of this world. It was the best fresh orange juice with the right amount of pulp and was really sweet too. It almost resembled tangerine juice, which I love even more. Overall, this place is a winner and I'm excited to go back and order everything else they have.

As soon as you walk in your greeted by delicious pastries on display and a more than happy staff ready to take your order.

Multiple problems taking place at Tartine. For one, their positive reputation and lines out the door just contribute to their lack of customer service. It's a problem not just at Tartine, but at many of the city's eating and drinking establishments. They survive with a good product and ignore the part about providing that little extra. They take your money and say fuck you at the same time. All the while delivering food that doesn't even warrant that attitude or those prices. I blame this on the owner, who could stand to implement a little change in the atmosphere. This place is constantly crowded, so the employees are worked into the ground and I can sympathize with that. I'm not looking for chit chat or a bubbly greeting, but simply dropping the gruffness would be nice. After that aspect, I was indifferent about the food. People check out Yelp and figure this place will be life altering and have no problem waiting an hour for a couple pastries. Then after the buildup, they eat it in ten minutes and while it's tasty, in the back of their minds they hear that voice chanting "Over-rated." clap clap. clap clap clap. I don't fall into that trap. It's an overpriced bakery with good, but not hour long wait with hipsters everywhere good, stuff. If you can figure out a way to get someone to pick something up for you, that's your best bet. That way, you can simply enjoy the food and not deal with the annoying aspects this place tosses into its business model.

Heaven on earth. There's a reason the line extends far out the door, but the staff are excellent at keeping it flowing, so don't despair. The bread pudding is a must, especially with the great Mr. Espresso coffee they serve.

I've walked by here several times afterhours, and invariably someone else in the walking party raves about each and every bit of heaven he or she has had here.  So last week I stood in the line.  The event: driving up to Tahoe for a weekend at friend's grandparents' cabin on the lake, and since have always been taught it is polite to bring something delectable as an invitee, I'd hit on the perfect solution. What I forgot was to bring was a cooler.  This was problematic because many of the cakes/pies/pastries have the lifespan of their ingredients outside climate controlled conditions, the a/c in my car is currently busted, and passing through Sacramento would be like a thousand degrees hot.  After the very nice people in front of me in line lamented re the perishablity of bread pudding, the very nice woman behind the counter suggested the cookies, and I ended up getting an assortment of five of every cookie they had.  Wonderful idea.  Upon presenting the brown cardboard box with the silver Tartine sticker, eyes lit up and we had grandparents getting powdered sugar all over their faces as they dove for cookies.  Can't beat happy people and beautiful nature. Also, since the wonderful experience with the cookies, I went back yesterday to try some of those perishables which were denied to me earlier.  I got the hazelnut chocolate tart, the seasonal bread pudding, and a coffee, and we took our goods and biodegradable utensils over to Dolores Park to enjoy the sugar in the sun.   I can't wait to return.

Tartine hardly needs my vote -- but it's the principle!! Their fresh baked ham and cheese croissants, their bread pudding, their coffee -- ALL to die for! GO GO GO. But PLEASE don't be one of those fools who grabs a table BEFORE you put your order in or even BEFORE your place in line reaches inside the bakery. BAD FORM (unless you have someone elderly who can't actually be made to stand in line for 20 minutes).

I am almost feel silly writing the review, because a) most everyone knows how amazing it is already  b) I would hate for one more person to be in line in front of me!   My favorites that I've tried thus far are: the ham and cheese croissant, the almond frangapaine croissant is unbelievable and other favorites are the morning bun and bread pudding. The chances of finding either a table or parking are not good, but if you plan for the extra time to stand in line, it's worth the wait. Their coffee (Mr. Espresso) is also solid.

I am a very particular about bakeries, and it doesn't get much better than this. Yea, the line is long just about any day of the week (except last Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. when I was waited on within 2 minutes...), but I always need the long wait to decide which of the heavenly treats I want. My faves: the lemon bars are luscious, tart, sweet, and incredible. The bread pudding hearty, so fruity and very satisfying. And my most recent find is the devil's food cake. Not sure if there is more cake or fudge filling. It's not a subtle cake. Kind of goes right to your veins.  You can't miss with this place, and you can watch the bakers through the large window from the street. There's a great neighborhood vibe too.

A lot of out of towner hipsters, which is kinda funny, but overall this place makes for an amazing bakery hands down. I like how the employes are chill and not in your face and fake like other places. Being "real" is important to running a business not "fakeness".

Honestly, hands down the BEST Bakery I have been to. I went about 3 years ago on a girls trip up the coast. My cousin introduced us to TARTINE. We went for lunch, then back for dessert that evening and back for breakfast the next morning.  I tried to save my leftovers but it didn't last the 6 hour trip home:( I called my husband at home and told them they had a cookbook. He ordered it for me off of Amazon for Christmas. I kid you not, tastes just like the real thing. Everytime I make something from it people love it.

There isn't much here about the sandwiches, but the mushroom crouqe monsieur I had was one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten.  Maybe it really was the best.... We didn't wait in line very long and ordered three different sandwiches.  Each one was amazing.  We took our food to Dolores park, spread out our blanket, and had a wonderful feast/picnic.  BTW, the park is a great reason to be in the neighborhood and shouldn't be missed.  Make the effort to climb up the hill for outstanding views. The pickled carrot that came with the sandwich was a real treat too.  When I'm in SF, this will be a for-sure stop.    Maybe next time I'll try a dessert.

First off, I absolutely adore this bakery and cannot rave about it more. The chocolate cake is to die for and so utterly rich and decadent that more than likely, you have to share it with a friend. The morning buns are flakely and delicious and have the perfect balance between pastry and cinnamon sugar topping. I also had the ham and cheese panini for lunch, but unfortunately wish that I had opted out of the dijon mustard or at least asked for less of it. It was so overpowering that the sandwich was no longer tasty. Tartine is well worth the trek for me to the mission but I only go there so often due to the sky high prices.

Joining the chorus of praise- the bread is amazing. It's just as bread should be, tough and crunchy on the outside to protect the fluffy and slightly moist innards... Sesame pairs nicely with avocado and tahini and the olive loaf is amazing with a nice cold-pressed olive oil. The walnut is the most flexible and can be used with sweet or savory toppings. You are going to be happy so long as you do not waste your day on a country loaf (sorry, Dan). Also, since the bread is dreadful on its second day (rather, not the bliss it was when it was fresh), I recommend ordering a half-loaf. YES, you can do that- so very nice. I've heard the sandwiches are too greasy, the pastries are over the top and the coffee has only been served to me hot ONE TIME. My five stars  go to the bread alone.

I went here with my brother who raved that Tartine has the best pastries outside of Paris that he's tasted. I was suprised at the homey, slightly informal interior. I saw their cookbook and expected something posh, contemporary. The line was long and it was tough to find a table but what can ya do? if it's popular then the line is going to be long and it'll be busy. We had pain au chocolat, morning bun, and pumpkin bread. They were very good. My brother actually has better taste in pastries than I so I didn't appreciate Tartine as much as he. A good place for someone who likes fine pastries.

Sweet or Savory this place has a killer selection of great food a drink, but make sure you're ready to stomach some butter, because it's in e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g. Except for the "side salad" which is just a little head of lettuce, but magically seasoned with lemon, salt, pepper, and oil. Yum.

Great staff. Colin is an awesome baker and the staff is very personable. The best croissant I've ever had. Just the right amount of crispy-flaky-beautifully layered goodness. The huckleberry frangipani is out of this world. Every bite was an enjoyable moment. My Hubby had a lemon bar and it was great, too! Great, clean, beautiful space. Can't wait to get my morning bun! Oh, and my iced coffee was amazing! It was a perfectly balanced shot. Great espresso and great service! Can't wait to go back:)

Waited in line for 20 minutes and walked out with 2 hefty croissants. Delicious, dense, buttery, to-die-for. Must return for their bread pudding. I don't mind the wait. Parking on the other hand is an exercise in patience.

I think i tried the wrong stuff.... I did try the morning bun and i thought it was good. The bread pudding was VERY pudding-like and too moist and the berries were too sour. I wish i tried a tart, but i don't think i'd go back just for that.

Good god, I never knew it was possible to make pastries so flaky and buttery!  There was a long line by the time we got there - around 10:30a - but it was well worth the wait.  The coffee matched the quality of the baked goods.  It was days before I recovered from my butter coma!

On vacation and saw the reviews.........walking around trying to find this place and looking at my phone and maps and then I smell the sweet scent of baked goods.  THEN I see in the distance a line of people and I know I'm on the right track.  The service and staff is sub par but the baked goods are delicious.

Exquisite treats, both sweet and savory, that are not to be missed. However, beware of the fierce, bitchy attitude that is apparently customary of the employees. One girl egregiously snapped at me simply for asking a question. If you choose to work in the hospitality industry, then learn how to do so with finesse.

I make it a point to drop by every time I drive to SF.  If you make it early enough to enjoy the famous chocolate croissant, good for you!  Else, try their delicious bread pudding or any of their tea cakes or tarts.  Pick out anything over here, they rarely disappoint.

oh this place rocks!  Some of the best baked goods you will find anywhere!  We came here for a light brunch the other day and it was packed!  The line moved pretty well but the communal style seating is quickly swallowed up.  Got the frangipane croissant ($4.25) which was incredible!  Filled with some type of almond flavored cream!  Also got the croque monsieur ($9.75) which was also quite good.  It was topped with an asparagus, ham, bechamel and gruyere.  A must visit spot while in the Mission district!

I finally went here after years of my friends raving about it. Thankfully the line was not around the corner when i got there and the hipsters had all rode away on their fixed gears! Yay! They have a huge selection of baked goods and fresh coffee. The coffee was perfectly strong and I ordered a lemon bar, my favorite, and an eclair. Both were perfectly executed. I really liked the eclair with the vanilla custard filling, it was decadent. Its a very cute place to go and relax on a calm day and enjoy the eclectic area.

I would have to agree with Sirina K. on this one. I had the Pain Au Chocolat, which was ok, not as good as France,ok! My Cappuccino was one of the best I ever had, 2 stars for that, but it's not your coffee.  I thought $10 for a coffee and a croissant, the staff would be a little more friendly and attentive. Of course, I was wrong. Every time I asked a question I got a response as if I was at Starbucks and I thought a tall was actually a large! So I wasn't up on the Tartine vernacular and serving procedures.  They give you a sign to take to your table, but I didn't know that I had to wait in line, AGAIN! for my cappuccino and get attitude from not one Mission hipster, but two! I then had to get a glass of water in the friggin' kitchen, literally! When I asked for a glass of water the guy looked at me like I was a street person asking for a freebie. Here's the kicker: They ask you to bus your plates again in the kitchen, where both tubs were full to the gills with dirty dishes next to, yes, the water, where I had to serve myself, earlier. Sheesh! I rather go to the Richmond and get a pastry for a third of the price and get yelled at by a Babushka from the old country.

I met some friends here for breakfast on a Saturday. After reading reviews, I knew I would be waiting in line. It's a rare occasion if I wait in line for anything. But the wait wasn't horrible and I had good friends to chat with. I split a chocolate croissant and a ham and griere croissant....both were still warm from the oven. Both were also a little flakier and crumbled to tiny pieces. Delicious pieces, but I think a little over cooked. Who cares, though? They were still warm! I also ordered a chocolate hazelnut tart and a coconut macaroon for later. The coconut was terrific. Not too sweet and hit the spot. Haven't had the tart yet. Overall, its a little overrated. But I would go back and I would stand in line again. I'm just not begging to go again tomorrow ... Staff was fast and helpful without being fake or bossy. We even scored a great table outside.

Also stopped by here on name recognition alone...after Pizzeria Delfina, which is another review for another day (http://www.yelp.com/user…). The goods: - Was a bit coughy so got the $3 White Peony white tea and added a little honey for a really fragrant and clean taste drink. It comes in a little cup and saucer - along with the tea bag in a metal pot, which you can ask for hot water refill. - For eatings, it was the $3.50 tea cake which was like a chocolate cake but with a hint of ginger(?) and sure went well with that white peony tea. Was going to split it, but others did not enjoy it as much. So toughed it out and finished it by myself, yes! - The $2 Friand (http://static.px.yelp.co…) was on the rich side, but worth a try.. - Also got a $6.35=small Coconut Cream Tart (http://static.px.yelp.co…) and recommend that if you're into coconuts. I was. Still, everything is a bit on the pricey side for sweets ITTET, but what can you do? The atmosphere: - There are two sections when entering, depending on what you're ordering. If you want only coffee/tea/drinks, then go to the right side where there's a drinks "bar" and cash register. If want sweets, then it's the left side (http://static.px.yelp.co…) - a line, yep, but it moves quickly since there are two registers. This is where the display case of sweets are, with menus placed around if want to look at first. You can order drinks in this line too, but then pick up at the drinks register side. - As this place is crowded - most of the time is my guess - open seats amongst the wooden tables and chairs (http://static.px.yelp.co…) get taken up fast (noticed a few communal sharing of tables though). We had to stand by the counter (there is also a table at the end of said counter, with coffee refill pots and sugar, honey, the usuals). - The counter overlooked Guerrero St., which was not too bad of a view on a weekend; two wooden benches are located right outside (http://static.px.yelp.co…). - On the 18th St. side, there are metal tables and chairs (http://static.px.yelp.co…). Other yelpers have posted really good pics, and I didn't have my camera. So, thanks for letting me snagged your pics AngelaA, AnnL, AmyD, CookieMonsterN. The coolest part of the hour we were there was seeing how diverse their customers were - probably every single SF-neighborhood type showed up. :) *In These Tough Economic Times

I am a Missionite. I love this neighborhood and the little places that lend to all the hype that can make/break the Mission. Tartine Bakery is one of these places, as evidenced by the thousands of reviews for it on this site (among other things). And I am writing my first-ever Yelp review to tell you exactly why you should not stand among the sheep in line for them. I have been to Tartine Bakery many times as I used to live a couple blocks from them (and now live an eternal 5 blocks away). Not once have I ever been treated with anything but icy hipster coolness--admittedly, not a great customer service practice, but, frankly, many places in the Mission are manned by life-long baristas who think they're too cool for a job in the hospitality industry. So I'm not gonna hold Tartine Bakery to the fire for this one--it unfortunately comes with the Mission territory. (There are, thankfully, notable exceptions, such as, say, Bi-Rite Grocery & Creamery down the block, where I am always greeted with a smile and lively banter.) So as I was saying, I knew I wasn't going to Tartine Bakery for cordial, friendly service. I was going for the good food. Well, well, well. Was I in for a surprise. It was this past Saturday, the day of the NorCal Grilled Cheese Invitational in Dolores Park. The place was a mess but we had melted cheese on the brain, so we headed over to Tartine Bakery to help ourselves to their overpriced but delicious pressed sandwiches. (I had my eyes set on their three-cheese concoction.) We waited in the obligatory line for about 25 minutes, then a skinny dude behind the counter with hair on his face and hanging onto his face told us they'd run out of bread. UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. But, OK, that's fair--not his fault, maybe they didn't expect to get so much business that day. We settled for their open croque monsieur sandwiches; he takes down the counter-top sandwich menu. Raggedy hair dude puts them into boxes to-go (without even asking if we wanted to stay and eat them there) and we ask, "Are they warm?" He says no. I ask if he could reheat them, and he gives me the wariest look on earth, as if I was asking for some outrageous thing. But he does it--warily, warily. Sigh. All right, we pay. Just as we've handed over the dough and the register girl's rung it all up, we see--no joke--like 10 loaves of bread behind her. "Excuse me, we were told there was no bread to be had?" "Oh, yeah, uh..." (makes look one makes when one has been caught lying) That's when we notice everyone behind us has ordered sandwiches and raggedy hair dude has even put the counter-top menu with all the sandwiches back up. Everyone's ordering to their heart's delight! What gives? As the girl notices that we're taking this all in she says, "Oh, well, a sandwich would've taken 30 minutes anyway." Excuse me, but whose prerogative is it to decide how long I am willing/able to wait for a meal? If I want to wait 30 minutes for a sandwich, I will, thanks. I'll make that call. Further, when we told her that we'd been told there were no sandwiches and therefore would not have ordered these cold, re-heated croque monsieurs otherwise, she didn't even give us the option to order sandwiches. Disorganized. Sloppy. Rude. Terrible. Plus, our sandwiches were gross. I can buy overpriced sandwiches almost everywhere else in the Mission, and I can get more conscientious service too.

croque monsieur, i want to marry you. yes, i do. for you are the reason i wake early on sunday mornings, do yoga at an ungodly hour and skip down the street to catch the 22 fillmore. i hop off at dolores and 16th to walk a few measly blocks in the blustery wind to stand in line to have you. and have you, i will. from that first glance from behind the counter, to the moment i ravish you with my lips. the orgasmic sensations of nutmeg-infused bechamel, black forest ham and gruyere. melted, edges crisped, buttery GRUYERE. my lovely croque monsieur, will you do me the honors so that i may have you every weekend for the rest of my days? for a love like ours is hard to find.

Update: 9/22/06   I just got the new Tartine cookbook. . .now I NEVER have to deal with those counter people EVER again!!!    I can bake my own banana cream pies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bwaha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Does Tartine need another review?   No. Am I going to do one anyway? Hell yes. I stumbled upon Tartine one day by accident.  I was going to Carl's to get a doll cake and Carl's was gone and Tartine was there. . .looking all cute and smug like.  WTF?   What in tar-nation happened to Carl's and where else am I going to get a purple ruffle cake with a doll stuck in the top of it?  Sure, a buttercream laden bright purple cake with a half naked doll shoved into it is cheesy, but a girl sometimes needs a doll cake when everyone else forgot to get her a cake and she doesn't feel like making herself yet another birthday cake (can you hear the violins?).   So here I am, another year older without a birthday cake.  I would have thrown myself on the ground and had a tantrum (worst yet, the tile in the entryway still spelled out "Carl's" in a deliberate attempt to mock me), but that would have taken effort and I was worn out from feeling sorry for myself.  So I decided to check out what was what.   So this is back in the beginning when Tartine was not yet TARTINE and so they were still at least trying to be nice behind the counter.  It was not yet crowded and you could take your time browsing the deliciousness. . .ah, the good old days.  My first items there were a banana cream tartlet and a piece of lemon pound cake.  Perfection.  Delicious - the crust on the tartlet was the best crust I'd ever had.  EVER.  I went and sat in Dolores Park and shamelessly devoured both items.  Over a month's time I eventually went through almost the whole display case and then had to retire and get away from this vortex of sweet evil. Cut to about six months later. . .Tartine is now TARTINE.   I hate to throw the dreaded "hipster" moniker out there but what the hell . . bloody well infested with hipsters steaming up their tortoise shell glasses with their macchiatos and getting tufts of whipped cream stuck to their nose rings.  The line was sick, the counter staff was overwrought and bitchy but the goods in the glass counter still looked lovely.  I ordered my two faves plus a few other items as I was going to take them to a friend's house.  I also got some cookies 'cause I wanted to try them.  Mind you, Tartine bakes their items "a la francais" which to most people would seem too dark but dark usually equals flavor so I understood their motives.   One of the items I got was a rocher which is a meringue based cookie usually studded with nuts of some sort.  I ordered four of them because I was going to snack on them.  All told, I was spending about $40.00.  I had my pastries put in a box and the rochers in a little bag so I could snack on my way home to Oakland.  As I walked out of the bakery, I took a bite of the rocher and . . .gack. . .it was burnt.  It was still light beige on the outside but the inside was dark and the nuts were burnt.  I am not a cheapskate. . this was not about the $1.60 I spent on four cookies it was more like if this were my bakery I would want to know my stuff was sub par, right?  Wouldn't you?  So I waited in line.  Got to the counter person and told her NICELY that the rochers were overcooked.  I didn't say burnt.  I kept my tone low.  She rolled her eyes at me and told me that that's how they were supposed to be.  Um.  Okay.   So instead of pulling my pastry chef card, I just said, well they taste burnt to me and I'd like my money back please.  Eyes rolling again.   And she says all hell of sarcastically and loud, trying to embarrass me. . ."So you want your, like, dollar back?"  eyes a'rollin' . .and I say, "Uh, like, yeah.  . . your cookies are burnt and if you're going to charge 50 cents for something that costs you two cents to make, you might as well bake them correctly."    She tsk'd me. . .that sound that people make when they are annoyed at you . . .I got tsk'd!!!  WTF!!   So sadly, I avoid Tartine . .. but sometimes, if I am rolling with my sweetheart, I make him run in and get me one of those heavenly banana cream tartlets. . I can't help it. . .they are that good.

It was the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday, and I knew I needed to prepare myself for the days to come.  What better way to prepare for the holiday than to splurge at Tartine Bakery.   I met up on this nice sunny day in the city with my husband, friend Eric, and fellow Yelper Daniel L.  Daniel L. grabs his food first and mans the fort (aka table right outside) while Eric and I wait in line to order our food.  We approach the glass case filled with glorious sugary goodness.  It nearly brought tears to my eyes.  I felt like it was some kind of sick joke to have me pick a few items from this plethora of sweets.  Alas we order and head back to the table with two-open faced sandwiches, two eclairs, a coconut creme tart, banana creme tart, and tres leches cake.  We join forces w/ Daniel L.'s lemon tart and open faced veggie sandwich.  Everything was delicious, but the tres leches cake kicked the ass of everything else.  Moist cake w/ a flaky bottom layer brought me straight to nirvana w/ every bite.  Oh yea...it was that good.  The ecliars were soft and flaky, filled with creamy custard, and topped with a dark chocolate frost.  Banana creme tart (my second favorite of the "meal") was basically a banana creme pie in tart form with chocolate on top.  The twist here is the crust was lined with chocolate and CARAMEL! *drool* Tartine, I fell in love with you that day and I promise to return soon.  A big thank you to Daniel L., Eric, and Marc for ringing in Thanksgiving with me by indulging in sugar bliss.

Wow......Is all I have to say...I am seriously in a loss for words....This place sent me to a far way place that sweetaholics dream about and I am literally coming down from drifting on a cloud of pure decadent delight!! I could not have thought of a better way to have celebrated this wonderful Labor day then to have spent it at the oh so wonderful (Now one of my go to spots) Tartine Bakery enjoying some of the most decadently... out of this world pastries desserts that San Francisco has to offer (and do I mean Out of this world)!!! Though what made this day especially enjoyable was to have enjoyed it with 2 of my closet, most awesome major sweet tooth yelper buds Daniel L. and Kent P.! The line coming out of this place tells it all. Immediately after walking within the bakery I was bombarded with images of beautiful fabulous looking pastries sitting behind a glass case calling to me I'm here Shannon... Look at how fabulous and wonderful I look... and I taste delicious!! I f I could, I would have tasted everything (which we almost did lol) we decided to share a few decadent Items First the absolute Decadent Dark Chocolate Pudding (and when I say decadent, I mean decadent) seductively rich, dark and creamy with a dollop of cream in the middle- garnished with shreds of dark chocolate...Looked beautiful, tasted beautiful. We also had a heaping slice of the Tres leches cake (This was amazing and probably my favorite of all) Imagine a thick, fluffy, white, creamy, rich moist slice of heaven that just literally fell apart tenderly in your mouth....Mmmm...wow. We also ordered a Morning bun...which was nice- a little dry though it had great flavor.Rasberry Fruit Tart -which was both Daniel and Kent's favorites, which I am not a huge fan of tarts, however this was a delight- light creamy though not overbearingly sweet garnished with succulently fresh sweet raspberries (perfect summer dessert) We also ordered a mouthwatering open faced sandwich with fresh portabella mushrooms, thick succulent fresh sliced tomatoes entrenched in a wonderful melted Swiss cheese toasted to perfection...All accompanied with our beautiful foamy lattés served in big beautiful over sized cups....Which might I say  were Phenomenal and one of the best lattés I have had in a while!! It is noisy and there is only one exit which makes it a little crowded- however, despite the chaos of people and difficulty trying to get a table, it is certainly worth visiting and well worth the drive. As for everything else you will not be disappointed. I had a wonderful time. I would highly suggest meeting up with some friends to try this fabulous place (just be prepared to stand in a line for a little while) Thankyou Daniel and Kent for making my Labor day a memorable one!!

Stopped by here after getting ice cream at Bi-Rite down the street to see what all the fuss was about. There was a line going out the door, but it moved quickly. The inside is a cute little cafe-like bakery with a small display case of cakes, tarts, and pastries. Unfortunately, they were out of almost everything (including the banana cream pie, which I was dying to try). I settled for a slice of the chocolate tea cake, which was deliciously dense, moist, and rich in flavour. Everything was reasonably priced, and it looked like a good place to sit back and relax over a cup of tea. I would definitely go back to try other pastries.

I dreamt of morning buns and sweet pastries with cream and heavenly goodies from Tartine Bakery.  For months I've obssessed with the idea of finding the time to get to this place. And..............DISAPPOINTMENT crashed my world as soon as I had my first bite of my first Tartine pastry:  Chocolate Hazelnut Tart. But I refused to accept that such famed bakeshop was all for nothing.   So, I went back again and again and again............ ********** 1st Visit: (Excitement turned to Disappointment) 1.  CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT TART:  Made with Sharffen berger chocolate. So disappointingly DRY. Lacking in flavor. Where's the chocolate?! I left it alone after 3 bites.  Complete let down! ********** 2nd Visit: (Hopeful but Cautious) 1.  PEACH PUDDING:  Too sweet. Creamy. Fruity. Nothing else. Just okay. 2.  OLIVE BREAD:  This was like a square semi-firm savory bread pudding with plenty of black olives and ham.  Tender and smooth.  Very good and unique.  I was actually still craving this after 3 weeks. *********** 3rd Visit: (Final Decision) 1.CROQUE MONSIEUR: With Turkey.  It's like eating a gourmet pizza or focaccia. Bechamel sauce. gruyere and pleasant taste of fresh thyme. It was very good.   It even came with 2 whole pickled carrots. Cute addition  and complimented the saltiness of the bread.  Was it worth $9.25 for a slice of gourmet bread?  As good as it was, I don't think so! 2.  ROCHER W/ ALMONDS: Like a meringue cookie.  Airy. Light. Good.. Tasted like popcorn.  Not bad for $0.75 but nothing memorable about it either. Overall: There you go, after 3 visits and about $50 worth of pastries later, I guess, it'll be fair for me to say that Tartine serves good pastries but not great.  Sadly, the pastries did not live up to the hype.   Would I go back again?  I definitely will if I'm in the area and if I'm craving their olive bread and ham.  Maybe even the Croque Monsieur but I will think twice before spending $9.25.  Their coffee was just okay--too acidic for my taste. One thing I was able to confirm though--the staff at Tartine were very nice, helpful and friendy. None of those staff with attitudes as some Yelpers experienced.  Tartine is a cute and cozy bakeshop, as San Francisco as you get--bright, hip and happening.

Delicious, mouthwatering buttery croissants you can smell from blocks away. Unfortunately you can also see the the line from blocks away so I had to take away one star for the annoying wait.  I am trying to become a more patient person, but couldn't they open up a Tartine in another neighborhood to spread the love?

Yea.. I'm one of those people that wait in line on a Sunday morning half an hour before it even opens just to get in and get a spot to sit. I love this place. Ham and cheese croissant, smoked Niman Ranch ham, Cowgirl Creamery fromage blanc Croque Monsieur, morning buns, bread pudding, and banana cream tart!! If i could eat here every morning and not gain weight or have to be in the gym after wards for the rest of the day to burn off ALL those calories, I would.

I used to go to the Bay Area a couple of times a year and for various reasons, despite it being at the top of my list for breakfast, always missed out on hitting up Tartine.  I was bound and determined not to miss out this time even if we were being gluttons for punishment after hitting up Monk's Kettle.  My boys and I opted to get everything to-go; even the next day our goodies were delicious. Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies:  Thin, crispy and delicious.  I'm usually picking the soft and thick variety of cookie but these were awesome.  My friend, who always goes for oatmeal chocolate chip, proclaimed them to be the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies he's had and the guys eats a lot of cookies so that's saying a lot. Banana Cream Tart:  This shit is seriously BANANAS! We split this for breakfast the next morning and you couldn't even tell it was a day old.  Crust is a scrumptious puff pastry, not too much butter, with deliciously crunchy layers of thin pastry rising around the perimeter of the tart.  A thin coating of chocolate on the bottom of the puff pastry, a trick for any baker with their salt, kept the pastry from crumbling under the moisture of the cream filling.  Thin slices of banana topped the chocolate and a delicious not-too-sweet custard completed the tart.  Topped off with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and fat shavings of chocolate....mmmmm what a way to start off the morning. Tartine is still on my hit list for the Bay, I feel robbed that I haven't been there for breakfast!  I hope to go there this year and experience their Croque Monsieur, which I hear is glorious; this time I'll make sure that I leave even more room for dessert and another star to update their review.

After the recent release of Julie and Julia, it seems appropriate to review this famed bakery, brought to national prominence by accounts of Julia Child shopping here before she left us. This obviously raised my expectations for my maiden voyage here. The line was not bad with three or four people ahead of us, but it was a weekday morning (I can imagine the madhouse on sunny weekends here). Because of my affinity (aka addiction) to chocolate, my first three selections were reflex action: Scharffenberger Plain Brownie, Scharffenberger Nut Brownie, and Pain Au Chocolate (did someone say Chocolate croissant?), all between $3.00 and $4.00. Just before reaching the cashier, I noticed the baker sliding a hot tray of savory goodies into the display case. Without knowing what it was, I added one to my shopping cart; though it looked like their version of pizza bread, I later learned that it was their vegetarian Croque Monsieur. Since it was still piping hot, I HAD to (devil made my do it) take a few bites before hopping in the car. I must admit it was delicious, as most things are when they first leave the oven. The veggies were perfectly cooked and the bread literally melted in my mouth. As I drove home, I couldn't help but think about the goodies in my trunk. Unfortunately, things did not go as well when we arrived. The Pain Au Chocolate was a bit on the burnt side, which left a bitter taste after I warmed it in the toaster oven. The brownies were pretty good as the nutty one had more character. The disappointment was when I looked at my receipt and discovered that I paid $9.25 for my Croque Monsieur. Yes, it was  substantial. Yes, it came with pickled carrots.  Yes, it was good. But no, I didn't expect it to cost $9.25. In my frugal mood, I might say, "I could have nine Sausage McMuffins from the dollar menu instead." Overall, I'd say that the food is a-ok, perhaps blaming myself for heightened expectations. The price of the last item obviously dropped my jaw and that critical half star from being fan worthy. Maybe I need to come back as a blank sheet of paper.

I am no connoisseur of bakeries but this place takes the cake (a little pun LOL). My sister went crazy and I think she ordered one of everything but I don't even know where to start with the fluffiness and delighfulness that was on my tongue. The quiche, croissant, mousse and bread pudding was absolutely exciting and so fresh. No wonder the line goes out the door. There was also an eclair stacked in the bunch with bavarian cream inside that was so creamy. This is definitely somewhere I would want to visit when I have more time.

After a stressful day at the airport, this sweet-toothed junkie made a beeline for Tartine.  A typical long line greeted me, but nothing would deter me from getting my tarts, cake, and the impossibly perfect croissants.  Rain and sucky weather, but I was happy as a clam since I was in one of my favorite places in San Francisco.  It was my turn.  I heard Fred Astaire singing into my ear, "Heaven, I'm in heaven, And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak."  With darting, greedy eyes, I requested the last almond croissant, a Rocher almond (flaky meringue with toasted almonds), Mexican wedding cookies (aka Russian tea cookies, the best I have had outside of Paris), a slice of passion fruit lime Bavarian cake (gorgeous-looking, lime moistened genoise with passion fruit Bavarian cream topped with thick shavings of coconut), a lemon cream tart, a gougere, and I grabbed a bag of oatmeal currant cookies (more like flaky crisps that just melt in your mouth) at the counter.  Outta control glutton alert!  Yes, I overdid it, but I have a reputation to live up to. As usual, Tartine satisfied my sweet tooth.  Everything is made out of super fine ingredients and they know how to whip cream better than a professional dominatrix.  A dollop of it sits on top of their winning tarts, so definitely get one of those.  The banana cream tart is a must.  Layers of crumbly puff pastry, a polish of chocolate, slices of slippery fresh banana, creamy yet not too sweet custard, finished off with the creamiest whipped cream and sprinkles of chocolate shavings.  The lemon cream tart is also wonderful.  In fact, after also having a delicious lemon bar, I will say that Tartine does lemon desserts with amazing consistency, always mouthwateringly tangy with just a hint of sweetness, like the delicate citrus taste of kumquats and yuzu. As far as cake, try the lemon almond pound cake.  Like I said, they are expert with lemons.  A slice of this is wonderfully tart and sweet at the same time.  If you love hazelnut and dark chocolate like I do, definitely get the opera cake.  It is worth a bullet. The croissants are just incredible.  Flaky and crispy on the outside, the inside is warm, soft, not too buttery, and the whole thing just unravels with perfection.  The almond is my favorite and it sells out fast.  Its presence in your belly means the angels are on your side.  A great second choice is the frangipane--brandy and almonds, delish! Those who enjoy dessert but do not care for sweet items, the bread pudding fits the bill.  It is housemade brioche topped with a swirl of caramel and fresh fruit.  Holy Batman, if you like cheese and bread, you want gougere.  It is a freshly baked ball of bread lined withe gruyere and fresh herbs.  The sandwiches are so good, too.  Their croque Monsieur has a following.  It is an open face sandwich (think of pizza) with gruyere, herbs, topped with smoked ham, Cowgirl Creamery, or shiitake mushrooms and seasonal vegetables.  If you are an early riser, nothing will put a bigger smile on your face then the morning bun.  Essentially a croissant rolled with caramelized sugar, it does this neat trick of being sublimely moist, gooey, and flaky at the same time.  As if that was not enough, a surprise of orange zest makes a jack-in-the-box appearance and you know that Tartine has you good. I have no complaints about service.  Lines move along.  They have always been patient and nice.  Everyone seems happy to be here, and why not, with all the superlative baking, it smells just divine.  No questions, Tartine, I am a lifer.

picture if you will, a very sunny day in SF, people milling on the sidewalks, walking dogs, making out, pheromones in full effect. then picture if you will an outside table of 4 fat girls and one "fat on the inside" girl with a table full of incredibly crafted pastries. the passing of the plates for sampling of the wares was well oiled, not for the faint of heart, not for the weak. we were there to eat, moan orgasmically, and lose all sense of decorum as we fearlessly ate the last bites of the pastries we preferred most, even in one devil may care case, licking the plates clean. i try to imagine what it is like for mere non-fat mortals to walk by a gaggle of hot fat girls stuffing their faces and what they might be thinking to themselves, plebians in our champion court. i could concentrate on this for awhile, if i didn't want to tell you about the fluffy heavenly quiche, a banana tart, wedding cookies, a berry tart, and something or other with cocoa nibs. everything was perfect, beautiful, and delicious. tartine, oh sweet tartine, let us run away to a remote location and make hot sticky sweet love under a shade tree. you got me all messed up, baby.

cute little bakery, seems to be packed most of the time. assortment of sandwiches, pastries, etc... some delicious, some just okay. on a Sunday evening, my cousin and i came here to try some of Tartine's stuff. we got a few items to try out, including Mozzarella & Tapenade sandwich, macaroons, biscotti, oatmeal cookie, and banana tea bread. the Mozarella & Tapenade sandwich was delicious. at first, the $12 seemed a bit too steep to me, but once we got the sandwich i realized it wasn't too bad considering how big it was. definitely bigger than your average panini/hot sandwich. the sandwich was very tasty, and i really liked that even with the cheese, it wasn't too heavy or overbearing to eat. very light and yummy. LOVED the macaroons & banana tea bread. i usually don't like macaroons, but there's are to die for. perfect crispiness on the outside, and just so delicious on the inside. if you're a lover of banana bread like me, try out their version with a bit of a hint of tea. i also love tea infused flavors, so this was definitely a plus for me. as for the rest, the biscotti and oatmeal cookie were just okay. both were kind of bland and boring. definitely will come back next time to grab some treats.

not for the faint of heart... literally.  For Quiche, paninni, or a perfectly crip-buttery crossaint on a gloomy Sunday or sunny Saturday, this place is spot on.  I love Tartine for their cute, polite counter people and yes, I'll say it - the BUTTER!  Everything is richly loaded with it.  Decent coffee that's not great, but never horrible either.. which I would minus a half star if I could.   If Tartine could serve delicious coffee, they could sweep the democratic primaries, find Osama, replace petroleum with their delicious butter and rule the world.  I noze  this.

This has to be some kind of cosmic joke. I went to Tartine for the first time ever today, as it's close to the BF's and we wanted some Kuchen to go with our Kaffee. The 5-star reviews must either be from people on crack, or else people who've never eaten outside the US. The croissants looked over-cooked, the lemon merigue cake thing looked charred & everything else just looked plain unappetising. Maybe they figure that they don't need to bother anymore, as they have enough folks fooled. The BF got the lemon tart  and I had a taste of that and it was totally forgettable. This was his third visit and probably his last, according to him. This is a Swiss man who's a serious foodie. I didn't get anything, which is pretty major for a sweet-tooth like me. If this is meant to be some of the best that SF has to offer, then god help us. 1 star only for so not living up to the hype.

i've been here a few times and ordered something different each time, but overall i think the baked items are too buttery. at times it tasted so buttery that i felt like i should just eat a stick of butter because i couldn't taste the other ingredients. chocolate tea cake my first bite was just butter flavor. i couldn't taste the chocolate at all. i was hoping that was just the butter used to grease the pan, so i gave it another try. the second bite had less butter flavor and some chocolate flavor. the texture was moist, and the density was lighter than a brownie but heavier than a sponge cake. tres leche this was the only item in my memory that had minimal butter taste, and was too sweet. i still haven't had a chance to try their bread, but it is on my list

OK.  Here's the unbiased (minus-couldn't find parking so ima-gonna slammit) review:  Tartine is actually good and prices are reasonable (except bev's-- $3.50 for a SMALL mocha!).  I've lived around the corner for a year+ & been there all times of day, line/no line.  Here's what's wrong aside from that crazy line on the wkds and people taking my parking:  They BURN croissants (and sometimes morning buns)-- various flavors @ various times; you have to watch out when the almond croissant are heavily coated with confectioner's sugar-- a sure Red Flag.  Most of the Savouries w/o ham lack flavor 'cause they'll slather on the bechamel (but if you like that kindof thing...).  COOKIES NEED HELP: Don't make a mexican wedding cookies in the Mission; chocolate chip cookies resemble frico (thin and airy, anti-tollhouse proportions), ganache bites need more BITE (umph! chocolate!)  Here's what's amazing:  Quiche (smoked ham OR shiitake), Gougere, morning bun!!!, Jambon croissant, bread pudding, Scharffenberger pudding; coconut cream anything-- Did I say Gougere? Chewy and crisp on the outside, pillowy and rich on the semi-hulled inside... Throw some scrambled eggs, gruyere &roquette into one of those and you've got yourself a fiesta frances... Destination patrons, here's a tip: Point to what you want then check it; if they give you something wack ask for something else- Empower yourself, you just waited 20 minutes!

Understand why they are so popular---baked goods are amazing but until someone figures out how to manage the space/table issues the place is a boiling point for someone to freakout when they have their big coffee bowl and fresh pastry and no where to sit.  It is a low blood sugar meltdown waiting to happen.

The must-haves:     ---morning buns: can't get them anywhere else.  Haven't eaten anything like this before.  Is it like a cinnamon roll or is it like a croissant?  It is as delicious as it is schizo.       ---Banana cream tart:  I don't like banana in desserts, or banana cream pies.  But since everyone raves about it, I gave it a try.  Wow.  It is no ordinary tart.  The cream is light and airy, pairs perfectly with the lightly sweet bananas in a nice crusty tart.  Everything together is just perfect.  Quite large, good for sharing.     ---Banana bread pudding: another dessert that funkily features bananas.  I tried bananas in my homemade bread pudding because of Tartine and it was awful.  Tartine manages to make it so rich and tasty.  Why is my banana bread pudding weird and tangy?     ---Chocolate cake: chocolate cake is usually the last thing I'd order since it's so boring.  But my friend brought me a piece of Tartine chocolate cake once and it was really delicious.  Now I measure all chocolate cakes against Tartine's simple yet perfect chocolate cake. The secondary-choices:     ---Opera cakes:  they are good.  But I have had equally good ones at Cafe Cocola.  And I am still waiting for an opera that tops or matches the one from my favorite cafe in Lyon, France.  My friend and I were inspired to open up our own Opera cafe that sells nothing but Operas.  So it's a pretty high bar to meet.     ---Hazelnut tart:  has that nutty fragrance but slightly on the dry side.       ---Pumpkin tea cake: so I mistakenly thought it means it had tea in it.  But it's just a pumpkin pound cake sorta thing.  Delicious?  Yes.  Extraordinary? Go to the must-haves list.     ---I bought my husband their macaroons and scones.  He said they were good, but never asked for them again, so I assume they weren't magical.  Actually he said the macaroon he had at Google was the best he's had.  Not sure how to take that.     ---Lemon tart.  I have never liked any lemon dessert, so this was not my favorite.  But if you like that extreme tartness from citrus-y fruit, you might enjoy their lemon tart. The to-be-skipped:     ---nope, I haven't tried any desserts there that should be skipped.  But the coffee here isn't all that great.  Kind of a shame since it's really nice to have a cup of strong coffee to off set the sweetness of the desserts.  However, their chai latte is quite good.

The line for Tartine is guaranteed to always be there when you are really hungry or hungover and are dying for a delicious pastry or cheesy greasy baked good.  While the line does not serve any food, there is a really tempting smell coming from the exhaust fans, which makes you salivate for about 35 minutes as you are all but forced to watch the pastry chefs roll out dough, pull sheets of fresh treats out of the oven and cover things in sugar.  O, what fun!  By the time you actually get inside, sometimes you have ingested enough air-borne butter from the fans that you arent hungry.  But my inner fat kid just tells me to order something anyway, you earned it!!!

I'm sorry, I have given it two more chances and just do not enjoy the food. I had a yogurt and muesli thing that was totally flavorless - neither ingredient being tasty (and I do like good plain yogurt). I also had a few cookies that looked incredible but were super boring. And I believe I also had a chocolate croissant that was good but nowhere near worth waiting in line and dealing with the clerks who either lose track constantly of who they are serving or serve multiple people at once without explaining that they're waiting on your items from the back (or whatever).

You ever been with a dude who is fine and he knows he fine?!?!  Well that's Tartine in a nutshell. I'm going to keep it real.  You good, but seriously, you ain't that good...recognize! We came here labor day weekend (yeah, I'm lagging) because quite frankly my hubs has a slight addiction to this place.  I, not being a breakfast or a line (yes, expect it) person, had yet to try this place.  Typically, we would just do drive-bys before dropping him off to work so he could get his fix on BUT I finally caved because you would have to have the IQ of Jessica Simpson not to notice the following they have here (jus sayin).   So we actually got there before it opened and that got us about third in line (real talk).  To the homeboy who tried to avoid the line and swoop in front of me...don't do that.  My hubs naturally wasn't having it and took care of you right quick so take that as a learning lesson.  Unfortunately, the clientele are not the only ones that are rude and pretentious.  The guy at the counter nearly overcharged us and the hubs had to correct him and when we handed him a bill, he actually got an attitude.  Complaining it was too early for that.  Seriously, because we will gladly take our bill somewhere else which was what we were about to do when they decided to take it (that's right).   On to the grub.  I ordered the Banana Tart that everyone raves about and a Rocher with almond.  The hubs ordered the bread pudding and the morning bun.  Banana Tart was a major disappointment.  Center was aiight but the crust was so freaking hard.  I mean I was struggling with my fork to cut into it.  While we are on the subject of hard (don't go there) , the morning buns my hubs swears by was like a rock.  I was finna have a bf (umm, bitch fit) when I took a bite of the hubs bread pudding.    Ah, and their it was.  The taste I was looking for.  It's damn good.  I admit it.  I'm not even a fan of bread pudding, until now.  The Rocher with almond was sweet goodness too.  I just don't know if it's worth the line or the attitude.  Since I'm a believer in second chances (yeah right, it's so the bread pudding) I will give it another go but not on a weekend and not at peak hours.  But like that fine guy, I will kick you to the curb, so watch it Tartine!

This place always has a long line of people that extends out of the door and to the next builing most of the time, but I tell you it's worth the wait.  This bakery/cafe offers a variety of delectible, savory and delicious baked goods, but it has the best BANANA CREAM PIE that I have ever tasted.  Flaky, creamy and amazingly delicious.  One of the best desert places that I have ever been.

Tartine is officially getting an extra star from me because of their Almond Croissants. Christ they're good, I can't believe anyone would bother recommending the chocolate ones. Before I sat down to gorge my face with the almond ones at a friend's brunch I was severely mislead by whoever recommended the chocolate ones. Damn them, extra star for Tartine.

Absolutely the best pastries & baked goods in the city. Everything I've had has been 100% deliciousness and could hold its own against any bakery in the world. Others have said plenty about the food. But I have given up on Tartine. There is absolutely NO REASON why it should be such an ordeal to patronize this fine establishment. It once took me 30 minutes to get a sandwich. Usually, getting a pastry and an expresso takes at least 10 minutes if there's any sort of a line. Then, there's never anywhere to sit and getting from the regsiter to the door is an American Gladiators-style gauntlet. Instead of just complaining, I'm offering these suggestions. 1. remove the counter along the window, no one ever stands there even when the place is really crowded. put some 2-person tables! 2. move the self-serve coffee urn out of the corner, just put it on the bar in front of the espresso machine. 3. push the big pastry case back towards the kitchen to open up another foot of floor space. 4. I know you're supposed to bus your own table, but not everyone does and there's usually at least a couple tables that are unusable because dishes have piled up. Tartine needs a busperson. 5. They have two cash registers, but no dedicated cashiers. There should be two people who do nothing but work the registers. That's probably the biggest thing, the slowness of conducting the actual transaction. 6. a wider lane from the register to the door. it's impossible to get through there without body checking someone. 7. scratch #3, they should move the pastry case to the window along 18th street, so you come in the door, move past the goodies, tell them what you want, then order your coffe drink, pay at the register and follow along the south wall back to the door. this way, people would circulate counter-clockwise along the perimeter of the room with tables in the middle. Tartine, if you at least make some sort of effort to improve service and efficiency, I will gladly buy lots of pastries from you, especially the ham-and-cheese croissants.

OK....I visited my sister up in SF and saw the line for this place and read a few yelps and decided i had to go. It was only 4 blocks from her house and I do like me a good pastry! I got the morning bun, the chocolate croissant, the almond croissant and a brownie. Everything was burnt. Like black on top and bottom. Super crunchy...aren't croissants supposed to be pleasantly fluffy? Well this wasn't. On top of that each item was like $5-6...ya...you can choose between a complete sit down breakfast meal at some nearby cafe with waiter service and hot food prepared especially for you or get 2 charred black croissants after waiting in a line for 20 minutes. The brownie was good (but heck I can make a good brownie). I honestly want to give it only 2 stars...but I don't know if I can be that mean. (ok, wait, I did it.). Until i have a good pastry from this place which may be a long time from now, two stars. Boom. I would like to go back and give it a second shot but for now I am going to say that this place is all hype. Noe Bakery just up the hill is more better.

I'm with Michael E on this one. I finally gathered up the courage to wait in the 20 minute line to try a dessert and grab some coffee. I tried their Mango/Coconut tart and had a double cap. Coffee was fine and the tart was ok. I'd love to try more of their stuff, they had so many tasty looking things. However, I think the hype and wait for this place is a bit out of control...I can't deal.

OFFICIAL RESTRAINING ORDER This document hereby states the aforementioned yelper is no longer allowed within *100* yards of this eating establishment after a prolonged history of unwanted and untoward behavior directed at this bakery that can only be described as somewhere between obsessive and perverted.  Yelper agrees to participate in a class titled "Healthy Relationships: What is and is not stalking according to California law."  Furthermore, Yelper agrees to close his Etsy page selling voodoo likenesses of their signature products including the Morning Bun and ham/cheese croissants.  In exchange, bakery agrees to try and make their baked goods less tantalizing and tempting, especially in the early hours of morning when the aromas of butter and sugar permeate the thick SF coastal fog.  Also, bakery agrees to affix a warning label to every baked good sold on the premises, stating "WARNING: This baked good has been known to cause unpredictable and erratic behavior in otherwise normally-functioning humans.  Side effects include daydreaming about the infinite layers of buttery crumb of a warm croissant, and an inability to stop muttering words like "gooey" and "sweet" and "I want this now or I will cut you."   Yelper agrees that if restraining order is violated, punishment will be to eat a Costco muffin.

OMG OMG OMG!!! I had the best lemon tart ever!! Granted, the line for the bakery was out the door but it was worth the wait. The lemon custard was thick, tart, and savory.  The whip cream on top .. ohhhhh one taste and you know it didn't come from a can..The open face sandwiches were also pretty good.  Service was quick and friendly. Its pretty pricey but one bite and you know its worth every cent.

Fartine, that's what I call it. The staff often treats you like you just farted and the line is so obnoxiously long that it's humorous. There are better pastries at better prices out there. The bread is pretty scrumptious however. Just order ahead. Last time I was there there were two kids running around the inside area, and licking the length of the pastry case. The staff ( and parents) said/did nothing.

Over priced, over rated, bad service, and not worth the hype. This seriously has to be one of the most over rated places to eat in the city.   I have many many MANY gripes with this place.  First of all, it's like this place was made for women ages 20-28.  Look at the reviews above and below me, did you notice that about 95% of them were from women.  It's not a big deal, but whatever.... What's important is that the food isn't really that great.  Anything that has to be prepared (e.g. the sandwiches) takes a good hour before the androgynous hipster will bring you your food.  Which will undoubtedly suffer from one or both of two perils, it's cold or slathered with a pound of dijon mustard. The pastries are ho hum, I've had some that are kick ass, but I've also had some that I had to spit out right away. As with a lot of things in the mission these days, the hype is way too much to handle and ultimately the restaurant just doesn't deliver.

Croissants cost $2.75 and chocolate croissant $3.25.  The bakery has just found a way to reduce the endless line of customers.  Unless it's due to one of the rudiest and unpleasant service in the city. Does the job description for waiters and cashiers require them to be obnoxious and discourteous? This place is nothing like France...I know what I am talking about, I lived for 30 years in France.  Not that the service is always better in France but nowhere in France will people wait so long to pay so much for so little.  Never in my life have I seen a 30 minutes wait to get a piece of bread or a croissant.  So yes the food is somehow good but not worth the wait, the price and the always disagreeable service. A few words on the almond croissant, it is nothing close to the fabulous version we can find at Bay bread and all their bakeries. Tartine's almond croissant has no filling and is slightly burnt and dry.  It now costs $3.25, what a joke. Another reason for one star, this place often runs out of croissant early in the morning, they run out of bread very quickly after releasing them from the hot oven.  They have many waiters at the counter but often only one behind the cashier so people just wait with the food lining up behind the cashier.  At one point I have seen the entire store full of customers just waiting to pay.  These problems are not new and the manager/owner doesn't seem to be worried about it.  They could have a fast line or something, no they prefer to keep their customers wasting their time in line.  Once I tried to give the exact change to the waiter after ordering a pastry but she insisted I had to go to the cashier before paying and before getting my pastry.  They are simply careless about their customers and the great food doesn't appeal to me anymore because of that.

YUM. I adore Tartine Bakery, with their Weight-Watchers-Unfriendly goodies and that delicious smell of things baking. I am rapidly expanding from my current addiction, the frangipan croissant. My last dangerous obsession was the bread pudding and before that, the chocolate hazelnut tart. I am sending them my lipo bill, but before I do that, could one more Humboldt Fog sandwich really hurt? Their quiche, pastrami sandwich, and croque monsieur are all excellent, too! And there are usually cute boys to watch while you eat at the outside tables.

Don't go expecting an egg and bacon breakfast but if you're craving bread pudding or a delicious pressed sandwich from this upscale patisserie and cafe then you're in luck. Mission residents line up around the block for what's on hand here. Try the buttery scone with currants or the $6 chocolate hazelnut tart. YUM. You can also get Tartine bread as a starter at neighbor Delfina and if you try Radio Africa & Kitchen at Coffee Bar it's served up with edamame and eggplant spread.

I've been afraid to write my review for this place because i was the person that waited in line on a beautiful san francisco day and took the last two banana cream tarts. I know the people behind me were giving me the evil eye.  But I'm sorry I had to do it.  It's every man and woman for themselves.  You have to be selfish when it comes to the banana cream tarts. I can only ask you to forgive me and that time will heal.  But i have to say it's worth it. That banana cream tart was super duper fresh. It hit the spot! Especially since i'm a banana lover. Just one bite of the flaky crust and chocolate and your mouth will already be covered with custard and fresh bananas.    I ended up sharing the bread pudding with my friends, but if i had a choice i will disown my friends and eat that whole bread pudding myself.  It was warm and gooey and went well with the berries.  I think i will like to spend a whole afternoon here, and try everything o their menu. But first i must work on expanding my stomach.

Oh, Tartine, how I miss you so. I came here during a trip out west to visit a friend in SF. The pastries were AMAZING, it was just THAT good. Come here hungry and order to your hearts content. Trust me, your eyes will be bigger than your stomach and odds are you'll order more than you can safely consume (but you'll consume it anyway because it's so. freaking. awesome.) It gets super crowded and odds are you'll have to wait on line but it's definitely worth it. On a 4 day trip to SF, I came here 3 times. My friend brought some of their fresh baked bread back to NY and he's savoring every last crumb. You just can't get anything like it in NYC. Tartine, I'll definitely be back the next time I visit SF - it's a must!

Let's just start with I will and have stood in line  outside in the rain for 30 min or more just to get my tarts and pastries from Tartine.  My favorite thing here is the banana cream tart and the surprising thing with that is that I'm not even a fan of bananas but the chocolate that they use at Tartine is soooo good that it just makes this tart. Which means the chocolate croissant is super yummy, or anything else with the chocolate.  The open face sandwiches are also very good if you are not looking for something sweet but my go to for something non sweet here is the ham and cheese croissant, it's flaky, savory, and just perfect!  I must visit even if it's just to take and go.

**Cue Homer Simpson Voice** mmmmmmmm......breeeeaaaad puuuudddinggg (drool dribbling from mouth on to chin) Seriously, if you haven't been to Tartine you should get your butt over there - but do it early because the line is known to wrap around the block. My friend and I got lucky enough to snag a table right when we walked in but we had to fight off hoards of hungry couples rolling their strollers over our toes. I doubt you can go wrong with anything that you order here but as you can tell from my opening line, the bread pudding is off the hook delicious - it's more "eggy" than "bready" and is stuffed full of sweet cranberries. Pair it with a latte and you'll be in pure morning bliss.

I don't suppose there is much left to say about Tartine. Amazing pastries. I went on a dessert binge last week and almost came in my pants. I had the bread pudding (with seasonal fruits... peaches and berries when I got it): delicious. Then I could not refrain from trying a croissant (the French genes kicking in...), and I wasn't disappointed: flaky on the outside but buttery and moist on the inside... one of the better croissants I've had outside of France. I also got a taste of the chocolate pudding: very rich but delicious too. Expect a long line at pretty much anytime of day (but it's worth the wait), and you'll be lucky if you get a table. But it's only a block or two from Dolores Park if you want to get your pastries to go.

Update (02/11/07): Lines are still exasperatingly long, but I've discovered two new loves one savory one sweet I think this justifies the addition of an extra star. Finally got a chance to try the country bread loaf and to my luck it was just coming out of the oven. Yes I love it when things are perfectly timed. I had some camembert in the fridge and just slathered it on the loaf, it was the best midnight snack. My second love is the rocher, ordered mostly out of necessity as most of the sweets were gone and the pickings were slim. It was good but I would recommend just one as the sweetness can get overpowering. Original Review (8/19/06): I used to love coming here, that is until I had strategize and devise a scheme just to find a decent seat with my buddy. It's a bakery, so why should I have to act like I'm in a 007 flick just to sit for 10-15 minutes? Yes I definitely don't like the complacent folks that sit around hogging seats for those that don't intend to stay there long. I can't justify standing in line for 20 minutes either. But I'm going off on some bitter tangent. Here's what I love about  tartine: It's a slice of France in the mission. The sharffenberger is a must try, the epitome of chocolate goodness. The tarts vary depending on the seasons, I lean towards the late summer/fall seasons when you can order a persimmon or pomegranate tart with a warm cup of coffee.  I also liked the passion fruit/coconut bavarian, and for the savory side try the croque-monsieur or butter croissants. I recommend going in the afternoon on a weekday when it is less likely to be packed. If it's a nice day out then do what i do, take it to go, and walk towards Dolores park.

While Tartine Bakery is definitely tasty, I'm not always in the mood for the hectic and crowded mayhem that greets you on a typical weekend at this fine establishment. Yes, the food is good, but is it really worth the 40 minute wait and mad rush to find a table? Not so sure. For those that haven't had the luxury of visiting "San Francisco's best bakery", know that you are in for a treat, but come at your own risk. The lines are INSANE and once you get your food, good luck finding a place to sit! I've now paid four homages to Tartine. The first time was on a week day after work, when I came to pick up a loaf of their freshly baked pain au levain. Apparently it comes out of the oven around 5. I was there by 5:30 and I got one of the last loaves. ..which are huge by the way. I also enjoyed two different flavors of meringue type cookies- one with cocoa nibs and the other a delicious almondy concoction. The second time I went to Tartine was on a Saturday morning around 11. And of course the lines were out the door. I had a lovely soy latte and the apple bread pudding. Their bread pudding is made with brioche. Why they can't sell this divine bread on it's own is beyond me. My third visit was again on a Saturday morning, but this time I was pleasantly surprised- at 10:30 I would have expected more chaos. Instead, the line was only slightly out the door, and it took only 15 minutes or so to order.  I tried the berry bread pudding, pain au chocolat, and banana cream tart. The pain au chocolat was buttery, flaky, and brimming with soft chunks of dark chocolate. The bread pudding was, of course, stellar, and the banana cream tart was amazing (although I was on such a sugar high from the first two delicacies, I didn't eat much of it). Most recently I went to try their famous frangipane almond croissant. And now I understand why it is famous and why you'd better get there early to ensure you get one. This pastry is one of the richest, most decadent and buttery creations imaginable. Even better than the pain au chocolat, whose taste I had previously thought to be insurmountable. The crispy, flaky, buttery delicacy is filled with an almond paste and topped with thinly sliced almonds. To summarize Tartine is an excellent and well frequented bakery, I'll be going back, although if I chose to return on a weekend, I'll prepare myself for a long wait.

Came here by everyone's recommendation since they all know we love bread.  Tuesday at lunchtime saw no line.  We ordered a regular croissant, a chocolate pain (croissant stuffed with bitter chocolate), and their two signature dishes: the bread pudding and the morning bun.  The morning bun was like a scone or something that was drowned in sugar and orange zest.  Good but a bit much.  Surprisingly, we liked the croissant and chocolate pain better than the two signature dishes at Tartine, although admittedly,the two dishes were creative, different.  Maybe we're just old-fashioned and like the basics.  Do something basic well, and you got us hooked.

Tartine is a favorite of mine- a real diamond in the Mission's very charming and culturally rich neighborhood.  They are open 12 hrs/day 8am to 8pm and there is a constant flow of locals that try to time their visits to avoid the lines (which are evident at 8:05am on Sat/ Sun mornings).  My favs include the coffee (yes it's that good), croissants (plain and almond), fresh juices - which run out quickly- but rest assured that in a few moments there will be another batch of fresh goodies emerging from the magical ovens. Their quiche, croque monsieur, bread pudding and tarts are all top-notch.  I love their angled ceiling mirror that gives you just enough of a glimpse behind the scenes as items flow from oven to cooling-rack to display window to your plate in seconds!   Best new discovery- the Rocher with cocoa nibs (a meringue with a caffeine kick that pairs perfectly with their coffee) Ambiance: Well lit with huge windows, outside seating in limited, silverware and paper napkins Cost: $12-15

Don't be afraid of the lines as you will not find a better morning bun in San Francisco. I've been trying other morning buns everywhere I could find them and nothing compares.  Definitely worth it. We met a couple here who happened to be visiting from Chicago, chatted with them initially because of limited seating, but ended up making great connections. Great bakeries will do that for you: instant foodie connections to the people who love good baked goods.

With 1000 reviews already in place, I know I will just be echoing everyone else's sentiments:  THIS PLACE ROCKS MY WORLD!!!  I can't seem to walk out of there without a box of pastries (that I reluctantly share) and something in my hand to munch on while I exit because standing in line and smelling all that baked goodness is enough to make me ravenously hungry!  I love the seasonal bread puddings - always moist, tender and perfectly sweetened.  The open-faced croque monsieur  is positively delicious (almost a religious experience for me).  The scharffenberger chocolate pudding is rich without being cloying.  Those morning buns have a way of putting me in a super good mood.  I don't know that you can have a bad anything at tartine, so just pick anything up and walk yourself over to Dolores Park to relax and enjoy the fact that Tartine exists to make us these tasty treats!

I try to be a good guest when I am invited to dinner parties; I bring the host some desert from Tartine Bakery.  Chocolate mousse, chocolate pudding and banana crème tart are great for sharing after dinner. Tartine Bakery is famous with its croissants too. On a warm day, I love stopping by here to pick up croissants and coffee, walk over to Dolores Park for some people watching and enjoy my picnic. Some of my friends love their 5pm freshly baked walnut bread. I will recommend that if you do not mind the wait. Parking is horrible in this neighborhood.

its only a bakery you may say. or how good can bread, quiche, or tarts really be? keep saying that while you stand in line slowly inching your way into a indiscernible corner shop. take one bite out of a melt in your mouth gougere or the infamous morning bun and you will understand. so good you will forgive the 20 minute wait in line. besides this, a melange of french pastries can be found along with sandwiches and breads. try and grab a table, but be prepared to wait. personally, i've found there is no dignified way in eating the giant sticky morning bun other than employing a plate and fork. it's a giant puff of buttery layers, laced with cinnamon, and delicate hints of orange zest, quite delicious, still i prefer la farine's crisper, cleaner version. prices are on the higher side, but all items come in gigantic proportions. if you're inclined to try something savory, the olive bread was unlike any other. a thick slice, eggy and soft at the same time, it reminded me of a savory bread pudding. really, i don't think you can go wrong with any of the selections.  the one thing i do not enjoy here are the cookies. very thin, flat, and crispy, made with quality ingredients but a bit too crispy for my liking. i could rant on about the quiches, tarts, bread pudding, croissants, bread, and more but i've probably gained 5 lbs just from writing this. go see for yourself. now.

Tartine definitely has an impressive reputation, I'd heard of it before even moving to SF! Still, the idea of spending an hour or more of my weekend waiting in line isn't very appealing so I hadn't been until yesterday. Well I wasn't the least bit disappointed! There wasn't a single item in the pastry case that didn't look incredibly yummy. I settled for a really excellent piece of chocolate cake and the pressed pastrami sandwich, although the croque monsieur was incredibly tempting. I wasn't a fan of the ridiculous amount of horseradish on my sandwich, but my companion's ham sandwich was seriously tasty. The thick, soft, bread they use is just perfect. Next time it's definitely another sweet treat and the croque monsieur for me!

Def. one of the best places to get pastries around. But I was with my old boss the other day and he's like "I just want to tell the owners that if they they would work faster they could get more people in and wouldn't have to raise prices all the time." He's got a point. I mean, I'll give it up for Tartine- even $4.00 for their plain croissant! But come onnnnnn. Why the hell is everyone there so slow? I was in there last week with an industry friend and we were seriously shocked at how shabby the staff was. I've also heard they don't pay well, which would explain a lot. However, speaking quality, Tartine is the shit and can do whatever they want....and probably will continue to do so.

So. Good. Worth every minute in line, the high prices, and crappy service. The almond croissant is warm, buttery goodness. I enjoyed it more than the morning bun. Love that they have turkey and veggie croque monsieur variations for those of us who don't eat ham. My turkey croque was premade and not re-heated; it could have been better had the cheese been freshly melted. I wanted to try the spicy turkey sandwich, but sandwiches take 15-20 minutes to make (no thanks!). Not a fan of the bread pudding- it was too egg-y tasting and there was barely any fruit in it. 4 stars despite this because that almond croissant is amazing.

I realise it's kind of ridiculous to review Tartine, but I feel I should point out how AMAZING the morning buns are, just in case you really needed a 15,000th person to confirm that fact before you were willing to try.  The lines on a weekend are insane.  Try to go before work on a weekday.  I realise this takes commitment.  Alternatively, you could, like me, just rent an apartment less than three blocks away.  Commitment, schmommitment.

Shopping List:   2 -  4" Frangipane Tarts:     $12.50   1 - 10" Tres Leches Cake:  $62.00 We rode in an uncomfortably packed J-Line Muni, and got off on Church & 18th Street.  Chilled from the cold and windy walk from the stop to the bakery, we decided to order some tea and relax before purchasing the highly anticipated baked goods.  After a few sips we realized the staff was starting to close up for the day.  I went to the cashier and before I could say anything, she said with a saccharin smile, "We're closed." "Oh, can we still buy a cake?" I asked. She flippantly responded, "Not really.  We've been closed for 10 minutes." Instead of leaving with tarts and a cake, we left with a full dose of sour service.  Don't let the waitress's red hair and porcelain-like skin fool you.  She delivers service like KGW: Kim-chi Gone Wrong.  As though forced to drink vinegar all day, she was quite ripe with fermented rudeness.  The café not only lost $74.50 in potential sales, it lost any hope of us returning or recommending the place to our friends, family and fellow yelpers.  Should o' gone to Bi Rite!

On a recent trip to S.F., I made a special trip to Tartine based on the rave reviews on Yelp, standing in line outside the bakery in the cold. I really didn't taste what all the fuss was about. The pastries are pretty, but in no way to they compare in flavor and texture to the fine confections served at any of the neighborhood boulangeries near my flat in Paris. The croissants didn't have the same chewiness and bite. The tarts didn't have the balance of flavor. And the bread pudding was just okay. Everything was pretty pricey too, and it's so hard to get a table there.

i love tartine for the meringes with toasted almonds in them.  they are delicious and chewy and if you love sugar, they really hit the spot. the problem with this place is that i find the baked goods to be too heavy.  bf and i shared a croque monsieur and half of a chocolate croissant and we just felt so gross and bloated after!  i think the croissant weighed 5 lbs. this place is delicious, but not for the butter and dairy shy. for lighter fare, go to la boulange for similar food.

Tartine, your line is crazy ridiculously long during brunch hours but I can understand why people would subject themselves to all the waiting.  I came here with two of my gal pals and we each decided to let our eyes do the ordering.  Our strategy-- one sweet, one salty, all different items so we could have a taste of everything.  Out of everything we ordered, our favorite sandwich hands down was their croque monsieur with vegetables and my favorite dessert was the banana creme tart.  My only slight complaint was that the bread on our sandwiches were a tad over burnt.  In spite of that, the food was still fucking awesome.  I can't wait to come back!

There is no need for more mention of Tartine's myriad annoyances so I'm basing this review solely on its positive attributes. Like the bread pudding, which is only sometimes too soggy, and the morning buns, which are only sometimes supported by a coaster of burnt syrup, and the sopressata, fontina, broccoli rabe pesto sandwich that is so so good and packs a wonderfully spicy wallop in every other bite. But the main attraction at Tartine for me is the idiazabal and membrillo sandwich, which is inconsistent but is the only dish to incorporate membrillo that I have ever found since being introduced to the stuff. I prefer to pair membrillo with manchego, but the idiazabal is a fine substitute and really, being served membrillo makes me so happy that they could give it to me on a cracker and I'd be thrilled. One word of warning: watch out for the gougeres. I don't know if the Tartine version is a warped version of a good thing but I've purchased these several times in the hopes of biting into a crispy ball of peppery cheesiness only to be stuck with a burnt ball of crust with a soggy base of wet dough. Despite the painful weekend lines and other minor irritations, I'm glad Tartine is there when I need it. edited after my return to Tartine after an eight month separation: Cake aux olives. Get it. Not only did I not have to wait for even a minute for a table but something pushed me to try this for the first time and it was worth it a million times over. Not too wet and eggy, just perfectly cooked with pieces of olives and pancetta. I also must pay some lip service to the previously neglected scones, which are the only ones I've ever had coated in rock sugar and consequently are the best I've ever had as well.

Yes, I know the service here sucks big donkeys but the baked goodies are transcendent!  I LOVE their eclairs, lemon tarts, rochers, morning buns, seasonal bavarians, and savory quiches!  It makes me so sad that I live down in the 'burbs where no bakery even comes close.  Back when I lived in the city, I would happily spend 30-45 minutes circling the block for parking and then wait in line for another 30 minutes.  I never cared if the servers were snappish and rude because whatever I was ordering would make everything better.  Sigh.

Everybody loves a french bakery!  How can you resist all those pastry delicacies in the windowed case? You can't.  This is one of SF's really good frenchy bakeries, of which we seem to have a growing number (thanks in part to Bay Bread).  I tried the pastrami pressed sandwich which was very large, nicely crusted on the outside and filled with lots of gruyere, pastrami and a spicy dijon horseradish mustard.  Whenever I go to a french bakery, I always get a few extra things to take home with me and so I also got a slice of quiche lorraine and a croissant filled with ham and cheese to go, both excellent.  I can certainly see why this place has collected 100 reviews already.  Nice outdoor seating and credit card friendly too.

Wow, I just realized I've never written a review for the amazing Tartine. What is wrong with me? This is the most heavenly baker I have EVER been to. I have not had one thing from Tartine that hasn't knocked my socks off. Really and truely. Their croissants are the kind that when bringing them home the bag arrives soaked with butter (nothing is better than a yummy buttery croissant). All of their pies, cakes, tarts, quiches, etc. are just amazing. If I lived closer to Tartine, I would be one fat lady. Love it!

I have to agree with the other one star reviews - the food is good but not worth the trouble.  Fighting rude patrons some with strollers who are pushing their way in completely ignoring the fact there is a line and you can't move forward so stop pushing the stroller into my ankles before I kick it.  Get to the counter to deal with rude staff who think they are doing you a favor by charging exorbitant rates for baked goods and sandwiches. Fighting to get some space to stand while waiting on order.  Fighting your way back out and trying to decide if you should stoop on the curb and eat since there is no where to sit  or if you do find a space inside, you get elbowed and bumped the entire time you are eating.  The food is not that great.  Another Mission establishment that is more hype and kept alive by people who think they are cool.

Not much to say here that hasn't already been said.  Tartine is a marvelous French bakery.  Their bread pudding is delicious as are the croque monsieurs (open-faced French grilled cheese sandwiches) and the quiche.  Not the cheapest bite around, but definitely one of the tastiest.  Best to go early am or after lunch.

I don't get the hype...at all. I went on a saturday for brunch, but ended up having a late lunch instead.  It took quite a while to find parking (to be expected of course), but this review is not based on the impossible parking, only the food and service.   Perhaps Tartine's reputation has grown bigger than what it really is.  And now, it's just mediocre food and poor service. The line inside wasn't too bad, but the service needs to be bumped up. No one said hi.  Everyone just kept asking me what I wanted, over and over.  I kept thinking, can you give me a darn minute?!  Nope.  They couldn't.  They just moved on to the person behind me.   I ended up ordering the pastrami and the spicy turkey pressed sandwiches.  The pastrami had way too much horseradish that it became inedible.  The spicy turkey was very good.  They were actually very big, which I didn't know before ordering.  One could have easily been shared between 2 people.   For dessert, we ordered the banana creme tart.  Very good, but the crust was too hard to break with a fork. My entire bill was almost $40 - 2 pressed sandwiches, 1 tart, 1 small sparkling lemonade.  Was it worth it?  Not so much. I was also irked because Tartine does not have any mention of its establishment from the outside.  As a first-time visitor, it was a little difficult to see where they were since they don't have a sign.

So lots and lots of folks on Yelp have mentioned the customer service issues at Tartine.  Here's my latest: I go in on a Monday for a loaf of bread.  The line to order baked goods is at least 8 deep.  I just want a loaf of bread, and if they are sold out then I don't want anything else.  Once I finally get to the front of the line, I am told "we don't make bread on Mondays, sorry".  So I turn around and go. Tuesday.  I go to get a loaf of bread.  The line to order baked goods is at least 10 deep.  I just want a loaf of bread, and if they are sold out then I don't want anything else.  Once I finally get to the front of the line, I am told "we don't make bread on Tuesdays, sorry".  So I turn around and go. The girl that told me they don't sell bread on Mondays was really so lazy that she couldn't have added "or Tuesdays" to the end of her sentence!??  That's just mean. Wednesday, I go in for a loaf of bread.  The line to order baked goods is at least 12 deep.  I just want a loaf of bread, and if they are sold out then I don't want anything else.  Ten minutes later I finally get to the front of the line, I am told "we are sold out of bread, sorry".  So I turn around and go (and watch a guy pull 2 dozen loaves out in a wagon). Would it really KILL the counter staff to every once in a while say "Just an FYI for the people in line, we are sold out of bread!"  Better yet, let's get some six sigma going in this joint and have a little sign on the front door that says "All out of bread" that could simply be flipped around as soon as the final loaf is sold! Turns out you need to call and reserve a loaf in advance- I'm not kidding.  But of course the counter person didn't mention that, either.  Two stars instead of one because of the 5 star pastries.

All  I can say is that I'm glad I don't live near Tartine.  If I was near this place more often, I'd probably be morbidly obese and suffer from clogged arteries and diabetes.  Regardless of this, if eating their buttery and delicious croissants led to my death, I'd definitely die a happy man.  Seriously, it'd be a shame to live life without tasting the bliss that comes out of Tartine's ovens...

After hearing all the raves about Tartine, my wife, who is French, convinced me to take her there. We went for the bread, which is described as Country French. The line was long, the music playing was so loud you could hardly talk to anyone and the ambiance was forced French (tres pretentious). We had two disciples on line in front of us, raving about how wonderful the bread was. We actually were very excited. The counter person finally took our order, in a manner which was borderline rude and uncaring. When we asked to see the bread that he had already packed, he reluctantly showed us the masterpiece, which was burnt on the outside. When I asked him for another bread, he said that this was the way they were made, and there was a French word for the method, but he couldn't remember the word! Well, as feared, when we ripped open the bread outside of Tartine, the inside dough was not properly cooked. It was also sourdough, which doesn't exist in France. This bread is not French!!! We've learned our lesson, and will stick with good, old Baker's of Paris for the closest thing to French bread we have around here.

lovelovelove in the form of pastries & open faced sandwiches. the perfect place to have lunch and dessert all at once. (eat outdoors if you can). and then walk down to delfina & bi-rite creamery for dinner and dessert. this has got to be the yummiest street in all of san francisco. you can't go wrong with any of the chocolate desserts, and it is blasphemous not to order the banana cream tart. thanks for never being busy (but always tasty!) when i go :).

my friend brought me here once for lunch and yes, packed, but we got a seat right away. there is a fast turnaround as long as you're not waiting for the table where there's a guy with a full cup of coffee, a half eaten tart and a book in his hand. we both had the sandwiches, and it was dee-lish-ous! it was a fork and knife sandwich and i was so stuffed i didn't have room for dessert ... at that time. i bought a dozen of different items and shared it with the coworkers. oh and this place is really close to dolores park, so on a sunny day, why not take your food to go if there are no seats?

I thought I'd give this place another shot and once again it underwhelmed me. The bread pudding was cold and spongy with no real wow factor to it. The croissant was not as flaky/soft as what you'd expect from a top notch bakery. I honestly just don't understand what all the hype is all about?

#25 of 100 on 7x7's The Big Eat SF 2009: Loaf of bread straight out of the oven at Tartine (bonus: sliced while still warm and slathered with Brillat- Savarin cheese from Bi-Rite, down the block) http://bit.ly/1VmqYA #25 of 100 on 7x7's The Big Eat SF 2010: Loaf of bread straight out of the oven at Tartine http://bit.ly/a1POhh OH MY GOD. $7 loaf of bread + $7 Brillat-Savarin cheese. Kind of pricey for a fella who enjoys kraft singles and wonderbread, but I'm willing to splurge every once and a while. Despite the long line, this is worth it. The bread is delicious (we showed up around 5pm to get some of their fresh sesame bread) and the cheese from Bi-Rite sealed the deal. Brillat-Savarin would be more popular than Brie if it was easier to pronounce, since it is a totally creamier and tastier triple-cream. I don't think I can ever go back. My recommendation? Get some bread and cheese and eat it at Dolores Park. You don't need to be a hipster to do this.

This is an awesome bakery located on the corner of Guerrero and 18th St in the Mission District. I love coffee and pastries and this place is an absolute gem! Started in 2002 by husband and wife Chad Robertson and Elisabeth Prueitt, Tartine resumed the pair's success from their acclaimed Bay Village Bakery and has since grown to be an insanely popular stop for locals and tourists alike. The couple won the nationally prestigious James Beard Foundation Award in 2008 for Outstanding Pastry Chef. My favorites here are the bread, cookies, cream tarts, and croissants. The bread here is legendary and probably considered one of the pinnacles of the artisan bread movement. Available after 5 PM every day except Mondays in full or half loaves, the naturally leavened bread tastes sweet and airy and is perfect to take home for dinner. The beloved popularity of the bread indeed spawned their best-selling book "Tartine Bread." The dark chocolate cookies were a decent size and extremely crunchy. I didn't know it was possible for cookies to have this texture and taste without being overly sweet. The banana cream tart is arguably their most famous pastry: "flaky pastry coated in dark chocolate with caramel, pastry cream, and lightly sweetened cream." An extraordinary creation! The exquisite croissants were extremely delicate, buttery and tasty. Not quite like the croissants at my favorite bakery, Amandine Patisserie, down in west LA, but right up there on par. I've also tried their éclairs, scones, and quiches. All pretty good. Maybe next time I'll try their hot pressed sandwiches. I must admit the prices are on the higher side, but the quality of the bread and pastries here is just phenomenal! Every single visit has been a pleasant experience with above average service, despite the bad parking and long lines. Just be smart about picking when to visit and plan to stay here for awhile. All in all, this bakery is a must-visit in SF and definitely worth your while with Bi-Rite Creamery, Delfina/Pizzeria Delfina, and Dolores Park all on the same block!

this place was good but not amazing to me. a bit overrated maybe in my opinion. i tried the chocolate chip cookie, the scone, chocolate croissant, and bread pudding...nothing really stood out except for maybe the bread pudding...it wasn't too sweet/buttery. I also shared a soppresata sandwich with a friend and also had some of the pastrami sandwich as well, those were good but maybe too greasy/buttery for me. they were also huge and stuffed with a lot of meat and cheese...but for some reason it just wasn't amazing to me or something i'd crave or go back for. the coffee was really good though. i really wish i could write a raving review about this place but it was really just your average bakery.

Maybe Tartine is over-hyped and I expected too much, but I was underwhelmed.  Yes, the food was good.  The pressed/grilled sandwiches were nice and the banana cream pie was tasty but I just didn't feel the love for this place.  If I lived nearby I'm sure I'd visit here from time to time, but I don't see myself going out of my way to go here.

I love sweets. I'm a carbohydrate whore, I'm not going to lie to you on that. Tartine is rarely passed up if I'm going through this neighborhood (especially if one can find a parking space). If there was hail the size of golf balls, and a line stretching around the block at Tartine, and I found a parking space, I'd take the bruises and scrapes, and perhaps even those moment of unconsciousness for a dessert. I have yet to go wrong with anything at this place, from their delightful bread pudding (man oh man, it always calls my name with a sexy European accent) to the gougeres. I was in here yesterday with a friend of mine who doesn't really like sweets (yes, he's a heathen, I know) and I sit down indoors (there was no line when we strolled in, for a rare change) and I get a slice of their almond lemon poppyseed pound cake, and a cafe au lait. I of course, being the lady that I am, offer up a bite to my friend, along with the offer to buy him something, and he declines. As I start to nibble away at the slice, he says "wait...let me try some of that" and proceeds to eat some of my cake. He does this often, so I forgive him. After a telephone with my mother, where she politely demands that I bring her back something, and another round in line, we exit with another slice of cake, and a gougere. Walking down 18th, tearing off pieces of it to hand to my friend, he stops and pauses and says, "Wait, can we go back and get another one?" Yes my friends, it's THAT good. I want to move in here, and gain 50 pounds from the butter and sugar alone. It'd be worth each and every calorie. I have never had a problem with service here, though the line and location can get crazed from time to time, it's worth it. Also, all their to-go containers are biodegradable, they care about the environment AND they taste good.

This place is pretty pricey for what you get, but it's got some special variations on the normal goodies, so it's a cute place to go to.  I wouldn't call this my go to place. Mexican cookie.  Not bad for 85 cents.  Not as good as the $1.75 one from Roastery, but better than the ones from Whole Foods or Dianda's (in Mission).  Nice coating of powedered sugar over the shortbread cookie/buttery/crunchy inside.  I could tell the cookie had a lot of butter/grease. Lemon cream tart- kinda pricey, but each part of the simple dessert was made well.  The lemon filling was lickable like really tangy kick like lemon sorbet, but with the texture of a silky, dense, butter base.   It sat well on the clean crisp dense thin crust.  And to top if off was the dollop of cream, a light egg white/butter taste, great balance to the tartiness of the lemon filling and heaviness of the crust. Morning bun - $3.75 for a bun?!  OK, it's definitely special, so go for it.  I remember spending $50 at Tartine my first time and not wanting to waste $4 on a morning bun.  I should have.  It's a mixture of a lot of things - not so sticky sticky bun, the layers are fluffy like a croissant, and each layer has hints of a biscuit texture/density/taste.  Also sprinkled with orange and cinammon flavors throughout.  And the light crunchiness/burntness of the areas on the outside are the perfect crunchiness while keeping the inside soft, flaky, and gooey. (a year ago) Chocolate Hazelnut Torte - eh, nothing special. some other stuff; i'll have to dig it up.. but I remember I was so disappointed, it's taken me over a year to go back and try this place again.

Thursday 11:36-11:44am. some thoughts in my head while waiting in line at Tartine: ....oh there's always a line here...i wonder if they have ever considered expanding the place....i love their bread pudding...it's thursday freaking morning! doesn't anyone work in this town?...i don't care...i can wait...it's worth it for the bread pudding...BREAD PUDDING!!!....but seriously is there ever a time that this place doesn't have a line out the door. i wonder what they put in the bread pudding that makes it so good....hmmm. yeah, a latte. they make really good lattes. organic coffee and organic milk...i hope they aren't out of the bread pudding...haha...that older lady is reading a copy of the onion.... funny...oh...hmmmm...double latte...oh, and i love milk over the bread pudding!!!....i definitely want the bread pudding...great! we can share an open faced sandwich AND the bread pudding....that makes me feel less guilty about eating a whole bread pudding...oh no, did i park my car in a street cleaning zone?...i better go make sure...BREAD PUDDING, BREAD PUDDING, BREAD PUDDING....wonder where we can sit?...if that person moved over to the table with the other single person we could sit there...oh bread pudding!...well we can sit outside too. there's a few empty tables outside....better go get one....a bowl of bread pudding...most definitely....

This is easily the best bakery in San Francisco. I would recommend every single thing, but my favorites are the ham sandwiches, the banana cream pie, and the chocolate pudding. The bakery is less crowded during weekday afternoons, and is much more pleasant if you can get a table, especially one with a view, so you can watch all the women in their yoga pants come in and throw back 1,000 calories. Seriously, though. This place is infested with beautiful, toned ladies, who are serious about their pastries. They know what they want, and they've obviously been here before. Maybe this is the one caloric splurge in their otherwise immaculate diet. (??) Try living with one of the managers, you'll start thinking you ARE a morning bun.

To the tall hipster chic with the short blonde hair, I'm sorry I annoyed you by buying 5 items for a surprise b-day breakfast for my love. I'm sorry I asked if there were any morning buns because after you proclaimed, "What you see out is what we have" I realized how stupid my question was. I'm sorry that I then decided to get a berry torte, because you clearly wanted me to go away. I'm also sorry that when the morning buns showed up 15 seconds later, I said yes to wanting one when you asked me, which made you roll your eyes. I'm really sorry I made you roll your eyes...that takes a lot of effort. I'm sorry that you apparently hate your job and hate all the people that come into the bakery. I guess you have a habit of doing this (or so my boyfriend says..he knew who you were right off the bat) so it must really bother you when people come in to buy Tartine's delicious baked goods. You're obviously too cool for school. Tartine = 5 Stars Tall hipster chic w/ short blonde hair = 0 Stars.

The food is generally excellent, but there is absolutely no value here, so its hard to give it five stars.  Five stars are reserved for great food and great value.  The lemon tart was amazing, not as sweet or tart as most lemon tarts.  The whipped cream on the tart was perfect, and I liked the really thin crust on the tart.  The chocolate almond tart was even better than the lemon tart.  I thought the quiche was good, but not nearly as good as the baked goods.  The line did move quickly, but its pretty silly to wait in line for twenty minutes to spend $60 for three people to have pastries and coffee.  I felt like I was in an episode of Portlandia.

oh the joy.  oh the heaven.  oh the perfection that is tartine.  i recommend checking out the entire assortment of available treats before ordering - instead of ordering right when you arrive.  that way you can make the best decision on what tartine has to offer (not that you can go wrong).  the further you get in line, the more temptation you are able to see, and therefore order.   i prefer a scone with the warm quiche and coffee and...well, anything else available would be great as well.

I am so happy to return with an update, and tell the TRUTH! This place is so full of itself, it trips on it's own feet. So sad. First, it's damned expensive. And I'm not cheap! lol Ok, went for only the second time, because I could not bring my desire up enough to go again. But, my mother was in town, and she LOVES bakeries. Told her about this, and thought it was  a good chance. Went for lunch, we were going to get a sandwich to share, then saw the croque monsieur coming straight out of the oven, with ASPARAGUS too and could not resist. Boy, some people never learn! Just as bad as the first time, same ol' problems... A good sandwich should be so much better than the sum of it's parts. And this one is actually SO much lesser! It's like a deconstructed c.m. Big mistake. Total waste of time. Then, had a banana creme tart. I'm sure there are lots of DUMB people who will rave about this one!  It's crap. The tart crust is hard, flavorless (butter? probably. taste it? Nope). They line the crust w/ dark chocolate, ostensibly to keep the crust from wetting. Um, that damn crust needs some wetting. Might be edible then! The filling was fine, even good. I love banana creme pie. In fact, might be my favorite. Again, this was a lame "deconstruction" having some idea of singling out each part, making it "perfect" and falling FLAT on it's face. Someday, I'm sure I'll go a third time, 'cause I love Mark Bittman, and he loves Tartine! But it will take a long time again, I'm sure. Especially to wade through the MOUNTAINS of attitude and cool just gushing through this place!

Seems that my life is all about waiting in line for something. Something I don't enjoy much, but like the rest of us, you have to. Well, Tartine is one business I don't mind waiting in line. I have never had bread or pastries this good. Many come close, but there is something special here. I bought their book and have a few trial runs at baking loafs. Still need some tweaking, time/temperature issues. Like a science project. In the meantime I will stand in line, content knowing the reward.

I was jogging with my friend David when it came to me: my ideal day. It would be an entire day spent at Tartine. I would begin with the morning bun and a latte and catch up on three months of unread New Yorkers. When lunch rolled around, I would order one of the hot pressed sandwiches, perhaps the mozzarella and tapenade. Then I might take a walk around Dolores Park to work up my appetite, and return for a mid-afternoon snack of bread pudding. As evening set in, I'd shift to the wine bar. Then I realized it --- this was an achievable dream. I told a half dozen or so friends I'd be at Tartine, and said they should drop by during the day. Yesterday was the day. I began with a large latte, which came in a big white bowl and was made with Mr. Espresso coffee. The morning bun was as good as I'd remembered it --- flaky, buttery pastry with caramelized, crunchy sugar and a hint of orange. My friends Sheila and Chris showed up, with their dog, Simon, then my friend Emily. We sat on a bench outside and talked about how difficult the semester had been. Then we headed to Dolores Park, where Simon ran around, played catch and made friends with some of the other dogs. David showed up, and we went to Pizzeria Delfina for lunch, a small but worthwhile diversion from my all-day Tartine plan. We returned to Tartine after lunch, and met my sister and Kelly. Katie and David both got the bread pudding. There were two choices: one topped with banana, and the other topped with seasonal fruit; yesterday, it was strawberry. The small-sized serving comes in a coffee cup. It's not big, but it's enough, because the pudding, made from the bakery's house made brioche, is so rich. Five o'clock rolled around, and I was getting a little tired. I decided to save the wine bar for another day. But before I left, I picked up a banana cream tart, some macaroons and a few meringues with cocoa nibs and took them over to Emily's. We sat on her sofa and devoured the tart. It was delicious, as everything I have eaten at Tartine has been. The bananas are lightly blanketed in a caramel sauce, and tucked into a flaky pastry shell lined with dark chocolate. This whole concoction is topped with freshly whipped cream and shaved chocolate. Steven showed up a little later, and we gave him some of the macaroons and meringues. I still had a couple meringues left over, so I ate one for breakfast this morning. Kelly introduced me to them, and I am glad she did. The meringue is crunchy and sweet on the outside, and a bit sticky and gooey on the inside. Its sweetness is cut with the earthiness and crunch of the cacao nibs. I never did get to any of my New Yorkers, but it was a great day, and a perfect end to the semester.

I love the mix of fruits and almond paste in the almond frangipane, and the coconut cream is custardy and flaky perfection.  Twice now they've run out of banana cream, but that's probably due to poor timing (both weekend afternoons) and the item's popularity.  Each time, I've waited 20-30 minutes to order, but it's always been worth it.  The only disappointment so far has been the gougere, which was not as flaky and light as I'd expected it to be, and it was a touch salty.

This is by far my favorite bakery in SF!  While some of my friends have complained about the line, in my opinion it is well worth the wait.  Their almond croissants are the best outside of France and their morning buns are scrumptious!  I have enjoyed almost everything from this bakery including their lattes.  My only wish is that they had more space to sit down because fighting over chairs when you are trying to eat your heavenly croissant is not fun!  Perhaps as they continue to grow they will eventually expand.  However, for now I love this mission cafe and bakery and I continue to discover something new and amazing each time I visit.

This place really stresses me out because you really can't get a table unless you're willing to FIGHT some hip, stroller-wielding yuppie mom for it.  And then when you finally do get a table, people hover over you like vultures with their plates of pastries in hand. It's really an uncomfortable experience. It feels like a bus station. The pastries are fine, if you like butter.  There's something off about the lattes, but maybe I'm just not French enough. What's up with all the crazy money on this block?  I thought that Noe Valley was well on the other side of Dolores.

Now I know anybody who has ever tried Tartine loves it soooo much and I'd be a liar if I said I didn't (their morning buns are almost too amazing for words and they have fantastic sandwiches), but the line and crowded atmosphere are a little overwhelming. Customers who get a seat camp out there for days and sometimes the line is just too much to bear. So, if you make it there on an off time (almost never) it's great, although their coffee leaves quite a bit to be desired...

Like this place needs another review.. but I gotta put my 2 cents in. Despite the fact that its always shoulder to shoulder crowded, line out the door with hungry sweet-toothed peeps... the girls at the counter always manage to be super efficient in a very friendly way. Not that fake, i have to smile because my boss said so, friendly but genuinely friendly as in they manage to chit chat with you during the split second you have to order your morning buns. Kudos to that! I mean, that's some serious skill. So mouth watering treats AND cool people is totally five stars in my book.

On my first trip to San Fran, I've experienced what makes this city such a foodie town and Tartine Bakery is at the center of it. Situated in the Mission District, Tartine Bakery had incredible bread, delicious desserts, and even better pastries. If you are in San Francisco, go here. Wait in line, walk 3 miles, steal a bike, or whatever you have to do.... just get here and eat everything and anything they have. I can guarantee you won't be disappointed.

It is impossible to find parking around here, and lines are running out the door, so it takes a while to even get into the bakery.  The smell inside is amazing, and everything looks really good.  I tried their lemon cream tart, bread pudding, and ham quiche.  I was disappointed with the quiche because it was cold, but the flavors were good, although not amazing.  The bread pudding was very good.  The lemon cream tart was okay.  Overall, I'm curious about the sandwiches and other desserts, but nothing I had was good enough to warrant the frustration of getting in the door.

I simply love this place. The croissants are wonderfull even though the size is quite different from their French counterparts. This one can feed a family of four. Their grilled sandwiches are srumptious too. The only bad thing is the wait, there are always people waiting in line at all hours of the day. Also, I wish they had a bigger space with more tables inside.

4.5 stars, only because their delicious baked goods are slightly on the pricey end.  But you are paying for quality here.  I have tried the frangipane croissant ($4.25) and the lemon poppyseed tea cake ($3.75) and while both are delicious, I must say I like the tea cake better.  The refreshing citrusy lightness perfectly balances the butteriness that I know must go into making such a moist cake.  But the most surprising and delicious element is the crunchy sugary coating.  I am so in love with this dessert I found the recipe in the Tartine cookbook and will soon begin my endeavors to recreate this culinary masterpiece.

Pretty busy and small place, everything looked so good waiting by the glass display case. I decided on the Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian Rectangle. I loved the combination of the sponge cake, fruity cream, and coconut. It was later in the day, so many of the popular items were gone already.

Wow... this place has amazing pastries.  The chocolate croissants are sooooo good.  Not too sweet & perfectly flaky.  Yum yum.  The morning bun is really good too.  It's a Cinnamon & orange pastry.  There's always a long line out the door.  As other people have said, the line does move very fast.  If you want to stay there and eat, seating is limited.  Ahhhh... I can't wait to go back.

hazelnut tarte is to die for. as are a number of other pastries i tried but can't remember the names. other than the very long line (which is why i went - according to my rule of where there's smoke, there's fire), a great place to buy pastries and bread to go. has some seating but way too crowded to be enjoyable. i hear the bread is amazing too...

There is a reason why there is most often a line out the door to Tartine. This bakeshop shows the passion of the owners and their staff. The way they operate, baking through the day, bread out of the ovens at 5 pm is not like traditional bakeshops where the bake is done in wee hours the morning and by noon is off on taste and freshness. Bravo for the superb products you give to us. You live up to the hype, not often the case I find. I am in love with the Lemon Cream tartlet and the Fromage Blanc Bavarian. It is simply the best lemon tart I have eaten, and I have eaten quite a few, lol. The mark of a great bakeshop, in my opinion, is how well they do the common products. The simplicity of a well made lemon tart, the croissant or a country loaf of bread are often times so mediocre but here at Tartine, they are all spot on!! I have used the Tartine pastry book that came out quite awhile ago and now have been baking bread each weekend from the Tartine Bread book. Yes, you can turn out amazing breads at home with Chad's technique. In any event, I will close by saying, I will hit Tartine whenever I am in the city and continue to support this couple, who's passion for baking has paired so well, and given us such superb baked goods to enjoy! Don't visit San Francisco without a stop here!

I find the bad reviews shocking.  I had an actual out-of-body experience went I took my first bite of a croissant from Tartine.  It is 50% butter and 50% flaky goodness.  I now realize that every other croissant before Tartine is just slightly flaky bread.  It not just lived up to my expectations, but exceeded them, even though I had to wait in line for 20 minutes.  And I hate waiting in line.  For anything.

As per yelper's reviews, did the morning bun and the frangipane croissant. Both were very good but very sweet and very filling. Coffee was good. Wait was not bad on a weekday before 9 AM. It's loud if you sit inside. Glad I finally went. Next time I'll do the brioche bread pudding with fruit, or gougere.

my mom was the person who introduced tartine to me.  after going to the flower markets early in the mornings on saturdays, she would treat herself (and the fam) to bags and boxes full of baked goodies! sure, the boxes and bags were grease soaked by the time they arrived, but holy cow... i always felt so lucky to get something so decadent for brunch! the trick is to cut everything you buy into quarters so that you can ration it out and try to spread out the intake of heavy richness throughout the day (if it can last that long).  everything is good and nothing is "little" or small in taste.   the sweets (croissants, dense cookies, scones ets) and savories (filled croissants, quiches, pizza-thingys etc) are all worth the wait in line or the wait for arrival!  thankfully, i haven't really had to deal with the massive lines (unless it was during a festival or peak hours) nor the attitudes at the counter (just impatience and a bit of pride).  all the more reason to visit the parents more!!!  who wants to deal with the hassle of finding parking, waiting in line and ordering when mom can do it for you?  (i'm such a brat!)

After avoiding the ominous line out front for months I finally decided to give Tartines a try today.  I was kind of disappointed.  The quiche is good, the pastries look incredible, and the espresso rocked but alas, the place is full of table vultures.  These are hideous creatures that pounce on open tables with their trendy purses and claim them for themselves even if they are still in line outside.  WTF?  If someone would invent a table vulture spray that I could use here I will gladly take Tartines to 4 stars, until then...caCAW CaCAW bitches!

Tartine is fabulous.  In my opinion, they have the second best mocha in the City with real whipped cream (non-sweetened).  Also, the delicious bread that is served in Delfina is made at Tartine and is so reasonably priced ($4.95).  The lines appear daunting, but well worth the wait and the people customers/staff are all so interesting to look at.

I do not want to come across as this bitter, curmudgeonly discontent. I once loved the product that came out of this place. Oh yes, and I do know that a lot of you fancy your sweets and from the looks of it you will stand in line for what amounts to an eternity. Not I, never again, this spot does not justify me spending a half-hour of my day, immovably fixed, just so I can get me a sugar high. I have my reasons for avoiding this corner (at all costs). So many reasons in fact, that I have compiled a small list that I wish to share with any that are interested. If you are ready...here it goes. 1.) The Wait:  I don't know about you but when I see a line, oh say, out the door and then half way down the block. It does not prompt me to want and stand in it. All I know is that hair grows faster than this line moves. I am not sure if a long line indicates phenomenal fare or sluggish service. I now tend to think the latter applies...which leads me to... 2.) Customer Service:  There has never been or ever will be, a slower moving set of servers then these overworked, "pastry punks". You'll have better luck washing a cat (if you've ever tried washing a cat, then you know what I'm talking about), then having any one of the lovely ladies move any faster then they necessarily have to. I have never once seen this place use both cash registers. Which can be rather annoying. I'm not sure if the employees here are burned out by the time they finally get to me or just simply jaded to the entire customer service angle. They seem to under staff purposely, just to have the patrons (suckers) loiter around like a pack of ravenous animals, waiting for their rations. And speaking of loitering... 3.) Deplorable Design: The layout of this joint, renders it nearly imposable to even begin to obtain any semblance of contentment. If you are lucky enough to find a seat, chances are you arrived right when they opened and sprayed your spot (like the dog that you are) to make sure that no one else would stake your claim. Then once you have your seat, it makes it very hard to give it up. So, those that have claimed their center of operations, end up lingering for much longer then they normally would. I completely understand why people loiter for as long as they do. It's like when you were a kid and your cousin wanted to play with a toy that died at the bottom of your toy box and you have not touched it in who knows, how long. Suddenly, you become maniacally possessive over this thing and you wont hear of anyone merely gazing at it. But I digress (or regress). This is what it's like at Tartine. For those of us/you who are of the unfortunate, just hang around until you find your own. Oh, and good luck... 4.) The Guilt: Now, I'm not sure how many of you are of either the Catholic or Jewish persuasion, but I must say this...guilt is something I assume a lot of us live with (on so many levels) and feeling guilty for something as pleasurable as consuming amazingly crafted treats, is but a small price to pay when compared to the other guilty pleasures of life. Like, religiously watching re-runs of Zena, Warrior Princess on Lifetime or The Oxygen Channel. Anyway, I have to admit, when I was a patron, I always felt a pang of guilt, not only because of the vast caloric intake but also because of the truly shitty experience I had just imposed upon myself. Well...I've learned that you do not have to be treated like a complete imbecile in order to receive decent service and product, no matter how tasty the tidbits may be. Wow, I feel much better now that I have gotten this off my chest. Whew, thanks for listening...how much do I owe you?

This place is amazing!  I have had croissants, Ham and Cheese Croissants and their grueyere rolls.  We also ordered two cakes for my grandmother's 90th birthday and let me tell you, they were a hit!  We got the choclate cake with the gold leaves and the Passion Fruit Key Lime Coconut cake.  I am going to go back for on of their paninis this weekend.  The wait is long but soooo worth the wait.  I think this is one of the best French Bakeries in this city.

The sandwiches are fabulous and the pastries are otherworldly. The coffee is good too. However the whole experience is utterly, totally ruined because the place is packed with people and not that clean, and standing in line bored for 45 minutes turns a fun, vivacious party into a surly and depressed group of jerks. I don't like malls during the holidays and thus I don't like Tartine. Even the thought of going back there totally stresses me out, because it was so good and I really want to go back but I feel I may have a nervous breakdown if I ever have to experience that teeth-grinding experience again. Try to con someone into going and getting takeout for you and you will absolutely love it.

I've been here twice, once for the morning buns and last week for the bread pudding.  From what I recall, the morning bun was really good.  I've been on a bread pudding kick and I thought this one was excellent!  It was very custard-y.  It contains fresh cranberries and it's a pretty big portion.  Both times I've been here, the line is out the door.  It's kind of a small place and hard to get a seat but it's got a nice, warm, homey feel to it.   I rated this 3 stars because I only tried two things but it's definitely worth a try!

The lines are never ending and the smiles stop when the sticky buns and fav. pastries run out...which is usually around 2pm. Why!?!Keep yo shit stocked. I might just be venting but daym, after waiting in line and smelling the intoxicating sweets for 35 minutes they run out of morning buns...and all the other sweets I would have picked for plan B.

It gets a little crazy-bananas on the weekend. It is indeed worth the wait, but if at all possible I'd recommend avoiding it during peak hours. Unless you have extreme patience and can meditate in line. Aside from that, this is the best bakery I've encountered in San Francisco. Their crossaints are authentic, the homemade bread is phenomenal and the pastries are super good and not too sweet. It is a husband and wife team, which is awesome. I hear they are opening another bakery and a restaurant as well.  Yum yum.

OMG, the pressed sandwiches here are fucking unbelievable. I ordered Sopressata, had a bite of my friends' Jambon Royale and Pastrami. The breads are so crispy, I seriously thought they are fried in butter. Only if I had two stomachs, I would finish all my friends' leftovers and then some desert. Be warned, though, the sandwiches are HOT, HOT. If you can't help yourself, you will very likely get burned. Heck, the sandwiches are so good, you will probably love the HEAT and think it's all worth it...

Yes, this is the best bakery in the whole entire USA according to NYT. I've tried a many and their croissants rival those that I've had in France, hands down. The roches are light and airy, the eclair the perfect balance of chocolate to cream, their lemon tarts have the exacting blend of sweet and tart with a dollop of creme fraiche...I'm so glad that I don't live closer or else I'd be one walking lard ball.

When i go here i know to always expect a line, which i think is an indicator of how popular and good it is. The whole place has  a really cool ambience. People sit there and chat with their coffees or read their newspaper. One time i went in there, there was two ladies eating a sampling of like 5 desserts...EACH. If i had enough stamina to stomach that much sugar i'd do it too. Anyway, everything there is pretty good, hot chocolate is nice, as well as the mousse, but the sole reason i go there is for their ultra delicious, yummy, flaky, tart in your mouth lemon bar. It really is the best lemon bar that i've ever had. I may be biased because i love lemon flavored stuff, but it really is a great mixture of just enough lemon flavor and yummy crust. It's definitely something you have to try if you stop by.

I made a special trip here last time I was in San Francisco. This place is so rustic in its appearance and food, which I absolutely adore. I'm a huge organic fan, so I really appreciate that they use local, organic ingredients whenever possible. The croissants are just incredible. They are flaky and slightly crispy on the outside and soft, buttery, with distinct layers on the inside. I had to wait in a long line, but it was well worth the wait!

I took my Parisian friend to Tartine when she was visiting San Francisco. Not only did she declare their croissant the best one she's had outside of Paris but she said if she goes to Paris and gets a mediocre croissant she's know going to think "I can get way better than this in San Francisco!" and I've never met anyone as discerning of a croissant as her. I'm a sucker for the Morning Buns and Bread Pudding myself, but then again, I wasn't born and raised in Paris.

let me start this review off by saying that i have never EVER been crapped on by a bird in my life...... so one day while waiting in the ridiculous line that always encompasses the surroundings of tartine before it even opens something hit my head. a couple minutes go by and again, something hits my head. what the eff! i look up and there's a disgusting pigeon shovelling old bird crap over the side of the ledge and onto my head! that was uncool to say the least! anyway, no deducted points for that since it was external and not quite tartine's fault. and i will still claim that i have not been crapped upon. i have had crap pushed upon me, but no fresh stuff so far. my fingers will be crossed for life! anyway, tartine has some of the best paninis i've ever had. blanc and banana is my favorite! fromage blanc with jam and bananas on their bread, SO good! their almond croissants are unbeatable, no doubt. i haven't found anything nearly as delicious and gigantic as theirs. and the chocolate pudding is silky as can be. i don't even enjoy chocolate pudding all that much but tartine's i will eat. oh and their morning buns! when they come right out of the oven i feel giddy! this place makes me excited!

This place has great food. I love how it is located in a rather inconspicous corner; you can find it based on all the people waiting in line! The morning bun I had was delicious; it's made like a cinnamon roll dipped in sugar. The BF had the banana cream tart which he said was amazing too, especially with its caramel at the bottom. As we were leaving we asked about the bread they make daily and it turned out they made some of it earlier that day so we bought one. I thought it was a little expensive @ $7 but it stayed warm in the car for at least an hour and smelled absolutely divine. Delicious!

I thought Tartine would be another overhyped place especially since it was on the 100 things to try in SF but it is not! Parking is troublesome but the atmosphere inside is relaxed yet upbeat. We waited in line and ordered the morning bun since it was recommended as the must eat and also a cup of bread pudding. I have never been a fan of bread pudding and tried to persuade my mom to choose something else but she was determined. Thankfully she is sometimes stubborn because I tried it and loved it! The rich flavor of egg is delicious and the bread really soaked up the concoction well. My morning bun was a little hard but it was to give a good texture and a bite to the delicious fistful of sugar! Really enjoyed our quick treats :)

Wanted to try their coffee cake with dutch chocolate that I heard about but they were out. Anywho, tried a few of their hot sandwiches and I must say, as my bro said, too greeeasy!! They were caked with grease!! For $13 a sandwich, they better be close to perfect! Like everyone said, their service is much undesirable!! Condescending, too-cool-for-school attitudes pretty much sums up the peeps that work there! They're too bz chatting and definitely not doing crap since there's a clear sign that says "Thanks for busing your table" My goodness if I'm paying $40+ for 3 sandwiches, I shouldn't have to do a damn thing but sit and eat!! I might go back and try their other desserts when I'm in the area again but it'll def. be to-go!

The line went out the door but my Membrillo & Idiazabal sandwich made it all worth it. Why didn't I think to smother freshly baked bread with a lightly smoked sheep's milk cheese and quince jam? We shared a breakfast roll and a chocolate croissant. Excellent and excellent! The cocoa was a little weak but the service was nice and the food was delicious. It's a little pricey for pastry and sandwiches but you're definitely paying for baked goods that are a step above average.

I had a few hours to spare before my flight out of SF and i knew i had to visit one more place (I am always on a tight schedule when i visit SF-since there are so many friends and places i miss there). I dragged my friends on a rainy sunday around 3:00 who could probably care less about a french bakery i had heard of in a foodie magazine. We stood in line, in the drizzle, for 30 min. Finally time to order: I got the chocolate hazelnut tart although i was looking forward to the croissant filled with chocolate but they were all out, and I goat cheese on walnut bread sandwhich, friend #1 got bread pudding, and friend #2 got shortbread cookie. The tart was lovely...smooth chocolate-y goodness with a hint of hazelnut. The sandwich was not worth $10-- i mean the bread was pretty good and the goat cheese was standard but thats all there was. I didn't care for the bread pudding, it was rather cold and had big slices of apples on top an lacked flavor. The shortbread was nothing special. oh if you stand in line for the restroom you get to see them take out the fresh bread from the oven...looked heavenly. i don't know if i would make way to the mission just for tartine again..but if i were in the area i would definitely drop in.

Whoa, the line at Tartine on a holiday Monday was ridic. Out the door almost. Almost all of the desserts/pastries were taken. I grabbed what was left; a lemon tart and chocolate chip cookie. The cookie was enormous and the lemon tart was very good. I also had one of their specialty teas which was also a great addition to the desserts. Total for 2 and the tea came out to $11. Next time I'll come early and try and snag a piece of tres leche cake. It looked so good. Boo!

Came across this nice place after reading a review of Bi-Rite Creamery and another review mentioned this place. (thank you!) The line of people out the door made me think that this place must be the real deal and worth the wait. I was right. I checked the one page menu and decided on the fresh fruit Bavarian cake. It was awesome. The raspberries and blueberries were very fresh. I was glad that they accepted credit cards and that the line moved quickly. I really wish I had the room in my stomach for some of the super yummy looking pressed sandwiches. Maybe next time. As an out of towner, I will seek out this place again. (unless yelp or someone else tells me of another great place).

I have officially tried everything Tartine makes for breakfast.  It's Nan C.'s fault.  Anyways, everything is excellent, and I am totally addicted to their open face grilled cheese sandwiches.  The line totally sucks and I wish they'd find a way to better manage it -- also a "dog parking" spot would be great.  But the quality of baked goods and bread are outstanding, and the Mission is lucky to have Tartine.

The quiche is TO DIE FOR, and the pain au chocolate is on a whole other level.  I didn't have to brave the monstrous queue that everyone has been bitching about, so I can't dock points for that.  Outdoor seating is available, which is usually a selling point for me, but it's on a pretty busy street and might not be the most pleasant plein air dining experience of your life.  However, I bet the largely hipster crowd enjoys the ironic beauty of the gritty mission streets as a backdrop for delicate french pastries.  JUXTAPOSITION (They learned about that during their undergrad at Vassar where they majored in English Lit with a minor in androgynous haircuts).  But seriously, you won't be disappointed with Tartine.

Morning bun: sugary, sweet, & delicious!!!!  Well worth the $3 bucks spent. :)  I went on a weekday before work, and it was already crowded.  I can imagine how much more crowded it would be on a Saturday or Sunday morning.  They had other desserts there that looked really, really good too.  I can't wait to come back and try them.  :)

We stopped in here to quickly grab some cookies and other treats for dessert later that night. The place was absolutely packed to the rafters, with every table being taken and a long line going from the register along the display case and almost to the door. It was so long that rather than try to angle the stroller in, Loria sent me in on a solo mission and hung back by the door to entertain the baby. Having arrived in the later afternoon, I tried to peek through the line to see what is left. The cases were full of cookies, tarts, and breads, and each looked very inviting. For some reason I was feeling rushed, so I started pointing at random cookies without really getting a good sense of what looked best. I decided to skip the $6.50 miniature banana cream tart and ended up with a variety of cookies. As the line moved along the case, I inevitably saw this chocolate chip doodad or that walnut butter whatever, eventually requiring the patient woman helping me to bag my selections three separate times. Later that night, we dug in and are fairly disappointed. Nothing tasted bad, per se, but it all felt like pretty standard bakery fare. It all looked much better than it tasted, unfortunately, and a few of the cookies went unfinished. It's only later that I remembered that the place is renowned for its double pain au chocolat, but given how the rest of the cookies ended up, I didn't feel terrible that we missed out.

tartine- the ultimate "make it all better" place- y'know the feeling guys, you say/do something stupid, your girlfriend is more pissed than Kanye not winning an MTV music award, and the look of luvin' ain't the twinkling you see in her eyes... what are you going to do? One answer- Tartine her. With more orgasmo-chocolate options than anyplace in the ferrybuilding, you can instantly make it all better with _anything_ you get here- chocolate pudding, chocolate cakes,  even chocolate choclate- and watching those amazing bakery mavens frost those  cakes is easily the hottest food-porn you'll  ever see- and its live dammit! As the waves of choco-extacy crash over her, all unhappiness is forgotten, and you're in like flynn....for the moment. The morning buns are awesome, the mochas there taste like liquid dark chocolate, and the Ham and Gruyere pressed sandwhich is more than worth the trip over from across the city (I do it all the time). Just be prepared to wait in line- its worth it. Oh, and if you see an open table- jump on it like a tickle me elmo, once it gone, its gone baby gone.

I went here unaware that it was so famous, so I haven't tried the pastries people rave about, but a goat cheese and banana sandwich - how cool is that?

I'm always hesitant about giving a full 5 stars in any review, but after some consideration, and fond reminiscing, I suppose Tartine deserves it. I've heard that the food here is supposed to be European or European-inspired, but I'm only an amateur, so I don't really know specifics. (However, a friend of mine who just came from a European vacation says that the Tartine offerings are comparable to what she had over there, and that Tartine even holds its own against a lot of bakeries she visited.) I ought to dock them a star for not having more sitting space. With all the well-deserved hype, recognition, accolades, and popularity that this place has garnered, you'd think they'd take all their earnings and get a new table or two. Luckily for these bozos, the food is good enough that I'm willing to take my bounty and eat standing up at the bar --- although on nicer days, it's pretty neat eating at one of the outside tables. Personally, you can't go wrong with anything here. One weakness might be the chocolate cookie, which was very yummy to me, but was surprisingly wafer-like, and I'm not used to my cookies feeling like wafers. The mushroom croque-monsieur was a tasty, hearty treat for a creeping vegetarian like me ("creeping" because, although I've cut down on meat, it still sometimes makes its way into my diet every now and then). I got that with a side salad, priced at 3-something dollars, which might seem kind of pricey for a side salad, but trust me, the taste is worth it. Other times, I've tried the bread pudding, which is as legendary as you've heard from everyone else. After coming back a few times, I realized how weird it was that I've never had any tarts at tartine, so I tried a lemon cream tart and it was better than cheesecake --- which is saying a lot for a wannabe Golden Girl like me. Also get a cup of coffee. The brew is pretty good, and get it for here so you'll save paper and you get to use the cute little cup and saucer. PS to another review here that references the "annoying yuppies and hipsters": I totally feel you on that one. But they're mostly harmless and surprisingly conversational. I guess good pastries and sandwiches will mellow out just about anyone. I'll probably keep snacking and dining at Tartine long after the hype dies down. I've been in San Francisco since 2000, but didn't become a Tartine fan until this year. I've never been one to eat at places that are momentarily trendy. I eat somewhere because I, me, and myself like it very much. And it's a bonus when I get to bring friends who like the food, too.

"That Damn Tartine." is how my new friend refers to this establishment. i assumed she was calling it that for the uppity crowd that it attracts. but she called it that because they are always out of exactly what you are looking for, or have just closed the doors, or the line is too long. personally, i just want to have a seizure when i go near the clientele. the conversations i've had to endure while waiting in line have spooked me away from this place. this place. that damn tartine.

i'm always at la boulangerie.  after hanging out in dolores park and 45 minutes after ice cream at bi rite, i was craving something more savory to eat.  so, we hit tartine.  none of the sweets sang to me.  the toasted sammiches, well, to borrow from that love to hate rachel ray, "yum-o".  that's the only way to describe the delicious proscuitto/provolone/arugala sammich i had.  there were THREE sammiches in one order. hello? portion control anyone? not that iw as complaining.  every bite was delicious.  the saltiness of the meat, the perfect crunchiness of the bread.  oh, i wanted to save a bite for maybe a snack or lunch tomorrow, but nope, i devoured it all. the croque monsieur was, imho, not as good.  the bread was superthick, and the tomatoes threw it off-- tasted like pizza. i like my croque mosieurs a bit more virgin than all gussied up.  but, put it in front of me and i won't refuse it.

during a short bay area romp this weekend, i had to drag my traveling companions to tartine for a visit. & through the magic of their banana cream tart, with its light, flaky, chocolate-coated crust, delicate banana custard & surprise caramel center,  i think i made at least one of said companions a believer. their lemon tart was just as heavenly as the last time. they had run out of morning buns. maybe because it was well past morning when we went. d'oh. i don't mind so much now that the place is small & lacks seating - with dolores park so close by offering a great picnicking alternative, they really don't need it. if i ever move to the bay area, i would seriously consider living in the mission just to be close to tartine!

I stood in the long line and was expecting to be blown away by the sugary confections....I wasn't.  They all look good but taste just okay to me.  Just because you put a ton of sugar, cream, and butter doesn't make a pastry amazing.  I tried the Chocolate Hazelnut Tart, Lemon Passion Fruit Bavarian, and Lemon Cream Cheesecake.  They were all good but nothing mind-blowing.  They were actually too sweet but that's just my opinion.  Maybe I wasn't impressed because I didn't get to try the chocolate croissants that everyone else says are the best things there.  Apparently, they sell out immediately upon opening.  If they sell out so fast and are suppposed to be so good, then why don't they make more of them?

I was pleasantly surprised by how good their almond (frangipane) one is. It tastes like their is almond juice/cream infused inside the bread, but it's not creamy...it looks like bread but slightly more moist b/c of the almond juice?

Tartine is the little cafe of my dreams that I would love to open up one day for myself. The small, corner location is ideal for weekend brunches or even just a quick pastry on the go before work. The presentation is clean and simple in the bakery case and each item screams out richness and decadence. A personal favorite of mine is the passion fruit bavarian cake covered in toasted coconut. The cake is always moist and soft and counters the creamy and tart bavarian perfectly. I love watching the action in the back behind the counter as the bakers keep the baked goods flowing to the front. One day, I will have my own place and I can only hope it be half as good as Tartine.

Solid 4 1/2 stars. This yummy bakery is responsible for the creation of my very own "walk of shame." If you ever see someone that doesn't quite fit in with the other well put-together, somewhat yuppy, Tartine visitors, that's me. Tartine is one of the 3 in my Fat Foodie Trifecta, my holy trinity located on 18th street. I've been lucky enough to be a hop, skip and a jump away from Tartine (not to mention Delfina and Bi-Rite Creamery). Going to Tartine to load up on fruity bread pudding, savory quiche, chocolate friands, cheesy gougeres and most importantly, the sinfully delicious morning buns in the early morning before the rush is a plus. But on those off-days, when I can't seem to pull myself out of bed early enough but am in dire need of a chocolate croissant or fresh loaf of bread is when the shame begins. I know better but I always rush, hoping the line hasn't grown too much - I can sacrifice looking presentable for a taste of Tartine, right? No big deal. Or not. With my beat-up college hoodie, pj pants, the boyfriend's slippers, lopsided ponytail and sleep still in my eyes, I make the walk to the end of Tartine line. There's when I pry open my eyes to gawk at the goodies in the glass case and just in time to notice others around me are eyeing my less-than-stellar, "had a rough night...or life" look. I stand around, embarrassed that I didn't make sure my pj pants were the ones that were still whole and not the hole-y ones. After 12 minutes of trying to hide the hot mess that is me, I finally hear an upbeat, friendly voice reminding me why I'm subjecting myself to this, "Hi there! What can I get for you?" The insecurities fall away as I point and squeal at the all the things I want. "I want that...and that...OOoOoh...and 2 of those...and definitely THAT! THANK YOU!!" She packages them up neatly and sends me on my way. As I walk out, I rip a chunk from the buttery croissant and smile - the people are still staring...but I'm okay with that. Because Tartine is worth it.

for a line of people willing to wake up before their 8 hours of beauty sleep is up just for a treat at tartine bakery shows that they're on to something...and i'm coming along for the ride. the first time i came was on a random weekday around noon time. after reading and reading about their infamous morning bun i thought i'd give it a try myself. me: hi, i'd like a morning bun. server: sorry we're sold out. me: what?! really? (in my head) but it's not even 2p yet? what do you mean you're sold out?? i came all the way here in the rain and you're telling me you didn't save me a bun??! apparently they only make a set number of batches of these damn buns every morning and once they sell out, that's it, done deal, try again tomorrow MORNING. yes, i was discouraged, but still had hope that i would eventually get my hands on one. two weeks later i came back at 8:30a and there was already a mini line forming inside the bakery, about to burst out the door. i got to the counter and realized that i made the cut!!! i couldn't even wait till i got home to sink my teeth into my warm, just out the oven breakfast. O MANNNN, now THIS is a morning bun! the taste reminds me of a palmier-croissant hybrid. they sprinkle a generous amount of sugar all over, with a hint of citrus. the outside is crispy, while the inside is soft and chewy. i finished the last bite just outside my home...that made my day. dear morning bun...i will be thinking of you every morning until we meet again =)

Dessert bliss. The key lime pie was amazing but not what I wanted, what I wanted was long sold out before I even arrived. Tartine is all the hype you've heard it to be and then some so I suggest go early if you have your heart set on trying something specific! My next trip will be an attempt to try the croque monsieur and whatever yummy pastry they might have. Be prepared for long lines and lots of people watching.

Came here on a sunny sat morning, line was out.the.door and down the block at least 15 ppl deep - decided it was a not worth it. Fast forward a week later and found myself in the missions again on a sat morning. This time i was in for a treat! Roomie and I picked up 2 morning buns, double pain au chocolate (aka croissant) and a banana cream pie. Yummeo!

i love this place so much. i go here every time i visit. when i lived there i would try to visit each week, even though it was in a different neighborhood. i bought the cookbook and have nearly replicated the bread pudding, which is my favorite thing to order. the only thing that is a bit of a bummer is having to 'mad dog' people to try to score a table after one's food has arrived.

All I can say is YUMMMM! Buttery, flaky, baked goodness!!! Morning bun, croissant, pain au chocolat yum yum yum...the best one was the morning bun, which is basically a croissant with cinnamon sugar, but the rest were definitely delicious as well. I think these would be the best breakfast pastries I have ever eaten, hands down. Next time I'm in the bay I will for sure make this a stop just for another one of those morning buns.

OK, so the less-one star is for portions. They are HUMONGOUS. And frankly, unnecessarily so. For $14.24 I ordered the sorpressata (pls excuse sp) and was given a big box with  three huge half-sandwiches inside. I would much rather pay $10 for two. Oh well, maybe they make 'em so big so you'll give the rest to a street person. Remind me to hang out near here when I'm homeless! Other than the outrageous portion size, I thought I had died and gone to sandwich heaven. Crusty, buttery grilled bread and a house of happy inside. Don't even know what's in it. Don't care.

Do you have a knack for baking? Buy the Tartine cookbook - definitely not for beginners, but if you love to bake, which I do, it's an excellent choice. The book pays a lot of attention to detail - ingredients, kitchen notes, beautiful photographs, etc. Absolutely to die for recipes - both sweet and savory. Love the bakery, love the cookbook. If it's ridiculously busy, it's because they're doing something right - and rare. And if you bake it at home, you won't have to deal with the crowd.

Oh how I wish I could give Tartine five stars.  Their Pain au Chocolat is decadent, their Croissant with Frangipane (almond paste) is to die for, and their general location and atmosphere are wonderful.  But every time I have to wait in line for 15 to 20 minutes or call ahead three days in advance for a loaf of bread, the more I find my relationship with Tartine one way and dying.  In fact, after a recent discussion over IM with a friend, I've come to realize that Tartine is truly a whore.   Friend: So are you doing Tartine this Valentines evening? Me: I could, but it's probably going to be busy. Friend: It will be. Me: I don't want to deal with a place that doesn't love me. Friend: ...and for sure, for sure, for sure, no bread. Me: You know, I think Tartine might be a cheap ... well expensive ... whore. Friend: They don't love you. Friend: That's really it. Me: Tartine blows. Friend: They suck. Me: I hate Tartine. Friend: Exactly. Me: We should write a Yelp review... it could be quite an amusing review. Friend: ...stuck up and can't even make a cookie right, so screw Tartine. Me: Their French pastries are good.  Do they make you feel dirty when you leave? Friend: You know, they kind of do.  I walk away feeling shame in how they treated me. Me: People give you the look; it's the walk of shame when you leave empty handed without bread. Friend: "... it's 5.05... are you a retard to think we still have bread, retard." Me: Nothing to show for your expensive relationship that lasted minutes. Friend: It's a high maintenance relationship where the partner doesn't put out. Me: Well, unless you book three days in advance ...and only if they feel like it.  Abusive relationship, in all honesty. Friend: ...and you have to pay by credit card. Me:  They do that to make sure it's worth their while. No one likes to get a sack of nickles after giving you their "best." Friend: Plus nothing [no bread] on Sunday to Tuesday. Me: Hey, even they have to respect the Sabbath. Friend: But you bring up a good idea... next time I'm at Tartine, I will pay by nickels. So there you have.  An abusive relationship made worthwhile only when you take a bite out of one of their French pastries.  Now, I'll just go wait in line at Tartine...

Porto's Bakery in LA, thus far, has been my favorite bakery but I think we have a new contender here in SF. This place is overly cramped and even in the middle of the afternoon, it's difficult to find a place to sit here. I had the bread pudding, the coconut cream tart, and some random sandwich with asparagus and mushrooms that was already cooked because the three cheese sandwich that I wanted was going to take 20 minutes. I really wanted to try to the banana cream tart, but the coconut cream tart was still heaven in my mouth. THE best tart I have seriously had. Next time I need to try their sandwiches and more of their pastries, but so far this place is just amazing.

I imagine that in heaven or in a place that has long been bought out by capitalism, there are a million tartines and then you never have to wait in line.  However, in San Francisco, there is only one, so, if you get there hungry, be patient and stand in queue.  You won't be disappointed.  Besides, the fact that you could close your eyes and circle your finger and anything you land on would be a delicious adventure, the staff is obviously fed such yummy joys daily to keep them cheerful, friendly, helpful and quite delightful.  If you have the time or can't decide where to go, spend it standing in line at tartine, you'll choose your dessert first and then if you still feel hungry, you can order a sandwich or beverage that will make you feel like an english schoolboy at tea time.  Enjoy, because it may be a daunting choice to come here again!

i'm sitting at home in san diego dreaming of tartine bakery. from their desserts to their sandwiches to their cappuccinos--down to the simple dressing on their side salad--everything i've tried here (and i've made a point to try it all) is absolutely superb. once i caught a glimpse of a pastry chef in the back hand pitting cherries--cherry juice was running down her hands and she was stained red up to her elbows.  it was so sexy. that's what this place is--it's sexy satisfying simple rich bakery goodness.

Living just around the block from this so called spectacular place I often get to witness the "craziness" of the lines and patrons sitting outside feeding their delectables to pigeons. I admit that they make quality pastries, and i believe the bread is made of tears... it is amazingly good, BUT it is only ready at 5 o'clock each day. So after waiting 30 minutes with annoying people on their cell phones, a sweaty, cranky  counter person informs me that the bread won't be ready for 30 minutes. I understand having a policy and all, but possibly post that somewhere so that one would know they didn't have to wait in line.  Most of the annoyances of this establishment come from the patrons themselves. They block driveways over and over again, I mean I didn't realize that their need to have a morning bun was more important then kids going to school. It is definitely over the top bad behavior. Non patron related, I just don't get why a place that is so particular about the quality of their ingredients and presentation choose to serve Mr. espresso swill as their coffee. And if you happen to just be getting a cup of "self serve" drip coffee... you have to fight your way back through the line to get it. It seems like bad planning on the layout  to me.

Sometimes I eat bascially vegan, run 20 miles a week, and live my life in a way that defines a "healthy lifestyle." Then I drink Saturday night, wake up Sunday morning, and the little man inside my belly screams "TARTINE BAKERY!" So I brave the line, order the cheesiest thing I see, and sit quietly at a table in the corner while the grease fills my arteries. Then I get back in line, order a morning bun, and go home with a smile on my face. Sundays are those days. Thank you Tartine bakery for being my guiltiest pleasure.

YES, they have the best bread in town, YES they have the most delicious coconut cream pies, but no more can I abide by not only their too cool for school attitudes, but their downright unfriendliness. The people who work there need to get over themselves! I guess the owners don't care because they are raking in the cash. It's just tourists who go there now, because we locals are sick of you! If you go out of there feeling like you've just been slapped, head down to Bi-Rite who have the nicest people on the planet working there.

There is no way to avoid redundancy when discussing Tartine. Amazing. Delicious. Orgasmic? Yep, all of the above. I went here with a big group and happened to be one of two people watching over the food for seven while everyone gathered water, forks, etc. So there we were standing at the bar table by the window with two cranberry pear bread puddings, a mushroom and sundried tomato croque monsieur, a few morning buns, croissants and of course, coffee for me. People in line outside were clearly staring at us and we thought it was just because the food looked THAT good (it did) and then we realized they thought it was all just for us two girls. I wish it was. We did probably end up trying a bit of everything and I have to say my favorite thing are the morning buns. So fresh, flaky and soft on the inside these buns are simple perfection. Simple perfection is also descriptive of Tartine itself. The only complaint is a lack of seating and the long line, but as we found waiting in line and eating while standing can be pretty entertaining for everyone.

I visited Tartine for the first time today. Due to Friday street sweeping along Guerrero, it took me 25 min to find parking.  The line at Tartine was moderately-long.  The service was snotty.  But those Morning Buns (with cinnamon and orange) make it all worthwhile.

Come prepared with a newspaper, an ipod, sudoku or something because you'll be waiting in line for AWHILE. But don't let that deter you from coming. This place is heavenly; you can smell the butter and bread a mile away---a sine qua non of any great bakeries. My favorite is the croissants. I tried their hazelnut biscotti, shortbread, and walnut tart. All were good. Next time, I'm going to try their open-faced sandwiches.

The wait?  Horrible.  Finding a table?  Requires patient hawking experience.  The food?  Tasty.  But the best thing EVER?  I think not. Luckily, the lines actually move.  BTW owners of Tartine, those benches lining the place is useless.  I wish I could sit out there to eat my food but then I would be blocking the line.  Guess the ones in line can sit for a few minutes while waiting.. The Yum: (mind me, coming from a person that doesn't have much of a sweet tooth) *regular croissant- crispy crust with layered, buttery and flaky interior;  sharable size *ham & cheese croissant: more moist than other croissants they offer.  picture the regular croissant with a extra dose of flavor from the melted cheese and ham; ask for it heated..it is even better that way! *frangipane croissant- my fave (although received mine slightly darker, a little burnt, than preffered).  beautiful almond filling in the center and slivers of almond on top. *bread pudding: good but not the best thing ever; sometimes they add too much fruit though..and I prefer more carbs than fruit served in my bread pudding *croque monsieur- the first time I had this, it was heated and way too hard- far past crunchy!  about to cut my gum status...not good.  i just gave it another chance and ordered the ham and sun dried tomato and it was not heated again.  This time, it was perfectly crisp. *spicy turkey sandwich- definitely not my fave..the broccoli rabe pesto with the spicy turkey was definitely overpowering for me..leaving an aftertaste in my mouth.

Wow, almost 2800 reviews!?  I'd heard about this place from a number of different friends, and apparently it's just as popular on Yelp.   Unfortunately, I have to say I thought this place was overrated - it's 2.5 stars from me at the most.  We came here after dinner today to get some pastries to go, after I convinced my boyfriend to wait 35 minutes in line, which he was NOT happy about.   They didn't have enough chocolate stuff (in my chocoholic opinion).   I decided to get a chocolate friand ($2), which had a cakey bottom and a ganache-y top, sort of like a cupcake, but was shaped more like a macaron, and a slice of some decadent devil's cake ($5.50).   I didn't think the prices were too crazy, but then I picked things that seemed fairer to me (somehow paying $6 for a slice of chocolate cake doesn't bother me nearly as much as paying $4 for a croissant - this is admittedly totally subjective).   The wait, on the other hand, is completely ridiculous. The friand was yummy but nothing amazing.  The bottom was very dried out and it would have been much better if the bottom had been moister, although it was the end of the day so I have to cut them some slack.  The chocolate cake was...chocolate cake.   It was nothing to write home about, and although it said it was made with Valhrona chocolate (a fancy, rich chocolate that I normally love) I didn't taste anything extraordinary.   I've had better chocolate cake from Safeway and I didn't have to wait in line for 35 minutes to buy it.   They did have some quiches that looked really good and were reasonably priced ($4 or so a slice).  They also had some delectable looking bread puddings, if you're into that sort of thing (I'm not).  The croissants did not look great to me - kind of burned and dried out, but then it was the end of the day and I'm all about croissants that are practically dripping with butter.   If I hadn't waited so long in line this place would be a definite 3 star - nothing was bad, just nothing was outstanding.  But the wait makes it a miss for me.

I finally made it to Tartine Bakery today, and I was glad not to wait in a hugely long line like I have heard and read about -- I'm sure the weekend is a completely different story, though.  I ordered the eclaire and lemon tart, and both were very tasty.  The lemon tart was really light and had just the right amount of tang, and the eclaire was similarly light and the chocolate was delicious.  I'm glad I ordered it to-go, and enjoyed it outside of the bustling cafe!

Around the corner from my old church, I have NEVER seen this place without a line out the door. There is a reason for that and it's worth waiting in the rain without an umbrella. Hot chocolate is wonderful, chocolate mousse, pastrami grilled sandwich is just amazing. A friend had bread pudding and I don't like it. I know, I'm the only one in America, but I don't. But I enjoyed the taste she forced upon me, I must say. Always crowded so if you don't like  crowds be sure to take it to go and on a nice day eat at Dolores Park! or sitting in the gutter, you won't even notice, this place is so delectable

What makes this place special and what I miss about it, is the attention to detail.  It is like they see every croissant, bun and tart as their own masterpiece.  Every little slice of coconut or shaving of chocolate feels like it was brushed on by a meticulous painter.  You really do feel like you have stepped into one of those paintings that used to hang at your nana's house and that you stared up at as a kid. My favorites: the exquisite devil's food cake (served warm), the éclairs, and coconut cream tart--I am having a Pavlovian response just thinking about them. Oh and it is not just about taste.  The smells are what draw you in.  Especially early on a cold morning when the whole world feels like it is just beginning to wake up.  It just draws you in. It's also a great place on Sunday morning--if you get there early enough--to sit down at the sidewalk tables, read the morning paper, have some coffee and enjoy life.  You can see why people move to France and never come back.

Had a great cinnamon bun with orange flavoring, it was caramelized, moist, chewy, flakey on top and dense.  The lemon tart was sour and sweet and the shortbread crust was sweet and crisp.  $8 for both.   Found great parking at 12 noon on a Monday.

My chocolate pudding was sublime, as were the tea-size oatmeal cookies.  Would have liked to try the bread pudding, but they had run out and another batch wasn't expected for 15-20 minutes.  Next time. Didn't mind the wait, and the people around us in line were all pleasant enough.  Probably wouldn't enjoy the shared tables, however, as they looked quite crowded.  But that's why you take it to go.

more than 700 reviews (back then, only the good places had more than 200 reviews) can't be wrong.  cold weather does not stop the lines.  i loved the niman ranch ham croque monsieur--such perfect thick bread.  it's open-faced, and no matter where else I have one, I can't stop comparing it to this one! the croque monsieur ham and asparagus is still good, also have mushroom version, spiced carrot on the side the cheese and bread are still perfection gougeres were flaky and light.  so hard to get the morning buns (will be gone by 10)!  also the lemon and banana cream tarts are good (often sell out of the small ones).  the chocolate pudding is fine chocolate croissant flaky. also it's nice to have this place, pizzeria delfina, and bi-rite creamery all next to each other!  good luck with street parking (check dolores park) weekdays less busy of course

I made a point to come here during my short visit to SF. The bakery items that I ate were very good but I expected better. I've heard so many rave reviews and I think it's unfortunately overrated. The service is painfully slow and the employees don't seem to care or move any faster. The prices are very high for most items, which I wouldn't mind spending if it was warranted. I understand they specialize in bread and it might be worth trying (I didn't) but you can get other items as good or better elsewhere.

tartine has a place of nostalgia in my heart and nostrils. as a newbie in the city, my boyfriend and i were sucked in, not by curiousity of the crowd, but, simply, the smell. we had already eaten breakfast around the corner at dolores park cafe, and sat down for another at tartine. as for those who are bitter about waits, well, it's mostly just the weekend and honestly, it's a great place to have a good conversation. i went there during a dismal apartment hunt to perk up by means of quiche, endive salad and a glass of vouvray (awesome wines by glass-- and yes, wine is also good as a breakfast drink). i was "forced" to sit at a table with a lady who turned out to be amazing-- we talked for two hours. now if quiche can't bring generations together, i don't know what can! anyway, all the best boulangeries and patisseries in paris cultivate a wait. consider it, uhh, culture.

I *heart* Tartine's pastries. Let me help you count the ways: (1) morning bun: I like it when it's more on the well-done side because it's more crispy and less doughy. There's just the right amount of fruity taste that it doesn't overwhelm the entire pastry. (2) fragipane (aka almond croissant): With my love of all things crispy, how could I possibly not put this on my list? The exterior is crispy, including the topping of almonds; and the almond paste does not taste like it's drenched in butter, even if it probably is. (3) ham and cheese croissant (I can't remember the real name): Can anything with cheese ever go wrong? Oh and did I mention it's crispy as well so it's twice the goodness. (4) tarts (specifically coconut and banana): The whipped cream is luscious. The fillings are superb. There's a hidden chocolate surprise in the crust that may overpower the taste but since I love chocolate, I don't mind. (5) passion fruit cake: Real coconut shavings on the exterior. Filling of passion fruit mousse on the inside. It only tastes like it's good for your health. (6) cookies (specifically Mexican wedding and almond meringue): Just try it. I shouldn't even need to write a description. (7) open-faced sandwiches: I prefer the ham but that's a personal preference. Ask them to heat it up so it's crispier. (8) freshly baked walnut bread: Warmed bread with real walnuts (lots of them) can never go wrong. Atkins diet doesn't stand a chance! I don't heart... (1) ...the snooty service. They all seem to be hired from the We're Too Hipster for You Temp Agency but I'll make that sacrifice because of the food. (2) ...finding parking, unless you drive a Mini Cooper and so can fit into those spots not actually large enough to be a real parking spot. (3) ...the slow service. If you see the line out the door and past the benches, expect to wait 25 minutes before you're served. I think they deliberately work slow because serving fast is a violation of their credo. (4) ...the sandwiches. It's not that I dislike them but they are the only things that taste oily. I wiped my mouth of the oil after every bite. (5) ...the amount of gym required to work it off. Check out how much butter they use when you're in line staring at the prep area. You won't be deterred from buying though.

Well my never-ending search for a pastrami sandwich in the bay hit the wall again at Tartine. I ordered the pastrami and got a loaf of bread instead. Both the top and bottom bread was sliced 1" thick. The bread was the European type so it was extra crunchy after they pressed it in the sandwich toaster. In fact, the bread was so crunchy it took all the skin off the roof on my mouth on the way down. Now onto the filling, there was very little considering the 13.50 price tag on that badboy. The sandwich also came with Gruyere cheese which was interesting because the pastrami sandwich traditionally has no cheese, i guess it works because it melts well in the press. Overall, the sandwich was a disaster. I'm positive that the sweets are good because everyone in there was ordering them, however, I don't have a taste for cake or pastry.

Oh, Tartine.  It's gotten to the point where I can't go anywhere in the vicinity of 18th and Guererro without feeling a very strong urge to go in here.  I'll happily wait in the huge line which invariably goes out the door and onto the sidewalk.  Their ham and gruyere pressed sandwich, with a smear of good strong Dijon mustard, is to die for--and I don't use that expression often.  And if you can get past the bakery case without buying anything inside, I applaud you.  Especially the Scharffenberger chocolate pudding, which is super rich and perfect for chocoholics (of whom I am a proud member).  They serve up a very good cappuccino as well.  Makes it hard, VERY hard, to resist this place.

Croissants from Tartine are like no other. Crisp on the outside... warm, buttery, and soft on the inside. Actually, everything appears flavorful. I guess you can add points for organic delicacies and meat from Niman Ranch. The long line is so worth the wait, it's best if you can find a seat and eat your warm delicacy with a hot latte. Also try the Opera Cake!

I wanted to like this place after reading all the raving reviews, but once I reached the front where all the pastries were (after having trouble finding parking and then waiting in line for a while), I was turned off by the high prices and far-from-spectacular portions. I'm not from the Bay area and I guess I am not used to the typical high price-small portion deal that's prevalent in most SF bakeries so it was hard for me to fork over $3.75 for a smallish morning bun.          The morning bun was delicious though. It had lovely sugary glaze that had a hint of orange, and the pastry was cinnamon/sugar goodness. I enjoyed it but I've definitely had better, bigger and less expensive morning buns elsewhere.          Everything looked really delicious at Tartine and the tarts looked very enticing and were fair sizes for the price. It probably is one of the better bakeries in SF and I was glad to try it once, but as everything is $4 and up, I probably won't be coming back. Visiting San Fran is already expensive as it is.

i am so sad that i only had a chance to stop by towards the end of the day during my recent visit to SF, and i wasn't able to try more of their treats!  i picked up some pastries mostly for my mom, so i got things she likes- lemon cream tart, shortbread, plus a chocolate chip cookie for myself.  my mom and i both agreed the lemon tart and shortbread were perfect.  the tart had a delicious crust that was just the right thickness, enough to provide a textural contrast to the filling but still fork-tender.  and the shortbread was probably the most delicious shortbread i've ever had!  the chocolate chip cookie was good too-- i personally prefer chewier cookies, but if you like thin crispy cookies, this one was top notch. i really wanted to try the tres leches cake and the coconut cream tart, but they had run out of slices/individual sizes by then =( looks like i'll have to make another visit when i'm back for christmas!

Amazing Bakery! My wife and I went here during an anniversary trip to San Fran this past summer. We were shocked at the line wrapping itself around the corner (at first we thought it was a food kitchen line since there is a church nearby). The wait was about 30-40 minutes but we were encouraged by reviews we read on Yelp and the testament of a huge line. We had an assortment of treats: an eclair, a fresh berry torte, a morning bun, a gougère, and strawberry bread pudding. The gougère was possibly  our favorite items; so light and fluffy, but packed full of flavor. The morning bun didn't make a lasting memory, but the rest was above par. Helpful Hint: Mission Dolores Park is only a block away making it a perfect picnic place! Tartine was so wonderful we went back the next day with my sister we picked from the airport. Since we went a little later in the day we were able to eat from the lunch menu. All the sandwiches were amazing; a little greasy since they are grilled, but so worth it (I don't remember the 3 sandwiches we shared). We also had a lemon tart, another gougère:) a big slice of tres leche cake, and I may be forgetting one or two items. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the tres leche, it was very light and creamy and did not have an overly coconutty flavor. My sister ordered some coffee drink (latte maybe?) and it came in a huge bowl-like cup. I attempted to order the same drink, but the barista was talking with his friend about tennis or raquetball and didn't really help with my order. The friend was a customer so I'm not counting it against them, I just ended up with a different cup of coffee. Tartine is so good we are planning on going back in December. We live in Tahoe but planned our flight out of San Francisco so we would have an excuse to visit again! I'm sure they will come through again. TSA better let us take our pastry boxes through security!

I wanna give you five stars, Tartine, I really do! But your 'tude and disorganization make it impossible.  I agree with a previous review that the Croque Monsieur is superb.  I had it a few years ago and am still searching DC for one that comes close.  Another hot tip: preorder the bread. Crispy on the outside, light and fluffy with the perfect amount of airpockets on the inside. A little crunch and then it melts in your mouth. Divine.

My friends and I stumbled onto this place on our last trip to SF.  We each ordered a sandwich.  All of them were delicious but a little greasy.  We also ordered two desserts. One was a lemon cake and it was okay. The other was a Berry Bavarian Cake and it was freakin' awesome. The berries were fresh and the cream was so light.  I would definitely come back when I'm in town. The only bad thing is parking is difficult to find, long lines, and seating is limited. But, totally worth all the trouble.

I'm definitely a fan, but call me crazy, for this being what some say the best bakery in San Fran, I was not blown away.  It was definitely good, but by the line, you would think that its the only bakery in the city.  Had the chocolate nut thing, the bread pudding, and the lemon tart.  Everything was good, but cannot understand why the line took so long.  The pasty selection was good, but not overly large, so why it takes ppl there ages to decide what they want, I cannot fathom.

Fruit tarte to die for. Super crowded but that's because its amazing. My friend had some kind of chocolate mousse which was also quite lovely. If I had a lot of money I would serve tartine at my wedding, or if I really had a lot of money I would open a tartine in my kitchen.

I just went in for a pastry while my friend Brad wanted a bite to eat.  The Lemon Cream Tart I had was delicious and Brad's panini was HUGE.  He had to take half of it home.  Will definitely go back.

I hate waiting in lines and having no table to eat at.  But this is the one place I look forward to going to, and having to eat my breakfast on a bench in the city cuz the restaurant is packed!!  Best pastries here - croissants are to die for.  The ham and cheese croissant and their morning buns - WOW.

Strolled in on a Tuesday afternoon and I was surprised to see there was still a morning bun left for me!  I've heard so much about it, I eagerly snapped it up.  Definitely yummy with it's orange cinnamon goodness, but I have to admit that I like the morning buns at La Farine in Oakland a little better.  However, the pastry that I can't get enough of is the banana cream tart!  Rich chocolate, creamy banana...  mmm...

I hold their bread pudding close to my heart like a boyfriend. I've never had anything there I didn't care for and they don't skimp on portions. If you're feeling like you don't give a shit about calories, which I never give a shit about, try the pastries. The coconut tart is unreal. Do NOT think that you can stop in for a quick bite. Unless you can time it right and hit a lull, you will be waiting in line. And also, keep a sharp eye out for table spots, because they don't come around often. It is best in the summer when you can take your treats a block over to the park and eat orgasm food in the sunshine. Word. I saw that someone below posted a review that complained about female workers armpit hair...seriously? Not only have I never noticed armpit hair, but what does that have to with anything? Let's stay relevent when yelping. Thanks.

Great spot, I go back again and again for the breakfast pastries and the good coffee. They do a great job on flavor concentration and beautiful presentation even with the high volume - don't let the small space fool you, this place is very busy. There is always a line out the door and it can take awhile (10+ minutes) of standing in line to get your order in, but it seems to always work out on getting a seat just in time to eat. It's probably tough for any group over four, but working with the other customers get enough chairs together is part of the charm. Agoraphobics should steer clear - it's a tight spot and ALWAYS crowded.

This may be the best bakery in the city...The food is delicious as the the hot pressed sandwiches are made on their homemade bread each morning. These sandwiches are unbelievably large and thus are perfect to share. Full of unique ingredients. Enjoy the Fromage Blanc and Banana if you want something a little sweet. Use local cheese (cowgirl fromage blanc), sliced bananas, and quince jam. Their quiches are also excellent - light, fluffy, and flavorable as a quiche should be and the crust is flaky and sweet similar to their pastry dough. Not to be missed, and great to take home for later. Finally, you cannot leave tartine without some kind of cream tart. My personal favorite is the coconut, but the banana cream is also delectable. The place is always bustling and it has a wonderful crowd of people who gather around to enjoy great food with great company and conversation.

Being a sucker for pastries and sweet delights, I had to try Tartine Bakery. Reading the reviews, I could not help but choose the frangipane tart, which was AMAZING. Not only was the pastry beyond delicious, the service was great and the individuals working here make me want to come back for me!

Time to update: Would all the contenders line up please and you will be picked in order from BEST to Meh: 1. Brioche Bread pudding- never had bread pudding before, but brioche can do no wrong. AMAZING. 2. Lemon Tart- A very hard thing to make perfectly but Tartine does it. The crust is so crunchy and the lemon is perfection. Lemon bar is great too. 3. Passionfruit coconut cake- The cake is so fluffy and the passionfruit creme is tangy, delicious 4. Chocolate mouse- to my surprise it wasn't too bitter like most dark chocolate and I can't see how anyone wouldn't like this- very good quality chocolate 5. Coconut creme pie- good flavor just nothing special 6. Eclair- cream filling was delicious, but i HATE dark chocolate and that's what covered the top-totally ruined it for me 7. The Bread- good, crispy crust and CHEWY mmmmm... like it, but Semifreddi's is still my first love (The BF hated it, but it's because he's french and american bread will never be good enough lol) Ok, I'm going to go work out now.. you go to tartine

I like the food fine at Tartine. I'm a partial foodie. I enjoy good food, but am not constantly comparing one place to the next. I probably wont be going back to Tartine, even though I live around the corner. I can deal with the awkward space, and usually try to go on weekday mid mornings to avoid the line. BUT the people, WOW. I'm so sorry counter girl that I dared to tell you that you are out of coffee. Its not like I asked if you serve frappucinos. Its sad because, Ive paid the $50 um-teen times for their cakes, etc, and have really enjoyed them. But I expect a little decency. I don't want to be your bff and deal with awkward small talk. I actually hate that. But rolling your eyes when I dare address you, is beyond. Hey, turns out Bi-rite has amazing baked goods too. So I no longer need to deal with you Tartine.

Ok, I've had limited Tartine experience, but I have to tell you that the Humbolt Fog grilled cheese sandwich is completely outrageous (in an "I can't believe how decadent this is" kind-of way) and the bread...oh, the bread!

Wonderful, a place to meet friends or impress out of town guests.  The frangipane croissant and morning buns are our favorites, and the quiche satisfies savory urges.  But be prepared to wait and to fight for a table -- it's worth it.

What else can be said about Tartine?  Not much.  Place is unreal and the daily lines prove it. Here's my short list if you're a first timer.  Best to bring a few friends and share... Gougere - best thing.  It's a little puff pastry of pepper/cheese love.   Bread pudding - very tasty, very filling.   Quiches - amazing.  I'd been going to Tartine for a year before I tried one.  That's a year of mistakes.   Croissants - pretty good, not my favorite but seem to be a hit. Morning bun - I'm not a fan.  Some like it and I think it's one of their most popular items.  Don't make it the only thing you get, that's all I'd say. Their coffee isn't the best, but they make a damn good cafe au lait.

Having never experienced anyone lining up to buy a pastry and coffee, I admit I was transfixed by the dedication of San Franciscans...once we got inside I was delighted with my morning roll with orange glaze plus coffee chosen with restraint from among many luscious baked goods.  In flooding the sidewalk outside Tartine each weekend, regular customers demonstrate their strong attachment  toward this singular neighborhood bakery, surrounding it as one would a precious gem. If you are in the neighborhood, stop by--it is worth the wait.

If you are looking for the most other-wordly pain au chocolat experience, look no further than Tartine. I am not a fan of most pastries but honestly cannot resist Tartine's chocolate crossiants, made with Scharffenberger chocolate and surely a lb. or two of butter. I also really like how the lattes at Tartine are served in bowls - there is just something so comforting about cupping my hands around a bowl of hot coffee...Ah but a word to the impatient, Tartine is not a place to go when you're in a hurry, or when you have a big group of hungry people...it is always packed with locals and given the recent James Beard accolades (naming Tartine's two owners the best pastry chefs/bakers in the US), I'm guessing the line will only get longer...

I went to this place not as an after thought while visiting San Fran but as as a last minute decision on the way to the airport, but I could not think of a better reason to stand in line and then wait for seating.  And open sandwich with lots of cheese and tomatoes... and lemon cream tart with REAL.. and I mean real whip cream on top.  The sandwich was so huge I had to share it and did not finish it and the lemon tart was out of this world.  yes I am still dreaming about it.

So after reading reviews here and on chowhound, I had to go. I'm a dessert person and am always looking for great sweets to eat. There was no parking so I got out as my dh circled and eventually double parked. There was a line out the door at 1:30 Saturday afternoon.  I called and text my dh when I got closer to the desserts to tell him the choices. No reception! Ok it was broken reception, same thing! Get a booster people your phone has to work at all times or forget it. 1 star so far off from me. The choices were fancy sweets no good old fashion cookies and cakes. Very played with type desserts. Everyone there raved about the lemon tart with whipped cream and the fruit tart. So I went with the line of people ordering that. The staff was unfriendly and not helpful. They just wanted to keep the line moving.  The person in front and behind me got the same treatment. We were both from the east coast and were surprised of the lack of service.  Very expensive for not great dessert. The lemon tart was way too sweet and after 2-3 bites I was finished, very unlike me. I love sweet. The fruit tart had a dry crust. My dh felt similarly. We threw it out. What a waste!

I have a love-hate relationship with this place.  I LOVE their bread (especially the sesame) warm and fresh and I LOVE their croissants and morning buns.  I just wish it was easier to get the croissants hot out of the oven. But their customer service can be spotty.  And I hate that there is always a line (I know, not really their fault--it's tough being popular).  Even at 8:30 on a Saturday, which really takes the fun out of getting up early.  And some of their desserts are really just so-so. At least not on par with the above mentioned items. I recently had a cake from here at a birthday party and was seriously unimpressed. I couldn't help but wonder wondering how much it must have cost the hostess. This place isn't budget. And I am sad that they have raised their prices on bread. But I guess there's demand... I still get it on occasion. I also wish they had a better system for ordering the bread.   Their hot sandwiches are good and gigantic.  Share them...or you may not want to eat again for a looong while.  I like to ask for mine without oil, so it's not too greasy.  The cheese inside generally provides enough grease and ooziness.  But that's just my preference.

Good...

Like most others, the line in this place kills me - waiting 30 minutes while smelling buttery goodness is akin to torture on a Saturday or Sunday morning. But, when I finally do sink my teeth into the pain au jambon - it hurts so good. I don't think I've tried anything that I haven't liked - but I have to say that their grilled ham and cheese sandwich is divine.

Whats up with all the Francophilia in the reviews.  It is damn good pastry straight up.  No snobbery at all.  Nice friendly staff (some are kinda cute in that indie kinda way).  I moved to a place two blocks away just so I can have it at least once a week.  I cant find a therapy that can replace it.  Seating is the downside, not enough, and patrons arent eye candy.

Now that it's jumped the shark, and now that I've found tastier pastry places, I just find no reason to go here, nor wait in the god-awful line. Oh, and the ham and cheese croissant was so rich, one day, that I got sick. Better shops? check out Brioche in North Beach.

Yes. There is a long line to enter but it is well worth every second. Of course, the desserts are excellent. Lemon tarts....mmmm. However, in addition, the sandwiches and the quiches are money! The latte, from what I've heard from a very reliable source, is excellent. Tartine is also located in a very vibrant neighborhood, with Dolores Park close by. On a sunny day, it is just great to come here, grab a bite and go exploring the city.

You can't go through the Mission without seeing a long line wrap around the corner of Guerrero and 18th all because of this little bakery/cafe and for good reason.  Everything I've had here is phenomenal.  The most recent item I had was a sandwich and boy are they pricey ($10+).  However, they are quite big so two people can easily share one sandwich and be satisfied.  As for pastries I can speak for the morning buns, eclairs and bread pudding--YUM.  If I lived in the Mission, I'd probably gain 30 lbs from visiting this place because everything on the menu is good.

Came here on a rainy Sunday, so the line was not out the door! Yay! Ordered the banana cream tart because of all the raving reviews about it. To be honest, I didn't find it particularly special. It was good, but definitely not worth $6.50. The place was too crowded, so there wasn't really anywhere to eat. The banana cream tart is definitely a sit-down type of food. We attempted to eat it in the car but gave up on that idea quickly. Got home and tried to cut it up since there's no way you can bite into it since it is pretty massive. The crust is thick and hard and almost impossible to cut through. The banana cream was good but still not worth $6.50 in my opinion. I would like to come back though to try other things.

Tartine's has the best quiche I've ever tasted! Their frangipane almond croissant is also very scruptious. It's the best I've ever had before. I also recommend the morning bun. The chocolate croissant is mediocre because it has too much dough in it. I say that because I was spoiled with EXCELLENT chocolate croissant from Paris and Napa.

The croque monsieur, albeit a bit pricey, had a wonderful mixture of flavors--sundried tomato, ham, and gruyere cheese all blended together perfectly. This is definetly the place to take out of towners or to satisfy your lazy sundays.

I have been hearing about Tartine Bakery since I can remember. I finally decided to make the trek over and wait in the long weekend lines this past weekend when I had to go into the office on a Saturday.  I waited for almost 30 minutes - but let me tell you - WORTH THE WAIT! I ordered the ham and cheese croissant and a large latte. It was so good I have been thinking about it non-stop! I spent some time in France this past summer, and the croissant at Tartine was BETTER than anything I had in France (and these were not touristy places either).  My only suggestion is that they need larger to-go coffee cups - I need at least 3 cups before I am nice on a weekend morning. :-) Overall the staff was great, the ambiance was great, and the food is fabulous!

I'd been bugged by so many people to check this place out that I finally went in. 30 minutes in a line didn't help, but once I sat down, my almond croissant was FANTASTIC! Really soft inside with a tougher outter shell (although it probably would've been a little softer if it were fresh). I want to go back and try a sandwich.

There's probably not too much I can add to what's already been said. The line moves fairly quickly and gives you the time you'll need to try to decide on that one (or two) things to eat. We had a group of 5 for my first time there and ordered 6 items (which was kinda gratuitous) which we all got to share. Finding a place to sit might be difficult, but we were lucky enough to swoop in just as a group was leaving. Minus one star for the thin/watery chai latte... it tasted more like chai tea with a splash of milk.

Yummy sandwiches! Love the sandwich bread. The swiss chard quiche was good, but the sandwiches are better. Try one of those fruit and cheese sandwiches, they're really yummy (even though it sounds a bit weird). Coffee was okay, it had a unique, not for me, flavor. All in all, would love to come back again next time I'm in town.

uhhhhhh...i really dont see what the fuss about this place is about except for this quiet, quaint little bakery bustling with people from all walks of life... 4.5 stars on YELP, decided to give it a try...IMO its only 3.5 or maybe I tried the wrong things again =[ Parking in the area is a nuisance, circled around several times before we were able to actually find parking. Ambiance - reminds me of Betty's Bakesale (another sandwich/bakery place) but with more pastries & baked goodies and also a bit more expensive. Food: Prosciutto+Provolone Sandwich - decent, but super heavy (i.e. the spray or oil they used to grease the grill/press the sandwich was seeping through my fingers after only eating a portion of the sandwich).  I cant seem to pinpoint the type of bread it is, but it is a bit thick. Spicy Turkey Sandwich - surprisingly same toast issue, but tasted better in that it was more flavorful & tastier. Hazelnut Torte - they use Scharfenberger chocolate, which is a bit rich.  This needs to be enjoyed with a tall glass of milk. Rocher with Chocolate - very light and airy pastry-like. Bread Pudding - im not too fond of this but my bf wanted to try and he was not a fan, glad we only got a cup of it and not a bowl. Coconut Macaroons - one of the better macaroons with a light lemon-y center.  The crust is solid and the insides are moist & soft, very similar to Ici's Macaroons. Price - WHOA WHOA WHOA, i literally spent like $40 here for lunch (since sandwiches ~$11/$12 and the baked goods are NOT cheap)  IMO, pricey. Oh yeah, the wait for the food was not too friendly either - hmmm...not sure if I'll come back, but if I do, I'll need to give the morning bun (was too full to consume anymore) and this amazing banana cream torte (they ran out when we got there) a shot.

high quality ingredients. consistently good. whipped creme tastes like milk, the chocolate is dark , and the bread pudding tastes like flan, with the consistency of bread. only complaints- line is long. seating is limited. it's far from the bart. and the chocolate shell coating inside the banana creme tart is hard to cut into.

Thank you Tartine!!!!! Not just for your fantastic representation of french pastries and delights, but for sharing the recipes with the world to make at home!  I first bought the Tartine cookbook never before visiting the cafe.  So far the few recipes I have attempted have been a success which is pretty rare for me.  The banana cream tart recipe had me feeling like a pro with bananas and a light custard encased in a buttery flaky crust, topped with fresh whip cream and chocolate shavings!!! Upon visiting San Francisco, I already had an idea of how good it would be, but I am happy to say that it was even better than I imagined!!  And I haven't even yet tried the croissants or bread pudding yet! Tres leches cake- do not come here and not try this.  Coconut chiffon cake soaked in sweet milk and layered with an indescribably good frosting. Banana cream tart-  decadent and light as a cloud all at once Chocolate Eclair-  a classic elevated by the highest quality of chocolate and attention to detail Almon rocher-  crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside with a lovely almond flavor Croquet Monsieur with mushrooms- Ever so packed with burnt cheesy goodness and such a nice texture from the mushrooms and bread Nettle quiche-  best quiche I've ever had.  Defying gravity almost since I'm used to such dense heavy quiches in the past. I may live over 500 miles away, but the though of Tartine is never to far from my mind.

Yeah, I'm gonna have to disagree here with most and say this place is such a scene but I'm not all that impressed with the food or pastries.  It was fine, but not worth the wait.  I've had better sandwiches around the corner at Dolores Park Cafe, where at least you might get a chance to sit.  SO overrated.

I know it is near sacrilege to say it, but I don't really dig their pastries all that much.  Now, I am a girl that digs on the butter and the cream - the more fat the better is my usual motto, but sometimes the pastries at Tartine taste pretty much like I am eating straight lard. It is just more than I can stomach.  It also doesn't help me like their pastries any more that I have to wait in line for 30 minutes to get them, invariably with some dude talking really loudly into his cell phone or some kids who are tired of waiting and turn to brattiness to combat their boredom.

If you are one of the many San Franciscans that hasn't been to Tartine,  get yourself over there. There will be a line out the door, but it moves quickly and this place knows how to make bread and pastries. Face it - if Delfina serves their bread, you are guaranteed this place is good. Best breakfast pics: the morning bun, any croissant (can you say butter?!) and the croque monsier. Lattes are delicious and doubles are served in a bowl! With these tips, your experience will be better...... 1. Be prepared to stand in line 5 - 20 minutes 2. Go with someone so while they hold your spot in line, you can go inside to the separate drink counter. Order, pay, and take drinks back to comfort  you in line. Otherwise, your drinks will be ready 10 minutes after you start eating. 3. Do not expect a quiet or private experience. Seating is limited and it is cramped. 4. Don't hesitate to ask for your food to be re-heated. While the food was recently baked, it tastes much better hot and they are happy to do it. 5. Buy shortbread cookies - a lot of them. If you are too full to eat them, take them home. I promise you will be happy you did! Why not 5 stars? Because it doesn't have the ambiance I like for a breakfast/pastry place. It's not a spot to hang out and sip your coffee because there are 20 people waiting for a place to sit down. And you don't want to be the rude guy reading while others are waiting to sit down and eat.

I ordered the banana cream tart and hot chocolate. The crust of the tart was very hard, but the banana cream made it all worth it. I was regretting that I ordered the $6.95 tart, but the sweet banana glaze, fresh banana slices, and light whipped cream made the $6.95 seem reasonable. The price for the hot chocolate was average along with the taste but the cup size was petite. This corner cafe with no visible name gives the urban feel of a loud atmosphere, and semi sticky shared tables. But the cafe does provide an issue of The Onion!

Suffice it to say I no longer eat croissants elsewhere for fear that I am wasting my croissant quota for the week and instead save it for the slim possibility that I may actually wake up at a decent hour on the weekend and wait 30 minutes in line around the corner to enjoy one of these amazing treats. Sounds incredibly pretentious, I know, and I slightly hate myself for it, but these are hands down the best croissants I have ever eaten.

this place is completely overrated. I had a hot pressed sandwich for $12, which was full of grease and the bread was 90% of the sandwich.  I also paid $4 for a cappucino, which honestly, was half the size of one I'd get from Starbucks for the same price, and it wasn't half as good. Biggest scam.

Lemon meringue cake was good, my milk was kinda a creamed out whole milk that they eyeballed into a 1%... get anything here to go unless the place is totally empty which it won't be.  it is too crowded to eat in... that is my only real complaint with this place.  DONT dine in unless you want to get bumped in to by people trying to maneuver strollers and crap.  This place is too small for a stroller.  If you bring a stroller in you are an idiot even if your baby is cute.  Get an f-ing bike lock for your stroller  and carry your baby if you must.

Get the bread pudding.  Seriously... GET IT!  The bread pudding is worth 5 stars.  The sandwiches and croissants get 2 stars.  I would not order them again.  Service gets 3 stars because I don't like to clean up after myself.  Overall, I still think this place is worth the wait in line but only for the bread pudding.  Seating was quite hard to find.  It was also hard to navigate through the crowd of people without fearing that I would spill my bread pudding all over someone by accident.  However, the ordering line did move quicker than expected.

My friends and I came over here over the weekend. It was about 1:30, and there was a line about 30 minutes long. My friend was really concerned that they would be out of morning buns, but they had a ton. We ordered two of the morning buns, the ham and cheese croissant, the bread pudding, and the banana creme tart. First I have to say that I was not really too impressed by the morning bun or the bread pudding. I'm not quite sure why, but even though they were relatively good, I don't think it was worth waiting in line for. My boyfriend tried the ham and cheese croissant and really liked it. We put the tart in the refrigerator and had it the next day. And OMG, that tart was amazing! Chunks of banana in creme, with chocolate shavings on top, and chocolate just on top of the crispy wonderful crust. That item alone was worth the long wait.

Unfairly lauded bakery in San Francisco, I suppose it's pretty good, for America. Buss your own dishes? How not fancy Ok Lemon pound cake - best thing I had, maybe a zest too much lemon? Frangipane (almond) croissant - really good, maybe a bit too rich Hot chocolate can be quite good So so Bread pudding, not really my thing Pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant): too big, so big what the hell, not all that bad but something is amiss Pass Croissant - lacks butter and ultimately flavor, is of course too big, good texture/flakiness Lemon tartelette - lemon overtakes the tart.. granted I had let mine sit for a few days so maybe that did it Scone - quite gross, all hard and stuff, maybe I just don't like em in general Looking good Fresh berry tartelette (sorry to be redundant but it does look huge also) Lines out the door, every morning, afternoons are much less crowded

So, why am I writing yet another review of Tartine? Because there are too many people out there unwilling to try it 'cause it's always so packed. Well, here's the tip. Go on a friday, after work.

When I first saw how pricey the items were, I was a little skeptical, but it was worth EVERY penny! I had the Prechutto and Provolone sandwich which was superb!! The flavors were incredible plus it was a very large portion. I also had the eclair which was very rich and a chocolat lover's delite. Very laid back place, only downsides I could find were that it's a really small place with limited seating and you have to bus your own tables.

I don't really think this place needs another review. The quality of the bread here is beyond contestation. Yes I just made that into a noun. I grew up eating cheap croissants and this place has ruined me. I can only enjoy them here now. Rich, crisp, and buttery, you can't have two. Can't really write too much about it, its an experience. Any bread item here is just stellar and I really like the pickled baby carrots with the sandwiches. The patisserie side of things is pretty damn good too. This is also the first bakery I've known to donate the day's leftovers. All that aside an amazing bakery that is mostly organic and they try to serve local ingredients as well. -1 star for the occasional lackluster service.

My favourite bakery in the city! Why? The gougeres are to die for!!!! The cakes are delicate, not too sweet and the ingredients used are top notched! I had to remove one star because of the extremely long lines! No matter how much I love the place, I cannot justify standing in line for 20 mn just to get my gougeres fix! Weekends are extremely crowded but if you need a cake for a birthday celebration, this is the place to go.

The pastries here are delicious, though I usually get the bread pudding. For me, that's saying something: bread pudding is stupidly easy to make at home, and when I go out I usually go for something I can't do myself. Tartine's brioche bread pudding, though, it's something else. Mostly I stop by for the bread, though. There's no line at 6:00 on a Wednesday, and the bread is fresh and hot from the oven and still too sticky and squishy to cut. I buy a loaf for $5, then put half in the freezer for later. Even re-thawed, it's better than any other bread in the city. Updated 5/3/11: I really can't think of anywhere else that's been this good for this long. Five stars it is!

I feel obliged to chime in here. It's Tartine's fault that I can't eat a croissant from anywhere else. The morning buns are a dream, but I can't handle the mess on my way to BART. When I have time to sit down, I have the bread pudding, or the best a bowl of mushy bread can ever taste. It's hard for me to branch out. I've had bites of the Croque Monsieur's and Madame's, and ogled over others' hot pressed sandwiches. But I can't get past the plain croissants - at the same time, why should I if they're so damn good?

Five stars for food. One star for attitude. I agree that tipping is a great idea and would prevent people from having a shitty attitude. However, if all you've been given by the staff is shitty attitude, I don't see how a tip, which is given at the end of the service, is going to suddenly make the shitty attitude go away. Anyway, I believe that people should not have to pay each other for common courtesy. Tips are for excellent service, not excellent attitude. I'm not talking about normal levels of "she must be having a terrible day" shitty attitude. I'm talking "I work in a fabulous bakery and therefore am something special and you're an incompetent moron who's dared to sully our floors with your giant clodhopper feet" shitty attitude. And, yeah, some stuff looked burnt. Honestly burnt, not butter- or sugar-browned. It's too hard to get to and the attitude left me cold, so I'm not going back. There are plenty of other very good bakeries around, or I can just make my own.

I've been here before and didn't have a memorable experience but yesterday, my husband and I decided to try it again - we should have stayed home. I have to admit, the food was good but I didn't like the service at all. The staff seemed a little...arrogant. First, I asked about the ingredients in the quiche, the woman tells me there are two, ham and tomato/chard. I ask what else is in the first one, she tells me (while looking at me like I'm an idiot), "Ham." So I say, there's no cheese and she says, "Yes, there's cheese." So again I say, "what else is in the ham quiche?" I didn't even care anymore, I was just pissed that she was being a jerk face.  BTW, there was cheese in the Tomato/Chard quiche too. On to what we ordered: chocolate walnut cookie, hazelnut biscotti, croque monsieur, and pastrami with no cheese nor mayo (my husband is particular about his sandwich spreads so he carefully studied the menu and he doesn't like cheese or mayo). I have to admit, the croque monsieur was pretty good however, my husband didn't get his pastrami sandwich for 22 additional minutes. On top of that, it had mustard and something else that wasn't listed on the menu that of course my husband didn't like. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the attitude nor the wait. I also didn't like that the non-specificity about the ingredients that they use. Tartine prides themselves on using only the best products well, why don't they tell us what they are. And when customers are asking questions, why not answer - with a smile. And get the pastrami out before the customer decides they no longer want it. Oh yea, and this sandwich that my husband got late with the ingredients that he didn't like cost $13.50...he only ate the meat. I doubt that he ate $13.50 worth of meat and the more I write the more I doubt that Tartine deserved a 3 - wish I could do 2.5.

mmmmmm baked goods. my friend and i came here on a saturday afternoon and boy was it difficult to find parking. i suggest barting it if you can avoid driving. the line was out the door and along the building but the wait wasnt too bad. we were there for maybe 30 mins at MOST.. in fact now that i think about it, it was probably 15-20mins. anyways baked goods are all fresh. i got myself a raisin bun and a croissant while my friend got a lemon tart. the bun and croissant were amazing. crispy and flakey on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. i didnt try the tart but my friend gobbled it up. she said it was super creamy and the caramel center made it even better. however theres a chocolate layer on the bottom and breaking that thing was no easy task. she struggled splitting it up. it can get pretty stuffy inside so we took some tables outside in the gorgeous sun. if you want, take it to dolores park for a quick picnic! good times at this place. awesome bakery

Coconut Creme Pie- Super hard crust; it was so hard to cut! The inside of the pie was pretty good though. It was just so frustrating to eat the pie that I gave up less than half way. Bread Pudding- Soggy bread + fruit? It was alright but it wasn't ALLLL that. Shortbread- the bf liked it Lines- Don't be intimidated, it moves pretty fast so be patient. Seating- Awful, just take it home. Although I ordered to eat there and couldn't get a seat so my bf and I just stood and ate the goodies from the plate. That was lame. I'm gonna have to come back for their acclaimed Morning Bun and perhaps fresher baked goods and maybe I'll change my mind.

Sandra has it right! The baked goods are scrumptious but why don't they separate out a take-out line or something, ANYTHING to get the line moving faster? and you can't get fresh baked bread in the morning--you have to order it and come back later in the afternoon. It's just inconvenient. also: have you ever had to wait in line for an hour and then learn they *ran out* of croissants moments before your turn? I have! It's just cruelty!

Absolutely the worst at doing special orders.  I have experienced nothing worse in the universe. Tartine needs to consider investing in a more professional operation or simply shut down the 'special orders' business.  After multiple phone calls and emails I did get my 2 custom cakes.  Each one of my calls went straight to voicemail.  In the end, was it worth the excruciation and pain.  NO.

I cannot understand why everyone raves about this place. Yes, they serve tasty cakes and desserts. But so do a bunch of other places. I too saw the line snaking around the corner but they were quick and I got my turn within 5 minutes. No complaints there. I tried their fruit pudding and an open faced sandwich. The pudding was ok, but the open faced sandwich was mediocre. For $9.75 I would have expected a lot lot better. Maybe these are not their best dishes but I dont think I will go back again. There are a number of other nicer bakeries in the City that serve much better food for the same price.

Oh my goodness.  This place seriously has the most amazing pastries I've ever had.  Take your choice, you can't go wrong.  There is always a line, always. But of all the lines you will wait in, this one is so worth it! And it is tiny and cramped and usually crazy busy and hectic feeling, but all this is worth it, seriously. I have been there two times and neither time have I gotten to eat in the actual restaurant, but I cannot wait to go back.  Try one savory and one sweet.  Two amazing choices are the ham and cheese croissant (buttery and tasty and melty!) and the morning bun (buttery and gooey and sweet and chewy)! The pain au chocolat is also incredible!

Wow!  Keep me out of here.  My sweet tooth sometimes gets the best of me.  Going here proves it.  I stopped by here based on a recommendation on Eye On the Bay.  I sampled the sandwiches my friends ordered.  So good.  I ordered the lemon tart and quiche, also very tasty.  My friend also had the gingerbread which melted in my mouth.  We had to really scope out and swoop in for a table but it's totally worth going here.  The line moves pretty fast and the prices are relatively decent.  Yummy yummy for the tummy.

I can't believe Tartine actually exists. How can a bakery create such magic in its ovens? The brownies disdain being sickeningly fudgy, opting instead to let their chocolate flecks melt on your tongue. The lemon tart flaunts a crisp, clean, and creamy lemon custard on an impossibly tender shortbread base that makes me want to cry. And the bruschetta, fresh cakes, and the brioche bread pudding all looked scrumptious. I think I may need to give up baking. Such bliss will never be attained in my humble kitchen.

Yes, the food is amazing (especially the bread), but I think Tartine is a little over-hyped. Everything is very expensive, and the line is ridiculous. It took me 45 minutes to get a couple of morning buns. If you are willing to wait for good food and you're not on a budget though, I would definitely recommend this bakery.

My sisters had raved about this place, so I made the effort to go when I was in town. The first challenge will be to find a parking space. I think we went by close to 2:00 and it took us a good 10-15 minutes to find a place to park, followed by a long walk to the bakery. Once you enter, you're confronted by a small shop full of delicious-looking goodies, accompanied by sky-high prices. $36 for a 6" cake? Yikes! Wife and I split a Turkey sandwich that was very good and large enough for both of us, and we also got a lemon tart and a chocolate-hazelnut tart. Both were great, but probably not worth the $6 each that they cost. My take is if you don't care about cost, then the food is great. If you do care about cost, you can probably get equal food elsewhere for cheaper.

Remember the feeling of disbelief and overwhelming jealousy as you watched those brats in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory walk into Willy Wonka's sugary haven? You try and put yourself in their shoes and wonder, where would I start? The lemon candy tea cups? The chocolate waterfall? The giant licorice whip flowers? Ah, too many tooth decaying options to choose from!!! I had a similar feeling upon entering Tartine... Charlie and the Chocolate Factory haven of the 3-D adult variety. Sweet or savory? One of both. Savory is easy, going with the quiche. Now for sweet............................................ coconut cream, banana cream, seasonal fruit, passion fruit.... Too many options.... Close eyes, purse lips, wave pointing finger around... pick a spot.... Open eyes.... Banana cream it is! My method, while unorthodox, proved quite effective. With a wonderfully flakey crust, full slices of banana, rich banana cream, topped off with dark chocolate strips, I was in that diabetic bliss I'd fantasized about as a child. The half an hour line was worth every second.

okay, i've been to paris, and lived in montreal for 3 years. I've had crepes and croque monsieur up the wazoo and have lost my taste for sugar in my old age. However, it's the quiche, baby, the quiche. Light, fluffy, ham and bacon filled and HUGE slices, and for under $5. Jesus i want a quiche for my birthday cake. We had a birthday party for the chef at minako ( judy's mother). Her cake was a monster size eclair from tartine. nuff said whatever with the line - check out the ass in front of you and ogle away.

I wish the chocolate hazlenut tart came in toothpaste form, then I could brush my teeth with it. Not that my dentist would appreciate that, but she introduced me to this place, so.... all's well that ends up cavity filled?

I just don't get all the hype. Compared to Thorough Bread a couple of blocks away, Tartine was a disappointment. I didn't mind queuing or even being unable to get a table, but I do object to the server being downright rude. Because it was packed and the rock music rather loud, I had to ask her to repeat herself a few times and she was very huffy and kept rolling her eyes. As I was giving my order she kept walking off, so we didn't even get half the items we'd asked for. Also, we were told one of the pressed sandwiches we wanted would take 25 minutes! My husband enjoyed his croque Monsieur but I have definitely had better quiche - the pastry was over done, as was the gougere. I will definitely be sticking to Thorough Bread in future for its better selection of cakes, pastry and bread, and pleasant counter staff.

This place is the Mama's of SF bakeries. Their morning bun and other pastries or OK, but nothing worth waiting in that long line for. Boulange has better food. The quiche is underwhelming and $9 for a loaf of bread is just ridiculous. Acme bread is so much better and a fraction of the price.

OMG OMG OMG! OMG! oh and OMG! I tried Tartine's on a recent SF trip and I am SO glad I did. This was the best French bakery I've ever had. This is also my first french bakery I've ever had hahahha but it be damn good. Ordered the Seasonal fruit bread pudding, chocolate au pain thing, almond croissant, and cinnamon orange morning bread thing that looks like a cinnamon roll. Everything was sooooooooooooooooooo good. The bread pudding has a very eggy creamy taste. It was really good, but I would not order it again (rather save my tummy for the other even more exquisite baked goods. Glad I tried it though. The chocolate bread thing was my fav. The chocolate had great cocoa flavor baked to perfection. Croissant was so damn good as well. The slightly burnt exterior had such yummy toasty flavor. The morning bun was saved for the next day's breakfast and it was still amazing the day after!!! Overall, I would consider this place a MUST TRY. Warning, it does not have a sign so use your smart phone. There is a tote hanging with Tartine printed on it inside the window though. Only bad point is the line. I waited about 45 minutes.

I had heard amazing things about this place, and for the most part, I was not disappointed! We tried a few things,a friand,(small chocolate cake about the size of a truffle, filled with chocolate ganache.: it was a little more bitter than I personally like, but i realize some people really enjoy that kind of chocolate. So, can't totally knock it. Same thing for the chocolate cake, more dense, and bitter than we like at my house. The shortbread was incredibly good, it melted in my mouth. I will definitely be back for that. We  tried their scharffenberger (sp?) cookies. It's a good thing they're small, because they are very rich. Although very enjoyable. We also brought home a lemon bar. As much as I love lemon on a variety of things, and I do like the tartness.....This was too tart even for me. It would have been perfect if it had just a bit more sugar. The buttery crust it was on was excellent.

I want to give only two stars but the baked goods were so lovely. I only had the coffee and it was ok.  I bet the baked goods are super and the sandwiches are great...who knows.  The coffee was expensive for the beans they use (Mr. Espresso which is average) and they charge too much for about 6 oz of semi weak coffee (half of my soy latte was soy foam...I think that is considered a cappuccino but what do I know...) It took forever to get my latte, I had to wait crunched in between LOTS of people stuffing their faces with the above-mentioned baked goods and their screaming children... TANGENT: if you are going to a cafe that you KNOW is tiny and you KNOW is crowded on the weekends, why in the world would you bring your giant stroller, wheel it inside, block an entire walk way and then ignore everyone who is trying to get around, including the wait staff trying to do their jobs? that just makes me want to kick things...mostly people and their progeny in the above mentioned giant strollers! BACK TO THE COFFEE: average. Not worth the wait, not worth the price, not worth getting enraged by the long lines.   The people who work there seemed nice though.

What can you say that hasn't already been said?  I saw Tartine on the Martha Stewart show and dragged my family there while we were in the city.  It wasn't as good as Martha made it sound.  We waited a while but not as long as I thought.  They got our sandwich order wrong but no one went hungry.  The gingerbread was awesome!  You have to bus your own tables.  Martha was probably used to this since her jail time!

"Besides having sex with other guys, this is by far the gayest thing I've done all week," comments my buddy Ben as we find a place in Dolores Park to settle down with our Tartine breakfast pastries and Pellegrino this past Sunday. We had both separately had rough nights the previous night, so I was definitely looking forward to some tasty food. As it was my first time, I was a little wary of the long line I saw forming outside, but Ben assured me that it would move quickly. The only problem is that as you creep your way forward, you pass the pastry case and those lacking will power can only hope to leave without ordering an extra 3 or 4 things... Anyway, on to the food. We both ordered the Pain au Jambon (like a thick piece of toast with gruyere cheese and smoked ham). Mine with sun-dried tomatoes, his with asparagus. And OKAY, I COULDN'T RESIST, I admit it, I have a problem... by the time I got to ordering, I somehow also threw in a Lemon Cream Tart , a Frangipane Croissant (with brandy and almonds), and a Morning Bun (like a cinnamon role without the gooey icing, plus an orangey kick). The Pain (the Pains?) probably would have been a little better had we eaten them immediately, as by the time we got settled in the park, it had cooled a bit, but they were still delicious (if not just a little difficult to eat). I saved the other pastries until I got home, and all were excellent (the tart has an amazingly smooth filling and a sweet, buttery crust). The croissant and morning bun I've actually been picking at the past few days, and they're still delicious. I'll definitely be back for more!!

and then the heavens opened up and sent down Tartine bakery, filled with all kinds of wonderful things that make me ignore the fact that a button popped off my velvet blazer and my jeans no longer button.  the open faced croque monsieur is an absolutely amazing Gruyère covered delight with a twist- sun dried tomatoes...you had me at ...sun...okay so that doesn't really work here but still it's so good you will go running back. i've had turkey and ham and i actually prefer the ham but if you bring me home a turkey one i won't smack you. and while the bread pudding with seasonal fruit was good, i have to admit that i was a little underwhelmed but i think it's more that everything else is soo amazing that bread pudding that's "just" good kind of fell flat for me...it was definitely a little more wet and eggier (i totes made up that word) than how i usually like my bread pudding...it was like someone put bread into flan....so not bad but not great..just good the real star of the show is the banana cream tart. i've had this twice and i have no shame digging into that bad boy and having cream all over my face. give it to me banana cream tart. i love it because it's so complex you have to be smart to eat it. the pastry crust is coated in dark chocolate then filled with bananas and sweet cream. it's then topped with shaved chocolate and powdered sugar. KILL.ME.NOW. i don't like fake banana flavored crap so I was a little weary when my friends brought this back...but my fears were quickly killed after one bite. the cream is just the right amount of sweet and there ain't no fake banana flavor here. it's an indescribable party in your mouth...well i guess that's a lie because i just wrote it...this cream tart must be related to charlie sheen because it's all kinds of winning

You might be thinking I'm a little liberal with the stars these days...but I'm still floating around on Cloud 9 following my morning roll and croissant from Tartine.  Both, you say?  yes.  You cannot choose between them, so bring someone with you.  I also highly recommend attempting to walk off maybe five of the one million calories you will have inhaled by taking your baked goods to Delores Park instead of ruining the experience by eating at the overcrowded, deafeningly loud tables.  YUM!  The boy wins extra points each times he shows up with one of the hot loaves for supper.

I always buy something for now and something for later.   I love love love their orange cinnamon rolls... and their ham and Gruyere croissant like thing they have is so killer .... and their Scharffen Berger chocolate torte cake is so decadent.  I can't say enough nice things about this bakery.  I just wish I lived closer so I could come here as often as I like.  Then again, that's probably a good thing.  I'm pretty sure these guys aren't playing around when it comes to the BUTTER.

I used to be a hardass bitch about this place because I refused to succumb to all the hype, but Tartine is slowly growing on me.  I'll do illicit favors for the first person who waves bread pudding & a veggie quiche at me!  My mind plays this scenario over and over again, and it doesn't seem to bother me...I'm that serious.  I'm docking a star because once the kitchen ran low on ham and subbed pastrami in my panini without asking me.  And I hate waiting in that stinkin' line!

i'm sure everything that can be said about tartine has, but i have to review it so i can add them to my chocolate list... these are some damn good pain au chocolat. the melted chocolate that oozes out and drips down your chin adds to their orgasmic qualities (the chocolate covering your teeth quickly detracts any sexiness from yourself). my friend says tartine's are the most like those in her part of france. since she was born there & i've only visited via the travel chanel, i'll have to take her word on it. but what i stand in line for is the bread pudding. it's funny too because the first time i had it i wasn't too sure if i could handle the texture. in fact, i almost wanted to gag by the time i got to the end of it. but it triggered something in me and now i cannot get enough--brioche covered in caramelized fruit with little pockets of custard, mmmmm. other yelpers have mentioned a chocolate bread pudding but i have not yet had the chance to meet that one. one day at costco i saw their cookbook for sale. shameless as i am, i quickly jotted down the bread pudding recipe. however, i'm afraid of fucking up a good thing and have not attempted to make it yet.

I came here anticipating a huge line since this place is popular, but there were only 3 or 4 people in front of me. Good start! The tables inside were all occupied though, so I sat outside, which was refreshing since the weather was actually nice and sunny! Anyway, onto the important stuff. My mom, sisters and I had the... -Ham and cheese croissant.. best thing I ate there! No joke! It was THAT GOOD. The ham and cheese were high quality and the croissant was insanely good. Flaky and browned to perfection on the outside, buttery and soft on the inside. My explanation doesn't do it justice. You just have to have one and see for yourself! -Banana Cream Tart.. second best thing! The combination of banana, egg custard, chocolate, and that flaky crust is heavenly! -Fig tart.. REALLY good! The figs were perfectly ripe and sweet and I loved the crust on this one. It was a firmer crust, not so flaky, but broke more like a thin cookie. And the creme-style vanilla bean custard was light and complemented the fruit perfectly. -Bread pudding.. I've had better. I love bread pudding, so it was kind of disappointing that theirs wasn't better. -Morning bun.. I've never had a morning bun before, but if this is what they usually taste like then I want more!! Haha. It's like a cinnamon bun without all the nasty frosting. Instead, it's sprinkled with sugar and orange zest! Yuuummmmmm!!! I gave this place 4/5 because I've had better experiences at western-style standalone bakeries (especially at this price). From consistency to selection, this one is up there in the ranks, but the only thing I would return here for specifically is the ham and cheese croissant. Just my opinion!

Good Lord - 733 reviews?! Wow, I guess there's probably not too much more to say about this place. My two cents: Amazing food, desserts and most definitely the best bakery in SF. The croque monsieur is fabulous and sometimes I have dreams about the lemon tart and the chocolate pot de creme...yummmmmmmmmmm...Only downside is the crowd and the long line - it's tough to get a seat outside, but if you do, you're set for a good few hours - great place to people watch. I can't wait to try out Bar Tartine and see if the food compares.

The long line did not deter my gf and I from enjoying what we considered to be the BEST sandwiches we've ever had! I had the Prosciutto/Provolone and she had the Pastrami.

Yummy!  It is a good thing I don't get to go to this part of the city too often, because if I did I would have a sweet and savory overdose.  You have to try the bread pudding.  Despite my small phobia about moist bread, I still love it.  (I think it is the butter.)  Also the mocha latte is fantastic.  Just keep in mind that everybody also loves Tartine so expect a line unless you are an early riser.  The last thing that I had from here was a chocolate eclair.  It left me speechless not only because I had half of it in my mouth, but because the custard filling was oh so pleasant.

Everything here is spectacular! I came here years ago and came again just last week. The pastries are still as yummy as ever and it remains a very popular local bakery. All the cakes and cookies are really unique and tasty. I especially liked the lemon tart. The quiche was extremely flavorful and satisfying too. So good and popular, but they still keep the prices down, very commendable. My friends and I were very happy, borderline giddy, as we walked out of there.

I came here based on the recommendation of a trusted friend who actually singled this place out for breakfast, but I didn't get over here till lunch.  Loved it!  The pressed sandwiches are not just the standard paninis you get anywhere with a sandwich press.  The bread was homemade, the ingredients primo & the combinations original.  Me & my friend split the Jambon Royale w/Gruyere and the prosciutto sandwich based on a staff recommendation.  Both were phenomenal & just made me want to come back so I can try them all.  ...thinking about the Humbolt Fog on walnut bread & the one with the lemon & sage..

We made a point to try out this Bakery even though we were staying far away and it was well worth it.  We loved the lemon creme tart and the chocolate pots de creme.  There was live music and a good crowd enjoying dessert and wine.  I wish they were open later because we had to rush dinner to make it there before they closed.  A dessert spot should be open at dessert times (8-10pm).  But overall, we loved the desserts and the atmosphere and I loved that there was a bar with a good wine and liquor selection.  More bakeries should serve wine and cocktails!

Okay, so everyone knows about Tartine, but in case some stopped going because of the lines out the door...turnover is still quick, and it still offers the best California-adaptation of the Croque Monsieur.  It's open later now on the weekends, and soon summer hours will keep it open even later.  The aroma of chocolate and butter will hit you a block away, and the cinnamon morning buns, hazelnut tart (and just about every other tart), chocolate pudding and various other baked delights make the trip (and wait) worthwhile. I've never been in love with their coffee or the bread pudding (too eggy for my liking), but there's so much else to choose from!

What more can I say besides all the animated reviews everyone else here has given Tartine?  But I'm a lover of all baked goods so I have to give my two cents.  The lines can be excruciatingly long and parking is a pain, but its worth the buttery experience.  When butter oozes out of any pastry, how can that not make your day?  The bread pudding is so indulgent...brioche soaked in cream and sugar and fresh fruit...I'd eat that any time of day.  The innovative paninis combine wonderful ingredients that you don't see everyday...pecorino and almonds...fromage blanc and bananas?  Who thinks of these glamourous concoctions?!  The croque monsieurs look like they'd give you heart attacks...but at least you would die knowing you had one last sweet taste of heaven.

there's always a line everytime i go there, but not too bad of a wait.   small, crowded space -- not a good place to bring work, but a good place to read, check e-mail, breakfast/brunch/lunch & chat with a girlfriend. absolutely THE BEST almond croissant & chocolate croissant!!!!   the almond croissant is sooooo gi-normous i can only eat half (that says alot cause i can definitely eat quite a bit of sweets in one sitting, that i gross my husband out at times), PLUS they defnitely don't skimp on the marizipan (almond) paste :) the chocolate croissant isn't as big as the almond but they make up for it by using bittersweet scharffen berger chocolate (yummeee).......... the banana cream tart was probably the best one i had, but i'm not a big fan of banana cream tart -- probably better to have on a sunday afternoon but it was friday night & i should have gotten chocolate......... the chocolate chip cookie was okay but though it was large, it was too thin & crispy for me (love chewy cookies) & the brownie was good but not the best even though they used scharffen berger chocolate. the frangipane tart was ok a little too dry for me and i was REALLY disappointed with the  coconut passion fruit bavarian cream cake --the cake was so dry, the passion fruit's tartness  was overpowering, the coconut flakes were large, dry , hard to chew & the cream was heavy -- there was no balance or cohesion with the texture, taste & density -- it just didn't make sense............. it was especially disappointing after having the BEST lilikoi cake @ kilauea bakery in kauai -- the cake was soooo moist & the passion fruit itself was light creamy with a very slight tartness that wasn't overpowering -- just the right sense of balance.   so now i'm just sticking to the croissants..........& very happy with that UPDATE:  AWESOME bread pudding!!!

Ultra orgasmic stuff here. This place is not for you if you expect to get someone on the phone who will give you information. It is for you if you don't mind waiting in a line that goes out the door just to get something from their counter, and have spent too long circling to find a parking space. The strawberry tart has a buttery flaky thick crust, filled with a creme fraiche and topped with mounds of slices of sweet juicy strawberries. The Banana Cream Tart is a flaky pastry coated w/dark chocolate with caramel, pastry cream, bananas and sweet cream. Hate that I finally got a parking space a half a block down the street, as I am now cursed and must go back again, like a junkie who needs a fix.

As we walked down Guerrero looking for Tartine, we noticed a huge line form on the corner of 18th & Guerrero.  We figured this must be it, and it must be good if all these people are lining up to get some delicious fresh baked pastries.  And it was good!  We got their bread pudding brioche and their pain au chocolat.  I don't normally like bread pudding, but this had a good combination of fruit, creamy egg flan, and sweet bread.  The pain au chocolat was warm and filled with rich dark chocolate.  Very delicious, we came back the next day and once again lined up for a ham and cheese croissant and morning buns.  Both were really good.  I have to say the best pastry they have is the ham and cheese croissant.

Caution : Over-indulging in their heavenly creations may cause euphoria,  weight gain, and addiction. Tartine's dark chocolate coconut cream tart is hands down the best tart ever created.  You can tell with every bite that they DO NOT skimp on ingredients and know how to keep the flavors well balanced.  I've recently tried their Croque Monsieur sandwich that can be topped with either shitake mushroom or smoked ham.  I am usually not a big fan of ham, but when paired with the flavors of Gruyere, herbs, and peppers, it's enough to make Vegans convert.  The line around the corner might scare you, but it's well worth the wait.   Your stomach will thank you.

Yeah, yeah, it's great...blah blah blah. But you have to go at off hours during the week so you can get your lovingly baked, buttery crack in a flash (15 min.), instead of waiting an hour in line on the weekend because Hans the tourist can't decide on lemon or coconut and Jenny with the baby stroller just wants to order everything 'cause it's "so yummy!". Also, sometimes the staff is grouchy, so don't expect Kool-aid smiles when you order your over priced, but damn good baked treat.

If you are searching for a local bakery to brag to your friends about, please don't go here, you are making the line too long.  For everyone else that wants to know what flawless tastes like in pastry form, then Tartine is the place.   There are three things that call out to my insufferable sweet-tooth:  The chocolate chip cookie,  brioche bread pudding,  and the incredibly decadent and cozy coffee.  Folks on the salty team might like the various breads and the gourmet sandwiches with high-end cheeses and carefully picked toppings... All things to welcome your weekend mornings --  hence the long but very manageable lines.

Get here early.  I arrived here at 7:55AM on a Saturday after my stop over at Dynamo Donuts and there was already a line formed 12 deep.  While 12 people aren't many as the morning moves on the line gets longer and longer. The morning bun is really good and worth waiting for.  The pain au jambon is very tasty.  It's flaky and buttery with a nice crust then when you get inside you're hit with jambon and cheese. The quiche is great too, the crust is also flaky and buttery the filling is perfect with their seasonal ingredients.  The gougere I can't comment on, I had it left over as my sister took half to her husband and the girl at the bakery packed us the wrong things. My other sister said she's had better pain au chocolat, it's not much since I've never had it but... The frangipane croissant wasn't so great, it didn't really taste of almonds. Croque monsieur wasn't ready until 9:30am so I guess that'll have to wait for next time.

Cozy little pastry and coffee shop, constantly busy throughout the day. I was a little sad they didn't make any banana cream tart that day, I mean that's why I came here! I had to settle for the Frangapine Tart. It wasn't the same but still a real treat. Soft flaky outside topped with a fresh fruit spread and nuts. The Tres Leche cake was very moist and not too sweet, but I didn't care too much for it. I'll have to stop by on another day to catch the morning buns and banana cream tarts! A bit pricey though so 3.5 stars.

WOW, this place is goooooooodddd! I listened to my fellow yelpers and ordered the morning bun and the double pain au chocolat. The morning bun...speechless it was the best pastry I have ever had hands down and it wasn't even right out of the oven. It was very soft on the inside and had a crunch on the outside. I am dreaming of having another one now. The double pain au chocolat was also very good and the chocolate in the croissant is actually dark chocolate. I ate it up quickly, but would probably order 2 morning buns next time. This bakery is pretty pricey, but worth every penny since it is not something you can get at any bakery, guaranteed!

Finally made it to Tartine! This has been on my bucket list forever! I was definitely impressed. Came in early Saturday afternoon. There was a bit of a line... but nothing like I was expecting from what I have heard. Plus the waiting gives you a bit to look around and decide what you want to try! Of course I had to try the morning bun. Delicious, moist, just sweet enough. It was great with iced coffee. We also tried a lemon bar. Delicious lemon curd, and a thick, shortbready type crust. Fantastic. I will for sure be going back because there were so many other things I wanted to try. The quiches looked to die for and there was this asparagus tart that I couldn't keep my eyes off of. They even have wine!

I wasn't quite sure what to expect in regards to coffee or pastries but hey, all of those people standing in line, and walking out couldn't be wrong. The wait was definitely well worth it!!!! I ordered probably the best mocha I have ever had!!! Real rich. If the coffee is this good then pastries must be awesome so I ordered a lemon tart. Oh man. Definitely go! Wait in line and enjoy.

I've been to Tartine at least 5 times, and there are three things about the Tartine experience I feel stand out and people need to keep in mind before entering... 1)  Parking: it can be a nightmare, especially during those nice weekend brunch times.  Be prepared to circle, and circle, and circle around...just be patient, there is some turnover, and don't be afraid to go several blocks out. 2)  Getting a seat/table:  this place is small, and you have to keep an eye out for that person or persons that look like they're on their last bite, wrapping up to leave, and then be bold enough to ask if they'll be leaving soon or just swoop in before someone else takes the spot when it opens.  There are also benches and tables outside.  If it's nice out, you can just grab the food to go, and have a picnic at Dolores Park, just one block up. 3)  and most importantly, the food:  pastries are excellent!  The tough part is deciding what to get because everything looks SO good.  You start from wanting a slice of their Tres Leches cake, and then think that the Lemon Tart looks really good, so you'll just get that, too,  to have for later...then you come across the bread pudding...and you end up ordering 3 desserts and finishing them all off before you leave the place.  (Guilty on multiple occasions!) :)

Okay so I went there yesterday with my mom after my dr's appointment and was a little disappointed by the girl behind the counter who takes your order.  We basically ordered about $50 worth of food and she got my order wrong twice.  Yes, the food was good but not for the price and the bad customer service.  Each time I ordered something she just seemed so annoyed.  If we're ordering so much food you would think she would be a little nicer but she wasn't. I told her right from the beginning that we we're ordering everything to go but still didn't listen.  When she put the bread pudding in the bowl I had to remind her it was to go and then she basically dumped it in a to go box.  So our bread pudding was upside down.  I don't think I'll be coming here again even though the what we did order was good.

Tartine is a national treasure.  The scones, croissants, bread pudding, open-faced sandwiches (tartine), cookies, cakes, are all the best in town (and beyond).  Get there early and expect to wait.  You can also expect perfection.

After circling Coffee Bar for 30 minutes looking for parking at close to 10am today - no coffee pumping through my veins for THREE hours after waking up - on the last lap, I told myself, "if you don't find a spot, recoup your cranky mood, peal out with a big skid mark, and burn rubber to Tartine. If there's a spot out front, you're meant to eat a stick of butter coated in sugar and cinnamon (aka a Morning Bun), and should not feel one iota of guilt." That's how good Tartine is. The one thousand calorie tic tac ... the splurge that makes pms, bad drivers, no parking, and one red light after another, worth every single bite. Good to the last crumb.

Artisan bakery and cafe that serves European goods.  The simple croissant trumpts their banana cream tart.  A line of customers curls out the door and down the street, but luckily moves quickly and infront of the display case.  Edgy art adorns the walls, and you'll find yourself wondering if it would be weird to order quiche underneath paintings of well hung kangaroos.

For a place with this much hype and long lines, they should be ashamed of their quality control.  I stopped going there a decade ago after the third strike - a rock hard morning bun following burnt croissants on two occasions.  However, unwarned, my Mother ventured in on her visit yesterday.  She bought an "almond pastry" covered with powder sugar hiding the fact that it was way overcooked, browned and tasted dry and burnt.  It doesn't matter how good they are when their good, when they pass of s**t as food when their bad.

This place smells heavenly.  My BF and I arrived at about 745 am on a Friday, and while waiting in line breathing in the delightful goodness, we were thinking about all the goodies we were going to purchase.  However, at 745 am, they don't have any of their tarts or cakes available, just mainly their croissants, morning bun and bread pudding.   We ordered the morning buns and chocolate croissants.  They were buttery filled delights.  However, my BF was highly disappointed with both items.  He didn't like the hard, almost burnt-like exteriors.  He did enjoy the soft warm centers.  So be aware if you don't like your pastries to have the burnt crunchy exteriors.

I've never had anything here I didn't love. Sandwiches (which are good sharing size), pastries, espresso, everything is great. I'm particularly partial to the eclair, which truly puts other eclairs to shame. Also, they serve little spicy pickled carrots with the sandwiches, which are divine. I debated docking them a star for their incredibly unfriendly waitstaff, but those eclairs....

What a great way to start the day in SF. Worth the 20 min. bus ride + 15 min. wait in line. It was going off and it was a weekday at 9:30. All the tables were taken, including the outside ones. Patrons were finding any surface they could place a pastry on and lean up against to enjoy the spectacular morning selections. I was impressed with the variety of options, from bread pudding with fresh fruit to almond crossiants (what we shared this trip). The desserts they were bringing out looked amazing as well. They have several small 2-bite size dessert options for $0.75 (small commitment if unsure). The workers were helpful and seemed to enjoy their jobs. Oh, and the cafe au lait in a large bowel was totes tasty!

You'd figure a bakery that is  known for their delicious croissants would be capable of making an eatable sandwich, Tartine Bakery is definitely not one of them. I got in a 15-20 minute line hoping to get a sandwich that was meaty and cheesy while my GF was going to order their infamous croissants that she saw on the food network. I picked up a menu when I got near the front line and saw that their panini sandwiches were $15 bucks. I'd figure there was no backing out since we had waited and went ahead and treated myself out considering it was my birthday weekend. 15 minutes later my turnkey sandwich came out and was black and burnt. I took a few bites and thought to myself, "WTF is this", the sandwich was so burnt and hard it almost broke my tooth off. Because It was 1pm and hadn't eaten all day, i went ahead and finished a third of the sandwich until my stomach wasn't growling anymore. In the end, the roof of my mouth was shredded and cut and my jaw was sore. In addition, the sandwich could have used more cheese and a non-deli type of meat. This is another example of a joint being highly popular just because it was featured on the food network. I'm definitely not returning. BTW, my GF said that the croissants were burnt as well!

I'm mixed, sweets great (ie: mocha, chocolate mousse, tarts, bread pudding) but the savories, what are they thinking.  The cheese on the sandwiches looks curdled and tastes curdled. More docked points for the lines and female workers that have underarm hair and show it.

Okay, so all the SF hipster guides says to check out Tartine for a life-altering carb experience, and, of course, there's the whole James Beard award winner thing.  I'm happy to report it's all true and it's all delicous.  We had the morning buns (not too sweet), gougere (not too cheesy) and squash quiche (not too emasculating).

Now this is what I call a bakery!! Something you would find in Italy or France. Tartine is not only a must try but another reason to love SF food culture. I stopped by Tartine before they were open on a Saturday morning (they open at 8am on Saturdays, late for a bakery) anyhow, their doors were left open and emanating the smell of good old fashioned pastry baking. Sign of a good bakery! Right then I knew, it was worth coming back to try what they had to offer. So, in going back and now having been open for 45 minutes and already a line out the door (another clue that it's probably worth the wait otherwise people wouldn't wait), I couldn't take my eyes off the Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian. While in line I could see the bakers in the back room prepping things for the oven and taking things out of the oven. Tried the freshly squeezed grapefruit juice which would have been better had it not had so much pulp and if it was colder. What I did have, that was magnificent, was the almond croissant and the gougere bread. The gougere bread was a soft round bread, similar to a popover but better, tasting like toasted cheese. Soft and buttery, melts in your mouth good! Next time I'm in SF, Tartine will definitely be on my list of stops.

This is easily the first place that comes to my mind whenever a non-native to the Bay Area visits.  I can't think of a better place which blends the vibrant, yet calm nature that is San Francisco. If it is your first experience, I highly recommend starting off with either their (ever famous) brioche bread pudding or morning bun.  A perfect complement to both items is their ridiculously flaky chocolate croissant. Throw in a cup of coffee, and you won't be able to take a smile off your face for the rest of the day. Also, I'd recommend the seating outside.  It is a bit more of a wait since you have to try and vulture for tables, but it is well worth it if you like people watching.

This place is amazing and actually worth the wait on a sunny day. My friends and I love to go sit out in Dolores park with a picnic of food gathered from Tartine. The hot pressed grilled sandwiches are fantastically savory. The last time I went I ate a soppressata with provolone and broccoli raab pesto. So good. There was also a bread pudding that I've dreamt three times about. They served it up with fresh nectarines. I hope they still have it when I go back next week.

Expectation is the killer to everything. This place is honestly not bad without the excessive hype, but with all the expectation I had, it was just okay. I ordered the mushroom croque monsieur and it was pretty decent. The melted cheese on the bread and the herbs were two of my favorite parts, but the bread was really hard to work with because it was so hard. I also tried the croissant, the mexican wedding pastry, as well as the quiche. The croissant was very crispy and buttery, but i wouldn't say it was amazing (i expected to be aaalot better). The quiche was too heavy for me because of the cream and egg in it. All in all, good place to have breakfast if you are not in a hurry (never seen this place without a line out of the door, I waited for 30 minutes and I think that's considered pretty short) and have some spare money on you (not your cheap neighborhood bakery!).

Breakfast items are to die for!  Highly recommend fruit tart, choco eclaire, morning buns and pain au chocolat.  Four barrels was way too strong for my taste. It's worth the wait - even though the line is always long, it moves quite quickly. So glad we don't live close to the bakery, otherwise I will be extra fat and extra broke - their baked goods are delicously addicting and $$$.

My favorite, hands-down, bakery in San Francisco.  Everything is amazing here.  From the amazing pastries to the fresh baked bread.  Some of it is so rich though, like the chocolate cake that it lasted me a week with a bunch of people and still couldn't finish it.  There's usually always a line but worth the wait.  I wish they had more food selections because it's nice to hang out here, have a bite to eat and get a nice dessert.  The hot chocolate I love also.

Wanted to "grab something to go" before heading to an appointment in the East Bay--whoops.  I knew there would be a long line, but somehow still thought it would be quicker than it was.  And then when I got up front they told me it would be another 15 minutes if I wanted something other than a croque monsieur, which was disappointing but obvious and I should have expected it.  So I went with the sundried tomato croque monsieur, and even though it was one of the unhealthiest breakfasts I had eaten in a while, damn, was it worth it.  Definitely need to go back when I have a whole morning to waste--I mean, spend in the best way possible.

OK....so I ended up here because I just kept seeing all the great reviews on Yelp. I purchased a slice of passion fruit cake, a lemon tart, a lemon bar, a bowl of bread pudding, a cup of chocolate pudding and some kind of round pastry with the word frangipane in the title. I tried a little bit of everything when we got home and I must say that I was truly disappointed. The 2 best things out of the bunch was the chocolate pudding and the bread pudding but they honestly weren't anything special. This place is so over rated. I will not be back.

Lot's of right on comments about this interesting, over hyped bakery or cafe loved by readers of non resident food critics who believe that San Francisco is heaven for anything expensively decadent.  Throw in slow, erratic, uncaring staff and you start to see some of the conflicts that make the open minded praton go crazy watching rude lemmings bark, bitch and behave badly as they show their oversized SUVs, designer sunglasses, spoiled brats in Bentley strollers and starving Nannny's all preen like starlets on the directors couch for a bit park in a B movie.  Got the picture?  Actually some of their food is excellent, some not, but the staff is poorly trained and disciplined, prices inflated beyond reason, and attitude that could fly the Goodyear Blimp for a decade.

Sunday morning my sister and I decided to run to Tartine from Pac Heights to work up an appetite for some pastries. We rolled up to a long line that went out the door. The wait wasn't too bad (~15 minutes) and it was well worth it. We split a chocolate croissant, a slice of pumpkin spice bread and the currant scone. The turnover was so high we even managed to get a table and enjoy a nice cup of coffee with our sweets. Great sunday morning.

Tartine is always crowded and there are never seats for you and your friends. You'll probably get felt up in line but that's only cause people are so eager to get to the yummy baked goods that they forget you need your personal space, heck you'll prob forget too. Just pick one, or maybe two, ok stop at three things to take away. The bread pudding is good for people who don't like things that are too sweet. This place is so worth the trip!

came here planning to grab something to take to dolores park, but ended up eating at tartine instead.  the sandwiches are pricey, but that's because they're so big.  i wish i had known one sandwich would be ideal for sharing.  oh well, leftovers meant I had lunch for work today.  delicious though.  thick crusty bread, clearly doused in butter before pressed (a good thing).  my only gripe was that the crust was too burnt, but the quality of the bread made up for it.   the quiche was also good, though we wish they would've warmed it up for us... we should have asked.  and i was drooling over all the pastries in the display case, but had to save room for a big dinner i was having that night.  aside from the disaster that is the crowd, a very tasty experience, and i'll definitely be back for dessert!

So I'm normally not a fan of bread pudding but my life has changed now that I've tried Tartine's.  Soft, fluffy, and sweet with juicy plums and raspberries - my only regret is getting the bowl size b/c it was so big.  I can't wait to go back and try what else they have.  Bakeries rarely stand out to me but you could just tell that the quality of the food put out by Tartine is something special.  I also like that this place doesn't scream commercialism - they didn't even have a sign for the store (maybe it was being redone) but everything else about it just looked like a cute simple coffee shop hiding the magic that goes on in the back.

Stopped here briefly to get a couple of things to go.  There was no wait at all and the place even had available seating.  Got the bread pudding (to go) - the portion was good and cheap - only $3!  I never know what to expect when I order bread pudding since it seems to be different every place I order it.  This was more bready than others, but a creamy bread with a thin layer of custard and sweet sauce.  It was delicious - not too sweet.  Also ordered the Dark Chocolate Devil's Cake, which was SUPER rich, and a slice of Lemon Meringue, which was a little too moist for me.  Both cakes were nothing out of the ordinary, and I'd venture to say that both may have been a bit below what I'd expect from such a highly rated bakery.  Maybe we chose the wrong things, but definitely order the bread pudding.

The line is always long but it moves quickly the food is good. This place is really a bakery first and a cafe second but the sandwiches are not too bad. The croissant is de.lic.ious. Not too buttery but crispy-flaky on the outside and moist on the inside. And they gave us apricot jam! The morning bun was so-so. Their house coffee is suitable, even for coffee snobs like the Boyfriend, but seating is a nightmare. There are a few tables outside and a few tables inside as well as a long window-side ledge. People like to sit around over empty coffee cups just talking so this is really a place where you have to use your best unobtrusive hovering skills. If you order a hot drink other than house coffee, there's a separate bar where they'll make your drink and call your name. You pay for everything right after you order and then just go hang out until you hear your name.

OMG!! yes OMG!! I'm salivating again just thinking about tartine and all the yummy goodness that I saw and did not get to eat. If I could spend all day in one location before I die, I would probably choose Tartine. Even though the line was long as expected, it was so worth every minute. Everything looked so scrumptious and smelled so damn good my stomach kept gargling while I looked hungrily at other people grubbing. Unfortunately I was on a budget so I couldn't splurge as I normally could (pre-recession style) so I settled on something sweet and chose the pain au chocolat, one of my faves and it was just so amazing. The crust was flaky and warm, just out of the oven and the chocolate was melted just enough so that it blended wonderfully with the bread. SOOOOO GOOOODD!! Plus I had the refillable house coffee (and I happened to be standing at the counter right next to the coffee kiosk) so I kept going back for more. My cousin got something savory (we do this so we can share something sweet and salty), the quiche lorraine (which had lovely bits of bacon mmmm) and it was just warm enough and crust nice and flaky. Once again SOOO GOOODDD!! If I could go back everyday I would, but luckily I can't afford it and I don't live in SF (which is good cuz I would become ginormous otherwise). But I highly recommend anyone that's passing by SF to go, please go, this place is a serious delight for all lovers of damn good food. I will even overlook the lack of seating available because the food is that great ( I hate places that claim their food/coffee is great and use that as an excuse for their interiors being ridiculously small and cramped).

Yes, there's a line, but how else can you build up anticipation and get to watch what other people are eating.  The banana cream tart seems to be the favorite at 11:00 a.m., saw them at half of the tables.  I had the Hazelnut Tart ($6), which wasn't very sweet, but it wasn't what I expected.  The plain croissant ($3.25) was as good as it gets, crunchy on the outside, soft and feathery on the inside.  My friend was making um, um sounds while she was eating her chocolate croissant.  That tells you how good it got for her.  The quiche looked yummy.  Actually everything looked yummy and mouth watering.  When you walk to the corner, you can smell the butter oozing out of the place.  Follow your senses.  I finally figured out why that street corner is always overflowing.

Went very far out of my way to try Tartine.  Bought three items so I could taste all that Tartine has to offer.  I understand the hoopla and the hype but a little piece of me thinks than anybody who uses that much butter in the croissants will make a tasty treat.  The outside of the croissant was miraculously crunchy, flaky and buttery.  I found the inside to be a little dense but the flavor and taste of the croissant was unparalleled.  The ham and cheese croissant with gruyere and Niman Ranch Ham - come on.  Thats just too much.  I ate it 2.5 hours ago and I'm still full.  The morning bun is ridiculously perfect.  A perfect combination of cirtus, cinammon, sugar and the same crusty flaky perfection of the croissant in different form.  I'm not usually a sweets person but that was excellent.

Ahhh I get it now...the reason for the long lines and all the hype of the "Morning Bun".  It was worth the wait on a early Saturday morning for a warm morning bun.  You look at it and think - is this really THAT great?  Well it is.  To figure out how they get the consistency of texture from the crunch on the outside to the smooth flakiness on the inside, to the delicious but not overly done sweetness.  Perfection.

This place is worth the 20 minute wait... MY strategy was to wait for a rainy day like today, so the line would be less.  I was lucky and got parking RIGHT in front (must be a sign).  Waited and got the banana cream pie, the quich (soooo goooood) and Croque Monsieur.  I was taking food to go and they packed everything very nicely for me  Service is great.  Banana cream pie is REALLY light and yummy.. I almost thought it was HEALTHY eating it (who am I kidding).  I tried their chocolate chip cookies last time.  SO addicting.  They didn't have that today so I got the raisin oatmeal instead.  My husband who doesn't normally eat dessert or cookies decided to eat all the cookies and half the cream pie... that itself deserves 5 stars :)

i'm at a 3.5, i'm going to round down because of the price i had to wait in line once...man and it was a line.  But I still waited, so that means something = ) I've heard that the paninis are really delicious, i've only tried the museli, croque monsieur, and some crossaints.  The croque monsieur is better eaten there...reheating it up doesn't do it justice.  Something about the pastries...they're really flaky and not as sweet?  I prefer thicker (bagel) and sweeter (donuts) desserts...so clearly it wasn't as satisfying for me.  But my friend really loves the place and next time i go i'm going to get a morning bun...still haven't tried it!

This is one of those places that is worth the hype for the experience and the deliciousness.  I love just drolling over the baked treasures before I choose. I love the hazelnut tart, but the others sure look fantastic too. They have excellent coffee and some savory things as well. You probably can get a table, just be patient or come when the line isn't insane.

3.5 stars... Tartine bakery is a great little corner cafe that has a decent selection of breads, desserts, paninis, sandwiches, and a few other items to sit and enjoy in there or to take and go. You can choose to get a waitress service for the tables inside or the outside or you could wait in the line (which can get pretty long) and pick what you want and pay right there. I tried both the bread pudding with seasonal fruit (cup for $3.50) and the banana cream tart ($6.50) which is made with chocolate and caramel. Sadly I was disappointed with both but I just know by looking at the savory items and some of the other desserts that they really know what they're doing here and some of the other options would have been much better. The bread pudding didn't quite adhere to itself too well and I found as though it wasn't savory nor was it that sweet, it was just sort of bland. The banana cream tart was the most difficult dessert I've ever tried to eat. It was too large to eat by hand so I got a plastic fork which couldn't sink into the pastry shell. Neither could a plastic spoon or a plastic knife. I then went to metal and a fork and knife barely made it through so I had to use some elbow grease. By the time I was able to break into this fortress of dessert I made such a mess it was borderline funny. The taste was pretty good but I have no idea how anyone taking this to their office, to a park, or someplace would have eaten it. Their lemon bar/tart and cinnamon rolls looked heavenly though so if I were to ever go back for a snack I'd probably end up with one of those.

Went here on a whim because the restaurant we were going to wasn't open for another hour. We saw the crowd and the long line so we decided to give it a try. We had the ham quiche and meringue...both were very good. Next time I'm trying the bread pudding and banana cream tart that everyone was raving about.

Dang, no wonder this place is such a big deal.  Even before you step into the store, you can start to smell that delicious fresh-baked bread smell as you walk up to this little bakery.  They were out of the almond croissant and regular bread which is what I've been wanting to try, so I got the regular croissant, ham and cheese croissant, and the bread pudding instead.  The croissants were flaky and the bread pudding was just the right amount of mushiness.  I'm such a sucker for fresh bread, and this place definitely satisfied some intense pastry-cravings of mine.

Now, I am generally not a breakfast and sweet tooth person, especially when it comes to pastries. However, my world has turned upside-down after a friend took us here on a San Francisco gourmet trip. lol First of all, I loved the ambiance of the bakery/cafe. It was small, cozy, personable and smelled divine! There is a wide selection of pastries (some of which I have never seen before), pies, tarts, cakes, greek-style yogurts, sandwiches, soups. Almost anything you can think of. I think it would be a great place for casual brunch dining with your family and friends. The customer service was surprisingly efficient, polite and considerate, based on how packed and busy the restaurant was. For example, when we asked for a glass of water, even though we ordered to-go, the waitress gave us two cups of water, filled in coffee cups so that it would not spill. My friends and I ordered: 1) Opera Cake: many, many layers. It looks dense and delicious but you'll be surprised upon the first bite because it is incredibly light and fluffy. I was also amazed as to how thing each cake layer was. It seemed to intricately made and I loved the chocolate marzipan topping. Would definitely come back and try other cakes 2) Quiche Lorraine: tasted like homemade goodness. I really enjoyed it because the cheese filling was smooth and light. The cheeses did not overpower the eggs' delicate flavor. Tartine must have used a variety of cheeses in the quiche because I discerned many cheeses in each bite. Of course, the crust was also nice and flaky. Although the bottom was a bit hard to break through. They offered vegetarian and normal cheese quiche with bacon. I've made quiches, maybe 3x at home and this is the first place I've been to that tasted closest to being homemade 3) EClair: I love eclairs, but it is generally very hard to find one without an overwhelmingly sweet cream filling. I enjoyed this one very much because the flaky, buttery-ness of the pastry actually came through; so there was a good juxtaposition between the sweet, velvety cream and the pastry dough. 4) Greek Style Yogurt: to be honest, this is probably something I wouldn't normally order because it tasted a little bit murky and sour. However, it could also be because I generally don't like flavored yogurt. Simply put, it is greek style, probably made from goats milk, yogurt mixed in with special cereal grain and other stuff. However, my friend, who ordered this and is a health nut :) seemed to have liked it a lot. So, as you can tell, I really enjoyed Tartine's and plan on bringing on family here for brunch. It would probably be a good idea to bring friends/family so that you can sample all the delectable treats. I would definitely try the Banana Cream Tart, Quiche, a cake, a sandwich when I come back. Also, it is important to note that they make everything fresh, including the bread for their sandwiches, daily; fresh enough that you can taste it and smell it as you step into this quaint establishment. Overall, I am giving a 5 stars rating to Tartine's and am anticipating my return here. NOTE: Tartine Bakery also has its own cookbooks (2): Tartine and Tartine Bread. I have read from David Lebovitz, past pastry chef from Chez Panisse and famous author of  "The Perfect Scoop," that Tartine's brown bread is delicious enough to be made into an ice cream flavor!

When I stopped by, it was packed! They ran out of bread but the line was still out the door. Whatever was out was what they had left. Wasn't able to get the things  I wanted, hence the star deduction, but at least came out with bread pudding to go. Haven't tried it yet but it looks good haha. The bakery/cafe is totally my vibe too. Would come here regularly if I lived in sf.

The line is long, even on a week day moring at a random time, but then again, it's worth the wait for their flaky, rich, delicious ham and cheese croissants.  I always get mine to go because the seating is crowded and often full.  And yeah, the prices aren't cheap.  But the incredible ham and cheese croissant will always keep me coming back.

Long ass wait... but I want to cry thinking I cant have their croissants whenever I want them.  The ham and cheese was insane, best i've had and will ever have im sure.  I was utterly disappointed that they were not making the almond croissant but next time im in san fran its first on my list.  The coconut cream pie was great, Puffed cheese Pastry one wasnt my favorite and I wouldnt get that again considering all their other choices, chocolate croissant is good but 2nd to the ham and cheese.  Very impressive Tartine!

Tartine is good, but way overrated.  Everything tastes pretty good, but they use a lot of butter and egg in everything.  The line usually moves pretty fast, even if it does go out on the street.  Very expensive.  If you want something cheap and possibly even better, walk up to Church and 15th and try Thorough Bread.

Came here with some friends and we all ordered different pressed sandwiches, all of which were fantastic. I also couldn't help myself in buying $20-30 worth of baked goodies for the road and to take back and share. Everything I ordered was tasty and delicious! The only downside is that it reminds me of a more expensive version of Porto's (one of my favorite places to go, but unfortunately located in LA).

If you're trying to cut down on carbs, a bakery isn't the place to go. But if you are going to treat yourself, Tartine is incredible. I don't think I've had a better bread pudding or chocolate eclair anywhere. The lemon bars are alright, and the croissants are a bit pricey, but really flaky and tasty. It's definitely worth checking out - cool part of town too.

Charming and clearly super popular (I was told by no less than 3 East Coasters to come here, and it was packed on all three occasions we stopped by).  Almond rocher was the BOMB - chewy meringue packed with honey and almond slices was amazing. Chocolate hazelnut tart was pretty amazing, as was the chocolate eclair. Wish we could have tried more!

What else can I say about Tartine? What a great bakery. As I'm sure every reviewer has mentioned- the line-ups are utterly insane and it's rare to be able to actually get a table. Luckily its proximity to dolores park make that OK. All of the pastries are delicious (and oh so buttery)- e.g., croissants and morning buns. The bread pudding is also excellent, as is the daily quiche. The coffee is good. The desserts (particularly the tarts) are also great. The biggest quandary I have is trying to narrow down what I'm going to eat.

Tried the banana cream tart based on the other reviews... OH DOUBLE GEE GOOD! Definitely a must! I also tried the lemon tart which was too much for one sitting, so stick with the banana. Also had a sandwich there... can't think of it bc it was eclipsed by the banana creme tart, oh yeah I had the coque monsieur which isn't quite like a french coque monsieur but whatever. that was aiite. Basically you go for the banana creme tart... even if you're not a fan of bananas you still go for the banana. capiche!

disregarding the long line and once-in-a-while moody and rude wait staff, their pastries are some of the best things ever baked! it gets crowded so you're lucky if u find a table. but if you're patient ppl are in and out of there. some outdoor seating too. its also down the street from delfina and bi-rite. amazing location if u ask me :) morning buns are must! but go before 2-3p ish otherwise its very likely they will run out. It does vary though, i went close to 4pm on a sunday once and they still had plenty. their gougere bun has gruyere cheese, pepper and other spices, most amazing savory pastry to ever exist! their other cakes and tarts are really delicious as well but can be a little overpriced (hazelnut tart) everyday around 5pm is when they release their fresh baked bread, but i have yet to go and try it out. next time!

Best bread I have ever had.  I am not going to elaborate, as there are numerous blog posts, newspaper/magazine articles and book on the bread.   I would dash up there some random early evenings just to grab a loaf of boule, drop by my favorite grocery store or farmer's market to grab heirloom tomatoes, butter or triple cream cheeses (Brillat Savarin or Delice de Bourgogne) and eat it fresh that night.  If I have leftover I would make some soup or stew and dip this damn thing in.  Or being inspired by Zuni, I would roast a chicken and put slices of bread under the chicken when it is resting out of the oven to absorb drippings. Unfortunately they only have their heavenly bread in the evenings.  They are out of the oven around 4:30 to 5.  That is why I docked one star, especially that parking in Mission is so hard to find during that time. What am I supposed to do when I am craving the bread in the morning?  Hunt for Anthony Bourdain's old pal, Adam Real-last-name-unknown?  If they have the bread coming out fresh from the oven throughout the day, I would give this place 6 stars.   Oh, they have other goodies too, my favorites are the gougere, souffle cake, eclair and croissant (both regular and the frangipane version).

830 am on a friday and still a wait. about 45 min after getting in line, we had ordered: 1 croissant, banana cream tart, ham quiche, 1 eclair, 2 morning buns, 1 coffee. all incredibly amazing. the croissant was the BEST ive had - so buttery. and the tart was also delish except the crust was much harder than i expected.  thought the eclair was ok but that may have been bc it was overshadowed by the deliciousness of everything else. the morning buns were hot out of the oven and u could taste their deliciousness and orangey-ness that wasn't too overwhelming as it kind of melted into a buttery goo on your hands. yum.

I *LOVE* sweets.  I *love* dessert.  I *Love* pastries. And I really really really don't get the hype about Tartine. Bread pudding - bleh.  Give me Chaya's or Woodhouse Fish's (seriously) any day. Morning bun - dry.  I could go to Starbucks and get the same thing. I had the gougere - eh. And there is nowhere to sit.  The lines are *forever* long - after years they still haven't figured it out. Why am I not giving this place 2 stars?  I don't know.  Maybe the hype.

Ah the legendary Tartine.  For my first visit, I made the mistake of coming late in the day, when only the rejected items remained.  And yet there was still a line!  Had a sad looking scone (which tasted like animal crackers), some coconut macaroons and a lemon cake, none of which were extraordinary. Returned for breakfast and a much improved experience.  Sampled the almond croissant (wonderfully crispy, generously filled with rich almond paste), the morning bun (buttery and flaky), and the bread pudding (a bit disappointing as it was more of a custard).   Not the place I'd choose for a relaxing morning reading the newspaper - with its crowded tables, lines out the door, and general commotion.  For strictly breakfast items (not the cakes or tarts) I'd also say that places like Thoroughbread are just as good for nearly half the price.

Tartine, you need better signage, actually, you need a sign period!  I walked right past by you and I didn't even know!  I was having dinner at Pizzeria Delfina and on the way out, I snuck a peek in the your window and caught a glimpse of your sweets!  Let me tell you, I'm a sucker for sweets!  You could of had my business before and after dinner!  Lucky for you, I liked the dark atmosphere and the guy on the guitar!  Some friends and I found a table and stayed for coffee, pumpkin loaf, lemon bar and cookies!  Delish!  It was the perfect ending to our night!

I really only go there for the Country Loaf.  They don't make it every day.  The days they do make it, it's not ready until around 2pm.  And they sell out fast.  It's worth it if you can get it!  The service is a little on the snappy side, but they are so busy they can afford to be brusque.  I guess.

Excellent sandwiches - one is probably enough for at least two meals, and probably buttery enough to clog two hearts. That thing they say about "eat, drink, and be merry" is definitely true with regards to this place. The meringue cookies are orgasmic, and the coffee isn't bad either. The lines are a little long, and it's a bit crowded, but those shortcomings can usually be forgiven.

Finally made it here today, and luck struck for sure as we scored a table amidst the chaos - primarily due to the kindness of another group that agreed to cram around a tiny table for our benefit. It was a little stressful trying to figure out what they had while crammed against others in line, but the food was good. We had the morning bun, the proscuitto and provelone panini and the mushroom and leek quiche. The morning bun was great, loved the orange glaze. The panini was massive, fed three of us. Between the morning bun and the panini we were a little overload on the fried/grease, so definitely a treat! An SF gem worth checking out for sure.

Love coming here to try things; their range is fascinating, they do not necessarily possess a specialty like Fleur de Cocoa in Los Gatos, but are very adept and well rounded, as can be seen in the skill and flavor palette of the pastries. Bordering on "great" for some, but have so far fallen on mostly "very good" so far. Service is attentive, and have met some very warm, friendly staff (hey, hey, not in that way), so plus points for good service. Incredibly crowded, not the place to come to if you are in a rush but if it's a day to just "roll with the punches", this can be a great place to just come and get to know someone, cruise over the lines of a bestseller, laugh with a foodie friend, people watch... When you find your corner in Tartine--at the standing area, the few seats near the coffee bar, the large communal table, the outdoor chairs--it's that small, romantic, Franco-American Mission pastry love affair you can quite memorably call your own. Some things I have tried: * Bread pudding, one of their trademark products, always a bit different day after day. Not exactly my style but very tasty, looks incredibly succulent; my mother, a fan of British desserts, loved it. * Savory Quiche, very good brunch fare; rich, tasty, not mind blowing but still very good. * Croque Monseiur, not exactly traditional--there are a number of additional ingredients du jour--and left open face, it's satisfying and very good but again, not mind blowing. * Slice of Shortbread and Mocha (with a huge dollop of whipped cream). Excellent, very delicious Shortbread! Altogether came to $4.25, about the same price as a scone and coffee at Starbucks, but ten times more comforting. * Pain au Chocolat, HUGE but still classic. Buttery, super crisp, nice bitter smooth dark chocolate. Yum, delicious! A bit expensive, but I suppose it's due to the largeness of the pastry. Definitely coming back; favorite Sunday odd-hours spot on a cold winter day.

Tried the croque which was good...not as traditional as I was expecting (has anyone had sundried tomatoes on a croque in France??) but delicious nonetheless.  Then split a Frangipane tart that was topped with a compote of with one of my favorite, yet under-utilized fruits, the huckleberry.  Good thing I had to walk back to SOMA after that to work all of it off.  To add my two cents to the age of question of whether this place is worth the line or not, I'd have to say it depends on how hungry you are.  I just know that if it was that time of the month, I probably wouldn't have been able to ignore my pastry cravings long enough to wait for one.

We came here after our dinner at Cha Cha Cha's for dessert.  My friend had been raving about this place for the longest time!  So... of course... since we arrived at night, most of the goodies were gone.  Yet, they still had a line out the door.  We took our goodies togo because all their tables were taken.   I had a slice of their Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian Cake.  OK... Let me tell you... it's the REAL deal.  Most places in the continental US don't really have real passion fruit in their desserts or juices.  They use passion fruit juice concentrate (or extremely microscopic droplets of the real fruit) and then mix it with other citrus juices, so that in the end... you don't really taste the passion fruit.  You taste the orange juice or what ever else they mixed it with.... But you buy it because they market the product as "Passion Fruit blah blah blah..." and then you become disappointed because you just don't taste it.  That's just my taste bud's opinion.   So, honestly, I did not have high expectations for this dessert.  I expected it to taste citrusy and more like lime and coconuts than anything else.  First bite... and I was back to a tropical paradise.  The tangy sharp flavor of passion fruits was SO THERE!  Oh my goodness!  I can't believe it!  I'm not in Hawaii or Fiji... and yet... I am actually tasting passion fruit on my tongue... ohhhh... I am so savoring every single luxurious bite.  I take another bite, close my eyes and just let the flavors mesh and melt together on my tongue.  I feel the creaminess of the cream, infused with passion fruit.  I don't taste the lime really... but maybe because it is sour and tangy... just like passion fruit.  The flavor of the passion fruit definitely overpowers the lime (IN A GOOD WAY)...personally, I think they can just omit the lime and leave it out of the name!  I can feel the coarse and crunchy texture of the coconut as I chewed... and know that it is fresh (well, fresh as in picked off the tree overseas, shipped to CA, off the boat to Tartine, and chopped open onsite fresh)... I expected dehydrated dried coconut flakes... not the real, honest to goodness, fresh real real real (I still cannot believe it is real) shaved coconut! I was so so sad to finish my dessert.  I told my hubby that had I known it was this good, I would have bought the whole damn cake!  He said that we probably couldn't finish it while it was still fresh... ha, that's what he thinks!  I could have eaten that whole cake in a day and not share it with him!  =) Ok... so the downer is that I take two stars off because after the waitress packed my slice of cake in a box, she actually licked the cream that got onto her finger... I did a double take... I couldn't believe what I saw!  My friend mentioned it after we left... she saw it too!  We were both quite shocked at her lack of cleanliness and professionalism.  How many times does she do that in a day of business??  Why doesn't she discreetly wipe her finger on her apron or a napkin or a towel?  Is my cake that damn good??  If she had done that before or as she was packing my cake up, I would have raised some hell... good grief!  Germs!!  Thank goodness it was after she closed up my box.  Plus, sadly... I think I was also too shocked to say something.  I really couldn't believe I saw it. In the end... that real slice of heaven was certainly worth it.  They have a recipe book out... I think I'll go buy the book, just to learn how to make that darn cake!  Beats going back to a finger-licking waitress passing Gawd-knows-what germs around!

Beware:  Long Lines.  No Parking.  Costly pastries.  But, you will die happy.  The croissants have a crispy exterior and a delicious fluffy interior.  The choc croissant was delicious. The cookie I had was OK but I could've bought a whole package of Oreos for the price they charged.  Didn't try the bread pudding, it was all gone when I got there.  There's limited seating and the coffee is good. They had a note by the register telling you that due to the cost of ingredients, transportation, etc., they've had to raise their prices by 30%.  If you have time to kill, then waiting in line is the thing for you if you really wanna eat here.

Solid bakery. croissant was absolutely heavenly, and was probably the best thing I ate followed closely by the lemon bar that was divine, not overly sweet but with a lasting rich and deep flavor. The latte was decent, but in a really cool cup, and I thought the bread pudding was pretty good. I'm not a connoisseur of bread pudding by any means, but I really liked the fruit, but not the abundance of moisture. Again, no expert with the croq mousier, but it was pretty good. The bread was really good. I also had a chocolate chip cookie which was really tasty. It was huge, and had a strong molasses flavor, which I enjoyed greatly. I'm a bigger fan of large doughy cookies and this one was thin and crispy, but for what it was, it was excellent. The service is good, but don't expect to be quick about eating here. It can also be hard to find a table. We ended up sitting outside, which I always love. We had some great people-watching. Overall a strong bakery which I would certainly go back to.

things you might need for a day-long excursion to sonoma: 1. a car and a dd 2. some monies for sippin' on wine 3. an ass ton of pastries for the ride there i realize long lines can be discouraging. waiting for 15 minutes in that brutal san fran cold can be a hassle, i know, but there are deliciously flaky, skull-sized croissants at the end of the rainbow. the chocolate was my personal fav, but the ham and cheese seemed to hold its own, lasting an entire day in a hot car for the sole purpose of squelching our hunger after a long day of drinking. thanks for your ham and cheese hangover protection, tartine.

I came here to have a dessert before dinner - that's right folks, dessert always comes first. Unfortunately -- it seemed like the desserts were all cleaned out! Perhaps Monday nights are not the best nights to go. Instead, I got a hot chocolate in a bowl (yummy), and my friend ordered a chai latte. I had to have something, so I ordered a macaroon cookie. The macaroon cookie was DRYYYYYYYYY -- like saharan. But my hot chocolate more than made up for it. It was perfection. I also love drinking out of those french bowls -- it brings out my inner Amelie. We sat at the communal table, which is always nice. I really wanted to try something fun though, like a chocolate pudding, or bread pudding, or another type of pudding.... I've had their bread before, right as it's come out of the oven -- so soft and warm... MMMMM.... but apparently they only do that Wed-Sun after 5:30pm. I think it's a place worth going to, but maybe on the right day.

Have you ever had two jobs? If yes, have you ever realized that you are responsible for opening both businesses on the same morning, and they happen to 'open' at the same time? If yes, did you call someone from each location to attempt to solve the problem yet were unable to get anyone to pick up (since it's 9:30am on a Sunday morning), thus leaving you the nearly impossible need to be at 2 places at once? If yes, were you a little stressed out? The answer for me this beautiful sunday morning was YES to all of the above. Don't worry, I am super woman and was able to get both locations opened, didn't need to fire anyone and didn't get fired myself and managed to stay calm during the process. How you might ask? Well I have a superman of a husband that went to Tartine Bakery this morning before they openend and stood in a line 30 people deep to pick up some morning buns and coffee for his wife to enjoy at the job she was actually scheduled to be at this morning. He saved the day by picking me up and transporting me between 1 location and the other with pipping hot coffee and soft fresh sugary morning buns in hand. Once crisis was over, businesses were open and customers were happy I was able to sit down, enjoy my yummy, gewy sugary, flaky taste treat of a breakfast and reflect on 'jobs' well done. And an added bonus - he also picked me up a coconut cream tart that I have to look forward to for dessert tonight : )

i was so impressed with Tartine that i bought the cookbook and tried making some of dessert at home. I have successfully made the Lemon Meringue cake! The lemon cream on this cake is just heavenly. The combination of the lemon cream, sponge cake and caramel is just perfection.Unlike newer bakeries, Tartine uses a more traditional method in their pastry. I came down here for a breakfast, and had both the lemon tart and quiche. Both are very yummy. I wish there are more bakeries like these.

I keep falling in and out of love with Tartine. Sometimes their food is really good other times it's disappointing. The last time we came we had the frangipane tart and coconut tart. The frangipane tart was really dry and you could barely taste the fruit. The crust was almost impossible to break through. The coconut tart was pretty good because the bottom of the crust cup is layered with dark chocolate. The coconut filling is good too but we had the same problem with the indestructible crust. I think we'll stay away from the tarts for now.

well, i'm mixed..i thought the plain croissant and the bread pudding were fantastic...but the chocolate croissant was pretty crappy. actually, it would have been really good if the chocolate was slighly melted. maybe it was my fault for letting it sit for a few hours - see, when you bit into it, you basically got a block of bitter-sweet chocolate in your mouth. disappointing. oh, and the asian counter girl there has a real attitude. someone should fire her... but the other girls at the register were very nice. am i being too bitchy?

Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  If only I could eat at Tartine every day for breakfast.  I'd be in heaven... and very, very fat.  The frangiopane croissant is one of the best I've ever had - only beaten by fresh, out of the oven butter croissants I gobbled up in Paris.  Their salad is also spectacular - just the right amount of lemon zest for the dressing.  Stick with the panini over the croque monsieur - I thought the CM was a little too heavy and soggy.

my favorite things about tartine: * morning rolls, pretty much everything. since the food needs no more reviews, how about the less talked about things... * there's always a long line on weekends -- keeps me from going too often and saves my blood sugar, waist line and cholesterol from hitting dangerous levels. * they aren't open when i pass by in the morning on the way to bart --  -- saves my blood sugar, waist line and cholesterol from hitting dangerous levels. * when i walk by in the morning i love seeing the pastry chefs (would they mind being called bakers?)  rolling dough and working their magic. i have a crush on whomever is working that day. * i'm convinced that the best street crossing in the city is crossing 18th st in front of tartine early in the morning...if a gust of wind comes down 18th from diamond heights, the air carries with it a blast of tartine pastry goodness that only dissipates from my nostrils when i'm assaulted by the piquant odor of the 16th & mission bart station steps. * this one time? i bought a morning roll? the very cute girl working the counter smiled at me and told me she made sure i got the best one in the case. that didn't just make my day, it made my month. though like a dope i didn't follow up, as the place was (as usual) insanely busy.

crowded, over priced and attitudinal. morons score a table and then get in the *ALWAYS* long line so that there are people standing around who have food and would have eaten and left by the time the moron who dropped his bag on the one empty table actually gets anything to sit down with. pricey. high quality ingredients, but it always leaves me feeling a bit too squeezed in my pocket book. Often burnt. I know many americans are used to way underdone baked goods, but they serve stuff here so past the *done* stage its no longer caramelized, its carbonized. The pressed sandwiches are good, but they are inconsistent with the application of mustard and I have had a few so smothered in hot mustard that i couldn't eat them. i order it with the mustard on the side now, and ignore the hipster cashier behind the register who thinks putting my mustard on the side is like, ya know, WAY too much trouble.... this place has been a sacred cow almost since the day it opened (which i was present for) and i wind up going here because others love the chichi abuse they get, but i would NEVER pick it if i had a choice and i usually leave annoyed. the best part about tatine is the interesting folks i have met while standing in the line or sitting elbow to elbow with. but it's a sad thing when the people watching is the best part of a bakery... try mission pie over at the corner of mission and 25th. delicious and way better energy.

tartine is hands down, the best bakery/cafe in san francisco. i would be blind if i dont realize how tartine's devotion to clean and scrumptuous goodies reflects their success in their own craft. i've been there twice already, and so far i've ordered the almond frangipane croissant, olive bread (savory), fresh muesli and chocolate pudding made of valrhona chocolate!...im like the walking advertisement for tartine, because i've brought 2 of my girlies there..and they ordered the bread pudding, lemon tart (very cute!), banana tart, quiche, et al. all are made at their bakery/kitchen, located at the back of the cafe. OH YES. i love how their big gynormous oven is located beside the restrooms.. AHHAHAHA.... i really know where my food from tartine came.. :D ... BUT THE THING is.. the waitresses are kinda snobby... seems passive and stressed out... they need to be more inviting and interactive. BUT tartine is the booomb.! :D  regardless of the snobby waitresses.. lol next time.. i SHALL order a drink there, haven't ordered a drink from tartine, but one of my girlies did.. she ordered a hot chocolate! :) OH YES! WORTH THE WAIT ......... JAMPACKED WITH PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT, BUT IT'S GREAT TO WAIT AND SEATING ISN'T BAD AT ALL... people come and go, so you get a table after you paid! hehehhe

This place is phenomenal. They were sold out of bread but they luckily had everything else I was dying to have. I got the chocolate croissant, morning bun and the banana cream tart. The croissant must have weighed in at just under a pound. It was the richest, heaviest, butteriest thing I've ever eaten and it was amazing. THe morning bun was also delicious, but the banana cream tart was one of the greatest things I have ever eaten. Puff pastry with banana pudding, whipped cream and chocolate shavings? Yes please

Quaint, busy cafe. I got the infamous banana cream pie and the eclairs, I'm usually not a fan of cream filling but the cream pie and eclairs were delicious! But $7 for a pie and $5 for an eclair is pricy, nevertheless they were tasty and hit the spot. I would definitely go back!

The morning bun is overhyped considering the inflated price and average size and good, but not exquisite taste of the pastry.  I was impressed by the crispness of the first bite, thanks in large part to being literally the first person to sink my teeth into one at 730am in the  morning.  Despite that fact, I'll have to rate it slightly above average at best because the taste of it is nothing unique

I am a big fan of pastries, especially desert pastries. This place has the BEST chocolate eclairs I have ever eaten. Most chocolate eclairs you will find has dough that is dried out and lacks taste. As well as chocolate that is hardened onto the eclair. But at Tartine it is perfect. Their dark chocolate that they use is of perfect consistency for a pastry, and tastes amazing. The custard filling that they use makes you feel even more in heaven. You have to try it. Another pastry I would recommend is their morning buns. But be warned they are very addictive.

Warning: they only serve bread after 5 PM! I came here in the morning to get a loaf of sourdough (which was rated the best in the city by... someone), only to find a line out the door and a sign telling me that bread comes out of the oven at 5 PM. Bummah. Instead I got a morning bun, which was good, but nothing mind-blowing. Without the orange sugar on top, it would have been totally blah.

I went here on my way home from a weekend trip to San Francisco. This place has a ton of hype so I expected greatness! I ordered the quiche and my wife ordered the gougere. Both were very good. I have to admit that I have had better quiche at a place called "Bread and Cie" in San Diego. So I cant give 5 stars. The gougere was really good, and I'm not sure where I would ever see this again, so I cant compare it to anything. When you walk in and look at all of the freshly baked pastries and breads behind the glass though you just know that there are so many good things here. I will definitely  go back on every visit and try a new thing there. I can see myself coming here each visit and trying a new thing.

I was pretty smitten from the moment I walked thru the door.  The pastry case that greets you upon arrival is filled to the brim with a vast assortment of delectable treats.  I choose two pastries and a cup of a superb monkey picked oolong, I was on vacation, so thought I would splurge ($5 for a cup of tea!?!?) granted, it was delicious.  My savory pastry (I forget the name, but it was basically gruyere, pepper & thyme brioche) was phenomenal, the chocolate croissant was good, but not the best I've had. I really wanted to get the banana creme tart, it looked unreal, next time I will for sure. Definitely a must when in the bay area.

They had a 4 piece orchestra band on a Thursday evening...that was cool! I think their sweet stuff maybe better than some of the savory. The keish was really heavy. The coconut macaroons were the best I ever had because its crispy on the outside with the toasted coconut and soft on the inside. I can't wait to try their coconut passion fruit cake that a lot of people seemed to have. They give generous slices of everything. I also want to try the open faced sandwiches that looked good. On a nice day, the outside seating would be fun!

I get what reviewers are saying about the hype and here is what I think the deal with the mixed reviews on this place is: There are a few items in the pastry case that are "meh".  If you happen to order these, you will be let down - particularly if you heard the mouth-orgasm-pastry-lust reviews from friends or online.  This is what happened to me the first time I went.  I enjoyed everything fully but was not overwhelmed. Then I went back and tried something I normally would not have picked first - the frangipane tart.  That thing blew me away hard...I worked in a french bakery for years in college and I can be a baked goods snob...but this thing was completely perfect. So, despite the "meh" level coconut cake and yummy but not mind blowing banana cream pie, this place gets 5 stars because there are few things that are so perfectly made that makes up for anything else that they have ever or will ever do. Also, to be clear, even the worst thing in the place gets 3.75 stars in my opinion.

I tried a few different things here- the Coconut Passion Fruit Cake, Croque Monsier with turkey, and the Soppressata sandwich. All were good, but none were amazing.  All in all, Tartine ended up seeming overhyped to me considering the prices... You could easily get better tasting items of a similar nature elsewhere for maybe 2/3 the price.

I think, and have thought for years and years, that Tartine was one of the most delicious and beautiful little bakeries around.  I still do.  Half a block away you can smell the butter and yeast and sugar; an intoxicating aroma that pretty much sums the place up.  As a carb and sugar junkie who tries to limit my refined carb and sugar intake- this place is deadly.  Actually, that whole stretch of 18th is deadly (Delfine, Pizzeria Delfina, Bi Rite, Creamery...) Their sandwiches and very nice.  Especially their croque monsieur and madame.  The one without meat, with mushrooms, is so well done.  It used to come with little pickled carrots.  Sometimes I would get the endive salad with it which was very crisp and refreshing and lemony. Their coffee is decent.  Their desserts, like their bread, are perfection.  Try the eclair.  Or the lemon tart.  On occasion I've thought that their bread pudding needed some work.  But otherwise everything I've ever had has been lovely.  It is a bit pricier than what you may expect if you don't live in SF ie sticker shock...I've at times grabbed some food and sweets to go and dropped $20 to $40 before I'd realized what had happened.  But worth every life-shortening penny...

Tartine! I dream of your croissants and your lattes in bowls. Seriously, the croissants are French-grandma-flaky-golden perfection. The open-face sandwiches looked similarly epic (thick-cut country bread and what looked like lots of hot, golden-brown, melty cheese seemed to be the theme of these) although they were completely out by the time I arrived to the counter. There's also a little coffee bar inside that sells Blue Bottle and, unlike most oversubscribed Blue Bottle stores themselves, actually makes a delicious, hot, foamy latte. We came to Tartine following the SF half-marathon on a busy Sunday and waited in line for about a half hour before ordering. However, something about a long wait for buttery breakfast pastries and caffeine makes San Franciscans more than a little cranky, and we felt so pressured to order and immediately leave that we pointed at a few pastries at random and ran out the door to a bench in Dolores Park as quickly as we could. Although the aforementioned plain croissant and the pain au chocolat were delightful, the gougere (a big fluff of pastry filled with gruyere, then salted and peppered) and the bread pudding (lushly covered with apricots and blackberries) didn't quite live up. Perhaps the gougere would be better warmed, and the bread pudding better when immediately served. If Tartine were a neighborhood bakery in which I could stop by and grab a croissant and coffee on my way to work, or sit down to savor them with a good book, I'd petition Yelp to give it more than five stars. However, I'm deterred by the rushed atmosphere, the customary out-the-door line, the cramped seating, the hipster waitstaff...but I suppose you can't quite expect less from a neighborhood gem in SF.

This place needs to get over itself. Or else be stuck with mostly one-time customers who are visitors of SF who interpret high prices with high quality. $13.50 for a burnt turkey sandwich. That's it; nothing else (I don't count two baby pickled carrots as anything). $6.25 for a chocolate hazelnut tart. AND the cashier gave me grief about substituting dijon mustard for the broccoli rabe pesto on my sandwich. Really?! Who wants broccoli rabe anything on a turkey sandwich? Oh--and when I asked for water, she rudely said "it's over there. you can pour it yourself." Niiiice. Most expensive lunch in SF yet. Someone should tell them the recession is over and 200% markup is no longer justified. I won't be going back...

After reading the numerous amazing reviews and being taunted by the over 900 pictures of deliciousness posted by Tartine fans, this was a must stop on our recent adventure to San Francisco. Once inside Tartine we selected bread pudding(next time I'll pass, too eggy for me), macaroons, Coconut Passion Fruit Cake(I'm determined to make this my future Wedding cake), Bavarian berry cake(delicious and quickly devoured), and completely missed the banana cream tart(which was one of the items I specifically went for).  Oh well, there's always next time. Goodies in hand and we were off to feast at Mission Delores Park just around the corner.  What a great view and the place where my partner of 10 years decided to propose!  I definitely want the Coconut Passion Fruit Cake for my wedding cake.  YUM! Couldn't have asked for a better moment, fantastic views, scrumptious yummies from Tartine and now a beautiful ring  :)

Saw this bakery featured on a tv show the week before my California vacation, and after seeing the host talking about their pan au chocolat with a lusty passion that made me almost cry, put it at the top of my list of places to visit.  We were able to park on the street a couple of blocks away which was great.  Small quaint bakery/sandwich place with a small bar as well.  The place was packed, and seating is definitely limited, though outdoor seating provides a great spectacle of downtown frisco!  I, of course, had the pan and a glass of white Bordeaux.  My  cousin had the banana cream and a tall glass of ice cold milk.  I just couldn't believe how awesome and perfect that croissant was!  I had saved my "hungry's" All day for this and savored every flaky and perfectly chocolatey bite.  The croissant was made from real whole ingredients and the flavor showed. Not greasy, not dry.  The banana cream tart was light and exactly what one would satiate those banana cream cravings with and be in banana cream nirvana afterward, no regrets.  It comes down to ingredients with these kinds if things.  Tartine seems to take no short cuts. To sum it up?  GO!!!!

Pastries like the ones you'll find at Tartine are hard to come by, at least in San Francisco.  I'm addicted to their croissants and hot cocoa.  I know that's nothing fancy, but they do the staples very well.  The croissant is flaky and buttery, not spongy like it is at most other bakeries, and their hot cocoa is rich and very aromatic.  The only downside is the crowd (lack of seating) and sometimes the unfriendly staff.  When they are busy, I can understand the attitude.  However, I've been there on a slow day and the person at the drink counter just stood their and chatted with her co-worker while I was longing for my hot chocolate!

I personally didn't like the broccoli rabe pesto.  But had left-overs, and tasted better cold then hot.  Will definitely come again.

Lines are always ridiculously long.  Service is super slow.  I think some of the workers may actually be moving backwards.  They're nazis about some of the rules, ie. no pressed sandwiches before noon.  Sometimes, I feel like they keep me waiting longer just because they can.  But despite all of these flaws, I still find myself coming back.  Personally, I don't think any of the sandwiches are that great.  The Jambon Royale & Gruyere is probably my favorite.  I really like the Gougere, which is essentially cheesy bread.  But the real reason to come here is for the desserts.  The eclairs are amazing, but super messy.  The Chocolate Souffle Cake and Lemon Meringue Cake are awesome too.  I don't think it's worth coming here for brunch.  You're better off coming when it's less busy to just pick up desserts.

Oh my goodness gracious!  Tartine's pastries are sooo delish and they also bake the best bread I've ever tasted.  The long lines can be a bit of a drag, but it is definitely worth the wait.  I always make sure to stop by this place whenever we're in the neighborhood (most likely on the way to dinner at Delfina) and pick up a few treats--my favs include their morning buns (dripping with orange cinnamon sugar!), scones, banana creme tarts, and bread pudding.  I also recently discovered the wonders of their bread.  It's really hard not to order one of everything they have, but since I am trying to lose some baby fat, I try to limit myself to a few items each visit.  I may never lose the extra 10 pounds I'm carrying from my pregnancy, but I just can't give this place up!

The best bakery in San Francisco. Hands down. The only item on the menu I've been disappointed with is the croissant -- It's a little too bready and not properly flaky like a real croissant should be. The lines are long... but unless they expand there's not much they can do about that...

killer desserts and pastries. i love the bread pudding. add a cup of extra hot coffee with 2 sugar cubes and a big dollop of milk (hahah) and a seat outside in the sun, and i'll be happy. maybe a little too happy. i like the banana cream tart, but i would prefer the bananas to be creamed and fluffy and not just sliced. the devils food cake is yummy for a few bites, but too dense for my ideal cake. i've always had better scones at arizmendi, but these are not bad by any means. tartine is best when it's not inundated by globs of wannabee trendy folk. for real food, the sandwiches are rather tasty and filling. why not just make two halves instead of three pieces? i look around and most people can't finish the second piece let alone make it to the third. i had an unsatisfying late lunch experience at tartine. ok, it's crowded, like a pack of sardines, but does it take nearly an hour to make one three cheese sandwich? just grill the mofo. whatever, i don't hold a grudge against them.

The quiche was fluffy, subtle, flavorful, and just so amazing! The almond croissant was out of this world, with the perfect crunchiness, great filling, and had a pleasant denseness. The bread pudding was good, but was the least favorite of the bunch. The banana cream tart was the perfect sweetness, allowing the natural sweetness of the banana and chocolate be the strongest flavors. The crust was also perfect. I can't say enough good things about the baked goods at Tartine Bakery. Definitely lived up to the hype!

i've been wanting to try this place forever, and today i finally had a chance. i drive down there and realize it's also right next to pizza delfina, another place i've wanted to try. so, to try to kill 2 birds with one stone, we have lunch and pizza delfina and decide to grab dessert next door. after a lovely lunch, we stroll over to tartine and run into a big line. ok, no big deal, people put their order in, pay sit down. hmmm...perhaps their system is not perfected though because the line doesn't seem to be moving. it took us about 10 minutes after we ordered our banana cream tart to go, to actually get to the register and pay, perhaps the girl is new. anyhow, the tart itself is delicious. flaky crust, ripe bananas and just the right balance of cream and chocolate. i also loved that the cream isn't overly sweet, allows me to just keep eating (perhaps not a good thing actually...)

The pastries here are phenomenal. Plain and simple. The pain au chocolates here are absolutely to die for. They're just as good, if not better, than the ones I've had in France.  And the quiches...and the cakes...and the... big fat butt I'm going to have if I keep coming here !!

I'm giving this place 3 stars because I only have 1 experience to base my review. But I really don't get what the hype is/was all about.  The place is cramped, layout and service inefficient and I expected a much larger selection of goodies.  I'll say the croissants did look good - but I went at lunch and didn't want to pay $3 for a croissant I wouldn't get to enjoy until the next morning.  I got the jambon and gruyere sandwich and was not impressed - too much mustard and $10!

This place is a buttery haven in the mission, shelling out the pastries and attracting lines of hipsters. But I must say, it is usually just ok, not fantastic. I suggest that you skip the greasy croissants and wait until after five pm for the breads to come out of the oven.... Now those deserve 5 stars for sure. I just can't give em' five starts overall, because: (a) some of the other pastries are sub par, and (b) why on earth must I wait until after five for some yummy bread?

Tartine is my favorite bakery in the world. Imagine walking into a packed french bakery where the food is perfect and they are playing old skool michael jackson on the radio? Yes. That's tartine. The line is worth it. Things i love: the daily bread pudding, the chocolate pudding (although i ask for extra creme - that little dollop is not enough) and the warm sandwiches with pickled green beans. I usually get the black forest ham and cheese. My sister loves the lemon tart.

I love everything here, you just can't really go wrong. But my absolute favorite is the morning bun and all of it's warm cinnamon orangey glory. I also dig their hot chocolate. Not something I could live on everyday, unless I want to be 1000 pounds, but definitely a treat. I had to take one star off, because another reason I don't go there that often is it is too f'ing crowded and the lines are long!

It's unfortunate that I live in the East Bay and can't take advantage of the many offerings at Tartine.  Although if you are going to go, take BART or walk... whatever you do, don't drive.  It's an easy walk from the BART station, and luckily that walk kept me warm as I waited in line to enter Tartine.  Everything looked great, but I didn't want to come off as a pig, so I just ordered the croque monseur.  Luckily my friends ordered the ham and cheese croissant as well as the bread pudding and chocolate pudding, thus I was able to partake in a tasting of each.  If only they had a bigger place, or maybe some heat lamps outside for those cold chilly SF days would be nice.  While dining outside, my food got cold fast but still delicious nonetheless.

i love this place, but can never visit on the weekends due to major tourist and marina takeover. week days for me. i love their coconut cream pie.w/ carmel and chocolate layers. it was my this year's birthday cake! they also are very nice to local artists, both supporting them with a great opening when featured in their cafe, and by being extra generous with their end of day leftovers...I fed my crew delicious gourmet bread and fancy quiche all donated by Tartine.. in santa cruz, where I lived for 15 years there are like 10 Tartines, In SF there is only one...one really decent bakery..or at least that I've discovered so far....we're so lucky to have them in the mission. in fact, Tartine is "good gentrification" there was a bakery there b4 them too so it's not like they turned housing into gourmet eating like some places have... .

God it was the best chocolate pudding ever! Unfortunately, my friends also thought so, and helped scarf down 3/4 of it, thanks guys! I also had their eclair and the cream was amazing! They've got some awesome coffee as well with free refills. Always packed so scope out seats, and their staff always has a smile.

I dream about Tartine. Literally. Since I've moved away from San Francisco, my trips to Tartine have been few and very far between. The bread pudding, almond croissant and ham and cheese croissants are my absolute favorites. They don't skimp on filling in their croissants. The almond paste in the almond croissant is heavenly. It's topped with lightly toasted almonds and powdered sugar - delicious. Their lattes come in large bowls and usually give me a good caffeine buzz. Before I leave to go back to Chicago, I always pack an extra croissant or two for the trip home. IMO, the best bakery ever - even better than Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery.

Insane. 952 reviews on Yelp doesn't lie - Tartine is phenomenal! I made my first trip to Tartine yesterday, a Friday, at 4 PM, and got a table outside immediately. As recommended by the cute guy ringing me up, I ordered the pressed sopressata, fontina & broccoli rabe pesto sandwich, and a heavenly almond croissant for dessert. I don't know why people have complained about the prices of the sandwiches and baked goods - after all, the ingredients are fresh, organic and locally produced. What is there not to love? I would have given 5 stars if they had heated lamps outside. It was freezing, and there were no more tables inside!

Okay! agree that the pastry and things they have in the store are good and delicious. Love the eclair, banana cream tart, and the almond croissant.... DELICIOUS!  BUT, they are a little in the pricey side, and the server I had today was very rude! So, I don't know which one should I weigh more while there are other competition with almost the same good quality of food and taste, and cheaper than this one with better customer service? Hmm... Anyway, it was worth a try and hopefully I would remember to come back and try different things... since parking was also a nightmare to find! But overall, it has good stuff and the place is cute.

Yes, it's good (really good), but the space itself is also uninviting, (partly because) the place is chronically understaffed, and I find $7.25 for a loaf of bread too much, regardless of how good the bread is...my point being that most baked goods, particularly pastries, are prohibitively expensive.

Yum.  The bread pudding and morning buns are amazing.  I was not as impressed by the frangipane croissants or gougeres, but the bread pudding and morning buns are so good that it doesn't even matter.  I had the croque monsieur awhile ago and wasn't blown away, but it's not bad by any means.  The worst part is the freakin' long wait in line to get in and the effort required to snag a table.  But worth it nonetheless.

being accustomed to lighter baked goods of japanese / korean patisiers, Tartine was definitely too rich for me. however, its close proximity to mission dolores park made it the perfect place to pick up some pastries for our impromptu picnic at the park.  ALSO, thanks to Tartine now i know what chocolate pudding is supposed to taste like and the brand that sounds like bell-O has it all wrong.

by far the absolute best bakery in san francisco. actually the entire bay area.   ...california?  nope -- the entire world.....  I first discovered tartine while eating dinner a few doors down at delfina. the bread they served was incredible, and it turned out to be the country bread from the bakery on the corner.... tartine!!!  if you haven't already, buy yourself a loaf of the country bread and tell me it isn't the most delicious bread you've ever had.  just as good if not better than something you can buy in paris and eat underneath the eiffel freaking tower.  everything sold in tartine is authentic and has so much thought put into it.  I have yet to try a pastry/tart/cookie/etc. that I haven't loved.   some of my favorites: banana cream pie, lemon tart, almond croissants, and of course, the country bread like to bake and feel afraid you can never live up to such a pheonomenal bakery??  don't worry, tartine has it's very own recipe book too ;)

Eclair for breakfast, banana tart for lunch, lemon poppyseed almond pound cake for dinner and coconut tart for dessert...that's what I wished I could have everyday because the dessert here is just awesome! I never tried their food but whenever I'm around the Mission I never fail in getting some kind of dessert here.  Always busy though so expect to wait for a while to order.  Plus the place isn't too roomy so eating in is not one of my favorites.  I tried their latte and cappichino too and they're not bad.  Their desserts doesn't come cheap but reasonable considering how good they are.

Wished I lived in the City so I could frequent this place more often. Came here with a friend on a Sunday afternoon after doing a long walk around the Mission District and Lower Haight. I had a creamy lemon tart and it was delicious. Perfect blend of tartness and sweetness. Pretty much melted in my mouth. The place and a fun and friendly vibe and once we placed our order, we got our stuff quickly. Grab a seat on the side and watch all the traffic and pedestrians go by.

I came here Saturday and ordered the ham croque monsieur and some MEAN bread pudding. It was beyond delicious. I walked down the street smiling very happily eating my delicious, creamy, cheesy, sandwich topped with asparagus. :) It's a trendy little spot and busy.

Tartine is an amazing bakery but don't bother trying to have a meal here.

i only come here when fate tells me to.  there must be a confluence of in the neighborhood + parking spot + time to wait + not on the way to or from eating already. and when i do make it through the line (which really does move fast, by the way), fate tells me to order more than i can handle and take it home, because who knows when the next magical moment will come?

coconut cream pie.   I don't typically order it, but it was calling my name.  Perfect to split between two people, maybe even three girls.   Thick rich crust that satisfies as much as a cookie with its crunchy dark chocolate lining, decadent cream, and the dense whipped topping with a touch of coconut shavings didn't even make you feel sick or too heavy but hit every spot possible.   Had about 5 small pieces of I don't know what, but nothing stood out as much as the coconut cream pie.  I am currently drooling.

Tartine Bakery is one of those places that you can't resist stopping by every time you're up in SF.  Be prepared though, every time I've gone, the line has been out the door.  It's worth the wait.  They're known for their delicious desserts but they're savory dishes are good too.  The interior decor always puts a smile on my face.  Hanging on the walls and ceiling are sketches of Sasquatch/troll-like creatures with the most curious looks on their faces.  If you don't like small tight-crowded places don't go.  Most likely you'll be standing up at a counter, shoulder to shoulder w/a stranger or sharing a table.  But if you're a foodie, its all worth it.

Good but questionable wait. We accidentally passed by and saw the long line and decided to come back and try the place. We didn't mind the line because it actually moved pretty fast but we had quite a rude server.  She was grouchy and look mad that we were ordering so much, if you get her beware (she had a sharply cropped ear length dark hair). So we ordered the morning bun, couple of chocolate croissants, the bread pudding, macaroon, some type of savory cheese pop over and coffee. We never got the macaroon because the server forgot to pull it out of the case. The bread pudding was wonderfully sweet and soft and a pretty good size for $6. The morning bun has a great orange taste that is so fresh and I love the sprinkles of crystalized sugar. I liked the chocolate croissants but wish there was a little more dough to it and not all flakey crust. The savory cheese thing was a great compliment to all the sweets. Overall I found this place a good place to try but I wouldn't be a regular. Still mad about the server too....what a grouch to be working at such a "cool" place.

Ditto to Marlis T's review.  I'm not taking off points for the ridiculous wait, b/c that's not Tartine's fault.  But the un-bussed tables, lack of direction about where to pick up your coffee and self-serve water (both in opposite corners of the restaurant), the presence of oatmeal in a chocolate chip cookie - all these minor frustrations add up.

So after having ike's sandwich what better place to finish off that afternoon than with Tartine.  I had the coconut tart and the bread pudding.  The tart is the best I ever had and i wouldn't mind if this was the last thing I ever ate.  Bread pudding was amazing as well, moist, sweet, but with a touch of berries that blends well together, you can actually finish the whole thing because it does not over coated with sugar.  THe line wasn't the long when I was there but will I stand in line for however long. U bet.

The bun comes out very warm, crispy, and fresh. There's a hint of a tangy and sweet taste that makes such a unique combination of flavor.  it's just perfect! I go to work early in the morning and having the bun for breakfast puts me in such a delightful mood that as I walk to work while eating the bun, I fall in love more with the city (the Mission area). Not that many food can do such a thing for me, but the morning bun elevates me in such a way that I feel excited and secure for whatever is going to happen that day.

I don't car how long the line is, I know what ever I order will be worth the "weight", though their bread pudding is best when there's great seasonal fruit like summertime.

With their lack of signage (same is true at their restaurant too), it seems like they don't want people to know that they're there and they exist. Luckily you can tell by the line out the door (or the address, smarty pants). Haha. We proceeded to wait in line - I didn't think it was sooo long but a few people ahead of us gave up and left while we were waiting. Inside was packed - some small tables and some big too - so it's communal. The staff varies from semi rude to semi out of it. And since there are so many people in there and in line, I got skipped over being helped a few times. It's kinda chaotic. I really wanted to try their Double Pain Au Chocolat but they were out that afternoon. So I settled for a croissant and a morning bun. Almost $4 for each - so overpriced - yet people still wait in line for it. After tasting it, they were both good. The croissant was flakey and moist, not oily. And the morning bun was surprising light with the hint of orange and cinnamon roll type quality. But worth the price and the wait - probably not and kinda overrated. Glad I tried it though and will be back for the chocolate pastry.

Lines were long but moves quick. Shared a jarbon with gruyere hot pressed sandwich and it was huge. Comes in 3 pieces and it made both my and my friend full from the sandwich (about $12 or $13?). My friend and i were hit really hard with a glop of horseradish that really opens up your sinuses, not pleasing at all. But that didn't take it away from the delicious classy jam and cheese. My friend ordered the side salad ($4?) and she couldn't eat it because she said the lettuce was really bitter. It's a cute place to come and eat and hang with hipster friends. Next time, I would definitely get dessert. The eclairs looked sooo awesome. Kinda bummed I didnt get it.

If meringue is your thing..

Looking at the line of people hungrily waiting to order their fix, one may wonder if it's all worth it?  Hell Yeah it's worth it.  The chocolate pastries are sweet, but not too sweet, and are sooo chocolately, they are beyond compare.  The only comparison I could fathom is Citizen Cake.  But the staff there is SOO pretentious, it's no wonder they don't have lines along the block trying to get in.  So jog a few times around the block so you could feel justified in eating what you stood in line for.

This probably goes without saying, but Tartine is basically the definition of happy morning food. Be prepared for an insanely long line that will leave you questioning yourself for staying in it for a mere pastry, but if you can be patient, bring your iPod, and get a fresh, warm morning bun (the best pastry they have), you'll forget the line altogether. Awesome spot to pick up an assortment for friends...they'll be happy that you did. The quiche and the souffles are also well worth sampling. Early a.m. is by far the best time - when everything is still piping hot.

If you have a craving for baked goods in San Francisco, this may very well be one of the best spots for it. I came here the first time with my brother and his fiancee about a year and a half ago. Nestled in a street corner, it looks much like any other bakery/coffee shop from the outside. Only when you get closer do you see that the interior is completely packed with a line of people extending outside. It's a small place so it is not uncommon to have to share tables with strangers. But that is always fun as you get to meet different people. I'm not usually much for fancy pastry but was won over by the gruyre roll. It's tasty with interesting after flavors of cracked black pepper. The quiche has also been killer. Topping that off with a cappuccino makes for a great Sunday mid afternoon snack. There are just too many things to choose from so I guess I'm going to have to come back and sample everything. =)

On an incredibly hot and sunny sunday afternoon (yesterday), the boyfriend and I were driving down lovely 18th street in the mission/dolores area when hunger striked and he whisked us off  to Tartine. I was extremely hungry, but Tartine's menu wasn't working for me. I nutted it up and ordered the Jambon sandwich and a pellegrino...I couldn't have been happier. The food was excellent, the staff was very nice and the place was crowded. Even though it wasn't entirely their faults, I am gonna minus them a star for the pidgeon that slightly attacked me while I ate outside at one of their tables. Overall I had a good experience, I will revisit and try their deserrts.

So I dragged everyone over to Tartine on our recent trip to SF. I had seen the owner of this place on Martha Stewart and wanted to see what this place was about. After finally getting there and waiting in line, we ordered lattes and a bunch of desserts. It was a cute little place and after coming from the terrible restaurant from Chinatown we kind of wished we had had lunch there. Everything was good-but nothing had the wow factor. The hazelnut brownie things were okay and the bread pudding was good too. Its a nice stop if you have some leisurely time in SF but dont kill yourself to get there!

There is nothing like a banana creme tart, croque monsieur, a slice of quiche and a decadent slice of chocolate cake to devour on a lazy afternoon.  I love coming here on Sundays when I have nothing better to do then people watch from a small outdoor coffee table.  There is ALWAYS a line out the door of the bakery, but it moves quickly.  Beware if you come here starving though because as you move through the line, you'll be taunted and beckoned by so many delectable pastries and cakes before you finally make your order.  I always end up getting too much food, but I've been lucky to have my boyfriend around to help me indulge in the tastiness.  Everything in this bakery is worth trying.

A little overrated, if you ask me.  I've had better croque monseurs; maybe because I am comparing to Bouchon, and that may not be fair.  The bread pudding was really good; would have been better served warm.  Could not taste the specialty sandwiches, since they were so backed up, they stopped serving.  Would rather go to Peasant Pies in Noe.  No wait, and it is pure goodness.

The chocolate souffle cake alone is enough to warrant frequent visits and inventing any reason to celebrate and buy a cake... the most delicious chocolate cake I have ever experienced, a lot like an incredible dark chocolate truffle, only the size of a cake.  Now consider the bread pudding and the hot loaves of fresh baked bread, and its obvious while the lines are usually obnoxiously long, but well worth the wait.

I really don't understand the hype.  I've been here 2X looking for the wow experience.  And I've come to the conclusion that you people are  far to easily impressed.   The bread pudding was ehhhh.  The buttermilk scone was blahhh and the lemon tart was way to tarty.   I've never been so misled.   Yelp, how will I ever be able to trust you again?  Skip the over-dramatized hype and head over to specialties for some tasty baked goods.

I love Tartine! We always make the trek across town for the yummy Croque Monsieur (any of their Croques with shitake mushrooms is soooo yummy!)  and a bowl of soy latte. The husband loves the tangy and spicy homemade pickled carrot we get on the side. Everything in their baked goods section has been good for us so far. I have not had  the Eclairs but they seem to be ordered by 3-4 people in line every time I go. Sweet things I love there: Bread Pudding, Almond Fragipane, and chocolate pudding!  As always, there is a long line out the door and you have to be strategic about getting a place to sit for more than 1 person. Counter style ordering and they bring you food to the table. Coffee will be served at the bar. Seating inside and out. A great place for food, but not much room.

I moved to Chicago for law school, but still think about Tartine all the time.  I would skip the sandwiches because they can be a little greasy, and stick with the croque monsieuers (sp?) and desserts.  My favorite is the banana cream tart...the tart crust is actually lined with chocolate.  Their lattes are also really really good and come in those fun bowls to drink out of.  I once bought the passion fruit cake for my family and they loved it.

This review is based solely on one supreme item: Tartine's walnut bread.  It is the most amazing bread ever and the loaves are huge.  It is easy to order bread in advance and if you give them a credit card you don't have to line up to collect it.  Attitude is not great, however, and it's small and crowded and impossible to park nearby.  But once I return and brave the lines for lunch or a snack I am sure I will have more to say.

After reading a review in SFGate regarding being voted as the best Bakery in America, I figured to give this place a try.  Wow. Just driving past it on a nice Sunday (Father's Day) afternoon, we saw a HUGE long line wrapping around the corner of the store...WHOLLY COW!  must've been a 30 minute wait!  I was FORTUNATE enough to find parking right on the corner!...(Time to buy lotto baby!) Everything inside was BUSTING like crazy!  Looked and smelled good!  We finally settled on things we haven't really tried before: Coconut Bulvarian Cake - Nice and creamery....very good and very fattening!  guess more time at the gym! Fruit Brioche Bread pudding - TO DIE FOR! Chocolate Croissant - ??? wasn't "SHARED" with me...she ate the whole damm thing! :( Museli?  (Don't know the spelling) - yogurt with wheat - result?  Don't know..I don't eat healthy stuff...only the GOOD stuff! Next time...I'll go by myself and get the chocolate pudding and the cream tarts!..NO SHARING!

I had lunch here with a co-worker. Outstanding open faced sandwiches...I had a shitake mushroom with asparagus and the bread pudding for dessert! The food is fresh and looks like everything is prepared daily. I love the Mission District crowd...

I had a great experience here, meeting a friend after work. The lemon tart was excellent; the crust was nice and crunchy, the lemon curd silky smooth and not too sweet.  My friend had the chocolate cake which was chocolately but not insanely so.  Although my little tart was $6, they did refill my iced tea for free.  Overall, a very positive experience;  I will definitely be going back to try more of their sweet offerings.

I think I'm going to review this little piece of heaven one item at a time. Just so I can hand out more stars. For starters, I'll address the 5 pm bread: five stars, right there. Yes, the $7+ per loaf is worth it, every single penny. Think about it. That's less then two gallons of gas these days...

DELICIOUS. Crowded and expensive, but so, so tasty. Terrible for you, but so worth it. And surprisingly unpretentious in spite of their rep. Though if they're out of what i want for a third time in a row, i might knock 'em down to 4 stars.

Whenever we crave for a good dessert we make our way to Tartine.  We've brought visitors and friends alike.  We even pick up cakes when going to a party.  People love this place, and how could you not.  Although nothing compares to a French croissant, I truly think this place come close. Everything is amazing.  We never order one thing, it's always multiple pastries and you can't forget the bread pudding.  I wish I worked/lived closer because I'd be there all the time.  The atmosphere is always welcoming, great outdoor seating and those beautiful white flowers always peaking out of the front window and freshing up the bathroom.  I love it!

Amazing. First time I came, I had the ham and cheese croissant (as good as everyone says it is; the croissant is so flaky; it's amazing!) and the frampaigne (???) tart. The tart wasn't that great. But today I went back and the Banana Cream Tart was MIND-BLOWING. Seriously. The chocolate on the edge of the crust really kicks it up a notch, plus I think it's Valrhona. Their source their ingredients really well...and the cream was really yummy. Their iced coffee gave me a buzz for 3 hours (and I've gulped down 4 Red Bulls in a night before) and almost made me want to skip dinner. :( Fortunately, I grabbed a Proscuitto Provolone Panini to go. The bread was amazing. Perfect for panini's. Lots of holes but so crunchy... Will definitely be back. They had an awesome-looking Coconut Passionfruit Bavarian that I want to taste next time. Very carb-tastic. Plus, it's right next to that great pizza place, Bi-Rite, and Bi-Rite Creamery. The Mission is so foodie-happening!

Wow, there are A LOT of reviews on this place.  Their frangipane croissants are SO yummy, but  anything else I could live without.  The outside of the croissant is nice and crispy with a mild sweetness.  Just wish it weren't so friggin expensive, when I could get 35934759745 croissants from Costco for the same price; well, ohkay, $3.25 isn't bad, but the traffic and parking almost isn't worth it.  AND they run out in the evenings.

I once asked my friend Brian - who is a professional pastry chef and teacher, who co-wrote a 1,000+ page book on bread/pastries/baking, who is a consultant for one of the big bread manufacturers that you see on your grocery store shelves - "Which is the best bakery in San Francisco?" He then turned my question on its head and asked me, "Best bakery for what?" Oho! Well, "bread," I said, of course. And without skipping a beat he blurted "Tartine! They know what they're doing there. The have the best bread in the region, hands down. They make the other guys seem like amateurs." I've been told by Tartine fans that people will line up around the corner before opening so they can get their hands on some of this heavenly bread stuff, and that it will sometimes sell out within an hour which is why you have to be there early. They've got all kinds of pastries and breads, and the masses typically show up to eat 'em. I've only been in a few times, and each time it has been crowded.  Their desserts are yummy (I have a thing for anything that's named "cookie" or "chocolate"), but as of yet I have not personally tried the bread, which is the thing that people go here for I guess. However, if Brian the master-ninja-baker says it's the best, then it's the best - you better bet your muffins on it...and then, BUY some from Tartine to replace them. Have a happy time visiting Tartine and stuffing your face with deliciousness!

I tried a pan chocolate, it was really good and nice and warm. However, it was a little too buttery, had it been just a little less buttery and more flakey, would have been even more amazing. Wish there was more seating.

Sorry, as much as I really wanted to, I just couldnt get into the food here. I love croque monsieurs, croissants, and bread pudding. So we had all 3 in our visit. The crossant was probably in the oven too long. It had slightly burnt ends and was too flakey. The croque monsieur I found somewhat bland. The bread pudding was ok, but nothing special. Sorry, I was pretty disappointed.

I probably need to go to this place again to give Tartine a fairer review since there's a plethora of choices. The morning bun was OK - (If you like your pasteries dry). However, it was fresh (I know, sounds paradoxical) and the flavor had a nice tinge of orange. To my dismay, I was expecting a stellar, remotely euphoric taste of a $4.00 tea. Also, this place is always packed, so expect long lines and to be standing around for awhile to get a table.

Does this place really need another review? Heck no but I just felt compelled to (sorta) quickly say that ever since eating my first REAL croissant in Paris minutes after it came out of the oven waaaay back in '95, I have been searching and searching and disappointed EVERY time for a  croissant even remotely as buttery, tender inside but lightly crisp on the outside and oh so friggin delish here in the US.  Trust me - I have eaten my fair share of croissants all across this awesome country and NOTHING compares to the real thing.   BUT I had Tartine's version today and I did a double take.  Exactly like the genuine article? Sadly, no.  Pretty damn close that I'll be back for more when I'm jonesing for a quality croissant?  Hells yeah!  It only took 14 years to find the damn thing - mon Dieu!

I was so excited to come here...after hearing so much about this place and reading the rave reviews. I ordered 3 things: croissant, lemon poppyseed cake and fruit galette (sp?). I gave the last 2 items to my mom and sister and had the croissant to myself. But alas...although the croissant was buttery and delicious on the inside, it was BURNT on the outside and although that might have been a fluke, they were selling at least a dozen burnt croissants to unsuspecting newbies like me. It was like eating a barbequed pastry. But I'll try again next time -- just got lucky on the parking this time, so who knows when I can drive 25 miles here again??

so i make a trip up to san francisco with my friends, and my brother recommended this place.  a friend of mine told me to walk past and hit up a pizza joint that was a little further down the street.  so we tried to walk past tartine, but the amazing bakery aroma of the place locked us down, and we just had to go inside (we were starving). apparently the line was short at that moment, because it didn't start from outside (it was about 4pm and we waited about 10-15 min). KIND OF A SMALL PLACE not the best place to go with a bunch of people.  it's hard to find a seat, and there's always a lot of people there.  who the hell goes to a bakery with a large group anyways right? SOMEWHAT PRICEY...  KINDA the menu items seem a little expensive, but the quantity makes up for the price.  i ordered a prosciutto and provolone pressed sandwich that cost $11.75, but i got stuffed because it came with 3 large halves.  some of my friends got ham croques for $9.25 and they couldn't finish them.  by the way, the water is obviously free and it's self-serve.  i must warn you, it definitely has a metallic smell, and a funny taste, so it might be worth it to buy a beverage. THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS the flavor matches the aroma.  i love the fact that they make their own bread.  the origninality makes everything taste that much better.  the sandwiches and croques come with miniature pickled carrots that are quite tasty.  what really sold this place to me was the banana cream tart.  it's not the easiest thing to eat, but the taste is rich yet not too sweet.  it hit the spot right on the money. you can't lose coming here.  it's definitely a trendy little spot in the mission of san francisco, so it's a great place to visit for out of towners.  for all you sf natives, i'm pretty jealous.

Tartine, with your long lines & too-hip-for-the-service staff, why can't I hate you. Truth is, I'll never stop loving your croissant, flaky and rich. Your bread pudding might be the death of me.  It's not my birthday without a chocolate souffle cake.

Tartine is a magical bakery, endowed with powers to massage simple ingredients like flour, milk, and butter into otherworldly light and flaky croissants that would make Sophie Marceau smile. It's every bit worth the weekly pilgrimage here for bread pudding, croque monsieur, and the delightful hot and zesty pickled carrots. When you can't be in France...

I am definitely a fan of Tartine. We stopped by here while waiting to get seated at Defina Pizzeria up the street. My sister raved about the crosiant so I had that in mind, but while standing in lined, I looked over at the bakery window and I knew that I couldn't just get a crosiant. I actually ended up ordering two crosiants, a Almond tart, and a Banana Cream tart. Although I didn't get to eat them until the next day, the Almond tart was delcious. I love almonds, so it was just perfect. Not too strond and not too dull. The Banana Cream tart was awesome too, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish it all since I had to catch my flight. The crosiant was okay, but the next time I go there it won't the crosiant I'll be waiting in line for, it will definitely be the tarts and the bread pudding (base on other reviews). PROS: -Decent price for the quality of food -Service was good -Delicious bake goods CONS: -Very limited seating.

My friend was in town for her birthday (lives a very foodie life in Brooklyn) & with my trepidatious encouragement, was very excited to be able to order a lemon meringue cake for the occasion.  Well, surprise!  Tartine f-ed up the order, and my friend wound up having the counter person be extremely rude to her (like the whole if I talk louder maybe the person  will understand my english.)   I was mortified when I heard this story, can't beeeeeeelieve that behavior on the part of Tartine.  New low even for them.  People often ask me where to get a special cake or dessert (I should start a service) and as much as I love Tartine's goods, and certainly not everyone who works there is that nasty, I will not be recommending them again.

Ordered: Morning bun Latte Cappuccino Shortbread Chocolate chip cookies My husband and I shared one of their famous morning buns. It was delicious, flakey, buttery, sugary and good, but personally, I'm not a fan of the orange flavor. I know that's what a lot of people like, but for me, I prefer the actual fruit rather than something else being infused with its flavor. I had a latte, he, a cappuccino--we both very much enjoyed them. Perfect w/the morning bun. We also got some shortbread and chocolate chip cookies to-go for my son, but I ended up eating them (gave him cupcakes from Kara's instead).   I want to go back to try more of the pastries, especially the croissant with frangipane and one of their savory items. First review from Feb 2010 Unfortunately, they were out of the cinnamon buns by the time we got there, so we opted for the banana bread pudding and almond tart. We were quite disappointed w/the bread pudding, but the tart was delicious. Would definitely go back to try their many other pastries--both sweet and savory.

I went this past weekend with my friends to hit up San Francisco with the goal of doing the Big Eat SF list. And of everything that is on that list (that I've tried), Tartine is the one that I can confidently state most deserves to be on it. When that Levain was handed to me across the counter, and I felt the warm weight of it through the paper bag, little did I know it would be the happiest moment of my entire week. Remember that scene in Ratatouille where the woman chef teaches Linguini how to listen for the perfect baguette? I felt like I put that lesson into service at Tartine. And the verdict was - excellence. I squeezed the loaf lightly and heard a faint crackling sound like the pitter pattering of bread elves on a hardwood floor. Lol. The crust was rustic, but not too hard, and once you rip it open, a most lovely puff of steam hits your face. And then you look down and are greeted by soft, doughy, holey, glutenous carb goodness. I ate half the loaf for my dinner (with Bi-Rite ice cream as the appetizer. Dessert first- you never know what might happen). Best Bread ever. Hands down.

I know this place does not need another review. But I find my waistline expanding and for that, if anything, I'm writing something at least to justify the weight gained. It's a Sunday ritual for me, and is also one of the stops on my list as a tour guide when friends are visiting from out of town. Beware of the line, it can be long but it's well worth the wait. The place also gets hot. I prefer to scope out a seat outside (next door to Delfina) or the bench facing Guerrero. Get a glass of champagne and a pastry (you'll want all of them) but my favorite are the tres leches cake, the coconut cream tart and the bread pudding (get the bowl for $6 and share with a friend). You won't be disappointed.

Tartine Bakery, WHY DO YOU RUN OUT OF DERICIOUS BAKED GOODS?!? Well, I guess I can't really blame you, but it still makes me sad that I didn't  get to eat them. I was hoping to get a Chocolate Crossiant  but they were sold out. My friend and I shared a Frangipane Tart, which had almond filling and season fruit filling. It was delicious and flaky! Next time, I will go earlier and get a Chocolate Crossiant and a Morning Bun...and maybe everything else on the menu.

I'm totally gonna get knocked for this review, but I thought this place was just OKAY.  I got the Banana cream tart and the lemon tart and they were both good, but not enough to keep me coming back.  With the banana cream tart I liked everything BUT the crust.  I don't like mine so flaky and dry that it crumbles.  The crust is one of the most important parts in a pie/tart for me and this one didn't strike the right chord.  If its any consolation to everyone else wanting to try this place...you should still try it, because everyone I got the tarts for liked it except for me

the wait is pretty atrocious and they do sell out of items quickly (damn you! i wanted to try the banana cream tart and morning buns), however, the offerings we had were pretty good. - ham and cheese croissant: delicious!  their croissants rock! - gougere: heaven on earth - croque monsieur: good, would have been awesome if freshly out of the oven - frangipane tart: the least favorite of mine.  kinda bland imo.

Although I didn't get to try much from the menu, I'm glad it gives me a reason to come back! First of all, I arrived at this place around 1pm on a Friday and there was a line out the door.  My friend highly recommended this place, so we decided to wait and normally I wouldn't.  As we were waiting in line, I noticed a sign that said they sold out of bread, so I assumed that is definitely something to try here.  Anyways, after waiting for about 45 mins, we made it to the front and I decided to get their chocolate pudding.  The only pudding I had before is from the grocery store so this was definitely a treat.  The pudding was very delicious and I definitely recommend for anyone looking for a light treat (although it does get filling).  I only give this place four stars because I didn't get to try anything else but next time i'm in SF i'll check out more items and hopefully come back with a five star update.  Anyways, only tip is that I think they only accept cash, so come prepared.

Tartine deserves five stars because it's an SF institution. The breads an the pastries are simply divine! It gets really crowded and busy which is the only less than perfect thing, but that's what happens when the product is this good.

Tartine Bakery is very cute spot with mouth-watering pastries and treats.  I honestly had the best cafe au lait here of my life.  I would recommend the gougeres and the croque monsieurs which are just delicious.  The only downside of the Tartine Bakery is the line... Be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes at peak hours to order your food.  I would highly recommend this spot though anytime!

Yummy yum yum. Was brought here while visiting SF, by a pastry chef. That's how good this place is. Pastry chef's take their friends here. Had the croque with asparagus and turkey. Pre ordered several of the sourdough loaves to take home (almost caused our bags to be overweight.) I gave five stars, even though the lines were long and I HATE having to send someone to "save" a table and chairs. But what else are they supposed to do? It's a bakery, not a restaurant. I'm glad for them that they have lines out the door. I wish that much success for us all.

Don't let the long line fool you: this place sucks. I came in here a week ago, on a Saturday afternoon, and should've brought a book with me, because the wait was over 30 minutes (I wish I could see the look on a person's face when he gets closer to the door and realizes that the line continues, all the way to the registers in the front). But the question is: what is everyone waiting for? Expensive pastries that taste mediocre at best? Or the "holier than thou" attitude from the staff? I'll admit, I had a bit of sticker shock when I first saw how much stuff cost, so I just got a chocolate croissant. It was bland and dry, it resembled a meager-filled cookie. The cashier girl was condescending and rude (how do you say "chocolate croissant in French? Anyone..?) and it was a relief to walk out of there. Plus, if you're in line for the bathroom, be on the lookout for waitresses who will mow you down with trays of pastries and cookies, even though, really, there is no place to wait or form a line. Good job, Tartine. Bravo.

I'd heard about tartine bakery being famous, and even saw it on a show on tv about best bakeries in the US. They were featuring the tres leches cake. One weekend, T and I decided to stop in, based on its famousness. There was a line out the building and around on the sidewalk, it was a holiday Monday late afternoon or early evening. This better be worth it, I thought, as we waited. Fortunately, it went pretty fast. We decided to get one piece of the tres leches cake, one piece of a coconut fruit cake, and one piece of their lemon caramel cake. Price was fairly good. We got them home and tried them. Eh. The best was the lemon. The lemon was still only eh. They really tasted like not much of anything. Just a sweetness. I took a couple of bites of the desserts and thought wait, this isn't even worth the space in my belly...I want more little star pizza instead (what we'd been walking to pick up when we passed tartine). Between we two big eaters, we never ate those cake slices. They ended up getting thrown away. It wasn't bad, just not good enough to bother eating. With such a rep, guess we're in the minority!! PS this is not really a place you'd want to sit down and eat in at, there are tables but they're only so-so and it's very loud and full of people lining up to order. Chaotic. Just bring your stuff home and eat it there instead.

The shortbread cookie is butterbutterbuttery, and so great. I get once in a while on my lunch break because it's a block away from my work. It's only a dollar twenty five, and it is just the right size. I eat it crumb by crumb and boy it is delectable. If you eat it slowly it is like cookie butter. I tried this place a few years ago and thought it was only pretty good. The latte I had was good because it was large, but I think comparable to other coffee establishments. I had some tart cream pie or something and it was fluffy and creamy, but not my cup of tea. The inside of the place is always so crowded with people, and the line is ridiculous on weekends and even sometimes at lunch. On hot days in the mission it is excruciating to be inside the room. Also, the outdoor seating is nice, but whenever I wait for the 33 I find it uncomfortable when the patrons just kind of stare at you while sipping their coffee and eating their tarts.

This review is for the plain croissant. Just got back from Paris and am in search of THE croissant in SF. Got one still warm from the oven this morning. It was 5 star good. Perfectly flakey outside, moist and chewy inside, and NOT greasy feeling! My only reason for deducting one star is the $3.75 price tag, high even by  SF foodie standards! Missing my 1 euro corner bakery croissant....

I met a friend here, and we took our sandwiches to Dolores to eat.  I (vegetarian) had a Humboldt Fog sandwich, which was probably one of the more decadent grilled-cheese offerings I've ever eaten.  I don't usually leave food on the table, but I had to pack half my sandwich to go. The bread is pretty amazing.  Acme over in Berkeley taught me to love walnut bread, and Tartine does it really well.  The cheese was great too.  It's from a cute little dairy called Cypress Grove - one of my favorites.   My sandwich came with some apple slices, which went well with the theme: goat cheese, walnuts, and apples.  My friends, however, came with pickled carrots, which were much more exciting.   I'll be back whenever I can, as long as someone else is paying.  They may even get me to pry my wallet open for one of those delectable desserts...

There is a constant flow of foot traffic no matter what time of day you come in.  Seating is hard so I usually get mine to go.  Loved the bread pudding  3.50 / 6 with my mocha.  On another visit I tried the croque monsieur  9.75 - Open face sandwich with béchamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper. Topped with either smoked Niman Ranch ham or seasonal vegetable.  Then there was the delicious Frangipane Tart 4" - 6.25 9" - 38, serves 8Light almond-cream filling baked in a flaky pastry shell with seasonal fruit.  Sooo much I still need to try.

Went back there three more times for desserts to go, so just wanted to update my review. Finally got their loaf of country bread. I think it was $7 and it was a heavy piece of thing! It was warm and the crust was really crunchy and the inside was chewy goodness! However the crust was a bit on the hard side. I could see myself chipping a tooth if I wasn't careful. But it was so good, that wouldn't stop me. The mexican cookie was eh. I also had the almond rocher and the cocoa nib rocher. It has this light texture that's chewy at the same time. Really good and a great deal at 85 cents a pop. All the times except the first time, I was in search of the morning bun...and they ran out each time :(   Oh if you are at Tartine's, drop by next door to Pizza Delfina. Dee-lish!

Heard so many great things about Tartine, it's the first place I went to straight from the airport!  There's no name on the store front, but it's right on the corner and you can't miss it with the line out the door.  Pricey, but worth it!  Bought & devoured a Croque Monsieur, however, I chose the one without meat, instead it came with shitake mushrooms, bechamel and asparagus! Mm mm!  Fresh & hot out of the oven.  Then I purchased a couple pastries to go,  the Frangipane (Almond) Croissant was flaky and delicious, with a nice almond paste on the inside.... however, the Almond Croissant at Thorough Bread & Pastry 7 blocks away is even more divine!   Gougere (Cheese bread balls) were alright, nothing to rave about.  Morning sticky buns were good but a little too caramely & sweet for my taste,  especially for breakfast.  Definitely recommend their chocolate croissant - just the right amount of chocolate - delectable goodness surrounded by flaky, buttery perfection!

The croissant here is the best I have ever had outside of France...maybe even better--something to truly crave. Everything here is amazing..the only downside is that it is small so getting a table can be a bit of a hassle...and on the weekends if you show up in the latter part of the morning the line is intimidating.  So go early. The bread (which I've had at Delfina) is something to be tried at least once...I'm trying to recreate it using their cookbook but no luck so far.

Absolutely fantastic croque monsieur, breads, cream pies, and morning buns. The recent addition of organic Belgian beers makes this a nice afternoon stop, too. It's no wonder this place is so ridiculously busy. The staff are efficient at moving the huge lines through the small storefront. People who are complaining that staff are "rude" may want to go to a lesser bakery where they have time to gently pamper your ass because there's no other customers. There will be plenty of us taking your spot in line for the world's best banana cream pie.

We practically ran here when someone told us it closed at 5 p.m. (she was a few hours off), and the line was a mere half dozen out the door. We just waited and enjoyed the conversation outside. The lemon tart was incredible (beats the banana cream pie and coconut cream pie, in my book). The chocolate pudding was decadent. The quiche was like whipped cream, though it would have been better eaten there instead of the next morning. Could have skipped the macaroon. Yeah, we ordered way too much. We couldn't help it.

We ordered 1) the ham quiche and 2) the bread pudding and 3) two cappucinos.  The quiche was super light and fluffy and perhaps the best I've ever had.  The bread pudding was like no bread pudding I've seen -- it had a plum compote on top!  I was so intrigued, I had to have some.  It was AMAZING.  I will never be able to have regular bread pudding again! Some logistics:  like most bakeries, you must line up to order your food (though if your choice requires heating, they will give you a number and deliver it to your table), however, the seating is very limited and you must be vulture-like to nab a table for 4.   Definitely worth the wait and difficulty of finding a table.  Can't wait to go back. 2/6/2008 Update: This is my favorite breakfast destination in San Francisco.  I go at least twice a month -- and I don't live in San Francisco!!  I still regularly get the light fluffy quiche and the moist delicious bread putting with seasonal fruits, but I have also discovered the Croque Monsieur and the pressed sandwiches. When I finally made it to Tartine for lunch I realized how much I had been missing --the lunch menu was ripe with opportunity!  Two new favorites -- the Croque Monsieur and the Pecorino and Almond Pressed Sandwich.  The Croque Monsieur is an open faced sandwich of crusty country bread, gruyere, and other toppings.  I generally get the Niman Ranch ham version.  The Pecorino and Almond Pressed Sandwich is unlike anything I have ever experienced -- closed faced pressed sandwich of pure deliciousness.  The pecorino gives great flavor and the almond offer an amazing texture. Gah, want to go to Tartine NOW.

One of my favorite bakeries of all time.  I did a stage back in the kitchen one day bc this place inspired me to consider a career change into the culinary world.   I love that they take the fundamentals of European pastry and give its own uniquely Californian character.   My favorites are the croque monsieur with the pickled carrots, the coffee & capuccino (Mr. Espresso), gougeres, morning buns (made from croissant dough!), and the banana creme pie (flaky crust lined with dark chocolate) -- and I don't usually like desserts!  The latter is not overly sweet like a lot of American desserts and has fresh bananas sliced in.  They also make a great passionfruit cake.  I must try to recreate the desserts with the new cookbook they came out with since I am now out on the east cost :(   The line out the door is worth the wait.  For those of you who don't like communal eating and like a lot of space, you won't like it here, but if you're into people watching and the serendipitous conversation with a local, this is the place.  I keep running into old college friends here randomly, too.   I don't know if they still do this, but I went with some friends one weekday after work and enjoyed a nice light dinner listening to some live jazz.  A great place to go on a Sunday morning, too.

This place is very simple, but they have the best Bread Pudding.  I love that Tartine Bakery gives you a lot of flan.  It's pretty crowded, but the line goes by quick.  Everything is self service from you getting your own water and utensils and boxing your own to go box (already provided for you on the counter).  Presentation is very simple, just the cake itself, but the dessert is very good.

The best croissant ever? in San Francisco??!!?? That's what I heard from the reviews in mags & etc. But let's see my personal review... When I came there like around 11am, the line was there, & I was so hungry havent got any breakfast yet, so once it was my turn to order... I ordered the croissant of course & banana nut bread w/ the blueberry muffin (whoa i was really hungry!)+ i don't want to be in line anymore, so i grabbed all those 3 to-go! when i tasted the croissant, it was definitely buttery, well to be honest it wasn't like I expected.  I guess I expected the best?? Well, it's not the best, it is rather ok,, i tried the banana nut bread it was sweet and crummy. It was not bad, i tried the banana nut bread in starbucks too they're really good & taste a lil' better than tartine. the muffin, it was just taste like another regular muffin; but i ate all that and i was really full!! So, the overall experience is I don't think it is the best bakery in the city, & to me i won't be going on a line just for an ok bakery like this. i could find other croissant way better somewhere else. I really still dont get it why people like tartine that much. well, everybody have opinion, but that's what i think. They do have a lot of varieties, however I just say this place is just an ok place. So best croissant in SF?? Not to me...:D

Their croissants and pan de chocolat can rival some in Paris.  You see, in Richmond, VA we are not blessed with good bakeries.  It is very very difficult to find a good croissant let alone a pan de chocolat.  Not only is the ganache large, the people working there are extremely friendly and offered up suggestions for my trip back east.

My roommate enticed me here on a drizzly day, hoping it would cheer us up. It did. I went there expecting to pay a lot of money, so I wasn't surprised at the prices of the place. My advice: eat a small but nutritious breakfast before you go to Tartine, or else you'll spend way too much money. I really like that the tables are less-than-private, European style. "Ist hier noch frei?", I wanted to ask.

If it weren't for the croissants I probably wouldn't come here. Parking in the area sucks and there's always a line inside. But the croissant...oh the croissant. They freakin' delicious. I'd argue them to be the best in the city. They're on the larger side, but are perfectly baked; crispy and flakey on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. mmmm.

So I love Tartine's:  because you can just get a coffee at the coffee bar. What else I love about Tartine's is proximity you can go there grab a perfect latte, and walk across the street to Craig's place for breakfast.  Do not order coffee at Craig's place.  It is semi transparent with a mysterious burnt flavor.  I feel like they boil it in a huge stock pot.  I can't prove it but that's the sense I get.

Not sure what all the fuss is about... this place is OK.  I don't think it's worth standing in line...nevertheless, the other day I stood in line on a very hot day (it was super hot inside too) and spent $20 on a few pastries.  When we got home we were disheartened to find that they gave us a half black/burnt morning bun.  Not the greatest quality.  I sent a note to the bakery but never heard from them.

I love the ambiance. I love love love the freshly baked bread (it reminds me of the fresh bread in Paris!) However, I don't love how weird their bread-baking schedule is. They don't bake bread on Monday or before 5 pm so when I took the 30 minute Muni ride to Tartine on a Monday and was told there was no bread that day I was definitely let down. Oh well, live and learn!

It goes without saying that the food at tartine is awesome. I also think that the service was great, but then again, I tip. I was appalled that so many other people didn't/don't. I read the other reviews that said bad service, attitude, etc. Well, did you fucking tip them? If not, then shut the fuck up. They help thousands of people everyday, most of them rich snobby fuckers like you who don't feel the need to tip. I had a conversation with a friend the other night who said that if people KNEW how much of a HUGE DIFFERENCE it makes when you TIP, then they totally would. I personally don't have that much faith in humanity, but here it is jerks, TIPPING MAKES A HUUUUUGGGGE DIFFERENCE. Try it sometime, and watch the attitude improve. Hell, what's an extra dollar?

Nice boulangerie in Mission.  It's a tad overpriced: $28 for 6" chocolate cake!  I had a turkey croque and chocolate pudding and it cost me near $15.  But it's certainly worth indulging in every once in a while.  The croques are great, chocolate pudding is delectable, and the bread pudding changes daily based on available fruits.  It'd easily be 5 stars if it weren't so crazy expensive. My only complaint is they should have some healthy salads on their menu in addition to all those delicious cheese and bechamel slathered croques and sandwiches!

Woohoo doesn't even begin how I feel about Tartine. This is a place I would come to visit even if I didn't live in the bubble that is SF. It is wonderful, divine, heavenly - and I'm not a religious fellow. Let me give you a specific. #1 - Bread pudding! #2 Banana Creme Tartlet #3 Those fantastic ooozy cheesy sandwiches. And if that isn't enough - the last time I went there a truly inspirational thing happened. Listen close - First we ordered. 2 sandwiches and some coffees blah blah. Went outside to sit at a table and wait for the food. A super charming brunette (who we see there very often - and I should be more outgoing and ask her name) comes up to us and tells us that one of the sandwiches was made wrong, so we will have to wait a short bit. She gives us the wrong sandwich for free and gives us a refund. And then delivers the correct sandwich about 10 minutes later. A refund and the sandwich. What? With a beautiful smile and a sincere apology for the wait. This entire experience I have just re-canted......has NEVER happened to me in SF. No one has ever had that amount of genuine care during an ordering/dining experience for me. I was so blown away I was speechless. I just keep mumbling thank you thank you thank you. I will always be a loyal customer of Tartine just for that one experience. My faith in the service community was restored - just from spending the 20 minutes or so in the company of this fantastic employee at Tartine. I work in the service industry as well (I guess don't we all) and I was truly impressed. Oh and guess what - the food was of course AMAZING. Like always. Thank you over and over Tartine.

Tartine's pastries are certainly decadent and nice to look at, but meh, I'm still not sure it's worth all the hype. I've been here a couple times and sampled the pain au chocolate, cinnamon roll, brownie and some sort of frosted chocolate cookie thing. All were pretty tasty but way more rich and heavy than they needed to be. Is it possible to leave this place without a stomachache? Anyway, they lose at least one star for the unpleasant woman working the counter.

I made love to a morning bun and a few bites of the Croque Monsieur yesterday. I was able to get to find seating at one of their rustic, farmhouse-like tables, drink their delicious coffee, which is as many free refills as you want, and chat with friends and people-watch. It doesn't even bother me that the place is tiny and crammed and that you have to wait in line at least half an hour.

I wish I lived next door to Tartine!  The fruit tarts are my favorite!

Tartine makes good pastries, burnt.  You can tell they made the pastries well (croissants, quiche, etc.) but they overbake almost everything, so that it's overly dark and subsequently over-crunchy and dried out, or just completely burnt (and still serves it!).  I went twice to give them a second chance, but on the second trip I got several things and they were all overbaked (tart, quiche, bread pudding, eclair).  You can even see in some of the pictures already posted that the pastries are too dark, with some black regions (most obvious on the croissants).  I just think that is a poor pratice for a bakery/establishment.  Won't be coming back.

Eat at the Tartine Bakery based on the number of reviews on yelp.  I was not disappointed: fabulous food!  The aroma of the baked goods signals to one's palate: they take food preparation very serious here.   I had the Sopressata, Fontina, Brocolli Rabe Pesto hot pressed sandwich: delicious.  Two things in keep in mind: the dinning area is very small so you may have to request to share a table with someone else and the sandwichs don't come with sides.  In fact, i think they dont sell sides.

I'll make this short so I don't start salivating and short out my computer ... I LOVE the toasted sandwiches.  I start drooling just thinking about the turkey/broccoli pesto.  The only reason I don't get it more often is it takes forever to make it (if I order it and my party gets something else, they're usually done before my sandwich arrives).  The passionfruit Bavarian lime cake is amazing (especially when served just a little cold).  The bread pudding isn't too shabby either.  The only other downsides I'd mention are the wait (first you wait in line, then you wait for an open table, then you wait for your sandwich) and the prices are quite high.  I go as a special little lunch treat ...

Let me start by saying that I think their pastries are exceptional and truly the best in town.  I don't care that the lines are long or that the staff is comprised of hipsters. However, I'm fed up with the staff's vitriol towards the customers.  Half of the time the service isn't so bad, but there are times when you can't believe how horrible they can be to you. I think most people go there in a good mood but leave the shop wondering what happened!

veryy goood brunch food or dessert treats! - always a line waiting out the door, and rarely that easy to find seats after ordering, but worth it or I highly suggest buying treats and taking it to Dolores Park and having a picnic (permitted that the weather is nice) I've gone twice and have tried the following: - Banana Cream Tart (I dream of this...very sweet but so yummy to eat in bits and pieces, best part being the tart that is shelled in dark choco...makes the tart that much yummier) - Morning Bun (on the 7x7 list again, had a orange hue, very cruncy and yummy) - coffee (Delicious, a little intense, definitely feeling it after 1-2 sips but so good to accompany the sweets) - ham quiche (delicious, pretty dense for a quiche) - mushroom croque monsieur (veryyy goooddd and a nice brunch meal when starving, very large in portion) OVerall everything is absolutely tasty, only bad parts are: - price, very pricey for what it is, but i guess worth it - space is always crowded and crazy - always a long line ...but i guess thats what you have to pay for if you want such tasty delicious foods

I feel blasphemous saying that I didn't like something from Tartine. But I didn't. Typically I love anything with bananas in the mix so I was excited to try the banana bread pudding. While the bananas had a nice brulee on them, the texture of the bread pudding didn't work for me. I like a bread pudding where I can tell there was once brioche. This was almost like waterlogged mushiness. Should have gone the banana cream tart.

just like the 1,700+ other people, i'm a fan! we had the chocolate croissant (pain au chocolat?) - the pastry was crispy on the outside and soft on the side, with just enough chocolate. also had the bread pudding which was also really good, it was warm and not too sweet.  and lastly, we got the croque monsieur (open faced sandwich)... they ran out of the shiitake mushroom, so we got the spicy turkey.  wasn't too spicy, and the bread was really soft. we got there at 10:30am, on a tuesday, and the line was out the door.  the line was still out the door when we left 1.5 hrs later.  cozy little place.

"I'd like a pain ow jam bone." "One pan aw jamb on." "Jaum baun, please." Me? I just point. But it's okay, because (1) the folks behind the counter have heard it all before and know what you want and (2) regardless of how you pronounce it, it's still friggin' delicious. They're even better fresh out of the oven; the 15 minute wait is totally worth it.  The plain croissants are a bit more hit or miss; I feel sometimes they come out a little too burnt. Actually, that's probably the case for all of their croissant-based items. I don't have much of a sweet tooth - except for ice cream - so it may be just me, but except for some of the tarts and the apple turnover (which isn't always available) all of the sweets are a bit too sweet for me. I would probably love the frangipane a lot more if they could turn it down a bit. I'd like to try items from the cafe if I ever get the time (too hard to eat a quiche on the run); for now, the rating is based solely on the baked goods that you can eat with one hand.

I had to come here after I read all the positive reviews for this place. I am a huge pastry fan, so naturally I needed to check out the hype. There was a line already formed but it moved quickly and the cashiers were very attendant. I ordered the ever popular morning bun, a lemon tart, eclair, and banana cream tart. Everything was absolutely delicious and well worth whatever wait there may be. It was so hard choosing what to get, as absolutely everything looked amazing. I was happy with my choices though. My favorites were the morning bun and lemon tart. The flavors were gorgeous and everything tasted fresh. I would definitely come back here to try other things!

We had to wait 20 min for them to finish another batch of pan au chocolat and had a croque monsieur while waiting which was really tasty, along with some tasty bread pudding. The fresh pan au chocolat was also good. Cant wait to come back and try a slice of cake, morning bun and that banana cream tart everyone keeps talkin bout since my friend tried to order the tart and they didnt have it for some reason that day.

This place is pretty amazing. I first head about it from the cookbook that the owner has. When I was there, I got a ham gruyere panini sandwich which was cut in half, but could have easily fed two. My friend also got a banana cream tartlet. It was yummerz, and had an unexpected shell of chocolate on the bottom which was a pleasant surprise, but made it a smidge difficult to eat. You would most definitely need a metal fork as we compromised the structural integrity of the cornstarch fork. I also got a berry creme cake which was rather typical. The bread pudding was yummerz and included apricots which I normally do not have in bread pudding. The raspberry tartlet was also delish and was very pretty!!! Overall, it is a pricier place that takes only cash, has a longer line, but totally worth it. This is SF so street parking only, if you're lucky!!

My love for Tartine began with their lemon meringue cake, simply divine. Then, we had to experiment further, devils food cake with that sneaky little layer of carmel, outrageous!

Okay... okay... I admit it. I went to Tartine like a lame tourist because I saw it on The Food Network's show, The Best Thing I Ever Ate. Well, after trying the double pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant) and the raspberry and peach bread pudding, I absolutely agree. Tartine has some of the best desserts I've ever ate. The double pain au chocolat was baked to perfection. It had perfect flaky crust that wasn't drenched in butter and was perfectly warmed without having the chocolate ooze out the side... but still melted in your mouth. This is one of those places you just need to visit. Why? Cuz I said so and The Food Network did, too.

Really great place to grab some food. Though I may be more inclined to order out however not living close to this place I'm either eating there or in Dolores Park. Be ready to stand in a line and though the line moves quick if your planning to sit, plan on asking people if they mind sharing a table. You will also have to wait 10-15 min for anything ordered from the kitchen  Because it isn't convenient to eat here it gets 4 stars but the food is arguably 5 stars. I do plan on eating here again and defiantly trying the sweets they offer but the sandwiches are delicious! Recommended!

My wife says this is the BEST bakery she has ever been to, and I would totally agree.  We ordered gougere, small bread pudding, and a croissant and our only regret was not ordering larger bread pudding.  It's sweet but it goes well with coffee, hot chocolate or croissant.  I also wanted to try croque monsieur, but we were already too full.  Saved it for next time -- we're definitely going back!

I saw this place on food network , the best thing I ever ate dessert edition and the man was raving about the chocolate croissant. I planned a day in the city and set tartine on my to do list, specifically to try the chocolate croissant. The line was out the door, but twenty minutes later we were in front of the display case. Everything looked scrumptious. I chose the croissant and I must say I was disappointed that it lacked the main Ingredient, chocolate. Minus three lack of parking, unfriendly male cashier with long blonde hair and disappointing croissant

You would think my very first review on Yelp would be for somewhere in the city I live in (NY).  I guess that's how impressed I was with Tartine.   A friend and I were visiting the area for the weekend, and came here on the recommendation of another friend and a pedi-cab driver in SF from Brooklyn, for a quick bite before heading up to Napa for the day.  It's true, the line was out the door, but the smells coming from inside were amazing.  After much debate, I got a chocolate croissant, almond croissant, and the coconut cream tart (not really breakfast food, but I love coconut).  Although good, nothing too impressive about the almond croissant.  But the chocolate croissant, WOW!  Buttery and flaky on the outside, creamy on the inside.  Most chocolate croissants have solid chocolate on the inside, but not these.  I had heard this place was featured on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate," but forgot to check what it was that was eaten.  I was happy it was the chocolate croissant, as I had ordered it without knowing, and I would definitely say it's the best chocolate croissant I've ever had.  The tart was good, but I decided to eat it the next day. I'm sure it would've been much better eaten day of.  I wish I would've seen the reviews about the morning bun.  I would've bought that too! I also ordered a latte to go.  Although it took a few extra minutes, the barista took the time to make my drink.  A good, but different experience than your quick chain places. Parking is also difficult here as its in a residential neighborhood.

I love bakeries and like everyone else says, this place is awesome. Supposed to have some of the best bread in the nation, too (call ahead to order). If you like bakeries, you must try tartine Everything's delicious. Staff was very friendly for me. Be prepared to wait since there always seems to be a line. I went on a random Tues morning and had to wait 25 min in line.

I still stand by my opinion that their food is outstanding but I'm a little disappointed that Tartine has raised its prices. I LOVE the treats but the price point is just getting too high. $3.75 for a morning bun is a bit much. It's really good but it's still just a bun, not a meal. Here's one less person in line as often. Tartine is now a sometimes treat.

Braved a blustery SF morning to stand in line AND had to eat at an outside table, but it was worth it. I had a slice of quiche laden with mushrooms, gruyere and the surprise element of beets! Savory, buttery, flaky perfection. For dessert I had both a Valrhona chocolate eclair and their famous banana cream tart...heaven on a plate! Can't wait to come back  to try their sandwiches and breads.

Went there with my girlfriend this past saturday. Saw this place featured on an episode of "Best Thing I Ever Ate" on the Food Network. We got there around 1pm and there was already a line out the door. We both wanted to order the Double Pain au Chocolat, but there was only one left. We had to share the last one along with one with ham. Both were a lil pricey ($4 each), but were friggen awesome! There was also a ton of things i would like to try next time like the Tres Leches, Eclairs, any of the pressed sanwiches... etc etc.

I finally got a chance to check this place out.  Overview: The sandwiches were delicious.  The pastries- to me were a mix (ie: lemon tart- wonderful.  Pecan tart - a bit bland and not rich enough for me).  The ambiance was surprisingly very plain and was bustling the entire time in the middle of the weekday.  Price- a little pricey, but worth the money.  Service- normal. Overall-   I would try it again.

I checked out Tartine Bakery while I was on a Nor Cal trip with friends who also love food. They ran out of Banana Cream Tart... :( We ordered Hazelnut Chocolate Tart... It was pretty good but not amazingly, heavenly good. San Francisco may have their Famous Tartine Bakery. But Los Angeles has Porto's Bakery...  and after trying many many bakeries, nothing beats PORTO'S BAKERY!

tartine takes the morning bun to a whole new level of goodness.  i usually pick one up on my way to work at least every other week.  the coffee is awesome too, but i wish they had larger to-go cups.  also, the employees are very nice and laid-back, they don't seem to annoyed with their jobs. not too crazy about their sandwiches... i had a croque monsieur once and it was over cooked... to the point where was no trace of goo left in the cheese. if you have issues about your personal space, avoid this place like the plague on the weekends.   ps: if you decide to dine-in, please be considerate and spend the appropriate amount of time at your table.

Not much I can say that will be any different from the hundreds of other reviewers, so I'll just keep this one short.  I was super lucky and was only waited in line for 5 minutes before getting my delicious morning buns and gougere.   Loved what I got, but a considerably longer line would've cut down on my rating.

I love this place!!! I wish I still lived in San Francisco so I could come here all the time! The line is always out the door but it's worth the wait. They have so many delectable bites! I always get the banana cream pie/tart (and I'm not even a banana person). It's not too overloaded with banana and there's even a layer of chocolate! I haven't tried their sandwiches or other breakfast items, but from what I could see while waiting in line---all the food looked divine!! Can't wait to come back here again!!!

Cute bakery on the corner that serves AMAZING pastries that are worth standing in line for however the snub that I got from one of their baristas threw me off.  Ordered their ham&cheese croissant, banana tart, and chocolate croissant that lived up to the hype that previous reviewers have posted.  Their croissants are flaky but the good type of flaky and every bite gets better but makes me sad that its one bite more till its all gone.  It was my first time there so ordering was pretty intimidating because everyone knew what they want and you were expected to know what you want because they need to keep the line moving.  I wanted a drink to go with my pastries so I head over to the bar and I'm waiting while the barista is having a convo with her coworkers.  I just voiced out that I wanted to order a chai latte and she looked at me and said "what do you mean? you ordered one or you want me to make you one, I don't get it."  I don't understand how you could misinterpret my request to place an order?  So I said I haven't ordered anything yet and would want a chai latte, and she got frustrated with me and mentioned something about it being hard because she doesn't know who ordered and who didn't.  I was not having it so I just told her nevermind and just walked away.  Lucky for them that their pastries are freaking so that their customer service can suck but still survive and bank on their good food.

The place seemed really hectic/chaotic, but my cousin and I put up with the line to try their bread pudding and they packed it in our box, alright. It was a bit too soggy for my liking, but after I ate a few more bites, I enjoyed it and the fruits were a good addition. Hopefully next time, I'll get to try their other popular items.

The best just takes 20 minutes to get a sandwich although they have amazing food including fresh chocolate croissants and croque monsieur and delicious range of coffees to choose from. My place of choice whenever I am in the area and the locals. It is always packed and hard to find seating and I can see why. There is a magical ambience to this place like a little french swag to it that I love. :)

Great pastries, but totally not worth the wait. First, you have to hope that someone will get up. Second, you're lucky if you can sit in privacy. Third...it's just a hot mess filled with yummy pastries. Seriously.   There's a lot of hype about this place and I can see why: Mission District with "cool people". I'm not cool and I don't live in the Mission, so it's really an inconvenience to go to a place like this.

Tartine........such a sweet, delicious name (It means a french open-faced sandwich) for a bakery/cafe that is so delicious, I could eat the walls. Its enticing aroma is evident at least half way down the block and across the street. I actually feel sorry for the people that live on its block--if I did, I would weigh probably over 200 lbs! EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING is so finger licking delicious, you can't go wrong ordering anything on its large hard-to-decide-what-to eat menu. For me, it is easy..The Bread pudding!!! I CRAVE the bread pudding( so yummy--they use brioche bread)..... and I love the seasonal fruit topping, which is always such a nice surprise to see which fruit is selected when I order mine. My favorite is the peach/blueberry topping, then the strawberry. Everyone that works there is amazing and wonderful. I love Trevor, Aaron, Josh, Kerry and Nathan. They are the BEST! So, if you live in SF and have never experienced a journey to Tartine at least once..SHAME ON YOU!!! I own BOTH their amazing books ( CHAD, you blow me away with your bread. PERIOD!!) their really cool Tartine cloth cross-body bag, that I wear everyday! CHAD, please excuse me when I say ( and I hope I have your permission) I WANT TO MARRY TARTINE! ( and I promise I will be faithful and never complain of a headache :-)

Their banana-cream pie can mend a broken heart. The eclair is comparable to cuddling a small puppy, and sometimes better. I've never tasted something that instantly turned me on, until I met their Lemon bar. From the cakes to the bread- it's all good. Clear your schedule though- you're bound to be waiting in line for awhile. Bring someone to flirt with and the line will move nicely.

Everything baked here is very high quality Everything here is also pricey and heavy, like "this croissant contains several sticks of butter and now that I have eaten it I can feel it oozing out my pores" heavy.  It's also often very busy and crowded, although I suspect some of that will abate once their Valencia St. bread shop opens. Overall great for picking up a special treat to take away, but not a great place to just hang out with a cup of tea.  Try the breads and cakes- I think they are usually better than the cookies.

De-friggin-lectable! Terrific savory pastries - the sweet ones are even better. The sandwiches are good, but who needs "real food" when you can gorge on pain au chocolat, banana cream / coconut cream pie, that evil chocolate crack - I mean cake - with chocolate ganache and caramel, lemon meringue cake, dense chocolate brownies, Scharffen Berger chocolate pudding.... One of the reasons why I've cancelled my Atkins plans 20 times (every time I wanted to start, I find myself staring at that chocolate cake!) In the spirit of full disclosure, the seating situation is dire (please open another spot), plus now that the hordes of yupsters (yuppie-hipsters) have descended on that place.... Oh, the service can also be uneven - some of the girls are sweeter than the desserts, some others make it painfully obvious that they are way too good to be serving you ;).

Definitely one of my Top 3 favorite bakeries in the city.  I always get a ham and cheese croissant (croissant au jambon et fromage), and a latte.  It's just around $5 and it's the best start to my day I could ask for.  The ovens are pretty hot here, so every now and then you'll get a croissant or other baked good that has a great brown crust but is a little doughy in the middle, but overall the product is pretty superior here.  Your best bet is to come during the weekdays or late afternoons.  However, if you come too late they might not have as big of a selection.

Pastries and breakfast goods are worth a try.  Sandwiches are on the greasy side.   Personal favorites: banana cream pie and chocolate croissant.   I only gave it three stars because of the ridiculous long wait.  The line was wrapping around the block by 9am on a Sunday morning.  There was no service either.

Spectacular pastries!  Like Cambridge's High Rise Bakery, almost everything here is wonderful.  Standouts are the orange-spiked morning buns, chocolate & caramel-lined banana cream tarts and bread pudding fresh from the oven.  Put some of the shortbreads in the freezer to give them a denser feel -- they're the perfect balance of sugar, salt and butter.  The only letdown has been the eclair.  The thick slab of Valhrona chocolate overpowers the suble vanilla in the pastry cream.

Wifey's Review: While on my way to try Pizzeria Delfina with my husband, I noticed a corner store with a line out the door that passed the second bench.  I had no clue what people were waiting in line for.  When we were done eating at Pizzeria Delfina, the lines were even longer!  I did not see any sign until my husband said, "It's Tartine."  Still I did not recognize the name until I went on Yelp and found out. Since that day, I have been to Tartine 4 times, and each time I go I always order 2 different pastries.  My husband DOES NOT like sweets, so there is MORE for me.  Anyway, of all the times I have been there, the lines were not bad at all, the employees were always pleasant, and the pastries are very, very good.  I recommend the morning buns which have very yummy, gooey, and distinctive flavors of orange cinnamon glaze.  It is very unique and very good.  The lemon tart is perfect in its tartness. The crust is just the right flakiness. The coconut tart is perfect as well. It has the flaky, buttery crust which is then layered with dark chocolate.  Then to add more happiness to my taste buds, there is another layer of rose flavored caramel!  Can we say "decadent'?  After all this heavenly goodness, you get to the main event, and that is the creamy coconut atop with fresh cream.  It is so good.  The lemon meringue, passion fruit Bavarian, strawberry Bavarian, and chocolate cakes are all very good as well.  Fresh and unique flavors are highlighted in every bite. I tried their butter croissants, but I felt it was a bit too bready and not enough flakiness.     Have not tried their lunch menu yet.  Overall, this is great place to have desserts with friends and family after having pizza at Pizzeria Delfina (review will be coming soon).

I don't dig the lines or the attitude that sometimes jumps out from across the counter, but these pastry-slinging broads are the sweet bun sirens of SF for my money.  Went there recently and everything was superb.  Quality of quiches, almond croissant, croque monsieur, etc., was what I would expect from a reputable boulangerie or bistro in Paris.  While there are some drawbacks to Tartine, its products are the best in San Francisco for my money.  Unfortunately, the secret is very much out.

The food is really good, but the line is always so long and moves so slowly that the other brunch places in the neighborhood must be thankful for the customers Tartine drives to their business. I have given up on the wait several times and I believe this could be improved without much effort. For example, if the customers could see the menu while they wait, it wouldn't take 5 minutes per person to place an order once they get to the cachier. They are lucky that there aren't many French bakeries in this city.

Tartine. Too easy? Not a challenge? Ok, the crowd waiting outside is definitely enough to put you off your appetite. My girlfriend refuses to wait here with all the hipsters on principle. She doesn't want to be part of the mindless mobs waiting when any competent establishment would get its act together and find a way to deal with the lines. I used to share her opinion, til I ate here a few times. Tartine has a long line because most of the stuff is great. Really great. The morning buns are unbelievable, sugary, carmely wet dreams of flavor, at least when they have them. The last two times I've waited in that stupid line with the effeminate dudes wearing ski caps from Nordstrom's they have been OUT OF MORNING BUNS!!! IN THE MORNING!!! Hello, I just waited in line 20 minutes with Scarlett Johansson's cousin from Aspen's yoga instructor and you're out of morning buns? At 10 am? Talk about suckage! So when they're out of buns the ham and cheese croissants are an excellent fallback item. Take your damn ham and cheese croissant, sit in Dolores Park and eat it. Better yet, take your morning bun AND your ham and cheese croissant. Make sense? Does to me. I had a croque monsieur once... didn't know how to pronounce it. There was something in the sauce, like a lemony bechamel, that was a little too tart for my taste. The bread looked right, the cheese looked crusty enough. Didn't knock me out. I've had couple other things that were good. Four stars because of the crowd and failure to deliver on said morning buns.

I can't say anything here that probably hasn't already been said. So let me quickly state the following: - Avoid the muesli. I was going for a long-ish bike ride afterward, so was looking for complex carbohydrates (yeah, I know that sounds gay. But I'm no longer in HS where my lunch would be ... a 2 litre of coke). The muesli tasted like a bunch of shredded dried coconut with little in the way of whole grains. The yogurt was kinda tasteless too. - They've got the best croissants outside of France. period. - Since their success, the quality of their food hasn't degraded one bit. THAT is something to shout about. You definitely can't say the same for Ritual Roasters.

Can't afford France for a day? Try Tartine instead.  Bread pudding is drowned in caramel with fresh peaches.  There are bowls of latte and croissants to die for (or at least get pudgy around the midriff for).  The line is long always and there is limited seating, but worth it. Ummmmm, Tartine!

Like many others, I too was in Dolores Park with a friend, tanned, parched and starving.  We strolled down the street to Tartine, and had to line up with the rest of the masses waiting nearly 30 minutes for tartine and pastry.  The pastry case does add a nice distraction, pretty remarkable from such a small place.  Also have to note that the staff is very nice considering the volume of service that they are providing.  Food and Coffee are delicious!

So I wanted to not like Tartine because they made me wait nearly 40 minutes for a single panini on a relatively slow weekday, and because I generally enjoy being a curmudgeon towards places with a lot hype but, alas, they spoiled my curmudgeon-liness.  The panini was fabulous; the bread perfectly caramelized and crisp on the outside, chewy interior--yummy.   I like also like (to my chagrin) that they don't feel the need to add a hundred ingredients to each sandwich and instead focus on a few simple, fresh ones-- a la Alice W.  Tried a couple cookies, which were okay, but was sad that I didn't have any appetite left for a fabulous looking peach tart.  I'd like to go back and see if I can find anything to nit-pick about (come to think of it, $11 is a lot of dough for a sandwich-- pardon the bad pun) but I have a feeling I'll be out of luck.  Good stuff!

The standard when it comes to croissants (especially Almond), morning buns and other fine pastries in SF Bay Area.  Delicious and authentic!  Fantastic cakes, cookies, and pastries of all kinds...tasty pannini's and excellent coffee and tea. Worth the wait (there's always a line here). Hip, sophisticated crowd.

I get together with a friend about once a month to catch up and we always meet at Tartin. Usually on a weekday morning before the line gets too long. They make excellent quiches, bread puddings w/ seasonal fruit, morning buns, etc. Everything is absolutely yummy. You can sit outside (or inside, of course) while enjoying a tasty treat and coffee/tea while watching the ppl of the Mission get ready for work. It is really delightful. I'm almost glad that Tartin is not near my house...I'd be unable to resist going there on a daily basis.

The bread pudding, croissants, and sandwiches are delicious. The greatest  desserts are the tarts. If you ever have a dinner party and need a special treat, this will impress the crowd. The line is well worth the mouth watering goodness.

I love this place, very busy on the weekends, great cappuccino, if you like a strong cappuccino, dry, this is the place! The bread pudding is to die for. I know a lot of people do not care for bread pudding but this is the place to have it if you like that. The pastries are yummy, everyone gets a little something here so you know is good. They bake their own bread, and is delicious, stuff is friendly but this is a little casual place don't expect to sit with your legs crossed and sip on your coffee for 1 hr here this is loud crowded and fun! We sat at a communal table, and it was fun! by the way there is usually a line here they are very fast but expect a line...trust me is worth it

This place is not worth the hype.  I live around the corner, and the place is always packed.  The service sucks and is totally inefficiently run, the line takes forever to get through, and they use way too much butter.  Their sandwiches are decent and so is the bread pudding.  I would personally go down the street to Urban Bread and try their chocolate croissant any day.

Food is terrific. Service is spotty: sometimes you'll get a nice woman that will be very helpful, other times it's someone (like today) that despite it being not crowded, has a complete dismissive attitude.  That's a shame because that's the only flaw I see in this place. Timing: suggest going mid-week, usually a lot less crowded.

Got there around 11 am so there wasn't a line but it was still pretty busy inside. The service was fine, and they had so many goodies it almost was overload. Their rochers are a deal and have just the right amount of chocolate and crunchy texture. The banana cream  pie is very yum and also got a slice of the passionfruit bavarian slice. A great bakery with great products.

You can't beat the morning buns from Tartine.  The bread pudding and banana Cream Tart are simply delicious, too.  But I think that Tartine's various grilled cheese sandwiches are its unsung heroes.  People watching is fantastic.  They have a DIY service attitude that I don't mind.  Finding parking and then a table to enjoy your treats is the only challenge.

Tartine morning buns are the best: sweet but not sugary, cinnamon kissed but not a cinnabon and a kick of orange zest. Other pastries are also great if you have time for them. Not as thrilled about the bread pudding but others (the gf) seem quite enthused about it so perhaps I'm just not a great judge. Line and parking are annoying but get there around opening and both are generally avoided.

I'd heard that the croissants were "simply the best I'd ever tasted", so after having a lovely brunch at Lovejoys, we went over to pick up a few baked goods for later in the afternoon. A few commenters mentioned that everything looked "overdone" - it appears that they do indeed bake their pastries at a higher temp. and probably coat them with egg whites to give it that browned color, which I found to be excellent in a croissant. Nice crispy outside, tender buttery inside - perfect! Other items, including the ham and cheese quiche and cookies were also fantastic. For the food, I give it 4 - maybe 4.5 - stars. I thought it was excellent, but others in my party were a bit turned off by the crispiness. The service and outlay of the bakery? A problem. Other reviewers noted the almost lazy or careless attitude of the staff. I noticed the sort of "yeah, whatever" look on a few, but the particular problems are: 1) The cashier that day had the bubbly "and screw you too!" attitude, which we did not appreciate. Not helpful, and snide. Which, in part, was caused by... 2) The noise. We struggled to make ourselves heard by the staff, and they mumbled questions to us. Frustrating, but all of this was compounded by... 3) Their ordering system. Having a small bakery with a few staff people serving up a few people (say 5), that's fine. How it works on a crowded day is: there's this big line. Once you get to the beginning of the glass displays, a staff member asks you what you want. You haven't seen all they offer yet, so you struggle to peek around other people as you give them a few items you like. They take a break at each item you recite to fetch a bag to put that item on, then ask you if there's anything else. Arrgh. By the time you get up to the cashier, your helper is off getting someone else's order, and if you have something warming or don't remember exactly everything you ordered, the cashier has no good way of finding out. That was the problem with the attitude we had. She asked what we'd like to eat, we said we'd already ordered, she asked what we got, we didn't know for sure the name of everything, she complained that no one else had ever had a problem remembering... etc. A recommendation, owners, is that you give the help staff NCR or carbon paper order sheets - sort of like deli's do it. They scribble down your order, and when you're done listing what you like, they give you a copy. They take their original copy and fill the order, putting everything neatly in a bag. They can then attach their copy to the bag (with a name, optionally), and then when the customer gets to the register, they either hand their copy to the cashier or the cashier grabs the bag and *bam!* NO CONFUSION! This also would help the customer double-check their order to make sure an item wasn't drowned out by the noise, and would keep the cashier from thinking that you wanted something *for here* as opposed to *to go*. Please please please improve the ordering process, and perhaps help the staff members understand their attitude isn't making the process any better. For now, I won't go back.

Bread pudding for breakfast? Sure. Why not? At Tartine, feel free to pair this typically dessert food filled with yummy fruits with a piece of their corn and tomato quiche and some coffee for the first meal of the day. You will start your day with a full belly and a smile on your face. Consider sharing because the servings are generous.

If you could pick your heaven... this would be mine. I have never gotten anything I haven't liked here, regardless savory or sweet. I tend to order a lot between myself and my friends when we go here, so I've had most of the menu. Their sandwiches have 3 halves. Seriously. If you cut a normal sandwich in half (=2 halves), and then add another half. My ultimate indulgence is the frangiapane tart. The line may seem intimidating and a deterrent to eating here, but fear not, it moves quickly. Finding a place to sit is more the issue, but with Dolores Park down the street, I think your issue is resolved. You must try their coffee. I am not a coffee person, and I will go out of my way for a cup of joe from them. If I lived closer, it would be dangerous. I think I would need therapy for my addiction.

Tartine Bakery is a great weekend spot.  The line goes out the door every day with people waiting to get their fix.  Everything on the menu is incredible.  The quiche is light and tasty.  The morning buns are perfection.  The banana cream and coconut cream tarts are heavenly -- they take a pie crust and cover it in chocolate before filling it with caramel, custard and either toasted coconut or bananas.  Although I have not tried the croquette sandwiches, they are supposed to be legendary. This is a very dog friendly corner near Mission Dolores.  A few tables outside to soak up the sun and people watch make this a great spot to kill some time.

Today I finally got my lazy ass up and got some coffee and a tasty tasty treat before I headed home to san diego. I'm happy I did finally got to try this place that I've heard all this chatter about. I believe more people go here for the food. It all looked so good I couldn't decide. I didn't want to hold up the line. I hate when people hold up the line cause they were too bust talking and not thinking about what they want. I ordered the morning bun and a mocha. I think this place is worth the hype. The morning bun was delicious. I can taste the orange tastiness. The coffee was just ok. I would go back here again.

The orange morning buns here are the only thing I constantly think about when I crave anything sweet.  I live in San Jose and have been known to drive to the city just for these. I don't think there are any other morning buns as good as these anyplace else on Earth. When a food makes you close your eyes involuntarily when it hits your mouth, you know you hit jackpot.

Come early on weekends before they run out of delicious pastries + desserts. There's minimal seating and typically a 10-15 min wait, but it's well worth it. Must try: - Chocolate Eclair: combination of rich chocolate and vanilla cream make it the best eclair i've had - Banana or Lemon Cream Tart: huge pastry dessert has a flaky crust and a chocolate lining - Vanilla lattes also hit the spot OK: - Morning bun: on the 7x7 top-100 list, but I wasn't impressed.. has an orange-flavoring but bland for the most part

I see the potential in this place..and thats why i gave it 4 stars..it deserves a 3.5 i'd say but yelp hasnt caught on to the need for 1/2 stars yet...till then... I cant speak for the pastries, but my boyfriend and I ordered two sandwiches.. the sheep cheese and lemon, as well as the turkey pesto sandwich (which actually was not the sandwich we ordered ..) The bread was amazing, AMAZING...Soft to bite but just the right amount of crispy on the edges. The sandwiches huge.. two people can definitely split one of these ridiculously priced, $13 sandwiches! The insides.. not so great. The sandwich with the sheep cheese was toooo sweet, we didnt finish it and ended up drinking gallons of water after. And both sandwiches had so much butter on them that the butter was literally dripping down arms on every bite. our hands were covered in butter and we literally used dozens of napkins. it was veryyy odd how buttery the sandwiches were.. but i suppose nothing with butter can taste completely bad ... ?

One of my favorite places in the entire city. This bakery, to me, epitomizes San Francisco - understated, casual ambiance without sacrificing quality of local ingredients prepared with an expert level of sophistication. Seriously, everything here is to die for. The croissants are amazing and worth the 20 minute wait. Also, I know people in the Mission love their coffee - and Tartine's baristas really do it justice!! Of course the bread pudding is incredible. But really, the experience - waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the abundance of colors and craftsmanship in the window; listening in on the customers next you dabble between their choices with the excitement of a kid on Christmas morning - is worth it. Sure the line out the door (especially on weekends) can be annoying, but there is something very special about this place. Somehow, Tartine helps you realize that the simple act of waiting in line can help you appreciate the simple things in life - the way flour and eggs and sugar can be whipped into a plethora of abundance of colors and tastes and smells to be shared and savored with loved ones. My suggestion - get it to go, and have a picnic in Delores Park just down the block. If you are really fancy, you can pick up a loaf of bread, some gourmet cheese and wine at Bi-Rite on the way and really do your picnic justice.

My most recent trip here was a nice rainy day where I scored the space right out front.  Woohoo!!  It was crowded (when isn't it) but it was considerably shorter because of the rain. We bought $28 worth of "pastry" to have at a friend's house.  It was nicely packed.  Since my husband and I weren't sure what she or her family liked, we pretty much picked what looked good that day.  We bought 4 sweets and a ham n cheese croque.  They were tasty but not special.  Nothing ever really is there.  I think I just stop by and get something because everyone else does. I'm not a pastry snob at all.  I'll eat just about anything that's buttery and flaky with sugar and cinnamon or chocolate that comes right out of the oven.  For the price, I expected more.  Everything is pretty though!

Maybe it isn't fair of me to give this place an assessment based off of what I purchased.. but I will.  This is a cool little place, another spot that everyone knows about in SF, and the line out the door proves it.  I saw some amazing looking pastries, but my eyes drooled more than my mouth.  I just had some sweets literally five minutes before stumbling upon this place, and I was in the mood for something a bit more savory.  Their sandwiches/paninis looked amazing.  But its a bakery, so we stocked up on some sweets for later.. a slice of Tres Leches Cake, a mexican wedding cookie. We were set on ordering a sandwich to go, and asked the hostess if the sandwich would keep for about an hour or so, she didn't recommend it and said we should get the Croque Monsieur.  Looked good but I was a bit skeptical since it is an open face w/ bechamel, cheese, ham, tomato.. definitely needed to be warmed up before eating.  But she insisted it would keep better than the sandwich so we got that, and a ham and cheese filled croissant.   The croissant was delicious, too bad it couldnt have been thrown in the oven for a few minutes (we were staying at a hotel Downtown).  But the Croque, albeit flavorful, was not very enjoyable at room temperature.  My BF only had a few bites and said it wasn't worth it.  That's when my woman-like ingenuity kicked in and I tried to warm it up using our blow dryer!  It actually worked decently.  The cheese melted, and although the bread obviously won't toast, it was somewhat warm.  The pastries, croissant excluded,  were just so-so. I would go back to eat there and give them a fair shot to impress me.

I have been an admirer of Tartine for a while - their Croque-monsieur, their bread pudding, their chocolate croissant, their other pastries, but I finally fulfilled my dream - to taste their fresh-baked bread, still warm from the oven. You have to order before 3 p.m. in order to pick up bread at 5 p.m. So on a rainy Sunday afternoon, I naively called their phone number and left a message on their voice mail to order bread (I didn't even specify the type or the size). But since they didn't call me back I grew worried, sprinted through the rain to the J Church and then again through the rain into Tartine. Turns out they knew nothing about my order so I ordered it right there on the spot - a half-loaf walnut bread. The rain had subsided but I ran again, before 5 p.m. this time to the 14L Mission (I live around 30th and Church, so I get a choice between the J and the Mission lines) and 4 more blocks to Tartine, just in time to pick up my warm bread. The combined Muni Clipper fare equaled the price of the bread. I have always loved warm bread. I sometimes go to the Russian bakeries in the Richmond to get my fix. I also love restaurants that serve fresh warm bread. I even got my very own bread machine. But nothing beats the feeling of this warm bread in the hands, and especially in the mouth. The light tartness of the levain (not to be confused with American sourdough), the tandem crunchiness of the crust and the walnut, the softness of the core, the comforting warmth and the mesmerizing aroma make this the best bread I've tasted, in recent memory -- and eliminates the recent memory of running for it in the rain.

I absolutely adore their morning buns and the ham cheese croissants are amazing ...  actually all of their croissants are amazing! The chocolate loaf is another tasty treat. I don't really care for the olive loaf or the gougeres, but have enjoyed everything else I've put in my mouth! There is almost always a line but well worth the wait. Now, go stuff yourself!

Great pastries and delicious croque monsieurs. Only taking off a star for the lack of seating and expensive nature of the baked goods, $4 for a croissant, etc. I recommend the pain au chocolat, the morning bun and the banana cream tart.

I been coming here for years,  I figure finally I should write a review.  Pastries are delicious and some rustic qualities to it.  But its the bread that I really come here for.  Chad Robertson spent twenty years just perfecting his bread.  They only sell one type of bread with variation of walnut, olive or regular country loaf.  Yes it has unusual time frame when the bread rolls out which is 5 pm and not in the morning.  Chad told me they need the oven space for delicious Pastries made by his wife in the morning.  In which case I can go on and on about how good the bread is but I'll let people of the yelp to decide.  One other word of caution, long line for bread starting at 5 pm sometimes, be patient and take a deep breath.

Not quite sure whats up with the line at this place, oh yeah, HYPE!! I laughed when I saw they were a James Beard winner, in all fairness I think they won it on their bread, which I have never tried,,I have however tried a lot of the baked goods ( I believe in benefit of the doubt).. 1. Banana Cream Tart - tasty, but why the chocolate? 2. Lemon Cream Tart - bland, tasteless, taste like lemon concentrate. 3.Mexican wedding cakes - dry (chalk dry), tasted old & dusty 4. Bouche de Noel - boring Maybe people don't know what good baking taste like and have settled for this mediocre place.  Maybe its because I bake from scratch at home and understand the love that goes into baking..seriously if anyone wants good mexican wedding cakes, send me a letter..I would be happy to make your taste buds happy.., OH yeah, I don't rate customer service at most places, I am there for the food, good thing too, if I did they would have 0 stars

Be ready to wait in a long line, so hope your sweet tooth is patient! It was worth the wait when I ate my Chocolate Hazel nut tart but only because they no longer had any other tarts available! The lady said they were really busy today, I thought..."aren't you always busy, shouldn't you be prepared." Anyways, I really wanted a banana cream pie tart but they were out so I settled for the chocolate hazelnut and was not disappointed. The chocolate was moist and sweet and the crust was to die for! My sister got the fruit tart and this was just as delicious! The peaches were just the right amount of sweetness with the same crust as my chocolate tart. $6.50 is kind of pricey to me but I guess you're in SF and it's convenient...close to Dolores park. Not a lot of sitting room, so be prepared to take your dessert to go. Overall, will return if I'm in the area but wouldn't make a special trip out here.

high expectations however overall it was a disappointment. Waited almost an hour to try their raved morning bun, but when it was my turn to order they sold out! I ended up getting their Frangipane Tart, banana tart, and coffee.  Coffee was a disappointment as well as the frangiane tart.  Banana tart was good although I had better ones elsewhere.  My friend raved about their breads so I'll order it in advance and try it out hopefully it will meet my expectation this time

I first noticed the burned meringue(which customers may only notice if they have experience making and baking meringue) on two of the cakes in the case, but continued and ordered for our group a spicy turkey sandwich which was huge, expensive and only okay.  I understand the sandwiches are on freshly baked bread and know great effort goes into this and therefore costly, but I think smaller sandwiches and a lower cost would be a better option for everyone.  We also ordered a butter croissant- only okay, quiche okay, oatmeal cookie- not good at all and to all of us tasted like popcorn.  The restaurant service does not run smoothly and needs an overhaul.

Went there for the first time yesterday... I had heard about it but never got the chance to go. I was stuffed from lunch but decided to stop by for coffee and a pastry before dinner. Can you tell that I was on an eating fiesta?? :) Long line in the front but it moves pretty fast... I wanted to try the banana cream pie, morning and pain au chocolat that everyone has been posting about. They had already sold out... granted it was already 5pm. But looking at this line, I would imagine that they would have still had plenty of stuff. I got a lemon tart, coconut pie, frangipane croissant and a cappucino. The pies were good (I am typically not a fan of lemon pies...) but the frangipane croissant was amazing!!!!!!!!!!! I've had these in France and this one beats most of the ones I've had. I think this place is more of a bakery than a patisserie. If you are craving traditional french breakfast (croissant, pain au chocolat, buns...) then this is the ultimate treat!!!!!! The bread is fantastic too.. next time I want to try a sandwich. Advice: Get there early in the day for best selection.

We have lived in Paris and consumed a lot of croque monsieur but  Tartine's croque monsieur is the best I ever tasted-I like the vegetarian option the best. We always order two to go, a pastry nosh for dessert, and then take it all on over to nearby Dolores Park for a picnic. Perfect SF lunch; been doing this for years every time we visit SF, and its always great, foodwise as well as hangout wise.

I was appalled at how rude their staff was.   And no, I did not go in with an attitude.  I'd never been there and had some questions and their waitstaff was so unbelievably snotty that I decided to go elsewhere.  Their food may be good (I'll never know) but  San Francisco is full of good food and the places with staying power are the ones that treat their customers with respect.

My favorite thing about Tartine is that I once was at a Make Out Room event to raise $ for Kerry/Edwards and some guy next to me was saying to his perfectly T-shirt and raggedy jeans-ed out friend next to him "Yeah, he says he's alternative, but Becky says she saw him at Tartine last Saturday". Need I say more? The pastries are good, but don't match Bay Bread Boulangerie in my opinion. And the wait is pretty long to justify paying $3+ for a turnover.

What more can one say about tartine.. they do some damn good pastries, there is no word to describe their chocolate croissant (they insist on you naming it pan au chocolate, but lets continue, i dont want to start on the french, not enough room here) Their country bread is also friggin delicious, and i'm not a fan of sourdough crusts, they just do it right. I give them four stars because the line to the counter and the service is outrageous, come at 11:00am, after the morning rush, or dont come near the place, no pastry is good enough to stand in line for 20 minutes next to the "who and who" of san francisco

This is hands down the best bakery in SF.  I've spent some time in France and this is the real deal.  If it was closer to my apartment I would be obese.   The desserts are amazing, especially the coconut cream tart and the scharffen berger chocolate pudding.  The chocolate croissant is the best I've ever had, period.  Great cappuccino too.  And the panini are not to be missed... be warned, they are huge.  They basically give you three sandwiches on the plate.  Plan to spend the rest of your day drinking water and giving your arteries time to recover.

Tartine is certainly worth the wait. You need to know what to order. Systematically trying it all is a great option. I like the muesli - it is light and healthy, with yogurt, cashews, fresh organic fruit and berries, almonds, walnuts... SO yummy. The perfect opening to something heavier like a chocolate croissant. The croissants are perfectly flaky, buttery on outside, soft and melt-in-your-mouth fluffy on the inside. If you ask, they'll give you  handmade apricot jam with the croissants. A friend who has travelled to Paris frequently says they are the best he's had in ten years. The bittersweet Scharffen Berger chocolate pudding is perfect. As is the double chocolate croissant, though it's intense - enough to be its own meal, as I found the coconut cream tart to be, as well. It's all the best. My only complaint is that they limit one's caffeine intake and will not serve a "large" cappucino, latte, or anything except for regular coffee. Only doubles in tiny "small" size cups. But the large servings of chocolate contained in the pudding or croissant make up for it in spades.

How do I even begin to put into words the sheer adoration I have for Tartine Bakery? I've been a faithful customer for several years now and can confidently say that my overall experience, from the quality of the food to the service, has been nothing short of exemplary. The croque monsieurs and hot pressed sandwiches are consistently delicious, probably because they share the base of Chad Robertson's absolutely perfect bread for all those other fine & tasty ingredients. The sopressata and pastrami  are personal faves. The pain au chocolat and pain au jambon are cafe mainstays that get elevated to buttery, flaky, and scrumptious greatness, shaming the versions you'd get elsewhere. And Elisabeth Pruitt is hooking you up with an invitation to nirvana with the ridiculously awesome coconut cream and lemon cream tarts. Seriously, we're talking about some transcendent pastries here. It's really disheartening to read the (thankfully) scant negative reviews about either the food or service at Tartine. Regarding the latter, it has been my experience that the staff of Tartine has shown a commendable amount of poise and restraint when dealing with the throngs of "challenging" people that come through there at all times. It seems to be indicative of such successful and special places like Tartine that they are frequented by the types of people that feel *entitled* to all the great stuff offered by the establisment. Such is their self-absorbtion that it seems almost impossible to please them. I've observed adults who should know better act like bratty little children when they can't get what they want. Well boo-effin' hoo. It's not the staff's fault that you got there after they sold out of your precious morning bun. And you have the nerve to get bossy and expect them to stay open "just a few more minutes" because you couldn't get your privileged ass in there before they've closed the doors and registers. Get over yourselves. So as not to end this review on a sour note, I want to say that Tartine Bakery is the type of place that makes me feel lucky that I live in San Francisco or, for that matter, anywhere in the bay area. I've taken countless out-of-town visitors there and they all look back on the experience with fondness and usually can't wait until the next time they're in town so they can go back. Recognize the real. Tartine is the lick!

A wonderful bakery, where the bread and baked treats are delicious but the service is can't-be-bothered. Best to order and split than wait for a table to be cleared for the next eager-to-be-ignored diner. There seems to be a boycott on wiping off tables in order for a layer of evidence to build until the end of the day. Even more puzzling -- there is a notice on the cash register that says, "Thanks for busing your own table!" but there is not a clue as to where to put the dirty dishes when attempting to comply. Do we push our way back into the kitchen? I like baked goods, but the "what, me work?" attitude sours the entire experience.

I've been coming to Tartine since the first week they opened.  Breakfast goodies, cakes, pies, cookies, you name it.  The sweet stuff.  There hasn't been anything that isn't spectacular. But then?  The other night?  I had their country loaf bread, which I have always ignored, and it was amazing.  Really and truly.  Dare I say it?  It was better than the desserts.  Oh my.  It takes a lot to get me excited about bread- I mean, we have the best stuff here on a regular basis- but god, it was good. It comes out at 5:00 and the other day I got there at 5:15 and they were sold out.  I ended up with the sesame loaf and it was also pretty freaking good.

OK I still love Tartine but as goes the way of most great things in the City, once they get too popular and full of themselves, the quality diminishes. Coconut Cream Tart  - still no doubt awesome but come on! $6.50 for a small tart? Bread - yes I do think your walnut bread is outstanding but must you absolutely CHAR the outside?  And don't tell me that is how they do it in Paris.  I've had Poulane's and it is not black on the outside.  DANG - turn the oven down some - it even tastes charred.  Also don't give me a dirty look when I ask for a loaf you haven't burned. Still love the clientelle!

Tried it out 3 times.

Visited this past Sunday on a gorgeous SF afternoon. The line was long but I needed the time to browse the menu and drool over the the confections at the counter. Plus, I had time to scan other people's food too (very important) There's no way I could have made a decision in just a minute. So what did I choose after taking my time to study the menu? A chocolate croissant, of course. The best thing about it was that the chocolate wasn't super sweet like commercial brands. It still maintained a soft chocolate bitterness in addition to its sweet undertone. Next time I'm there I'll stray from my chocolate addiction...or at least I'll try. I really liked Tartine but need to visit again for a larger sample size to merit a final star

I'm not sure what else to add.  Everyone seems to have made all the essential points about Tartine.  Amazing bakery.  In my mind, it's one of the best in the country.  It makes the pastries at the Cheeseboard seem like yesterday's stale bread.  And the portions leave one satisfied in a way that one is never satisfied upon leaving Patisserie Poupon in DC.   On the downside, it is insanely busy.  The service is perfunctory (probably because they're constantly swamped).  The seating is terrible.  The layout is thoughtless.   But, overall, I can say that I'm glad that I don't live in the Mission. If I did, I'd be at Tartine every day and I'd gain 50 pounds . . .

Went here over the weekend with my old partner in crime (see below). The line was long, but at least it kept moving. Don't expect indoor seating, as they appeared to have every table and counter occupied throughout the entire morning. parking could have been much worse, though I got a spot right in front of the bakery... The coffee was great, and the chocolate hazelnut tart that I brought home was superb. the only major discomfort to me was the way that the line wraps directly next to most of the seating (going in or out).

Now for amazing eats this is a fantastic  place.  The bread pudding, quiche and croque monsieur are to die for.  I get them to go when I want to impress friends but don't have time to cook.  Great food for picnics too.  However, the guy behind the counter yesterday was way beyond grunge cool.   He just looked like he needed a really good bath and clean clothes.  His t-shirt even had dirt stains all over the back.  Not very appetizing.  Luckily the food is so good, you'll almost be able to ignore it. He also tried to clear my friends plate of quiche when he turned his back to get more coffee.  A little too concerned with quick turnover perhaps?

The Pros: Excellent pastries, tasteful aesthetics, great people watching. My Tartine fave: the rochers. I love them so much I wrote a little haiku poem of appreciation:                       Light as Styrofoam                       Chewy, nutty, sweet--                       Rochers are like crack. The Cons: Long lines, prickly service, pricey goods. But hey, the goods in this place are so good, I gave 'em 5 stars anyway. It's not easy to maintain such attention to quality, day after day after day. If Tartine wasn't so good, there would be no long line, and maybe even no sullen servers(though I doubt it). Maybe some day they'll get a bigger place and staff it with smiley people. Until then I'll put up with the rough edges so I can get my sugar.

Without question the best bakery in town. Bread pudding, lemon meringue cake, gougeres, morning buns- all to die for. Come around the holiday months for some of the soft gingerbread, it is the best thing they make but they bake it rarely. (I made the recipe out of the cookbook and I must say it turned out pretty well) I wish they had some more creative vegetarian options for the sandwiches but I generally have no complaints. For good god, open a second location so we don't have to wait in line so long!

Yes, they make amazing pastries.  I live in the neighborhood, though, and don't go unless there isn't a line.  Why?  Because they came out with a cookbook a few years ago, and well, I can make just about everything I would stop in for.  And I don't want to wait on line for a half hour with people who (1) don't have a clue how to choose what they want while waiting and (2) have no regard for personal space and (3) are maybe, quite possibly from out of town, spewing inanities, grabbing tables when they first get on line, etc.  The experience of waiting in line at a place two blocks from my house--no. Which brings me to today.  There was no line.  I stepped in, was second in line, but still somehow managed to wait for ten minutes to both order and pay.  What is with the people they have working there now?!  There are only a few "old-timers" who still have a few brain cells and understand both civility and efficiency, but the rest... holy crap!!  The blank stares, the ridiculous outfits, the serving of a "double" cappucino that's the same size as a one-shot cappucino (what?!), the overly dressed little salad, the semi-warm quiche.  And then the girl who delivered my quiche took the table number so that the girl with the salad (who had taken my order BTW!) walked all around wondering whose it was.  I was frustrated beyond belief.  And I hadn't even done the half hour plus wait.  Sigh. And I just want to say... with a few exceptions, they always have the same stuff.  I understand that they're famous for a few things and that they make basics like croissants better than anyone in the U.S., but it's become stale and boring, honestly.  I think there's a little resting on laurels happening.

Most heavenly desserts in town - been a patron since the opening.  Best lemon tarts - creamy, tart, sweet filling and flaky, buttery crust done perfectly.  LOVE the Coconut Bavarian cake that contains passionfruit and lime genoise.  They have yummy sandwiches and croque monsieurs. The Niman Ranch jambon croque is one of my all-time favs.   Known for their country bread! They would get five stars but I must say that more often than not, the gurlz that work there tend to be aloof and give the impression that they could care less about serving you - hey, smiling is harmless...especially when I used to drop an average of $20 every time I walked through their door!

Tartine, I heart thee.  From your press goat cheese sandwiches and those sumptuous carrots soaked in vinegar to your almond croissants and banana cream tarts. I would regularly visit you when you first opened and there were no lines.  It was like our little secret.  But then at some point all my favorite spots began having ridiculous waits-but most of all you.  And it didn't matter if it was 10am on a Tuesday or Noon on a Saturday! 1 Star detracted for the line and the wait and the general chaos that ensues from that.  I mean I've never seen white folks get so vicious with each other.  Apparently your bread pudding makes the "civilized" become so un-civilized.  Something must be done.  I mean I know people fight over land, freedom, justice but...quiche?! My suggestion: Open up another rest. in the Marina.  That way we can keep things a little more hood if you know what I mean.

Not that this place need another stellar review, but i had to come on here to sing its praises! I got wind of this place from a friend who found it on yelp and we decided to go try it out. Its located in a beautiful part of the city. It was kind of hard to find as it doesn't have a the name anywhere but on the menu, but we found our way there via the huge crowds and the line coming out the door! We went there on a a tuesday morning and even then it was packed! we had to hover for a couple of seats! We ended up trying the ham and cheese croissant, the regular croissant and the fresh starberry tart. They were all AMAZING. Seriously the best that i've ever had. This place deserves all of its accolades and then some, great stuff here and everything looks amazing. This is one of those places where you have to go back 5-6 times just to try everything cause it all looks so great. Definitely worth checking out if you're in or around the area!

This is quite possibly the best bakery I have ever been to for single-sized and double-sized desserts. (I can't speak for the larger desserts like their cakes because I've never ordered them.) Bread pudding: always outstanding - great consistency, and served with the right fruit topping for the day. Frangipane croissant: also always outstanding. Good for you? Probably not. Tasty? Absolutely.  (There's so much salt, butter, and sugar that a friend of mine who left one in his car for a week still found it edible and surprisingly tasty one week later.)

Long lines don't stop me from making it my favorite place to hang out. The key is to come during the week, or grab a table BEFORE you wait in line. The best croissants, pastries, espresso (not coffee) cakes, bread to die for!! I've gotten to know the kids (ages me, right?) who work here. They work hard and too often don't get tips. LEAVE TIPS FOR THEM. Right, there's no table service, but who do you think has to deal with lines around the corner, cleaning the tables, sweeping the floors. TOURISTS, you should know that in San Francisco, there are many places you serve yourself, but tipping is normal for any kind of service.

Wow! Love this bakery! My favorite in the city so far! I love the berry tarts, chocolate cake, and of course the brioche bread pudding!  The best thing about the brioche besides the yum factor is that it is seasonal, so the fruit is always different . The sandwiches are delicious as well, featuring great and unusual combinations. I bought the cookbook and every recipe has turned out just as good as the bakery. Wished I lived closer!

I had 2 goals: 1. I wanted to see if all the Yelp hype was legit. 2. A local friend recommended it as one of the most famous bakeries in san francisco. Tartine lives up to the hype. I got the morning bun, the chocolate croissant, and the frangipane tart. The chocolate croissant was fresh out of the oven, and it showed in the flaky delicate layers. The sweetness of the chocolate filling balanced the nutty buttery-ness of the outer pastry. The morning bun and frangipane tart were less fresh i.e. a bit cold, which definitely detracted from the experience. The morning bun reminded me of a delicate cinnamon bun topped with hints of orange. It was a bit too crunchy, but that could have been attributed to its time in the display glass. It's hard to describe the ingredients in the tart. The cream filling was sweet but not overly so. Shaved almonds on top created a good crunchy contrast to the smooth mouthfeel of the filling. Basically, everything was delicious and subtly sweet, yet contained contrasting textures and tastes that demonstrated the craft that went into the baking . I detest overly-sweetened bakery goods, so Tartine really hit the spot for me. To its credit, if everything were fresh out of the oven, Tartine would have gotten a 5-star rating. But the time that the bakery items spent in the glass display case diminished their maximal possible impact. Bottom line: Go, and ask for the bakery items that just came out of the oven. You won't regret it.

The wild blueberry Frangipane tart is world-shattering. Literally. Order one of these babies, take it to the top of Dolores Park, and watch the world melt around you. I've also and enjoyed the classical roche, chocolate roche, cappuchino in a giant soup bowl, and open faced ham and gruyere sandwhich. Their country bread is definitely worth the $7 for the HUGE loaf. Buy one, cut it into sandwhich slices, and make your packed-at-home lunches exponentially better than they are today. (BTW: The bread always sells out on the weekends, so I call ahead to reserve a load for evening pick up. The situation is usually a bit more flexible during the weekdays.) I've never tried their croissants, because at $4.50 each, it's almost laughable to do-so. Maybe Tartine should consider adjusting their croissant pricing? Overall 5 stars, even with a wait out-the-door.

I probably don't need to add another review to the 2000+ already posted, but man this place is double effin' good! My gf and I went almost every day we were in town and got the double pain au chocolat, morning bun, and jambon croissant. The pain au chocolat was fresh out of the oven and just oozed with chocolate and butter and flaky perfection, and the morning bun was crispy and gooey and had a nice orange/cinnamon caramelly center. The Jambon (Niman Ranch ham and gruyere cheese) almost made me fall over, it was so BEYOND what it looked like. A flavor explosion sending happy ecstasy waves throughout my brain and body!  We would stand on the street corner and eat the whole thing and immediately debate whether we should get another one.

My honey and I just finished the remaining half of the frangipane croissant and half of the morning bun we took home from this morning's breakfast.  I didn't want to throw them away. How could I?  We couldn't finish them earlier.  We know the croque monsier is enough to fill both us but I get carried away everytime we come here for breakfast so I always order the extra on top of our breakfast favorite - croque monsieur and coffee.

Their lemon tart and ham & cheese croissant is to die for!  The lemon tart is the right balance of creamy and tart, love the solid crust.  Their croissant is super flaky and crisp, enough for a meal in itself.  Not sure I would recommend the banana tart, didn't care for the chocolate coating on the crust, although I understand it's needed to keep the crust from going soggy.   If you go on certain nights and time it just right, you can get a whole or half a loaf of fresh baked round of bread fresh out of the oven.

This is the best bread in the bay area as of the date of my writing these words. Anyone who says otherwise is a liar or is simply ignorant of Tartine's bread. Alas, the bread comes out of the oven at 5 pm and they usually close two and a half to three hours following, and last time I checked, no bread is available on Mondays or Tuesdays, and often sell out before 6 on any given day. But for the dedicated and true bread lover, these uncouth obstacles will stand as nothing to obtain these loaves of moist love. Of course you could just call in the morning and secure your bread without necessitating the braving of the Mission rush and the complete absence of viable and legal parking. Either way, eat some all ye farinaphiles, you owe it to yourself for existing in such proximity.

In the seven days I spent  in San Francisco last week, I visited Tartine three times.  The pressed sandwiches are massive and the great, thick bakery bread is liberally spread with olive oil; it is as a good panino should be.  The lemon tart is beautifully and simply presented, and tastes as delectable as it looks.  And the double pain au chocolat is crunchy, flaky on the outside and buttery delicious on the inside with just the right amount of rich Valrhona chocolate in the center.  It is usually hard to find a table, or even a spare chair in this popular bakery, so take it to go and enjoy the great view of the city from the bench at the top (southwest corner) of Dolores Park.

I have been to Tartine a couple of times now and truly think it is one the the best bakeries in SF.  They carry one of the best bread puddings I've ever tasted and I also recommend the Bavarian and tres leches cake.  I like the simplicity of the atmosphere.  In fact, the only reason I found the bakery the first time was the long line outside.  It's also right next to Dolores Park,  which is a great area to walk around and explore.  The only reason why I don't give this place 5 stars is: first the line is always tremendous, especially in the mornings, and second I am a student and paying 5.50 for a slice of cake can be slightly ridiculous. But you pay for quality so I guess I can't complain.

The croissants at this place are like no other. The gods of buttery, flaky, and delicious have blessed this place a thousand times over. If you are in San Fran and don't get by here for breakfast, you have made a major mistake. It is pretty quick even if there is a line. No waiters- you just order at the counter, eat wherever a spot opens up, bus your own table and leave. The regular croissant and the chocolate filled one are what I recommend.

Went here twice in 2 days, so that must tell you something.  Everything looked delicious and it definitely lived up to the hype. Ate: -Morning bun: have them warm it up for you or it won't be as good.  The best part was the middle where it's soft and the sticky bottom part. -Chocolate oatmeal cookie - This was the best cookie I have ever tried. Made perfect for me. I tend to like my cookies hard and not too thick.  So if you like the chewy thick chocolate chip kind, then this is not for you. - Banana cream pie - It was ok.  The filling was good but the crust was too hard. - Fresh berries with bavarian cream - OMG, this was sooo yummmy.  This was my favorite one of all.  The cream was not too sweet and not too bland. - Croque Monsieur with shitake mushrooms - this too was also good.  I love mushrooms but it had a little too much of it.  However, I would still get it again but this time try it with smoked ham instead.

Tartine Bakery is the sort of place that makes me deeply grateful to live in San Francisco.  Compared to other cities (and countries) San Franciscans are blessed with a phonebook full of good bakeries -- so much so that even our lesser bakeries would be considered great if they were relocated to a lesser city.  And with so many bakeries of similar quality, it's arguably a waste of time to compare them.  Tartine Bakery, however, is different from the average bakery.  In fact, Tartine is so far above the so-called competition as to warrant particular notice. Tartine's baked goods are truly in a league of their own.  Whether this is a function of superior technique, or better ingredients -- I'm not qualified to say.  What I can comment on is taste, and in this respect Tartine has no equal -- not in Paris, or New York, or any other city where you'd expect to find great bakeries.  The simple croissant is a good example.  At the better bakeries in Paris, you'll find a buttery, flaky croissant -- tasty, no doubt.  At Tartine that croissant is both buttery and flaky, but the butteriness is so much richer, and its flakiness balanced with crispness.  It's an elevated experience.  The same can be said of Tartine's frangipane croissant (and similar creations), with its perfect balance of butter and almondy-sweetness.  These are standard offerings at most bakeries, but Tartine's version of these croissants stands so far above the others that it's not fair to compare them as if they were like products. The same praise can be heaped on everything Tartine produces.  For example, I recently brought home a coconut cream tart for my wife who is fond of coconut.  I'm less fond of coconut -- or I was before tucking into that tart.  It was rich and creamy, yet simultaneously airy and light.  And where an ordinary crust would be dense, mealy and flavorless, Tartine's crust had a lovely flavor and was just the right texture.  Here was the Goldilocks of crusts, and indeed, of tarts.  I could carry on in this vein ad infinitum, but these examples are representative of everything Tartine produces. Some reviewers have complained that Tartine is expensive, while others have spoken of long lines.  While both complaints are valid to a point, they should be kept in proper perspective.  Yes, you will pay more for Tartine's goods than other bakeries' products.  But the adage that you get what you pay for is entirely true, and applies as much here as anywhere.  If you're on a tight budget, you can easily buy a lesser product elsewhere. You will likewise often find a long line snaking out of Tartine.  In my experience, the line moves pretty quickly, so I've never viewed this as a particular problem (though I take my goodies to-go, so if you plan to sit down and eat at Tartine, the crowds may prove to be annoying).  And on a related subject, parking is a bitch around Tartine (as it is in much of the Mission).  If you have to drive there, my best advice is to try to visit during the day, when this neighborhood isn't quite as packed.

The Sourdough bread is the most amazing food experience. The rind, not crust, is sweet, just slightly bitter with wonderful carmel flavor and the loaf is sweet and sour with a custard-like texture. My loaf was hot out of the oven.It is especially good toasted; the caramel flavor becomes prominent.

Stopped by Tartine this morning.  The line was out the door around 9am but it moved fairly quickly. I ordered the ham quiche, almond croissant, and bread pudding.  I did not care for the bread pudding. I prefer my bread pudding to be a little more firm than gooey.  The overall flavor was good, but it's not something I would order again.  My friend ordered a chocolate croissant. Both hers and mine were AMAZING! I haven't had such a buttery croissant since I was in Paris.  The quiche was flavorful and tasty.  I saw someone walk out with the mug/bowl of chai and it looked wonderful. We were in a rush and didn't feel like standing in another line to order our drinks, so we left.  This place is worth it for the croissants alone.  Their other pastries in the window looked scrumptious as well.

Excellent balance and presentation, pretty good value.  Never had Parisian goods but I'd assume Paris to have better quality.  The chocolates (eclairs, devil cake) were absolutely wonderful and the lemon tart the nearest to perfection of balance and synergy.

On a recent trip to SF with my boyfriend, we both concurred that Tartine was our favorite part of the trip. It's a casual eaterie, where you get in line and pay, then get a number and scout a spot to sit. The baked goods look sumptuous and heavenly, but I was in the mood for a croque monsieur. My boyfriend ordered the swiss quiche with bacon, but my croque stole the show. It was an alternative croque- with shitake mushrooms, gruyere and tomato (stewed or dried-not sure.) It rocked my world! We each had cappuccinos- so perfect you want to swan dive in. The place is popular, so scouting a table was challenging, but oh so worth it. The place has rustic decor and quirky bread themed art. I am already thinking of when I'll return. I will have to try a croissant. They looked out of this world. The staff is knowledgeable, cool, but not unapproachable- a real foodie crew. Sweet experience.

It was a so so visit today.  I had the chocolate eclair and two others had the bread pudding.  My eclair has a nice dark chocolate and a crispy shell, but the shell is neither that flavorful nor is the filling anything to make me jump up and down.  It was a cross between heavy cream out of the carton and slightly thickened cream.  Everything was dripping all over because it looked like the eclair was cut in half to get the cream in.  But it was so liquidy that it would not have stayed in easily anyway. The bread pudding got low to luke warm ratings for the second time in two visits.  Today's was simply too dry and bland.  The pears were nice, but they did not make up for the lackluster bread part of the bread pudding. Unfortunately, a less than thrilling experience considering the 20 minute wait. On an up note, the service was pleasant and efficient.  Well done to those behind the counter.

If you love pastries , this is the place for you. Let me tell you first of all you will have to wait at the very least thirty to an hour in line before stepping foot into the bakery. However they do have a side coffee bar inside that you can run in to grab a cup of jo and wait in line again. Thats what we did. Onto the pastries. Can I say delicious? Im not a big fan of sweets but what I had was quite yummy. I was with 3 other people so we tried almost everything things. I will only write about what I ordered. First it was the pain au chocolate something like that. It was goooood, flaky crust, crispy, and jamm packed with flavor. Next we have the Eclair, probably, the  best eclair I have ever tasted! Filled with custard this thing ooozed of it every bit. It got quite messy. Onto the Morning bun I believe it was called something like that. It reminded me of a sugary cinnabun, with an orange twist!  I tried a whole bunch of other stuff but don't feel like ranting any longer. All in all this is a stop that you must stop by at least once in your life . THUMBS UP!

It's been a really long time since I've had a really good croissant, and I was so pleased when I tore into Tartine's that it was as buttery as can be.  However I can't give it a 5* because it was too big and too dark.  They probably had to bake it longer  due to the size.  But that said, I was thrilled that this was the closest tasting product to a traditional croissant I've had in years. Also tried their chocolate tea bread, which unfortanately tasted nothing of chocoate.  Weird, huh?  It had that dark color like you get from mayonnaise cake, or dutch process + baking soda, but zero chocolate flavor.  Wouldn't get this again. The desserts looked really yummy and I'd like to try them one day

Was in SF for Spring Break, and decided to try Tartine due to great Yelp reviews. Was not disappointed! Luckily got there before the long line formed out the door! Sandwiches are HUGE! Share, share, share!! Food came out quick, mustard pretty spicy on some sandwiches, and dressing on green salad was very bitter, so be sure to request it without if you don't love strong flavors! Loved the eclectic true SF vibe.

If I were only rating Tartine's bread, I would give it 5 stars.   However,with a name like Tartine the pastries should be over the top sensational, and to me, they are just good, some very good, but not WOWIE, ZOWIE! After spending time in Paris and experiencing French Pastries (such as those made by Pierre Herme') I have to rate the pastry aspect of the bakery as OK but not over the top sensational. Add to that, the obnoxious scene and the haughty know it all staff, and I'd much rather spend my money  down the street at Bi-Rite Market where the customer is appreciated.   I live in the neighborhood, so when I'm in the mood for calories, I get Bi-Rite Ice Cream. Tartine is, however, a nice stop for the bridge and tunnel crowd. Additionally,  Tartine is inconsistent, they once served me a croissant that was slightly burnt on the bottom and then insisted that it was supposed to be like that...as if I have traveled all over the world for the last 30 years, spent considerable time in France, and wouldn't know when a croissant is burnt! Later for you Tartine!

So I heard about it on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" I'm not proud, I gave into the food network. All I can say is thank you (chef who's name I can't remember). Thank you so very very very much. Sweet Lord, the double chocolate croissant is definitely up there with one of the best most amazing things I ever ate. First of all when I got this pastry, it was still warm. STILL WARM people, are you listening? The crust crackled when I took a bite (meaning the croissant was perfect, they aren't supposed to be just flakey but also crisp - yes I've been to France, and yes I know what a good croissant is supposed to be like).  Then I could actually SEE the butter glistening in the center of it, oozing out. The mouthfeel was something between orgasm and winning money. It's a double chocolate croissant, so they use two rods of excellent chocolate. It's deep, rich, chocolatey, buttery. Delicious. And with the great coffee they serve I was a very happy girl. I don't live in SF anymore, but damnit I will be back!

There's something about Tartine that doesn't quite do it for me, food-wise.  There are some things I love, and some things that jut don't hit the spot. As far as the ambiance and the staff, both are thumbs down.  The place is always crowded, it's poorly laid out, the wait in line is incredibly long even though they usually have two people serving and at least one person ringing up.  This is a neighborhood place, but if they have regular customers I wouldn't be able to tell, because the staff never acts like they know the customers (or want to). At the end of this review I'll given an example of the staff attitude. The Good: Scharffen Berger chocolate pudding  (I think they switched to Valhrona but it's still divine). bread pudding with fruit -  the portions are massive.  Seriously, if you're on a budget, get this.  It'll tide you over for the whole day.  It's very eggy pudding;  moist, almost wet, and the fruit is always fresh.  I don't think tart fruit and eggy bread pudding necessarily are the best combination, especially when the fruit is al dente and the pudding is mushy, but the fruit is so good, and the pudding is so good, it doesn't matter.  You will not really taste the bread chunks - the pudding is very moist, so the bread kind of dissolves.  Sort of the texture of white bread without the crusts, so not chewy at all. morning buns - huge, rich, chewy, sticky.  perfect texture.  Probably a thousand calories each but who cares? all of their baked breads are amazing - but then, you can barely walk a block in San Francisco without finding amazing artisanal breads, so that's not a reason to go across town to Tartine. The Not-So-Good: quiche - good custard base, but the crust is so saturated with butter (or whtaver they use) that it is extremely greasy the banana cream tart - this is in a pastry shell lined with chocolate, then a banana custard with huge chunks of banana, topped with whipped cream.  The pastry shell is so hard you could crack a tooth.  the custard is bland, and the chunks of banana are huge.  It's like trying to eat an extremely hard cookie while eating a banana straight out of the peel.  The jawbreaker + mush + lack of flavor just doesn't do it for me.  And they're expensive, about $6.50 each The ham and cheese croissants are almost disgusting - way too rich, and salty. Many of their savory items have so much butter (or whatever it is) in them that they are overly greasy. ditto for many of their pastries.  their croissants are massive but just too rich.  And by rich I mean greasy.  I have to think if they used a little less butter, their food might taste better and be less unhealthy. So, an example of the staff attitude:  Today I went in, got some stuff to go then went back to use the bathroom.  It's in the back of the cafe... in an awkward location, by the bussing racks, near the spiral staircase that goes upstairs... There was someone in the bathroom and two other people plus a group of three friends waiting to use it so there was quite a crowd.  I tried to stand out of the way but then some staffer came along and shoved a stainless steel cart into my butt to get past me and go up the spiral staircase (which I hadn't even noticed).  Mind you, the cart was what was in the way, not me!  So I moved it to a spot where it wasn't blocking the staircase and two seconds later someone came along and moved it back where it had been!  Anyway after a seven minute wait, I was like third in line to use the bathroom and Little Miss Thang comes along from the cash register where she had been ringing people up and tells me to move, that "the line is over there"  pointing to some random stretch of hallway that looks exactly like the random stretch of hallway that I am standing in.  And she said it in a tone that implied I should have known that.  I said, half joking "you should put a line on the floor so people will know" and she replied, in all seriousness, somewhat impatiently, "that's where the bakers walk" (again in a "you should know that" tone).  I said coldly "I don't come here often enough to be familiar with the walking patterns of your bakers" and she went off in a huff.  Mind you, after I moved at her direction, I kept having staff push past me, so it appears she just made up "this is where people waiting for the bathroom are supposed to stand" (I mean, what are the odds that they had a staff meeting about it and decided on some imaginary patch of floor where people were supposed to wait for the bathroom?).  Moral of story - they have staffers who go out of their way to put down customers.  And by the way? where I started out was *less* trafficked than where she put me.  After I moved I not only had staffers brushing past me, I had customers with dirty dishes trying to buss them.

I think that this is hands down one of the best places in the city.  The ham and gruyere croissant and the coconut cream pie are my favorites.  Anytime I have friends or family in from out of town, I bring them here to have the experience.  We suffer in line (well worth it), get our food to go, and then bring it up to the top of the hill at Dolores Park.  By doing this not only do I avoid being cramped into a small space, but I also have a great view of the city while I enjoy my food.  My eyes seriously roll in the back of my head while I am eating the food.  It's amazing!

Tartine bakery is worth waiting in line for on a Sunday if you have your heart set on good coffee and decadent pastries that rival those in the best patisseries in France.  (Go ahead French Yelpers, bring on the  deluge of protests.)  The aroma of the place will keep you hypnotized as you stand in line.  (Actually, the line moves pretty quickly. ) Tartine offers a few savory items, such as the best, most delicate, tastiest quiche in the universe.  The croque was a little over the top:  too big, too thick, too hard.  In fact, everything is grotesquely super-sized, to satisfy that American sense of plenty.  The indulgence is compounded by the temptation to order two items, one savory and one sweet, because it's ever so hard to decide what to order.  It's all just so dreamy.

Five stars for the food. Tried the ham/cheese croissant which was supremely buttery and flaky like a proper French croissant , the olive bread which was rich with blended cheese and olives, and one of their mini pies. The pie's crust was praiseworthy. The coconut cream filling was a little less divine but maybe that was because I was comparing it to the Dahlia Lounge in Seattle which makes the world's best coconut cream pie.  Prices at this bakery are quite high.

i came here with two friends on a Friday afternoon, so luckily there wasn't too much of a line. after trying the food, i can now say i'm glad there wasn't a long wait, b/c i'd be seriously pissed to have waited an hour for the food here. i sampled several items (i don't come to the city very often, and wanted to take advantage of the short line) to to test the range of the stuff offered here. - banana cream tart: pretty good a little overpriced (you can get similar for less at other cafes), but fairly large and tasty enough. the pastry encasing the bananas and cream was weirdly hard though, had to break out a knife and fork to cut through it---and i had to work at it too, it wasn't a simple slice job. - bread pudding: ok kind of disappointed to see them scoop it out of a giant basin, just didn't seem as appetizing as getting something fresh made to order. but i can understand that the high turnover demand of this place makes doing that impossible, especially given the popularity of this dish. honestly though i didn't care for it (why do people rave about it?); it was pretty soggy, looked like a hot mess, and the texture was like muffin soaked in water---so dense with moisture it starts to disintegrate into mush. flavorwise, it was decent, but nothing special. - morning bun: not good overly crispy, i want to describe it as being too well-done? i thought it'd be softer getting further in, but no, it was barely chewy. mostly just hard and crunchy. flavor was ok, again, nothing special. didn't taste much of the orange and cinnamon, mostly just sugary sweet. - chocolate croissant: not good like the morning bun, too well-done. really crispy, almost crunchy. not very chewy. i like croissants that are rich and buttery (which this was) but also soft and chewy, where it pulls apart easily in your hands and the flaky outer layers are delicate enough to melt in your mouth. i also didn't like the chocolate they used, the sign just said was some type of imported chocolate; i should've checked that it wasn't dark chocolate. - croque monsieur: decent just a solidly filling dish. a single, large piece of bread, with ham, gruyere and sundried tomatoes (the overall taste was very similar to pizza). disappointing that this also wasn't made fresh to order, but re-warmed in the oven, though palatable enough. the pickled carrot it came with was a little weird though---very sour, almost citrusy. - spicy turkey sandwich: not bad my friend ordered this, and it took a pretty long time (they did warn her that it would take around 15 min to make); we'd almost finished our croque monsieurs by the time her dish finally came out. it was HUGE though, looked like one sandwich plus an extra half. taste was solid, no remote spiciness at all though, and really oily. overall, not impressed. this place is nice enough, but i could never stand the wait that's typical of this place----it just isn't worth it. you could get pastries at many other places (after all SF is abundant with great cafes) that are just as good, for similar or less prices, and much less of a wait. ultimately, it's good if you happen to be in the neighborhood, there isn't a line, and you fancy a quick sweet (id go with the banana cream tart if anything. their other tarts looked promising though). otherwise, can't say it's worth the time you'd spend looking for parking (if you don't muni) and waiting in line (if you can't come in on an off-hour weekday).

This place is the spot for the banana cream pie!  They take it up 10 notches by coating the pie crust with chocolate and caramel before adding bananas and whip cream and then topping it off with chocolate shavings! It is a beauty and a great dessert to bring to parties.   I've also oogled their gorgeous slices of cake and tried the coconut passionfruit cake this past December with a friend.  Delicious filling and I hope you like dried coconut too! The place usually has a quick line that stretches out the door and the scramble for a coveted outdoor or indoor seat is fierce.  I have seen dishes passed through windows and the partner strategy (one in line, one scouting out seats) is the best way to go :)

Everything I have ever had at Tartine is simply to die for!!!  Try a classic croissant, chocolate croissant, quiche or morning bun for buttery, flaky, rich, decadent goodness...but my absolute fav is the Coconut Cream Tart!!  Flakes of toasted coconut top rich coconut cream and sits on a bed of caramel and chocolate covered buttery tart crust.  SUBLIME!  Makes my mouth water just thinking about it... (I have been told that the Banana Cream Tart is very similar - same caramel and chocolate tart base but with a banana cream topping).

Love, love, love their bread and croissants. The bread is amazing, just have to order it before 3 and hopefully remember to pick it up before they close (though once we forgot and picked it up 15 minutes late, super friendly about that). We've tried all their breads and they are huge and delicious, worth the $7 price tag. Croissants are the flakiest and tastiest we've had yet, a little pricey compared to other places, but worth it still (considering they use organic ingredients and ultra delicious). One downfall, lack of vegetarian lunch options, I mean there are a few and they are awesome, but being a vegetarian more options would really rock. Also since so popular hard to go on the weekends.

Visiting from South Carolina and this place was on my list to check out...was warned there would be a line, but it moved very quickly and besides, isn't a line always a great sign?!  Got the infamous morning bun and loved it.  I am a huge bread pudding fan so i tried the apple brioche bread pudding, and though it was indeed good, it was too "eggy" for me.  Next time I am trying the lemon meringue - it looks perfect!  A definite go-to bakery in San Francisco!

A friend of mine recommended me this bakery saying that they have the best quiche and their line i always long and a lot of their pastries is gone by afternoon. So i went there with another friend of mine on a Monday at around noon. The place is pretty decent and there are people on most of the table there. But the line is not that long, there were just 2-3 people in front of us. We tried their quiche, scone and some other pastries which i don't remember the name. They are not as good as my friend has described.it's just okayyy, comparable to many other bakeries that i've tried.

Almond croissant was delicious.  The line was out the door and around the block when we arrived on a Friday morning (all in all a half hour wait to order), but it was definitely worth it.  The coffee service was a bit slow, but the delicious food made us soon forget about our wait!

I love everything about Tartine.  The quaint French bistro-like atmosphere, the incredibly yummy breads, sweets, quiches, etc., and I feel very at home in SF when I tote my Tartine items to Dolores Park for some people watching.  Of course, the place is small and the chances are somewhat slim you'll get a table, the line is usually fairly long, and parking is really hard to come by!  But when you taste that croissant or morning bun or delicious bread pudding, those worries will immediately be a thing of the past.  Butter isn't used sparingly at Tartine so I wouldn't go every day, but I would definitely try it out - you won't regret it.

My favorite bakery.  Anywhere.  In the world.   And in my favorite bakery, nothing compares with the frangipane croissant which is crunchy, flaky, sweet, nutty, sticky, and buttery all in the same glorious bite.  The morning bun is in the SF Big Eat list (ie, Top100 foods of the city), and for good reason.  Anything with that much butter and sugar must be incredible.  The sweet breads are dense but moist, and like pretty much everything else here..... buttery. But the beauty of a 10am visit is that you not only get one of the best pastries in America (here, you must understand I am not at all exaggerating), but you can also pick up a sandwich or croque monsieur for lunch.  I haven't tried a sandwich yet that I wouldn't rate highly, but the pecorino almond sandwich has these hints of sage and lemon that will blow your mind (ok, here I might be exaggerating just a bit).  The croque is available monsieur (w/ meat) or madame (w/ vegetables only), but either way, the fresh country bread, bechamel sauce, and lightly browned gruyere provide the perfect base. 5 stars for the bakery, 4 for the coffee bar which has always been good for me, but never great.  Coffee aside, I find the baristas here a little kooky-- talking to themselves and rocking as they gently pour the drinks.  Literally, this has been the case with like four different baristas-- are they trained to do this? And ever so briefly, I must comment on the lovely bathroom.  It always has fragrant and fresh flowers, not to mention clean surfaces, which you can't say for every public bathroom in the Mission, now can you? To close, I'm reading a lot of controversy over The Line. My take:  What line? This is a well-executed structure for giving the hungry customer enough time to make a thought-out decision about just how many friands, bars, sweet bread slices, croissants, etc. she's going to take home this time. These are difficult choices, people, especially when EVerything you see is delicious and perfectly done.  Were there no line, I would probably still stand between the bakery case and register for 15 minutes.

My friend recommended that I come here and I obliged when I was walking through the Mission. I wasn't disappointed - in terms of both its reputation of trendy hipsters frequenting its premises and the quality of their bread. After a somewhat lengthy wait in line, I got a morning bun and a frangipane tart. I hope they didn't make the morning bun in the morning because it was late afternoon when I went there. Nevertheless even if they did, I wasn't able to tell since it tasted anything but stale. While the morning bun was more simple in taste, kind of like a delicious cinnamon roll lacking in frosting and cinnamon (I know... bad analogy), the frangipane tart was bursting with berry and almond flavor. Well worth the wait and the price. Next time I come I'll be more prepared in some trendy hipster clothes.

I just do not understand the high ratings for this place.  Even some of my friends rave about it.  The Croque-monsieur on 1st visit was burnt, I mean seriously black, on the entire bottom as were all the baked sandwiches.  2nd visit, the highly acclaimed bread pudding was very soggy with a layer of water on the bottom.  3rd visit the brownies my friend raves about, no better than any other bakery.  My friends keep telling me I must have gone on a bad day... but 3 random bad days?  I give up.

I have been hearing about Tartine's fantastic breads for years and decided to trot over to pick up a loaf. I chose the walnut bread and headed home with visions of toast with butter in my head. I got home, got out the toaster and sliced open the bread and....to my horror it had huge holes throughout. You couldn't put butter or jam on it without having a plate full of slosh. The flavor was mediocre. What a disappointment. All this for $8.75!/loaf. My sens is that either it was loaded with too much yeast to  speed up the rising process (which ruins the quality of the bread) or it wasn't allowed to rise twice to improve the quality of the bread with small compact holes.  On the other hand, their croissants are, in my opinion, to die for.

This is my first review on yelp. Never felt the need to up until now. I'll get the good out of the way first. The morning bun is one of the most amazing pastries I've ever had......perfect!  The scone is the most delicious scone I've tried. Besides those two delectable items, there is no other reason to go. Everything else I've tried has been below par. If this is supposed to be a French bakery, I suggest the owner visit France again. In France the croissants are not served burnt. The same for the cookies. I do not understand the hype. It's as if the customers have been brainwashed. The absolute worst part of the experience is the service. Some of the staff have this attitude as if it is an honor to be there. Excuse me, I am the customer. And the set up they have of making you wait in line forever is just mean. Never going back.

This place blows -- DO NOT come here, especially when I'm in line, or trying to secure a table for myself and a friend.  Because I will burn you with my stink-eye when you stamp out my hopes of spending the morning at a Tartine table on a weekend.  (It has never happened yet, by the way.) Truthfully, the best time to go is on a weekday morning.  I used to live around the corner, thankfully, so I'd frolic over to Tartine for their hot chocolate and a Goujere au fromage!  I'd giggle all the way to BART, too, clutching my bag of special treats.

This place does not need another review but.... I can't help but say good things about this tiny bakery in mission dolores area.  Saturday morning... 11:30 AM -- parking wasn't that bad actually.. park above dolores park much easier than mission area.  Stood in line for about 20 minutes then got really lucky and a group was leaving so we did get their table right away.  We ordered a panini, morning bun and lemon cream tart to share amongst 3 people.   Everything was of utmost quality.  The morning bun was not sticky but flaky and crunchy.  Light but buttery at the same time.  The panini was ok, very rich I wasn't digging the meat cause it was a bit heavy/salty the pesto was brocolli pesto and quite unique.  They cut it into 3 pieces for us too so that was really an extra nice step. Next time I would like to try the croque monsieur.. looked awesome.  Lastly.. the heavenly dreamy fluffy creamy decadent lemon cream tart.  Pure delectable goodness on the inside, perfect thin tart crust, perfect whipped cream on top.  Before we started I bet that with all that food under our belt, we wouldnt be able to finish the tart.. it was gone within 5 minutes.  Split the sandwiches and morning pastrys/desert and you're tab won't be as high..  $5-10 bucks for breakfast/brunch. =)

with over 400 reviews, i'm sure tartine doesn't need another, but i'd figure i'd post one for my socal peeps. i visited tartine on a friday afternoon, and didn't have to deal with the madness i assume most people encounter on the weekends. got the croque monsieur with smoked niman ranch ham. i feared that this open faced sandwich may be too cheesy-greasy, but it was delicious. the bechamel added a great dimension of flavor and creaminess to the gruyere cheese. the ham was smokey and tender.  the country bread is spiked with all those great flavors. the lemon cream tart i got for dessert was spot on with the sweet-tart balance. creamy, runny citrus ooze in a buttery shell, topped with kumquat marmalade. yum. great, great place, if you don't have to deal with the hordes of others that find tartine a jewel of a place as well.

i admit, this is a place i found through yelp because it would always pop up on the sides, or the city's top picks ... i give this a 3 (WAIT! let me FINISH!) because i haven't really FULLY experienced tartine like the rest of the yelpers, or maybe it is just a 3 and i'm just schizo with my taste buds ... but yea, i'm willing to come back to pick up a sammie, and their cake, but for a quick grab -- 3 it is ... as a planner, i have a habit of buying a few munchies either the day prior or the day OF depending on how much time i have, so i have something to nibble on the plane or car ride... i heart pastries ... and tartine was definitely one of those places i promised myself that i should try before anything.... if you peek at the photos the others have uploaded, it pretty much explains itself... the LINE IS long, even at 8am... i couldn't believe it, but don't let that fool you. the line is long because it's one of those lines you pick and choose and leave. there are minimal tables ... line doesn't move quite fast though, even though, they have 3 friendly people who are assisting you and another 2 who is ringing you up. i'm going to blame it on the patrons. damn you! the best tip i can give you is to grab a menu when you get there or possibly ask someone you came with or not, to hold the line while you scope out the goodies, that way you can have a mental note of what is what.. or one of you grab a table or something. come on, be efficient! =D of course, this place has reserved a soft spot as a tourist trap so 9/10 folks are NOT locals... if i hadn't taken an early flight for the morning, i would've gotten their infamous hot pressed sammies, but they only have those at 12pm.  if they were smart like Paul Maison in FL (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) i think i'd have grabbed a sammie for me to go, but then again, i guess i can't really compare it because it was late afternoon when i was inside the bakery at miami, while here, i came pretty early ... but just simply stating the concept, having a sammie ready to go ....booo... i only got something small, just enough to fill my tummi for an hour or two, so it wasn't no feast. c'mon, im going to LA, i have to save my fat ass appetite! presentation? very fresh, and precise and extremely simple. i hear they use organic flour, so that's a plus. prices vary from $2.50 and up ... i guess that's average ... but anywys, i bought 2 morning buns that had cinnimon and raisin which were simply hollow on the inside, with no taste, but good. their vanilla eclair was good, but my eclair at t. keller's bakery was to die for ... i'd have gotten myself a tart or a slice of cake, but i'm only on the plane for an hour! i like how most of their items can be bought individually or as a whole, but then again, it IS a bakery... tartine is a place that seems a BIT overly hyped with the line and all, but it is a place, i wouldn't mind coming back for a 2nd chance. oh, and i hear they even have a sister restaurant called bar tartine for the night owls, so perhaps...

The other day, a Saturday, the line outside(!) Tartine was 28 deep... and growing. Nothing is that good. For all of us who live nearby Tartine is strictly weekday, early afternoon kind of fare because at "peak times" the line might actually be further back than your doorway. And then what? Then it dawns on you that you're waiting in line for the alchemy of butter, flour, and sugar behind the most obnoxious morning crowd south of Bugaloos, and below Noe.  Tartine is good, but people, People! While you're waiting for your morning buns or whatever, when ordinary people (who may be hungover) try to walk past, and you're crowding the sidewalk three and four abreast like suburban moms in the mall, can  we dispense with the dirty looks? I'm just trying to get by. And one last thing. The women who work there are angels. Fucking angels I tell you. If only for putting up with a clientele that puts on its smug sense of entitlement right after the fleece and crocs.

Tartine Bakery is my BUTTER HEAVEN. I come to San Francisco just to get a taste of their decadent, flaky, Morning Buns glazed with a deliciously sweet orange glaze. Other must haves are almond, chocolate, and regular croissants. Those things are the most outrageously big croissants ever! They should be outlawed for being oh-so addictive and good. And let's not forget their bread. By far the best bread. Tartine has perfected the art of making bread. The bread is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and immediately when you take your first bite and you hear that satisfying "crunch" you know that can only mean one thing: it's Tartine bread. Although I hate the Tartine lines, it is always worth the wait in the end.

Mmm, Tartine... It's so small for such a well-known and popular place, hence the line going out the door. According to my friend, that wasn't even that long of a line. We were there at about 10:30, so probably between the regular breakfast and lunch crowds. The wait was OK with me, as it gave me time to drool over the pastry case and peruse the menu. We ordered the wild mushroom Croque Monsieur (accompanied by two intriquingly spicy pickled carrots), ham and tomato quiche, and the brioche bread pudding with berries, along with a couple of coffees. You pay at the counter and take your number to a table and they bring out the food to you. We ended up sitting at a communal table, but that was cool; it felt like I was at a friend's place or something. Everything was extremely delicious--can't find fault with any of the items we got. I don't know how they make their quiche, but the egg part was so silky and smooth! It was an awesome breakfast. I just wish it wasn't so cramped in there, but that's the price you pay. They also ask that you bus your own tables, but that's not a big deal. I also dug the artwork on display--no safe little pretty pictures just because it's a cafe. There were these cool giant paper cutouts of rather ghoulish-looking humanoids hanging from the ceiling (see my photo) as well as various works on paper all over the place. I forgot the name of the artist, but I really liked his work. One of the many great places I got to visit during my time in SF.

The best eclair I have ever had! The best lemon tart I have ever had!  The best morning bun, the best croissant with jambon y Gruyere.....  You get the picture.  Everything they offer at Tartine is the finest example of its kind, and that is why it gets a full 5 stars.  The only downside is that there is never any seating due to its enormous popularity.  Dolores park is right around the corner, so I usually just take my food to go and eat it at the park.  Picnicking at my favorite people watching spot can hardly be considered a downside.

When you think Tartine, you think, amazing looking space, gorgeous cases filled with amazing desserts, writer of a fabulous cookbook and a friendly atmosphere. Well, when you actually get here you you are met with a drab looking entrance, and a claustrophobic, unremarkable space. The desserts are pleasantly displayed but are among the worst I've ever had in my life. A quick breakdown of what we had. 1) Tres Leches Cake. I don't want to pull the Yelp cliche "I've had better at (insert name of chain)" but....... I really have had waaaaay better Tres Leches cake at my local random mexican bakery. This one's super light and airy, reminiscent of tiramisu. A light, coconutty, un-tres leches-y slice of nothing. 2) Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Walnut Cookie. Extremely thin, Pepperidge Farm consistency. Not good. Not rich. Not even worth writing about. 3) Buttermilk Scone. I know some Bisquick when I taste it. Had some currants in it. Tasteless. How is it possible to make such a flavorless scone? The worst. The cashier was aloof and awful. All in all Tartine is among the worst bakery experiences I've had. What are these people thinking? Are there any repeat customers here? My Tartine cookbook, which never actually inspired me to bake anything from it, is going in the thrift store heap!

I have to say the only dealing I've had is ordering a cake from this establishment that was to be delivered to their restaurant down the street and around the corner for a birthday.   Apparently the restaurant 'suggests' you get a specialty dessert from the bakery for a special celebration, yet they don't deliver.  (Go figure!)  My real complaint is with the so-called "manager" who has no social or managerial skills or idea of what following-up with a customer means.  It took 20 phone calls, several voice mails, and 1 week to get a live person on the phone to order 1 birthday cake.  Even then, the "manager" couldn't get her facts straight before berating a paying customer to confirm an order.   I just hope the food at the restaurant is worth the hassle at the bakery.   I would definitely DO NOT DEAL WITH THE IGNORANT MANAGER AGAIN, Deal with Thalia.  She gets what customer service really means.

Upon walking in, my gaze quickly shifted from the varied assortment of pastries and desserts to the croque monsieur- huge slabs of rustic bread topped with ham, and eggs- amazing looking! I should have followed my first instinct and ordered one, but instead felt like I should order a dessert. This was, after all, a bakery. I settled upon a cup of coffee and a big slice of the tres leches cake. I was hoping for something more similar to the tres leches cake I used to love during my youth in Chile, but what I ended up with in Tartine Bakery was a fancy version of what I was expecting.  Don't get me wrong, it was really good but I think some things are better left alone, in their original form. However, my boyfriend ordered the frangipan, a beautiful pastry with almonds. We both agreed the price was a bit high, but he said the frangipan was delicious and unlike anything he had ever had in his life. The coffee was good too. I think I need to go back and order something else at Tartine. Maybe next time I will try the croque monsieur that originally caught my eye or one of their chocolate cakes, which I imagine must be amazing.

i suppose this is the place to go for all the foodies out there seeking for that ultimate bakery experience. well, i don't consider myself a foodie and i don't think tartine is all that. it's a good place to satisfy your sugar craving, but i won't get on my knees and start praying in front of the temple of tartine like some are inclined to do. if anything, it's the coffee that gets my attention. nevertheless, tartine is my destination whenever i have out-of-towners. it seems to make their day, and that makes me happy.

spontaneous drive from milpitas to san francisco right after work just to try this place. i got to say its worth the drive.  took us awhile to find parking, we parked like 3 blocks away. when we got there they didnt have much of the pastry or tarts left. i wanted to try the lemon cream tart but they ran out of slices. i got a ham hot pressed sandwich which was very very yummy. the little bit of dijon mustard gave it a flavor contrast. i also tried the quiche which was really good when i heated it back up and the prosciutto hot pressed sandwich and a piece of short bread and a scone. everything was really yummy. the sandwiches were hot and fresh. we left very satisfied and for all that we spent only 23 dollars. good enough for me!

Despite the complaints about the crowd, they really do have the best croissants in the city, especially the chocolate ones (flaky and oozy). The bread is delicious as well. I also love the open face sandwiches that are served with hot pickled carrots. The desserts are good but baked a bit dark for my taste. I prefer a rich golden color to my pastries rather than a dark chestnut color, but I like the rustic style and the classic flavor components and the use of fresh seasonal fruit. I have been treated nicely every time I go but sometimes the wait is outrageous. If you go, make sure to meet a friend and be ready for a leisure time. This is not the place for the morning rush hour crowd. Go on a nice day when you have nothing else to do but sit and eat rather than an average day of burning your mouth on coffee as you run out the door for work, otherwise you'll just get  frustrated and you won't apprieciate the beauty of a well made pastry.

So basically my mother won't let me come home unless I bring her something from Tartine. Last time I went home I got yelled at because I didn't think to bring an extra loaf of bread for my grandma. The lemon merengue cake smoothed things over pretty nicely though. Some people have complained that the staff is rude and that there is always a long line. I have never found the staff to be rude - it just seems to me that they want to move the line along as quickly as possible, which I have absolutely no problem with. And duh, the place is popular. There is going to be a long line. And guess what. It's going to be even more popular now that the idiots from the New York Times had to write an article in this week's travel section. Stay out of my bakery, tourists. I was pretty scared that the place was going straight to hell once my mother found their cookbook, but despite the publicity,  they have not gotten lazy and maintained (as far as I can tell) their position as the best bakery in SF.

I used to love this place...until I tried to get a WHOLE 15 scones put in a box before I picked them up. I guess that was too much to ask for because they said I needed to ask three days in advance! I'm sorry, what was I thinking asking for such a huge request - to put scones in a box before they are picked up? All I have to say is terrible customer service. It's not like I was trying to order six dozen scones with no notice. It's unfortunate that the customer service is what left a bad taste in my mouth.

So! I woke up this morning, a brand New Year and decided to go for a bit of an adventure - trek over to the mission and have a double chocolate valrohna croissant (or pain au chocolat) some of their organic coffee and a piece of quiche to go for lunch later... I had gone to Tartine when it first opened years ago and thought it was "o.k." but since then it has won a number of awards and I saw a clip on the Food channel about their pain au chocolat...and thought I have to try this again!  I had put this off for about 6 months but today was the day.  Yes there was a line - but no biggie as long as the food warrants the wait.  Ordered my pain au chocolat, a piece of chard chantrelle quiche and a cappucino.   Are you ready?  Yes, indeed the pain au chocolat was light, obviously had a lot of butter and chocolate - but was completely, and I mean completely tasteless.  I don't know if they left out the salt or they just think the fact that it's high quality chocolate that it should do the trick but trust me quality chocolate that is tasteless doesn't cut it -  I have spent a lot of time in France including a year living in Paris and 22+ years in San Francisco, and not only do I know my chocolate but I also know my pain au chocolat...this was so mediocre I didn't even finish it.  I kept taking a bite hoping it would get better, that I would taste something other than buttery pastry with a chocolate tasteless goo but had no luck.  And a note on the cappucino I ordered?  No foam - what kind of cappucino is just milk and espresso - yes, it was smooth but if I had wanted a latte I would have ordered a latte.   The quiche?  It was o.k. but nothing compared to the very light oh so delicious quiche at Castagna on Chestnut and Fillmore - a new authentic French bistro owned and run by two French brothers (one a chef).   I am writing their review next given I have visited this restarurant 4 times in the last month.  Tartine? Just not the best experience all around but glad I went and got it out of my system :).   By the way Roses Cafe at Union and Steiner has very tasty  pain au chocolat  if you are in the mood....Roses will be my go to spot in the future for a pain au chocolat craving.

Just because its reviewed over 2,000 times doesn't mean I shouldn't review it some more right? Needless to say this place in INCREDIBLE good coffee great pastries...its making me crave coconut and dark chocolate tarts just thinking about it. I can see myself going crazy one day and driving up from L.A. just to go grab another tart. I think the only downers here were the long lines, limited seating, and the long wait for our food to come out, but with the kind of pastries they make its worth the wait. The  pastries were all pre-made so we got those at the counter, we had the coconut tart and the bread pudding. the bread pudding was luke warm, mushy, and wet. I could tell it was probably good an hour ago, but it became very bland once it got cold. The coffee was yum although it kind of sucked sitting outside because all these little flecks of pollution kept falling into my coffee which leaves me to believe it wasn't just in my coffee and actually in pretty much everything i ingested...bleh. Anyway im digressing, it took 30 minutes for my panini's to come out but boy was it worth it! (because it took so long they ended comp'ing another one of anything on the menu, but i chose another coconut tart thing even though it was cheap because it was just SOOO GOOD). I had the best and probably only backwards meal I have ever had and it was all at this amazing bakery. S.F.'ers are so lucky to have places like this in their city...COME DOWN TO L.A. WHERE ITS WARM AND OPEN ME A TARTINE BAKERY please =)

i would say if you can score a seat, the dining experience feels quiant and lovely. otherwise it feels claustraphobic and crowded. tartine is overflowing with a buttery goodness aroma... i would recommend one of their sandwiches for a heartier meal. I had the shitake open faced sandwich and my friends had the pastrami and spicy turkey. I think pastrami was better than the spicy turkey. otherwise a chocolate croissant + one of those giant latte bowls = one amazing breakfast.

The last time i was in san fran, i dint find out about Tartine until the last day i was there.  So this time i had planned to visit Tartine at least twice on my four day trip.  I had previously only tried their baked goods so i was curious how their sandwiches would be.  They have a selection of about 6 to 8 types.  Their bread doesnt come out until about 4 because it is full with morning pastries during the day.  The loaves sell out quick, we bought one for $7.  The sandwiches utilizes their amazing fresh baked bread.  For 11.25 we had the mozzarella and tapendade sandwich.  The cheese was so gooey and stretchy and paired with the saltiness of the nicoise olives and the anchovies, it was scrumptious.  We also had the chocolate croissant, which was huge and flaky, definitely serves 2.  They bake really pretty cakes and you can buy them whole or by the slice.  For 5 dollars we had a slice of the lemon cake with meringue, so good.  I think anyone can tell that a place that has over 2000 Yelps must be Legit, and Tartine is no exception.

I heard good things about this bakery from 5 people. "Oh you gotta try Tartine it's sooooo goooooood!"  One day I went there to buy a birthday cake for my sweetie. I got the choclatyiestesssesese looking cake in the glass. My ankles started hurting from waiting in the long line. The shit looked good in there. I'm sure it's good but the cake I got was so damn choclateeeeeeeeeee that it was like biting into a 6 inch thick dark chocolate block with no bread. A tiny sliver of this cake was enough to go WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! EHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Give me some water or milk or both! Fuck! Put some cake in there. I'm sure 99% of the pastries are good, but avoid the chocolate bomb cake. The one that requires heating up the knife to cut it. It's litterally like a gigantic soft chocolate bar with almost zero cake in it. I give it four stars because the cash register there is gonna explode or blow circuits.

Wow! They aren't joking when they say it's crowded.We stopped in today around 11-ish thinking we'd be there right after the breakfast, but before the lunch crowd. I mean reallly...Isn't everyone at work by then. Boy were we wrong. The line was still out the door, but the line moved pretty fast. Just fast enough to keep you interested but slow enough for you to figure out what you want to get. And trust me, you will need the extra thinking time. It was my first trip there but I had several friends who frequent the place so I was pretty sure what I was going to get before I stepped in the door. Of course that all went out the window when I saw all the other buttery, sweet and flaky options. We finally decided on the coconut cream pie and the ham croque monsieur. The opened faced sandwich was one of the best things I've tasted in a long time. I'm not even sure how to describe all of it's savory glory. The bread was thick and held up great considering it was smothered in a creamy béchamel sauce, and then was topped with sliced ham and tomatoes. there might have been other things on it but it was hard to make out as it was flying into my mouth. After the sandwich we jumped right into the Coconut Cream pie. It was  even more mouth pleasing than the sandwich (if that's even possible). The crust was flaky and the bottom was lined with a generous layer of chocolate and caramel. The coconut cream filling was smooth, rich and velvety (none of those shredded coconut flakes mixed in) and tasted exactly like fresh coconut cream. Considering we were eating in the car and forgot to bring utensils it was quite a feat getting that gooey, fluffy, flaky little morsel down without making a mess, but I didn't want to lose one once of that yummy goodness. Don't worry ...it all made it in safely and no crumbs were wasted.

goddddd i was really going to up this to five stars because every pastry, desert and even the guyere bread puff (gugere?) are phenomenal, but then i had had to get pushy and try the pressed sandwich for over 10$ and it was tasty IFFFFF you first squeezed out the oil and wanted to light a thousand oil lamps for 10 years with it.  stay away from the pecorino almond sandwich, but i guess i gotta say it's made well but only if you want to eat more oil than bread or cheese or almonds.  but because the pastries are so f'ing fantastic and amazing, i still love this place.  (obviously it doesn't  need said that the lines are a pain in the ass, but that really is irrelevant by now).

I am so over Tartine. I used to go all the time, and stuff my face full of bread pudding and hot pressed sandwiches and croques and gougeres and pain au jambon and lemon merangue cake. All at the same time. No more. While, yes, everything is delicious, any trip to Tartine is now more hassle than it is enjoyable. This place has gotten too big for its britches. The trouble starts before you even walk through the door, becuase the line is so long that it goes out the door and wraps around the side of the store. The line moves slowly because the staff is too cute to work. My favorite Tartine employee is the wafily incompetent "Quaaludes Girl," who at rush hour on a Saturday had no clue what the quiche was. Customers are subject to the harsh and bizarre whims of the employees. Perhaps you'd like a pressed sandwich? Not until the pressed sandwich guy is "ready," a state with no bearing whatsoever to the time listed on the menu or the signage on the counter. And he gets mad if you ask him when he'll be "ready." Oy. Since I'm not one of those magic San Franciscans who doesn't have a job, I can only go to Tartine on the weekends. Which I now refuse to. Do yourself a favor and go next door to Bi Rite instead and get a sandwich and eat it in the park. That way you won't have to freeze at one of Tartine's outside tables on the shady side of the street, which are so busy you'll never get to sit down anyway.

This non-descript little bakery/cafe offers decent coffee and beautiful French pastries, among other things that keep patrons hanging around for hours. Seating is pretty limited. I secretly hope that people would just finish eating and move along... Today was my lucky day! I parked right out front, didn't have to wait in a long line, and I snagged the last almond croissant, the best croissant ever by the way. It had tons of almond filling. I have never seen so many almond slivers packed into one croissant before. Awesome! Someday I'll get around to trying a Panini.

I think I came at the wrong time of day.  After seeing all the pictures posted on Yelp, I know that they sold out of all their specialty treats.  Maybe I'll come back another time to try the morning bun and banana cream pie.  Since I couldn't find anything, I bought a Gougere (i.e. bread with thyme and black pepper), but it didn't taste good because the pepper was too strong and the inner texture was interesting--kind of flaky.  I ordered an oatmeal cookie with raisins and orange peel, but it was ok.  It is very small for a $.75 cookie.

Terrible service.      PS. I was coming here 3 times a week! clearly making them at least $120 dollars a month...which stopped immediately after I just decided, I might give away my comfort (busy, loud, no place to sit) for the food, but never loss of respect to myself for their attitude.bye bye. I kept it going until the the last straw. No matter how good the food can be, I'm the customer, is my money, I'm paying and for a business to be GREAT needs to #1 have great service. #1.  For the price I'm paying and the ambiance I'm getting (no where to sit, I have to wait 15 minutes to order and then another 15 minutes to get my food) You know what?  YOU BUSS MY TABLE. Yes, I get it, you're great and WE must accommodate to you, but you are also super wealthy and make thousands of dollars, so just pay your staff more or hire someone else to buss our table. #2. You better know the names or else!.... the will look at you as if you're out of this world. seriously. --not only know them but PRONOUNCE  them right.  Yes, one time, I try to order something new (French name) and I could not pronounce it, she just stand there saying "what?" "what?" .... not tried to at least move to where items where so I could point... very arrogant attitude. You feel rushed, you order sandwiches only at the front and other coffee (except house coffee) at the other side, if you are new you might figure this out when you been waiting for 10 min on that long line!. I understand that they are busy and these girls work really really hard, I understand. But we "the customers" the people who pay for your check..want to have an enjoyable day with our coffee and your delicious pastry and no matter how tired or busy you might be, you should treat every customer as if they are NEW to your place (because many people are) and not treat them as if you're doing them a favor, no matter how good and popular your place is. When I came with my mom, it was the same thing, she's 60 years old and never been here, of course I raved about your things...but she could not decide...there are so many things and the counter girl seemed annoyed when we did not know what when she asked..and no..I'm not going to the back of the line, Please just wait 1 min!... #3 you better order 1 or 2 items only (unless you been here so many times that you know the names of all!) because the line is long, once you start getting to the front you might be past the section you're ordering and then, you might not remember the names! sounds simple, but they are not accommodating, the seem rushed, you have to go back and check the names of things to go back and tell her...(I was ordering 5 different types of cookies) and she would not help..instead she gave me this attitude, did not at least try to move a *little* to the cookie section so I could point or tell her...Geesh she's behind the counter and can easily move.   I said " Mexican Cookie" and two other more... she repeated back.. "Wedding Cookie" and the two other more...  well...I don't work here..I have not memorized the names...so I'm confused... I go back and check.. and it saids " Mexican wedding cookie" ..Ok!... Big deal!.. so I go back and say, yes, the "Mexican cookie" and she saids. "THATS WHAT I SAID"...... what?   she said "wedding cookie" and that's sure to confuse a person...but is not big deal, why did she make me go back and check when she could just explained is the same one or the entire name. I'm ordering 5 different types, I have not been here enough times to memorized the names of your things!... Well...This woman THREW MY BOX...yes! maybe she things I didn't see her...but I did...she was suppose to put the box with cookies somewhere so the girl in the cash register could ring me up and give me the box... I saw when this woman threw the box! and said something to her coworker...... #4 Normally, no where to sit.   So you bought a coffee and a sandwich or a pastry? well you have to wait 15 minutes or eat standing. If you come with family or friends...so annoying that theres no where to sit. Enjoy while it lasts, nothing lasts forever. The day will come when a new Pastry store opens up with a much bigger space and better customer service.

theres always a long line of people, theres no ac, and hardly any tables (youre probably going to sweat up a storm while waiting in line). but damn, theyve got the BEST quiches out there. their pressed sandwiches are really good and the bread pudding.. mmm my favorite!

Okay, good. It was not bad. Really. But I mean do we need a bakery in the Mission where people stand in a line OUT the fucking door for 20 minutes just to get a damn pastry? I mean isn't that the Marina. As I've said in other reviews, this whole damn street is so yuppie with Bi-Rite, Delfina, and Tartine. We don't need this. The only place you should have to stand in line for a freaking piece of sweet bread is West LA and we aren't there.

There was a day when I had a hankering for a yummy panini from Tartine for breakfast but was in Hayes Valley. Whoa! there's a Tartine (the blue awning simply says Tartine) that I spied as I biked away from Blue Bottle Coffee. However, after checking it out, alas, not the same as my beloved Tartine Bakery on 18th and Guerrero. (the blue awning-ed place is some other establishment completely unrelated to Tartine Bakery or Bar Tartine). Yes, nothing compares to my usual selection of either a sopressata/broccoli rabe pesto/asiago panini garnished with spicy pickled baby carrots (those I save for last, they are DEEElirshus) OR a ham and cheese croque monsieur. For sweets, a myriad of options await but I tend to gravitate towards either the bread pudding (a bowl if I am feeling ravenous), the lemon tart, lemon bar, sticky buns or chocolate puddin. Wash that all down with a lovely double latte or glass of red. And if you're lucky enough to be there Sunday to Wednesday shortly after 5, then go get yourself a loaf or two of heavenly Tartine bread (the walnut or country loaves are fabulous, but then again, so is the olive loaf).  C'est magnifique!

I love this place...maybe more than my friends!  I used to make frequent visits here because it was on the way home from school.  Before you go I want to warn you about the lines here.  Be ready to wait for about 10 minutes on the weekday and much longer on the weekends.  Trust me, it's worth the wait.  My favorite item at Tartine is their Banana Cream Tart, which is out of this universe!  The tart is layered with chocolate, caramel, rich vanilla custard, sliced bananas and whipped cream...and the tart crust is flaky.  Oh my gosh... I miss San Francisco for this sole reason.  I also highly recommend the eclaires, morning rolls (orange zest, sugar, cinnamon), the warm bread pudding.  Tartine's pressed sandwiches are to die for.  The bread is crispy, buttery and rustic and whatever sandwich you choose I guarantee that you'll come out smiling.  I've literally tried every single one, and never came away disappointed.  Sandwiches are served with pickled baby carrots with a little kick to them.  If you go once, I guarantee you'll be back for more.

So I'm spending the weekend with the hubster in SF to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary.  We were in Tommaso's (based on yelp reviews) waiting for a table and this very nice gentleman overhead us discussing what we were planning to do the next day.  He told us of a few places around North Beach to check out and about Tartine.  Based on his suggestion, we planned our outing to the Castro/Mission district to include Tartine.  We got a little lost after getting off the F train, but we made it.  Based on the yelp reviews, we knew we had to try the bread pudding.  We had the best bread pudding we ever had on our honeymoon in Hawaii.  We've been trying ever since to find bread pudding as good or better and Tartine's definitely came close.  I guess blackberries are currently in season, so that was the fruit topping of the bread pudding.  First bite was just heavenly.  It was sweet, but not overly sweet.  It was moist and it had a custard like consistency.  So good!!!  The hubster and I just kept eating and eating until it was all gone and realized that we should have gotten a bowl of the bread pudding instead of a cup.  I will definitely go back to Tartine on my next trip to SF.  Lovely, sweet and beautiful bread pudding, I am missing you so much right now but know that I will one day have you again hopefully sooner than later.  Love your bread pudding Tartine!

i'm certain that this being the 100th review of this place i am really just beating a dead horse here, but i will sing to the choir anyway. this place is awesome. you know a bakery is good when the line's out the door and you can't get a table to save your life. the chocolate croissants are in high demand at this little cafe so make sure to stop by fairly early or you are certain to miss out. the croque monsieurs are monsterous and worth every last stuff-me-to-the-brim bite. every time i go back to san francisco for a visit i make sure to stop by this place. it's just too good to pass up.

Eclair was ok. However, there is a reason I live around the corner and never go here. It is just an extremely inefficient line - yes there are other good places that have lines. But this one is not necessary (one person at the cashier holding everything up with other servers sitting around) and they can continue to ignore this broken system because they get so much business.

The most amazing croissant and pain au chocolat I've had in the States for sure!  The smells are incredible the minute you get within a block of this place.  Even though the croissants are HUGE, nothing of the authentic taste and texture is compromised (I'm usually very wary of over size pastries!)  And the lines outside can be annoying, but both times I've been it has worked out that you can grab a place to sit within 5 minutes of receiving your order so you can truly enjoy your indulgences!

The pastries here are great.  The frangipane croissants are my favorite, even though they're ALWAYS a little overdone (dark brown on the bottom and too crispy).  They would get Tartine 4 stars (minus 1 for being so consistently overdone).  Minus another star because the line is outrageously slow.  It's bad enough the line is always out the door.  But even with the line out the door, you wouldn't think it would move so slowly when almost everything is already made and just needs to be put in a bag or on a plate.  This line doesn't include coffee (separate line) or waiting for anything that needs to be heated.  The one time a friend ordered a toasted sandwich (croque monsieur), I left, got coffee down the street, went home, checked my watch several times, decided he had been hit by a car, and walked back, all before he got his sandwich.  I can never figure out how they manage to be SO SLOW.  Probably just as well, because if they were faster, I'd eat there more often and weigh 500 lbs.  As it is, I don't have this kind of patience.  Clearly none of the patrons crowding the place have anything else to do.  Which also explains why all the tables are always full. My view: Expensive, but worth the price.  NOT worth the wait.

Sometimes you have to be patient to get the best.  France is my favorite country and this place is a little piece of France right here in our great city.    Any time I feel like I need a true croissant or morning bun I head over to Tartine.  The line torments you while you wait but once you get your morning bun you will find it all worth while. :)

the question with tartine is whether their excellent baked goods outweigh the near-obnoxious attitude the proprietors and management hold regarding their customers. a review of the baked goods themselves is relatively straightforward - they know their stuff. maybe not the most inventive assortment, but very well executed. 7$ bread is absurd, but it sure is tasty. the problem is the attitude borne to the clientèle. i was willing to tolerate the lack of friendliness until a recent episode where tartine overcharged me (and every other customer over the space of a couple days), and then dragged their heals in correcting the charges. apparently they accidentally double-charged every customer who paid by card in mid august, but quadruple charged me. i was annoyed they didn't contact me when they clearly knew of the problem, and even more annoyed that after my repeated requests to reverse all false charges they insisted i must have made a second purchase of the same amount. after 3 weeks they finally reversed all extra cost, but with no admission of fault, no gesture of apology and the expectant impatience their servers show when asked for a croissant aux amandes. tartine would do well to study the coded formality and respect accorded in a true french bakery as intently as they've studied the process of baking the goods.

The food at tartine is and always has been exquisite. Not only is everything fabulous, as evidenced by the perpetual line out the door, but the service is excellent as well. I have never had a bad meal or experience there. As I have always treated the staff with courtesy and respect (which cant be said for some of the other patrons) it has been reciprocated in kind. THeir cookbook rocks, their wine is devine, the people there are wonderful, and its easily the best bakery in the City.

My last bread pudding.   I used to go to Tartine all the time. It got too popular. But occasionally I'll stop in off hours to pick up a bread or bread pudding. No more. The set up is so intentionally rude and user-unfriendly I've got to give up the best pastry in SF.  Two registers, one perpetually unused despite a line out the door and many take aways piling up behind the counter. Lots of busybusy, lots of attractive women taking orders, which just pile up. But simply pay for your one take out croissant or pudding? No way. You will wait while two people ahead of you they go through their coffee orders, at the one functioning cash register. And then she wanders off for a while.  And the chutzpah of a tip jar.  Pay the workers in accordance with their attitude, but don't expect customers to.  And now i've opened my bread pudding, and it's all bread no fruit, literally one berry, which never would have happened before.

Everything here is REALLY good...but if you are here for breakfast,  try a morning bun, croissant (many options) or the bread pudding  - these, in my opinion are the reason to come to Tartine.  The desserts, sandwiches and the coffee & wine selection will keep you coming back again & again.  Worth the wait.  Oh, and skip the Meusli.

I have give Tartine a fair chance and i have enjoyed the food, but right now the lousy attitude of the staff is all i can think about.  The food doesn't hold up in the general stomosphere of a bunch a sour pussess.  It is remarkable that all the staff have no expression on their face or in their voice. Deadpan  and unpleasant. So now I wonder - maybe they aren't payed well.  I am sure they don't make extra money on tips - I certainly have not been inspired to tip.  So maybe they make a really lousy wage and are treated badly by the employer... who knows, but I know down the block at the Delores Cafe, they are friendly and I feel more comfortable there than at Tartine where I get more of a stomach upset than a tasty treat.

I have gone here several times and feel its time for the review. I really enjoy everything I have tried here: croissants, fruit tarts, coffee, tea... last evening after work I was walking around the neighborhood pretending to be a hipster and walked back in here. I was in line trying to decide what to try when I stumbled upon the fresh fruit brioche. Can I just say... YUMMY! I really enjoyed it because it was really fresh... not overwhelmingly sweet and the bowl for $6 was enough from my friend and I to share I also ordered the house ice tea which was tasty.... it had a hint of mint in it which I absolutely love love love! It was crowded as usual, but we managed to get a spot on the large table by the door. This place really does charge a lot for what they sale... it is my only complaint. Yet, I chose to go there.... so I guess I should shut my trap... but still... why oh why is it so expensive? I have had better pastries... yet, people seem to be like moths heading into the light at this place. I sure hope they pay their employees well... if so, it is cool.

We decided to skip dessert at Delfina and stopped by Tartine Bakery on our way out.  The case was filled with desserts that your eyes would feast on before your mouth! I picked up a coconut cream pie, a slice of the lemon meringue cake, a lemon cheesecake tart (I adore all things lemon!) and a small bag of the chocolate chip walnut cookies. Yes, yes..i know, seems like a lot but i wanted to taste them all, even if I don't finish them! Unfortunately, I started tasting before I started taking pictures...oh well, besides that there are PLENTY of photos for your eyes to feast on here! My favorites in order: the coconut cream pie ...filling was so good, creamy and very toasty coconutty :-) the crust was lined with a bitter sweet chocolate but almost tasted burnt so i tried them separately and they were both good! The lemon meringue cake...flavor was good, cake was good...confusing to the pallet, my preference would be to stick to lemon meringue pie. Moving on! The lemon cheesecake tart...very nice flavor and texture! And finally the chocolate walnut chip cookies. I love walnuts in my chocolate chip cookies, reminds me of childhood, but what made these extra ordinary was how thin and crispy they were! I would highly recommend a stop by if you are in the neighborhood...I would even recommend skipping dessert at Delfina and save room for Tartine!

If Yelp criticism lands on a business with 2000 reviews and 4.5 stars, will anyone actually read it and care?   Probably not but I'll post anyway because a couple of things need to be said.  First:  more butter does not equal better.    Yes, butter is amazing.  Yes, butter makes the (baked) world go round.    But Tartine proves that there is such a thing as too much.   If I squeezed my morning bun hard enough, I could have fried eggs for a week.    Second:  being a beloved business does not give you the right to treat customers with contempt.   Came in on a rare slow late afternoon to pick up a slice of tres leches cake.  The man behind the counter was engrossed in conversation with a friend and did not feel the need to help.   Several minutes pass.   Cake is requested.   Counter man checks the case to find 2 beautiful tres leches cakes.   Then brusquely replies that it is too late in the day to cut the cake so no slice.   I ask for clarification - what is the cut off to cut the cake?   No response as counter man moves on to the next customer.    Third:  the chocolate chip cookies suck.   I mean, really not good.

Just wanted to write a newer review to correct the old reviews saying not to come here if you're vegan. I got bored while my friends waited in line and, figuring I'd have no choices, got breakfast from Bi-Rite. Then I discovered that actually they have vegan carrot cake! The kamut flour taste was a little too healthy-tasting by my standards, but I appreciated that for waiting around for half an hour, I had something to go with my soy cappuccino, which was also delicious. My food didn't look quite as mind-blowing as my companions', and it wasn't worth the wait on its own, but if you're a vegan and your whole posse is going to Tartine, don't ditch them and eat at Bi-Rite! Then you'll have had 2 brunches and be way too full. Learn from my fail.

Okay, I must admit that the pastries here are out of this world.  Lately however, the coffee is absolutely terrible, sort of like colored hot water.  Maybe they changed their brand, maybe the cost of coffee went up.  Suggest bringing your own coffee, buy one of their cups and fill it with your own.  Can't pass up these pastries just because of the coffee.  However because a good cup of coffee must accompany these rich pastries, I am only giving it two stars.

You may walk by this unmarked cafe and wonder to yourself "Why are there so many people in line?" The answer to this question can be a multitude of things but to me, it would have to be THE MORNING BUN. This delectable treat has the consistency of a soft pillow, the fragrance of orange and the flavor of spiced citrus with sugar and a hint of cinnamon. It is delightful, to say the least! The banana creme  tart is also a great hit! I'll be the first to say that they don't skip out on the bananas. The chocolate croissant is flaky, bittersweet and something you would LOVE to sink your teeth into. I've had one in France and this one definitely compares! Tartine's Croque Monsieur is the biggest beast I've ever seen and it was a very delicious and flavorful dish. I cannot wait to come back here. It was so worth waking up at 8am and making the drive from the South Bay. I'll be back for you, Tartine. Soon enough!

Best croissants ever! I've tried their ham and cheese croissant and lemon cream tart one afternoon. It was 3 or 4 PM and it was still somewhat crowded. I liked the croissant more than the tart, but I'm also biased because I prefer savory foods over sweets. Nonetheless, the lemon tart was really good. I don't remember it being too heavy which is good. They also give you unlimited refills for their coffee which is a plus. The second time I tried Tartine was when my friend bought morning buns and almond croissants to share while we were waiting in line for rush tickets to In the Heights, but I arrived late and the morning buns were gone :( Luckily I got to try the flaky and crispy croissant with a delicious center. I need to go back and try the morning buns that are supposedly to die for. My friend was there when the store was about to open, and he said there was already a line, so it's probably a good idea to go early to avoid crowds.

dayam...$13 for a hot pressed sandwich. i must say it was worth every penny. you actually get 3 halves so sharing 2 sandwiches among 3 people would be perfect. i tried the ham and cheese and it was most excellent. i not sure i could eat here everyday (since it's super dense) but i'd definitely pay tartine a visit every few weeks. place is tiny so snag a seat when a table opens up.

pastry like paris without the plane fare...  this place certainly sets the bar for all else, though the experience can be a little trying - always crowded, people opt to not bus their tables, as you're meant to, so there's frequently 'stuff' on tables that could otherwise be used or are just dirty - it's best to just do take-away and dash up a few blocks to the park and overlook the city.  while enjoying your BUTTER.  mmmm.

Over a 1000 reviews for a bakery near the Mission is quite the amazing feat, but it shouldn't come to any yelpers since this joint is highly regarded by the yelp community and San Francisco in general. My girlfriend discovered the place on Yelp and she figured I would enjoy the food there and as usual, she is correct. We went during that heat wave that paralyzed San Francisco and between you and me, there were a lot of hipster chicks not wearing bras, including a worker...Plus 1! We both ended up wit the Procsciotototot sammichs (Sorry cant spell Italian) and it was damned awesome. Toasty and buttery bread and the meat was delectable. We were also able to eat outside and enjoy the sun and the harmonious sounds of the cars whizzing by. I beleive our sandwiches were 9 bucks each, quite pricey but luckily there was a corner store across the street, so I bought an Origina on the cheap to complete our European Bistro Style experience. Good times

wake up early, head on over and arrive at 9:06 am, 6 minutes after opening on a cloudy sunday morning. the line was out the door, but going quickly. the smells were drool worthy, everything just baked and still warm. unsure of what to get for my *first time*, i got two of the plain croissants, scones, and morning buns. and my friend also threw in the chocolate hazelnut torte. (aka good idea!) the croissants were flakey and buttery, the morning buns were sweet, with a candy likeness to them, sugar crystals decked out on it. the scones were crisp on the outside, crumbly in the center (i am going to have to admit i LOVE more the scones at Arizmendi bakery over on 9th ave.) the hazelnut chocolate torte... not overpowering on the chocolate, crisp yet flakey crust- delish!! the bread pudding looked incredible, but after stuffing my face, i could unfortunately bare no more baked goods.

Yelp let me down again.  Actually I have a few friends that raved about this.  A lot.  And 2000+ reviews were just tempting.  But I was so disappointed.  I really wanted a croissant and they were already sold out when I went there at lunch time.  So we order a banana cream tart and a bread pudding.  So many people were eating it, so I thought it must be good. Wrong wrong wrong.  It was really REALLY SOGGY and such a disgusting mess =/  I only took a few bites and left the remaining there.  Banana cream tart was OK... just cream inside a dark chocolate coated crust.  Nothing special.  Only the first few bites were good, and I didn't want to continue eating after that.  We had latte and it was... well...just latte.  Typical.  I don't know if we'll come back here.  I don't understand the raves and the line that wraps around the block.  Another overrated place on yelp, just like Burma Super Star.

The first day I tried to go to this bakery there was way too long of a line out the door. However, because the reviews of the chocolate croissants I waited. What a waste. After a long wait in line I ordered chocolate croissants but, they were out. The guy told me it would be 15 minutes for fresh ones so I chose to wait. Big mistake! After 30 minutes I checked on my order and they said it was going to be at least 7 more minutes. By this time I had enough and asked for my money back. Did I mention the standing room only space and blaring music? On the off chance it was a bad day, I tried again Sunday morning at opening. Again a long line. This time I got my chocolate croissant. It was good but, just as good as any other bakery (I worked in a European bakery for 6 years). I also tried the morning bun noticing that on both mornings a local was eating it. I figured he knew best. The morning bun I must say was quite a treat. Rather than your standard cinnamon bun, this one had orange and sugar. It was a wonderful pairing. My husband liked it too. I had a chance to check out another bakery in San Francisco called the Chestnut Street bakery (Marina District). I would recommend this place over Tartine bakery any day. I had the most wonderul red velevet cupcake (better than Kara's cupcakes), the place was not crowded and a lot more comfortable.

I guess sometimes people expect way too much from a place, and let me tell you I expected too much from this place. Don't get me wrong Tartine is a really good place for dessert lovers, I mean just from the name "Tartine" people can expect it to be fancy and a good bakery place. However, I must say that I like the banana cream tart, I don't LOVE it but I must say the taste is pretty good that i would categorize my liking into a 4 star. I recommend to just try almost every variety of the pastry selection they have, one thing i tell you, you are not going to disappoint yourself in trying new flavors. I wish that they would make larger spaces for the seatings though, it would be so much nicer if the customers are not clamped together in a confined space. But I guess, you could always sit outdoors and enjoy the view. Also point to remember is that Dolores Park is nearby and its just amazing to have Tartine foods while enjoying a beautiful scenery out in the park! But don't expect that Tartine is the best of the best bakeries in town cause i think there are still better ones out there:) Overall however, i still enjoyed this place:)

What the bakers at Tartine Bakery can do with flour, lots of butter, sugar and eggs is heavenly.  Add some chocolate and love of baking and the results are breathtaking.  Right there in the middle of the Mission District is this wonderful gem, full of the most fanastic goodies.  Don't miss this place - it is heaven on earth.

I wanted to check this place out because the reviews on Yelp were really good and the pictures of all the desserts and pastries looked sooo yummy...I just had to try it for myself. I went on a Sunday around 2pm and expected there to be a really long line. There was, in fact, a line but the wait wasn't too bad. The place is pretty small but there are also a few tables outside. All the sweets looked even better in person than in the pictures. It was hard for me to choose what I wanted to try. I ended up choosing the Banana Cream Tart to share with the hubbs for dessert. We each got one of their pressed sandwiches as well. I ordered the Prosciutto & Provolone and the hubbs chose the Spicy Turkey. There was a bit of a wait on the sandwiches so we ended up eating the tart first. Oh my...was the Banana Cream Tart delicious! Perfect size for sharing too. Our sandwiches came soon after we scarfed down our dessert. They were definitely bigger than I thought! If I knew the portion was going to be that large I would've shared one sandwich with the hubbs. Both were very tasty though I think I liked my Prosciutto & Provolone a little bit more than the Spicy Turkey....but I definitely would recommend both. We boxed up the the rest and ate them later on that day (and it tasted just as good!). I can't wait to go back again and try more of there scrumptious goodies!

Their pastries are to die for!  While exploring in SF, we discovered this little bakery.  I recognized it from the last time my family came to visit trying to find the "best bakery in SF."  This place is not easy to find since it has no sign but if you look for the long line, you'll know where it is (also it's 18th & Guerrero).  The place is small so I recommend taking ti to go or eating ti in the car.  When you get in, you will be so overwhelmed by all the wonderful goodies you can get!  I got the lemon cream tart, a currant scone and a couple of shortbread cookies (yes, you will gorge here...but how many times are you around this area to get these?).  We loved it!  everything is just so fresh and a true sense of what a pastry is.  I did have to take one star off for the cramped quarters to get the food (and the Asian lady who kept pushing her way to make wierd complaints and get questions answered).  A little pricey but I definitely will be coming back !

I came back this time to stand in line....parking was not fun to find as they were having the summer in the city and closed down streets near the bakery.  A line had formed and when we finally found parking we hopped into the line and waited for 10 minutes.  Such a nice and beautiful day...I ordered the pain au jambon, croissant, et tarte aux chocolates y hazelnuts (if my french serves me correctly).  Yes this place is on the indulgent and slightly pricey side, but it was worth the trip.  The pain au jambon was so good and inside it contained Gruyere cheese.  The croissant was still good the next day after popping it into the microwave, but I still liked the pain au jambon better.  My friend and I took our goods over to Delores Park and people watched in the sun.  Very relaxing for a Sunday morning.  Would definitely head back there....btw...my chocolate/hazelnut tarte still exists in the fridge, and per my friend the best way to describe it is that it's like a huge Ferro Rocher, it even tastes better when it's been sitting in the heat warming up....yummy yummy in my tummy!

i went to tartine around 730 pm on a Friday night and ordered one of my favorites, the coconut passionfruit bavarian cake. it was almost closing and there was about one and a half slices of the cake left. instead of giving me a bigger slice, the girl behind the counter cut me a tiny slice and threw the rest away! i was so APPALLED!!! she could have given me the bigger slice or saved the other slice but she threw it in the garbage RIGHT in front of me!! she couldn't even wait til she got in the back. i was pretty furious!

the crowded standing-room-only shop and the beautiful cookbook made me want to try Tartine for the first time. so a coworker and i made a special lunch trip to the no-parking area this afternoon. and quite frankly i was a little disappointed. ok, this may be a skewed review, but i'm not a sweets type of person. actually i hate sweets, pastries, almost everything Tartine is known for. HOWEVER, their menu also serves up some yummy sounding sandwiches and non-sweets stuff. first off, the service can improve tremendously. i was in line with only a couple of people in front. the girl behind the counter asks "what can i get for you?". i tell her i want to have a sandwich. she then tells me "oh, you have to order at the counter." ok, so why'd you ask?? so then i get to the counter and order. no problem the other girl puts my sandwich thingy into the oven and i go to another girl to pay. the assembly line system they have is so bad that she rings me up for other people's food after i told her 3 times those dishes aren't mine. i tell her it's the thing in the oven. she still asks. i'm frustrated by then. so i pay and sit down. she never told me how long it'll take. i'm sitting for nearly 10 minutes thinking they forgot to take it out of the oven. so i walk back up with my order number, and a new girl snobbishly says to me, "we'll bring it to you; it takes 10 minutes", as if i should know their procedure like a regular. oh by the way, did i mention it's not really a sandwich but a big slice of bread with cheese on top? and did i mention how much it cost? $7.75 plus tax = $8.31. OMG, WHAT A RIP OFF!!! for that much i coulda bought a whole loaf and a pound of cheese. and what's this whole thing about bussing your own tables? i could understand if it's so they don't have to hire so many people but they in fact had a LOT of ppl working there, yet the lines aren't moving any faster and they still stupid mistakes with the orders. they are quite lucky they're in a slow paced neighborhood. imagine if they were in the bustling downtown. great experience but i won't be back anytime soon.

Perfection. Do you know how hard it is to actually produce a flaky croissant as they do in France? Well the bakers here have figured that out ages ago but please dont limit yourself to a meager croissant or brioche because there are many, many more heavenly delights and pastries, cakes, desserts that could be displayed at this moment on the boulevard St-Germain in Paris or in any self-respecting neighborhood patisserie in France. But Tartine is more than a bakery. Their croque monsieurs/madames (does one say "messieurs and mesdames?") are positively craquants --yeah, oozing with marvelously flavorful gruyere; you won't regret it. I am also a big fan of their bread pudding, a mixture piled with fresh berries served warm. Haven't had the pleasure yet of their chocolate cakes but they look very inviting in the display case. And I have to believe that there is a daily exercise in masochism (or sadism?) in that hordes of very hungry people have to wait (im)patiently to order and in the process have to deal with what's behind the well-lit glass cases...just before they try to figure out what to order. Only a couple of quick misses: service can be a bit surly (please smile in order to disarm them); getting to the coffee in the corner is awkward since you have to cut through the line a couple of times as you are balancing your coffee cup. Finally, this place is much too small!

Yum.  I'm pretty sure that I could have eaten three or four servings of their bread pudding with nectarines and berries.  Somehow the fruit made it seem more like a nutritious breakfast food, but I still felt spoiled by dessert at 10 a.m.  The quiche was also excellent, the coffee was good, and the staff were super friendly despite being slammed (that morning and every morning we walked by).  Being a New Yorker, I expected a "be ready to order or lose your place in line" attitude, but the woman behind the counter was warm and friendly and totally relaxed, answering all of my questions without any hurry.  I guess that's San Fran for you, but I think it may have something to do with Tartine as well.

the tastiest bread pudding & sandwiches ever!!!! all the portions are huge and you'll have left over sandwich to save later for dinner :) highly recommend this place. seating can be limited, but the park is just a hop and skip away so take your sandos to go and lay out on dolores park.

I went when it wasn't as busy as most others have experienced. I ordered a coconut cream tart that was awesome but oh so filling. I also ordered a pressed sandwich with bananas, jam and fromage blanc. It was huge. Counter girls seemed a little bit snobby or just lacked desire in fulfilling requests.

My best friend, who happens to be a pastry chef, was visiting from Vancouver and she really wanted to check out Tartine while she was in SF.  Well, naturally it was my duty as her friend to sacrifice myself and indulge in a pastryfest.  Oh, and did we ever indulge.  Since we were there purely for her research purposes, it was necessary that we try pretty much one of everything.  Really, it was.  My absolute favorite item was the brioche bread pudding, closely followed by the lemon tart.  The chocolate croissants were also delicious.  It was definitely worth the wait in a line that went out the door and around the corner- luckily the line moved very quickly.  I guess the only thing that I can't rave about is the slightly tough/edgy feel of the place, from the artwork,  to the attitudes of some of the staff.  I get that it's in the mission and all, but it just doesn't have the warm and fuzzy feel that I like to get from a bakery.

This place is a little bit of heaven. Its close proximity to the Bi-Rite Creamery also spells danger; stop here for dessert after Aslam's Rasoi, roll yourself down to the Bi-Rite Creamery for second dessert, and then nap in Dolores Park for the most decadent tour of the Mission anyone should ever experience. Everything here is delicious. My favorite is the lemon meringue cake, it is consistently wonderful, with creamy lemony goodness sandwiched between fluffy white cake, all encased in meringue. I think a slice of this on a sunny day in the Mission is the definition of sublime! The chocolate cakes are great, and the banana tarts are excellent as well, with just a hint of chocolate to make them particularly stand-out. The chocolate tea cake is another good choice if I'm feeling particularly Spartan. Not to be outdone by their sugared counterparts, the sandwiches here are not fooling around. They're gigantic and gooey and wonderful; my favorite is the horseradish pastrami. I split it with a friend who was unused to horseradish, and it gave her a tummy ache, so proceed with caution! I love that burn in the back of my brain and the top of my nose, though, so I couldn't have been happier with our choice.  Sure, I wish the place had more seating, but I can't bear to knock off a star since the pastries are so damn good. I'm sure my waistline is happy I moved out of the city, but my taste buds sure aren't; I make a point to come by Tartine anytime I'm visiting the area or trying to impress out-of-towners.

went here for a quick breakfast meeting at 8 and just after we sat down there was a line starting that was swiftly making its way out the door. this place is legit with a nice exhibition style bakery kitchen. everything is freshly made and it's a real treat to get away from the cookie cutter starbucks decor. i had an americano coffee and a morning bun. the bun was both buttery and delicately sweet even with the extra dusting of sugar on top. there was also a subtle hint of orange zest and cinnamon. they opened at 7:30 this morning (friday). according to my cousin, the bun goes from night to day when freshly warm out the oven. i'm sure they wouldn't have hesitated to warm them up if requested as they seem to have a very friendly and personable staff. as we were in a bit of a hurry, we didn't bother and the buttery sweet glaze which i imagine would have been pleasantly warm and gooey was a bit hardened. still, it was a pastry of high caliber. i'm told on the weekends the line can stretch out the door and around the corner. i can understand why. if i get hungrier, i just might go back for one of their savory hot pressed sandwiches which i'm told are just as fantastic. if you've had the morning bun and are like me thinking it was as great a balance a morning treat could be, i did happen to stumble upon what seems to be the authentic recipe. i would surely try the real thing before aimlessly mucking around. http://www.7x7.com/eat-d…

As a dude who may or may have not once owned the largest artisan bakery in the south east, i might know a thang or deux about baked goods, and all things baked.  This place is off the chain.  My only knock is that every single time i have been in this place the girls helping me are either 1) day dreaming 2) talking with their co-workers about last nights date and not taking care of business or 3) a little too cool for school.  All things which are not so good for business over the long haul. Ya'hear. Does it stop me from going? No way San Jose!  I love food and this stuff is awesome, especially after I've left the vapor lounge and I need to feed the beast.  But girls can we please leave the chit-chat for break time and focus for just a few minutes and take care of the customer? Pretty please????  favorites: oatmeal raisin cookies, mexican wedding cookies, croissants, frangipane tarts, lemon bars, morning buns, scones, well you get the picture.

I'm going to join the minority here.  I chose to stop by here while touring the area today based on the high number of positive reviews.  I didn't even realize that it was on the food network for the chocolate croissant.  Anyways, they were already out of that when we stopped by in the early afternoon.  Instead, I got the bread pudding, chocolate chip cookie, and the gruyere bread.  I particularly excited about the bread pudding, since so many reviewers mentioned it.  Since they were finishing up on the last bit of the bread pudding tray before setting out another one, I got a huge portion.  And apparently, if you dine in, you don't get the same amount.  So I was feeling pretty lucky when I opened the bread pudding box.  All the ingredients were good, but it didn't really stand out to me.  It was just a lot of vague sweet stuff.  I had some stone fruit on top, and there was a portion of the pudding that was more flan like.  I thought the flan part was original...but in the end it didn't add anything to the dish.  So overall, I thought it was good, but nothing to write home about.  The chocolate chip cookie was even less memorable.  The gruyere bread though, was delish.  I thought the texture and taste were great.  If I do come visit the area again, I might stop by for the pain au chocolat.  But I read in other reviews that it might be a little too rich, so I might not make a special trip out here just for that.

Wow, I can't believe so many people have reviewed this place. I'll sum it up simply then. I can see why so many people like the food, but it's generally overpriced with a rude staff, long line, and no place to eat. While good, I certainly don't think a cheese and bread sandwich is worth $11. If you're allergic to yuppies, avoid it like the plague. Just because the staff have noserings doesn't mean its not pretentious.

i like this place. and how it doesn't try to be french. sure, there are french pastries and beverages, but it isn't a francophile joint with grammatical errors in the name (hello "beau maison" on polk, your name should be belle maison--ever heard of gender agreement between adjectives and nouns?!). anyhow, the foods that i've had the delight to try have been yummy. even worth the occasional trip across town to wait in the semi-long line. 10-15 minutes is so worth it. the brioche pudding is great. love the fresh fruit. the frangipane croissant, morning bun, and double pain au chocolat are also tasty. i did have a quiche that was iffy, but it was okay. i was already bursting at the seams from all of the food that we ordered and well, you can't eat everything, right?

Didn't live up to the hype.  After hearing that Tartine was one of the best bakeries in San Francisco, I went expecting a fantastic croissant.  It was okay, slightly burnt and a little dry.  The chocolate cake was good but the frosting was a bit too dense.  It did, however, come garnished with some excellent coffee-flavored powder.  All in all, a good bakey but not the best.

Ok I had to check this place out for myself. I was determined not to like it as I don't like to fall for all the hype and I am a fan of  Bay Bread Boulangerie and all . . . finally went there yesterday and the morning bun is so good that I will gladly make the trip to the Mission just for these. The quiche was also good but I will definitely be coming back for the pastries. I didn't notice any attitude on the part of the folks working there. The place is small and cramped but most everyone there was friendly. Another plus is Bi-Rite creamery is right across the street, so i picked up a pint to bring home afterwards. More on that later . . .

on my most recent visit, i got two rochers (the one with cacao nibs was better), the apple bread pudding (a disappointment because it was practically a custard. maybe i got a bad slice?), a plain croissant (alrite), a ham and cheese croissant (heavenly. i closed my eyes as i ate it so my other senses wouldnt be distracted) and an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. and a morning bun (the morning bun was also very good. like a croissant with sweet cinnamon!) and contrary to people complaining about the price- my tab was only $11 for all the goodies!

Frankly, eating here is like taking a funnel and dumping sugar and butter down your throat, but boy is it good.

Today a coworker brought me to Tartine for a quick snack for our drive to work, and after one visit I am addicted. While we waited in a long line (no complaints, it was well worth the wait) I was tempted with a long case of delicious looking goodies. After my 5 minutes of oogling was up, I went with a slice of quiche and some chocolate tea cake. WOW! soooooo good. I will definitely be back for all those other delicious looking goodies I didn't get to try!

Tartine Bakery is fantastic and I would eat here more often if there wasn't always a line out the door and impossible to find a table.  I have sampled the desserts, pastries, and sandwiches and all are fabulous (yes, you have to be a fan of butter!).  I do agree with other reviewers that the paninis are a bit expensive at over $10 and with no side salad, but the combinations are so unique that it is ultimately worth it.  Split a panini and save room for dessert!

The bread here is to die for! I love the crunchy crust and soft center. All their open faced sandwiches are so rustic and hearty. Their portions are a little large though, so I always end up splitting a meal. The cappuccino I ordered was good, but my friends chai was awful and watery. It is hard to find a great chai, and this place didn't quiet get it. It is such a cute atmosphere, but will the people who sit here on laptops please limit themselves! There are only a few tables inside, and it is so frustrating when you have ordered a meal and some person is sitting with his empty coffee cup surfing the web for hours! There are plenty of other places where you can sit and stare at your computer, but when I go to Tartine, I would actually like to look at my surroundings, the bake case, and the line of eager people buying their scrumptious treats!

This place has gotten too big and probably careless if they have a few complaints from the locals. 1. -** The set up of he place is akward because you have to form a line by the door that leads to a narrow isle on the left side of the room and then you can't really see what is there available to order until you are up by the counter. 2. --***** for the horrendous service.  some drug induced un-clean and lazy guy was throwing all kinds of attitude when we request to purchase a slice of cake.  He would reply by saying we don't sell the cake by the slice like duh....r u stupid????  There was no sign on any of the cake stating they don't sell them by the slice.  So basically, every cake they have on display they don't sell by the slice and how dare us to even ask.  When I wasn't looking, he turned and made fun of me requesting cake by the slice with another woman.  How rude!!!  what the hell do you sell if nothing is available by the slice????? who the hell goes to a coffee shop and order an entire cake with their coffee??  Just rude!!!! To add insult to injure, they put a tip jar at the register where the cashier also had a blacken sour face....... Maybe you can bang on getting the tourist bucks to carry on in this manner but I would rather eat chalk than to return for your great service served up by your fine young staff.

the currant scone is great. it's not very sweet and has a nice slightly dry texture that would go well with tea/coffee. i tried a piece of a croissant that they reheated in the oven and it was light and crusty-good. the grilled sandwiches that were coming out of the kitchen also looked really good. perhaps i need to give the bread pudding another shot, but i thought it was ok. sit down space is hard to come by as the place is kinda small. also, waiting in line--though not for too long--is standard.

This is a long overdue review for Tartine's. This place doesn't deserve a star as far as how the people working there treat their customers. It's too bad how 2 underpaid, pompous & miserable workers could affect the reputation of an establishment. For almost 2 years, it's this rudeness that has kept me from coming back , unfortunately I decided to give it another try. Lo and behold! rudeness really is a trait and permanent on this place! 25 minutes into waiting for our order, I asked one of the workers there to please check on it, she answers with rolling eyes & tone dripping with sarcasm - "it should be on the grill". 10 minutes after it comes out & was just dumped at the other counter, I let this scraggly guy know that it might be our order, he gets the plates, tosses it in the boxes & leaves. Oh! and I had to finish putting the sandwiches in the box! At least there was this girl there who had the decency to apologize for everything, only after I told her what happened. Even if this place had (allegedly) the best  morning buns & pastries, i wouldn't go back, even if you paid me! No self respecting person should! To be treated so rudely by pompous, arrogant people who looked like they could use a shower or two is just unacceptable. Remember that if it were not for these customers who walk into your store & actually BUYS food, you'd still be stuck in that rinky dink place you came from.

Yes, their pastries are fine, however, their coffee isn't anything special.  I highly recommend that for an excellent expresso, just head to the movie rental store directly across the street.  Their expresso's are the best believe it or not.  Also the condiment area is very clean as well.  It just makes sense to have good coffee with the excellent pastries that you are about to consume.

I usually remove some of it before eating the eclair. The choc. is way tooo sweet, but everything else about it just melts in ur mouth!

my lady brought me to this place and i love it, possibly the best bakery in SF (even though i havent tried any others, i imagine they cant beat this place).  great pastries desserts and breads, but my favorite are their hot pressed sandwiches. the line can be long sometimes, but everything they have to offer is worth the wait.

I took 17 people here at once, and the staff served us all with courtesy and efficiency.  Not exactly the biggest place, and it lacks seating area, but I don't know what could be done about that other than them moving, preferable to Southern California...  Hard to find an unlikeable menu item, unless you don't like bread or pastries, to which I would ask, "What the hell are you doing here?!"  I love pain au chocolat, and it's even better when they're filled with Scharffen Berger...

I resisted for a long time because the line spoke over-hyped to me.  Everytime I am in line now, somebody walking by asks if the line is worth it.  Every time so far I answer yes.  The Morning Buns are like crack.  The bread is the best I've had in SF (and comes out of the oven hot for dinner (5pm)).  Even the 4-star coffee can't hold this back from a 5 star rating.

Food is great. Service sucks. They don't clean their tables after customers leave. The wait in line just to order is made unbeiveably long by the lousy system of taking and filling orders. The cashier does nothing but sit there taking money while she yawns her day away. There can be a line out the door and still only one person taking orders with a mob of people in the kitchen milling around. Don't even try to order a sandwich here, they are way too expensive - over $20 for 2 sandwiches that took over an hour to arrive... where they waiting to bake the bread or cure the ham or make the cheese? God knows why it takes over an hour to make 2 sandwiches. Food is great, but is it really worth close to $3.25 for a morning bun? And did I mention, the service sucks.

A friend of mine brought over some breakfast pastries from here.  All I have to say is ... it was the BEST croissant I have ever tasted.  Buttery soft on the inside and crisp and flaky on the outside.  I also tried the morning bun which had cinnamon and orange ... not my cup of tea, but still really good.  Luckily I didn't have to wait in line for it ... and they still tasted amazing when they got to my doorstep!

It's too crowded, it's true.  I don't go here for the scene. I'm not a dessert person. I have been here 100 times and never sat down at a table. Why? Because I go there for just one thing--the bread. Their country bread is as good as I've ever had in the US.  I went to Rome--was there on National Bread Day, where I sampled enough amazing varieties to make me burst--and this is as good. It's a hassle getting a hold of it--available only 5-7 on Wed - Sun, and forget about the weekend--but I'll pick up a loaf (or a half loaf, they're huge) on Wed or Thur and it's just heavenly. (Do they serve other food?) You can order it ahead, but it's still a hassle. Please Tartine, make it available at other times. But I give it five stars for the country bread alone.

I moved to San Francisco from Philadelphia about 5 years ago and have been searching for that 'perfect' cafe/bakery/bistro combination- you know- great food, relaxed atmosphere, friendly service. I've been to a number of cafes/bakeries in the city, everything from La Boulange to Arizmendi's to Citizen Cake and back again. A friend whose culinary tastes I value recommended Tartine, so I decided to check it out. Experience #1: I decided to come in on a cold rainy San Francisco night, an hour or so before closing time. I had bread pudding and a cafe au lait. The bread pudding was a little on the sweet side, the coffee was good though not great. However, the thing that was really awful was the downright uncaring, borderline rude staff girl who, mind you, looked like she hasn't taken a bath or washed her hair since 1994 AND, as if things couldn't get more awful, they were blaring some totally inappropriate noise on the radio so loudly, I could literally hear my own thoughts. I know this is the Mission...but c'mon people, I've had friendlier, less hipper-than-thou service in Williamsburg for crying out loud! Experience #2 So, a few months later, I actually decided to give it another try...willing to try anything at least twice. Decided to come at brunch with a friend after relaxing at Dolores Park. I had a cappuccino and a ham/gruyere sandwich. The sandwich was delicious, the cappuccino, not so much. The espresso tasted bitter (shot pulled too long?) and the foam was full of bubbles, no creamy, velvety microfoam to speak of. Once again, the staff seemed more interested in talking to eachother then making a sale and the place was a mess, tables dirty, crumbs everywhere. We sat on one of the tables outside and watched dirty dishes literally pile up on a table next to us, as no one, not once, in 30+ minutes we were there, came to clear any dirty dishes. Overall, this bakery has incredible potential but atmosphere, and most of all, service, are seriously lacking. In my humble opinion, if you're looking for a stellar bakery, you're better off with checking out any of  Boulangerie's located throughout the city.

this place would get 5 stars for the baked goodies themselves. they lose two stars for the ridiculous catastrophe that one must endure to actually purchase said goodies.   i am tempted to knock off another star for the frustrating effect this place has had on the neighborhood, but since i've moved to the other end of the mission, i am less consistently annoyed by patrons so will stick with three stars.  keep in mind, i actually wrote this place 'welcome to the neighborhood' poems before they opened (slipped 'em in the mail slot), i was so excited to have a quality bakery in the 'hood.  those were the days... no joke, while the goodies are delicious- the best i've had in SF- it is rarely worth the wait, unless you come on a weekday, or can get someone to pick up a box to go.  i wouldn't normally down grade a place for being popular- that's the price of goodness.  but this place seems to foster a willful incompetence amongst staff and whoever worked out the floor plan.  despite being crazy busy most of the time, the counter folk have a ridiculously slow and error prone system of moving forward the line.  i cannot believe that after all this time, they still seem to muddle along with the same routine.  how about a number system like mitchell's or lucca's?  or lose some of the indoor seating-? the other huge issue is the floor plan.  the coffee counter is at the opposite corner of the place from the coffee fixings.  what the bleep!?!  and, it's behind the ever-present line, and separate from the silverware and other eat in items.  so one might wait in line for 30 min, then have to struggle across the cafe 2-3 more times before being able to eat/ drink your treats.   seriously, NOT WORTH IT.  that said, if you ever wander past and there isn't a line out front, it might be worth a try to stop in- the baked goodies really are delicious (i lived around the corner for years, so i've been more than a few times).  i highly recommend the morning buns and the lemon tarts, and they have great croissants. also: the art tends to be terrible, even for an SF coffee shop (which is a fairly low bar in general).

rich flavors, heavy food, and delicious.  (i'm sure there is a lot of butter in whatever it is they've got going on).   I've had a few of their sandwiches and have been adequately satisfied with each.  Again, expect a full barrage of overwhelming flavor coming your way.  sometimes borders on a bit too much of a good thing .. but, in the end i still deem it within the 'good thing' range. love their croque, pastrami (even though i'm not usually crazy about horse radish), spicy turkey, and sopressata.   for dessert i've had their lemon bar, lemon tart, eclair, and some bread pudding dealy - i'm pretty sure i loved each one.  again, very rich, and very satisfying.  and since i love lemon tarts and lemon bars, as far as lemon tarts and bars go: pretty f*cking good.       also, love the pickled spicy carrot! and, word to the common stream of employee bashing... but to play devils advocate, they've not all been d*cks and as a fellow service industry worker, i get it.  (even though the attitude on some of them can be flagrantly excessive). if you're serving and endless line it is highly likely that you might run out of nice. also, to address those of you that have taken issue with the impatience displayed by the workers regarding ordering process, i say it is more than likey partially your fault. let me explain: you should pay attention to how the person in front of you is ordering if youre not sure. thats about it.  the first time i ordered i realized that there was a system at play and tried to pay attention to how the process works and didnt expect for them to cater to me. not like youre tipping them as you would a normal waiter. and if you aren't paying attention have the balls to ask them how to order.  the end. butterflies and ponies, l.n.

Tartine is amazing!! I am addicted to their Ham and Cheese croissant. Their pressed sandwiches are a dream. Their pastry is often the cure for what ails. Their cookies are crisp and delicious.

So, I gotta say that I think this place is good but seriously overrated.  On a few occasions, I've noticed the croissants and morning buns are overdone.  They are a little too brown to call perfect, i.e., clearly accidentally overcooked but served in any event. Coming from Manhattan, where they have some french bakeries with some incredible croissants, I have to say I was disappointed by the croissants at Tartine.  They are massive and overbrowned. They also seem to have some sort of egg wash to make them crispy on the outside.   This is not how I envision a perfect croissant. The coffee is just okay and I'm not a fan of coffee that comes in a self-serve thermos.   I feel like the hype of this place has kept it going, but it isn't anything special.  It's just a place that gets a lot of good press but I can't say I've had anything amazing there. To be fair, I've heard the freshly baked bread is incredible, and perhaps that is also true with the morning bun, but if you don't happen to get there when everything is piping hot from the oven, then I'd say it's just a mediocre bakery in a good location.

Admittedly, I am a bakery & pastry snob. Tartine warms my heart and soul at each and every visit. I have been known to take days off of work just to make a trip to my favorite SF bakery. The brioche bread pudding is amazing (just not when it's made with bananas) and the ham & cheese croissant is the devil!  I wish they had another location...perhaps in the East Bay?

My first visit  and a solo one too. Got there before the noon rush on a Sunday and had no problem finding a table to eat at. The chai latte was unsweetened so I had to dump these hardened rocks of sugar into it which didn't seem to melt or sweeten it up .. oh well. The olive loaf was good but I had to ask for it to be heated up. Went great with my chai latte but was a bit too greasy for my taste. A bit too pricey for a latte+slice of bread = $9 but def a great spot if you have some time to kill and are able to score a seat inside or out. My neighbours were also allowed to read for a bit but most folks are courteous and just eat, sit for a bit, and then leave.

After reading about all the reviews about Tartine through Yelp and various other blogs/articles/TV shows, etc I had to check this place out.  It did not disappoint, though the line was insanely long. I went on a Saturday morning (prime time, I guess), and had to wait outside for around 1 hour. Lesson learned: to avoid waiting in lines get here EARLY.  I tried their banana cream pie, morning bun, and the pain au chocolat, I loved them all.   MORNING BUN = YUM.

The morning buns really are as good as people say they are... flaky, not too sweet (but if you don't like orange zest, you won't like it as much).  The bread pudding was a little disappointing--there wasn't anything special about it.  The Croque Monsieur (I've had ham & also mushroom) are good, but the BEST part is the home-pickled spicy carrots/onions that come with it.  I don't know why they're so delicious, but they are.  However, I noticed that some people got more than others... maybe you have to ask for extra carrots when you order the croque monsieur!

I had a passionately love affair with the croque monsier (french for cheese toast) and especially its pickled carrot garnish. Alas, after months of free extra carrots, we had an irreconcilable split when the gorgeous woman behind the counter informed me that, No, she couldn't give me extra carrots with my $9 cheese toast because it turns out carrots are really expensive. Maybe in a year or two I'll get over my heart break/wallet ache and be able to return to my naively romantic youth... until then, my toaster oven is getting a serious workout. anyone know how to pickle carrots?

The food here is good and the prices are great. However, the wait staff is extremely unhelpful, negligent and rude. The last time I was there, I noticed the "please bus your own tables" sign. I was happy to oblige, but wasn't sure where I was supposed to place the dishes. I tried asking a member of their wait staff. All of them knew I was trying to find help, but chose to ignore me. The food is good, but I wouldn't recommend coming here. The customer experience is simply too bad. In addition to the wait staff, finding a table isn't easy. One often waits almost a half hour standing with your food in order to sit down and eat it. I'd be happy to pay more and go elsewhere for a better experience.

Mexican wedding cookies, morning buns, and the walnut bread - these are my favorites.  The wait is ridiculous.  Forget about going on weekends.  I've swung by a few times right before they open on Sat and the line is out-the-door.  Late evening is definitely the best time to go (tho the selection can be limited).  I went in a few weeks ago and they offered me a free pastry cause they'd baked too many.  That was cool.  Oh!  Definitely try the bread -- and you can buy a half loaf!

sorry the fact that i spent last year eating one perfect pain au chocolat after another means that this place dissapointed me. i finally past it by when there was not a line out the door. so i decided to try it out, it being a "french" cafe and all. the good news was the pain au chocolat i had was the best i've had since i got back to the states. but it was also the bad news why is it that you just cannot get a good soft unburnt pain au chocolat and from what i saw croissant in the states. is the process of making them just impossible to reproduce. cant we steal some french bakers to produce high quality pastries for us here in america? why are all the pain au chocolats here thick, dense (i know same word) and hard. we are able to make good angelfood cake... and thats all squishy and soft. why cant we make good croissants? whats the deal? sorry tartine. but your pain au chocolats are dense and hard and too crunchy. and your croissants looked burnt. lets get our act togather america its not quantity its quality. yep

Everyone and their dog has reviewed this pre-eminent of bakeries in the city, and I agree with the majority: this place is the bomb. Gorgeous little place, long lines that move pretty fast, cool atmosphere and the food is divine. So what do I have to add to the conversation? Well, my sister and I were talking about it the other day and I realized that Tartine triumphs in the realm of English-y foods: scones (buttery, dry and subtly flavorful), bread pudding (advice: get it take-out, put it in the fridge for 24 hours, and it's even better than served warm and fresh) and cookies -- I love their cookies, especially the crispy choco-chips and nuts. Where Tartine lessens in my estimation is their French-style desserts. My sis and I both agreed that La Boulange bests Tartine in tarts and creamy French confections; I once had the coconut cream tart and it was kind of monstrously over-the-top, too rich and overpowering. Ditto the eclairs -- I had eclairs in Paris that would beat the gooey stuffing out of Tartine eclairs. Just SO rich, the flavor was lost in the creaminess and I had to give half of it away, it was upsettingly rich for my stomach. The Parisian eclairs managed to be so sweet and rich and yet combine dozens of interesting flavors and texture. The eclairs here taste of undifferentiated fattiness to me. But the things that Tartine does well, it does so amazingly well I had to give 5 stars.

Absolutely loved the morning bun and the currant scone. It was the right texture, consistency and crispiness. Pure heaven. The bread pudding, however was a bit mushy for me, hence I only gave 4 stars.  The service was nice and speedy to keep the line moving. A very unassuming place with fantastic surprises awaiting inside.

Insane, though parking and the line can be a drag. Still, I could live off of these pastries, as good as you'll find anywhere. The rep is well deserved, down to the simplest items. But they need to expand or get more efficient somehow. I'll skip just to spare myself the agony of the long lines and slow progress half the time I'm in the area.

I had a plain croissant at Tartine around 12 noon on Saturday January 3, 2009, and felt sick as a dog a couple hours later.  That was all I had all day.  I was wondering if anyone else had the same at Tartine that day and felt sick?  I can only imagine that it was the croissant, but if so there must be others out there.  This has never happened to me before at Tartine so I am kind of bummed.

Tartine is the best bakery I know in San Francisco, possibly the best west of the Mississippi. I'll admit that there's a shortage of good bakeries in SF. But Tartine is still worth a long wait at least once a week, sometimes twice. The savory dishes--croque monsieur and quiche-- are rock-star dishes, often neglected for morning buns. Tartine is worth it! Every time.

We ordered two paninis at a hefty price of $12 and after 35 minutes of a wait no sign of panini.... when we asked the cashier about it, she rolled her eyes said "it's coming, you have to wait ten minutes". when we reminded her that it has been 35 (we had the receipt in our hand showing what time we ordered), she again rolled her eyes. 5 minutes later our mediocre panini showed up. The cheese was not even melted. Safeway does a better job! The attitude was just too much. Won't go there anymore... way too overrated... way too expensive... way too snutty (for an undercooked panini!).....I wish bakeries like this would not hire teenagers with attitude problems.. they think they are cool but somebody has to tell them that's not....

First I will start by saying NORMALLY the pastries are wondeful! However, the last few times we have gone, they have been over cooked and boardering on burnt, ( this seems not to matter as they serve them anyway). This aside they are NORMALLY the best in town. SERVICE is HORRIBLE, like other Yelpers have said, it seems not to matter if you are there or not. This is strange to me as their whole buisness is reliant on us, the customers. I would think that they would at least make an attempt to be nice. If you are not able to do so, then perhaps working an early morning job is not the appropriate employment for you. Next, I find it odd that the shop does not open until 7:30-8AM... the last time we were there, we waited outside for 10 minutes while they put out benches... What happened to being able to go and get a good cup of coffee and a crossiant at a resonable hour... I think that opening tim is a bit late... In summary... Normally great pastries, normally great coffee, ALWAYS RUDE SERVICE! For this I  am docking them of their otherwise well deserved four stars...

2.5 stars if i could. Experienced the usual parking and line out the door thing. Caveat, got there at 3pm, a little later than ideal,so perhaps we didnt get the really good stuff, which i'm told runs out by noon (the double pain au chocolat and the morning bun). We got the tres leches and bread pudding, neither of which either of us liked much. Wasnt bad, but not nearly as great as the rave reviews lead us on to expect. I will admit that the pastry was pretty light, that was a plus. Will go back to get the pain au chocolat sometime. Girl who served us looked and sounded like she was doing us this great massive favour, negs for service.

This place is constantly packed with customers waiting in line.  They serve a variety of hot pressed pressed sandwiches, pastries, and breads.  They bake their own bread fresh and let me tell you, it's pretty damn good.  Their croissants are so buttery, flaky and will just melt in your mouth.  Their sandwich bread is so large, that your sandwich is served in 3 sections.  Very good food with their prices a bit on the high side

went to tartine for the first time this morning, and it was great! the big downsides are the lines, and rich old guys trying to cut in line so they can "just buy a loaf of bread."  however, the line moved pretty quickly, and the food was well worth the wait. my wife and I got the croque monsieur and the pastrami sandwich.  both were nice and hot when we got them, which was excellent.  the sandwich had the perfect amount of horseradish on it, so it wasnt too strong, and the meat was nice and tender.  The prices are a little high, but you get a good size portion which is nice.  The pastries and tarts, though, are pretty much the same price as at starbucks, but I'm sure they are tastier They only had grapefruit juice, which I'm not a big fan of, but they were cool about me going across the street to get a naked juice and drink it inside the cafe. it's hard to grab a place to sit inside, so you have to keep and eye out and stalk people who look like they are about to get up. I usually try not to lend the trendiness of places affect my reviews, but this place was very good, and worth the crowd.  we'll be going back soon for pastries and tarts!

Yes, their food is delicious and decadent. But 1 star because the managers clearly don't care about their customers. The line is insanely long and they are ridiculously inefficient at coming up with a fast way to service their clients. There are many many other shops and bakeries where they have figured out a way to serve the clients FAST - and it seems that Tartine owners haven't even tried. I've stopped going there just because I don't want to wait 20 minutes for pastries.

I live in the South Bay and made a special trip to arrive at 5 p.m. for their fresh country bread.  I am a bread head and bake a lot.  They were out of the country bread so I tried a loaf each of the sesame bread and the walnut bread.  The walnut bread lacked taste.  I ran this by other tasters and they agreed.  The sesame bread was by far the better bread.  Both loaves were a tad burnt.

This is by far my favorite bakery in the city.  A friend introduced me to it close to 5 years ago and I have been a faithful client ever since.  The only down side is that it can be a little pricey and  there are always very long lines on weekends.  But in the end it is all worth it.

All I can say is this place is a total friggin joke.  I ordered a pumpkin pie and a frangipane tart for Thanksgiving dinner.  I placed the order by phone a few days in advance and paid by credit card.  Wendy, the manager, took my order and told me to make sure I picked up the order by 3pm, as they were closing early.  Unfortunately, Wendy DID NOT mention they were closing on Wednesday at 3pm, not on Thanksgiving...  Needless to say, the door was locked and nobody was working on Thanksgiving day when I showed up.  The following day I called Tartine and explained there had been a miscommunication and although I was there to pick up my order on Thursday, they were closed.  I told the girl on the phone I was going to be coming by to pick up my order.  This is when I was informed that, now, there was no order to pick up.  The person on the other end of the phone informed me that when I didn't show up on Wednesday our pie and frangipane had been THROWN AWAY!!!!  Yup, instead of calling me, they threw away my $60 order.  On Thanksgiving, in a city full of homeless Tartine is throwing away orders.  Based on this fact alone - GO EAT YOUR PASTRIES ELSEWHERE.  It was only after a VERY painful conversation that they agreed to make me another frangipane and give me credit toward the pumpkin that was thrown away.  Did I mention that the manager called me neglectful and asked not to return next Thanksgiving??

after eating lunch at Delfina next door, we were totally stuffed but i was determined to go to Tartine before we headed back to LA. the line was out the door and hooked around outside a bit. seating inside is very minimal and crowded. i think there were about 6 or 7 tables and a small bar seating area along the window, but the line snakes through the seating area and out the door. we waited in line for probably 20 min and finally reached the bakery display case. what to get?!?! i had just read on twitter that morning that Bobby Flay was in SF and was in line getting morning buns haha! so i got a morning bun! and a little bag of cookies. my friend got the mini banana creme pie. getting a seat in there is near impossible so we just headed back to the car, and ran the rest of our errands before heading to the airport. we both forgot about our tartine goodies until we got home to LA. the morning bun was crispy, lightly sugary and had a slight hint of orange. it was even better warmed a bit in the microwave. my friend said that her banana creme pie was smashed but it was still so good. the cookies i got were thin and crispy and so good with coffee. tartine... another must go-to/must-try kind of place in SF :)

they get the two stars for their morning orange bun.. but......................... their devil's food chocolate cake. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!! hello........ bought a piece of this cake to go.. and unfortunately, it wasn't until we left that we discovered how stale it was... apparently, to save time, they like to cut slices of the cake before it's even ordered, which means.............. it can sit all day long and then by the time someone does order it, the sides of the cake are stale....... which ours was.. if we had gotten the cake for inside, I assure you, they'd have had that cake planted right back at them but sadly, we got it to go and we didn't want to come all the way back to the place...... Also, had their croissant.. ah yeah.. a bit burned on the bottom... and if the employees handing the cash register didn't talk so much to one another, I do believe the line would move a lot faster... this place has some decent items.. but beware.. you must truly pick and choose....... some things are good... others things just aren't.......

finally got the chance to savor one of their almond croissants after attempting to do so at least 3 times. got up at 5am to lift this morning before i showered and headed out for tartine. got there at 7:25 and waited 5 minutes with a few other people for the store to open. all i wanted was the almond croissant and so i made a mad bum rush for those luscious treats. at 3.75 for one croissant, i'd say the price was pretty steep, even if the croissant was quite a bit larger than normal almond croissants. the croissant itself I thought was perfectly baked until i got to the ends, which were very burnt, so that definitely took away from the delectability of such a fine concoction, my favorite pastry of all time. the almonds, however, were perfectly toasted, the powdered sugar was not too heavily sprinkled, and the almond filling was very mild and pleasant, even if it was scarce. all-in-all, the price definitely was not worth the wait and effort. most of the croissant was just a croissant, and even if it was very flaky and well done in the middle, the burnt ends and meager filling really took away from a very steeply priced morning pastry. la boulange on pine and the brioche bakery in north beach still top out on the almond croissant list.

this place makes a mean cup of coffee and the pastries are really quite delicious. bf and i sampled the quiche and the bread pudding, which were both quite tasty, and the couple next to us were raving about the croque de monsieur. it was packed on a saturday morning, though, with a long line and people waiting for seats for quite some time. it's probably better to take and go on weekends, or at least rainy ones, when there's no outside seating.

My experience at Tartine can be summed up by the following experience which took place towards the latter end of my 30 minute stay at the famed Mission District Bakery.  Upon walking into the bathroom, I noticed expensive decorations and fragrant candles, yet the garbage can was overflowing with hundreds of used paper towels.  And that is exactly the way I felt about the food, service, and atmosphere of tartine.  Ok, so I got there in the evening after they were out of the croissants.  I'm not expecting much, just a nice cup of coffee and a couple simple baked goods.  Well, upon reaching the counter, I was greeted by a couple of snooty women telling me they were out of just about everything I wanted.  My friend and I proceeded to order two cups of coffee, a chocolate chip cookie, a brownie, a croque monsieur, and some sort of ham and cheese bread.  The coffee was actually pretty good, but it took them nearly 20 minutes to heat up the croque monsieur and the ham and cheese bread.  The croque monsieur was completely burnt on the outside, soggy on the inside, and impossible to eat.  The ham and cheese bread was dried out and not adequately reheated.  And the chocolate chip cookie and brownie? Inedible.  Both of them.  How can a place claiming to be a world class bakery be unable to make two of the most simple, common desserts known to mankind.  After eating, we had to balance our dishes on an overflowing tray of other used dishes that should have long since been cleared.  Essentially, this place has the attitude that suggests its the greatest place in the world yet the food is well below subpar, and the employees are rude and lazy.  Tartine, I hate you.

My friend lisa has been telling me since the beginning of time that I must hussle myself over to Tartine's to have the almond croissant..frangipane. Honestly, I don't even like almonds...I'm not indifferent...I actually prefer NOT to eat them. But there I was eyeing everything through t he glass and I opted for one and a shortbread cookie. The croissant was nothing short of heavenly..Maybe earthly is a better word as the filling was dense and well distributed..not all lumped in the middle. A slightly sweetened paste with slices of almonds..and a buttery flakey fresh outer shell. I had forgotten about the short bread and ate it a week later...dug out from my purse. Wasn't stale at all...and crumbled apart like a good shortbread should. Sat. I went for the rasberry bread pudding which is eggy and light...with a nice amount of rasberry juice for the pudding to wade in at the bottom of the coffee cup...and I had one of my favorite brunch treats: the croque monsier, fromage blanc. Its a mild, mild fluffy cheese on a soft bread with asparagus spears on top burnt brown. Last time I had it, it was made to perfection, this time the aparagus bases were a bit...too fibrous and I couldn't bite through them.

We were in France for a month in May and June, and I literally did not eat a single croissant (and I ate croissants almost every day) that was a delicious as the ones at Tartine. This bakery is a truly rare beast. My favorite things: the insane bread pudding with the seasonal fruit topping; the chocolate pudding (I know, I know, who cares about chocolate pudding? But try this one-- it's made with Sharffenberger Chocolate and is absurdly good); the mini lemon tart; the morning buns with the orange zest. I also love the ham and cheese croissants (which must be made with a pound of butter) and the cheesy gougeres-- I do wish Tartine had more savory treats. My one issue with the place is that the service can be uneven-- the cashiers are a little attitudinous and they have timing problems with the lunchtime rush. And I avoid the place on weekend mornings, when the queue goes way down the block. Nonetheless the food is incredible. It took me ages to lose my baby weight because when I went on long walks my feet always seemed to transport me to Tartine...

We went on a Saturday and stood in a line that didn't move for 15 min. and left, coming back on a rainy Monday when it was quieter. The pastries and cakes are gorgeous. I was prepared to be wowed and would say the verdict was 50% Ho! and 50 % Ho Hum. The lemon tarte was as beautiful as it was delicious. The chocolate on the eclairs is high quality however, like a hard shell vs. icing. The pate a choux is thick and chewy vs. light and airy. The pastry creme inside was flecked with vanilla bean, yummy, however, very runny, not a creme patisserie, more an anglaise. This is not a French style eclair. We split a Niman Ranch ham and gruyere panini. Enormous! and greasy, and because the bread is so thick, the ham and cheese didn't melt. I'd love to come back at 5p.m. one day and buy their bread. It's divine.  We didn't try the other pastries however, the morning buns and almond croissants looked wonderful as did many other items. The baker must have turned the oven on too high today because they brought out a large platter of truly burned pastries, next to many other "too burned to sell" pastries. Who would want to eat burned pastries? The staff were all friendly however and we had a nice lunch here.

DO NOT buy the food from this Bakery.  They do one thing very well, bake, the chef has it all wrong when it comes to real food.  I've had many of their treats and they're good.  I'm not going to say they're great but compared to other bakeries they're just a little above.  The difference is the food.  I ordered a sandwich which was terrible to say the least.  The grisly bread was too hard to even be considered for a sandwich I couldn't finish it.  After working my way through about 1/3 of it I threw it away.  The bread tasted like stale croutons soaked in oil and burnt.  I've never been so offended by food which comes from such an upstanding bakery.  Take the bread aside, the whole recipe was off.  If you have a sweet tooth then get a desert; it's what they know best.  If you're hungry, go somewhere else.  On top of that, the staff was rude and gave the impression they didn't want to be there and the whipped cream had no sugar in it to the point I threw it away as well.

I was actually a little worried about their business when I showed up for lunch today because there wasn't a line for me to wait in and I had my choice of tables.  Be forewarned, this usually doesn't happen.  But if you are willing to wait in line and eat your food wherever the hell you can find some space, the bread pudding will not disappoint you.  Your hot pressed sandwich (I heartily recommend the sopressata) will be liberally bathed in butter before it is grilled.  Whether or not that's a good thing is up to you to decide.  The pickled carrot took me by surprise - perfectly tender-crisp and zesty and flavorful with some spice that kicked in later.  That and the broccoli rabe pesto are fantastic and might make you feel just a little less guilty about what you're eating.  The desserts are gorgeous.  Personally I've never tried them because I'm afraid if I do I'll just keep eating them and never look back.  Maybe you have more will power.  If you do, I'd suggest that Scharfen Berger pudding.  It's been calling my name for months now.

I've been to this bakery twice.  The first time for a morning bun which was delicious but overpriced.  The second time I went in wanting a morning bun again but the line was long and I waited then got tired of waiting and got discouraged and left. It is a shame that in reading the other reviews that other patrons think they are too slow in attending the customers and I was mortified to hear that some patrons got bad attitude by the workers taking the orders. Its a shame because even though they make good pastries THAT IS NOT A GOOD EXCUSE TO TREAT YOUR PATRONS LIKE CRAP!!!! So if the owners of this bakery read or even care about what your customers who keep you in business are thinking or writing THEN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!!  Devise a better system to make the lines go faster and hire professional courteous employees.  Your patrons deserve it for heavens sake!  If you don't care what your patrons think then your days in business are numbered and you won't last.  You should be kissing our feet for us to patronize you not the other way around!  Yes...the customer is ALWAYS RIGHT!
