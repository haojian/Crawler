Love! This place is sooo beautiful-ambiance and food alike. This place is easy to miss, actually it's very nicely hidden in terms of any signage indicating it's a restaurant. Walking in, this place feels special. There are large tables to accommodate large parties in the main first room and further back is where I dined and it's especially cozy-made for two people max per table. The room in the back is made to feel romantic and special. I loved the lighting. Okay, aside from the lighting, the food was beyond wonderful and elegant. I had a three course meal and loved every bite of each. The portions are not gigantic, as most upscale restaurants tout themselves on quality not quantity. However, that said, I was more than satiated at the end of my dining experience, so much that I couldn't finish my dessert. Men-if you want to take your special someone, this is a great place. xoxoxoxo.

I've had Providence on my (long) list of restaurants to go to for awhile, and my boyfriend and I finally went with Ailyne H. and Denmark V. during Valentine's weekend. This restaurant is easy to miss because it is not on a busy street and there's really nothing else nearby. There was a Valentine's Day menu available, but our table decided to order off the $85 3-course Prix Fixe menu. I ordered the Scallop Ceviche, Wild Black Sea Bass, and Harry's Berries. My boyfriend ordered the Ugly Bunch, Liberty Farms Duck Breast, and Carmelia. My boyfriend and I were both relieved that they served complimentary bread, Salmon Skin w/ Smoked Trout, and Butternut Squash Soup. The Bacon Brioche bread was delicious--I should've took more of it! The salmon skin was crispy and well with the savory smoked trout dip. All the dishes were made with high quality ingredients. There were some very memorable dishes, particularly the Duck Breast and Harry's Berries--thinking about those dishes makes me salivate every time! The Duck Breast was so tender and evenly cooked; it tasted just as good (maybe even better) than a piece of steak--I've never had duck breast made like this before and it was a nice surprise. The Harry's Berries dessert was sweet and refreshing; I really enjoyed the white chocolate rose water mousse, and the strawberry sorbet paired nicely with it. The Ugly Bunch was very unique and interesting. Everyone at the table was trying to figure out which components were the sea urchin, abalone, and the geoduck (first time trying it). However, there were also quite a few disappointing dishes, such as the Scallop Ceviche and Wild Black Sea Bass. Although the scallops were fresh and tender, the overall dish lacked in any interesting flavors. I was expecting the Black Sea Bass to be tender and flaky throughout, but the center of the fish was raw. The waiter took the dish back to the chef, and came back to tell us that the chef intended it to be cooked that way. I didn't ask for it to be cooked more so that I could taste what the chef intended to make, but in the end I didn't like how the fish was half cooked/half raw. I also didn't like all the pickled vegetables that came with the sea bass. Even my boyfriend, who normally likes pickled food, thought it tasted weird. After dessert, we were also served a plate of complimentary Peppermint Macarons, Salted Caramel candies, and Pate de Fruits. Service was good, but not stellar, which I would've expected from a restaurant like Providence. One waiter was great--he was friendly, knew the menu well, and gave his suggestions on which dishes to choose. Another waiter, however, wasn't as friendly and attentive. Valet parking is available, but my boyfriend and I found free street parking only a block away from the restaurant. Although this dinner created a huge dent in my wallet, I was glad to have experienced it. However, it's doubtful that I will go back to this restaurant, considering how expensive it is. For an $85 3-course dinner, I would expect every dish to be amazing, but a few dishes turned out subpar and not worth the price. Despite those dishes, I will still look back on this dining experience with good memories.

I came here on a week night for my birthday dinner.  It wasn't incredibly busy, so I expected better service, heck, even a warm smile.  The waiters appeared tired and sloppy in their over-sized, out dated suits.  We were seated and waited for the menu (this is something I expect to be handed to me as I sit and place my napkin in my lap).  We waited, waited some more, tried to make eye contact.  Very difficult in this dimly lit patio.  Yes, patio.  There are what seems to be 4 walls, but the walls and the ceiling must be a thin fabric because we heard the ambulance sirens twice that evening and had to halt the conversation so that they may pass.  Ever sit 15 feet from a wailing siren and try to talk?  First menu they handed us was the drink menu, then disappeared, came back to finally give us the food menu and our waiter was quite short and rude to my guest when he inquired about the food.  I've been to Michelin stared restaurants before and the service here was not up to par. On to the food.  This redeemed my experience a bit.  We ordered the 5 course market menu and a couple of amuse bouches.  The following is what was placed on our table (with a 1-5 rating): 1.  Vodka grapefruit bubble.  Similar to the Bazaar's one with the olives, but this one was 10 times better... I did notice the membrane was thicker and not as easy to pop. (5) 2.  Crispy Salmon Skin with Smoked Salmon Dip.  (2) 3.  Squash soup.  First time I had soup from a shot glass with a straw.  Fancy!  The flavors were great, very multi dimensional, especially love the crispy breadcrumbs on top that taste like mini mini bacon bites. (4) 4.  Jampanese Kampachi.  Nothing super memorable.  I'm sure I ate it all.  (3) 5.  Scallops.  Bar none the best scallops, I have ever had.  Great crust, super soft inside, and I loved the sauce. (4) 6.  Sea Bass.  Lacked flavor and had me reaching for the salt. (1) 7.  Veal Tenderloin.  The spacing of the dishes were too far a part.  it had me tired and cranky by the time this dish came out.  I was hungry and just wanted to go home.  I had a taste of each item and I didn't care for it.  In fact, I was thinking about drive through for the Taco Bell cool ranch shelled tacos. (1) 8.  Dessert.  This is where I got lazy and stopped asking what were putting on the table.  Something that looked like a glob of whipped cream.  I ate it all, so it had to be a (4) at the least. 9.  Macaron/caramel/sugar gel cube. (2) When a high amount is paid for a dinner, the expectations are up and something as small as service plays a huge part.  Orchestrated like a fine dance.  I was not pleased, and I would not be back.  3 stars is fair in my book.  If I happen to be invited back here again and they change some things, I am definitely open to giving them the 5 stars they think they deserve.

When I travel to the USA, I find the Michelin a good starting point to find good fine dining establishments. Unfortunately, Michelin stopped publishing their Los Angeles guide in 2010 because the locals apparently "prefer to select the restaurant based not on the number of Michelin stars, but based on the number of stars who go to the restaurant" However, flicking through the 2009 MIchelin guide to LA, I found that Providence held 2 stars and was highly recommended as one of the best fine dining spots in town, so I duly booked up Coming from the UK, we have been sold the Hollywood view that LA is all super glamorous and I was a little surprised to find that Providence was located in a little less than super glamorous location However, the friendly service soon made me feel welcome in the restaurant. Unfortunately, the main problem for the evening can be best appreciated by looking at my photos. My table was located in such a dark corner of the restaurant that I couldn't really read or even see the food properly. Note to restauranteurs - if your guest is having to use his cellphone light to read your menu, your lighing is too dim! I went with the market menu, which is meant to showcase the best of the ingredients that the kitchen has available that day. Unfortunately, I was unable to make any notes like I usually do as it was too dark! So, I can't remember the individual dishes suffice to say that I don't have any strong memories from my meal 2 years ago or of any particular outstanding dishes I remember leaving with a 3 star satisfaction rating and hoping that Melisse would be better

***Providence is my favorite LA restaurant and their lunch tasting menu is a good way to experience this high-end restaurant*** Providence is the one LA restaurant that can compete with Bay Area fine dining spots in terms of quality, creativity and presentation.  I will often get the tasting menu at those Bay Area restaurants, but I tend to go a la carte at Providence.  Providence's a la carte menu showcases great produce and proteins (with peak season and high quality fish and shellfish that are often only at the restaurant for a short period of time). Providence does offer a nice tasting menu though and their 5-course lunch tasting menu is actually less expensive than the same dinner tasting menu.  The tasting menu typically consists of a sashimi course, a scallops course, a fish course, a veal course, and a dessert. I opted for this menu and it started (the same as the a la carte menu) with a series of amuses.  They were all great.  There was a nice punch from their vodka and grapefruit gel.  There was a nice gougere as well as great crispy salmon skin with smoked salmon dip. The best amuse though was the Tahitian squash soup with espuma, maple syrup, bourbon, sherry vinegar, and breadcrumbs.  It might be the best soup I've had at Providence.  The warm squash soup went very well with all the other ingredients; everything stood out; there was a nice mix of sweet, salty, bitter, and acidic (great textures too like creamy espuma and crispy and crunchy breadcrumbs). The first course was soft, fresh and moist wild Japanese kampachi with smoked apple juice, daikon and Anaheim peppers.  The kampachi was higher quality than what you could get at most upscale sushi restaurants and the smoked apple juice was very good.  It had both a sweet and tart apple flavor as well as a noticeable smoky accent (really unique). The second course was seared Nantucket bay scallops with perfectly cooked root vegetables, meaty and flavorful la quercia bacon, creamy turnip puree, and a sweet brown butter powder.  Though I am more of a fan of diver sea scallops, this was actually my favorite scallops dish at Providence because it was the first one that truly combined perfectly cooked scallops with great garnishes. http://www.yelp.com/user… The scallops had a great crispy sear, but they were still soft and moist.  There were a lot of elements on the plate, but everything came together very well to make this a truly exceptional shellfish dish. The third course was wild black sea bass with tender fingerling potatoes, spinach and stinging nettle veloute.  The sea bass was very good--moist, nicely seasoned and flaky.  The garnishes were great and they were light but still very flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/user… The fourth course was veal tenderloin and it was the only course that I did not love.  The garnishes of nicely caramelized shallots, broccolini and nori breadcrumbs were all fine, but the veal could have been more medium rare.  The veal was very tender from the sous vide cooking process and it was still moist, but I would have preferred more of a red center.  Tenderloin can often be a little bland in flavor so I would have also preferred a richer sauce. The fifth course was a warm chocolate chiboust with spice cake, sour cream, toffee, and toasted milk ice cream.  Desserts are often prepared in advance because people just will not wait long enough for a true made-to-order dessert so I enjoyed the freshly baked topping to the cake, which was moist, light, warm, and souffle-like.  I also liked the creamy ice cream and crunchy toffee. http://www.yelp.com/user… I ordered two additional plates.  I had the Wild Alaskan King Crab, which was exceptional.  It was soft and moist and served with juicy beets, crispy beet chips and Meyer lemon. http://www.yelp.com/user… I also had the carrot cake, which was served with creamy and very flavorful carrot ice cream, carrot chips, coconut, candied ginger, and cara cara oranges.  It was a great showcase for carrot and enhanced versions of familiar carrot cake garnishes.  It was one of the best desserts I've ever had. http://www.yelp.com/user… Service was great as always--very professional but also very personable.  The food came out at a great and even pace. Prices are high, but lunch does offer some savings over dinner. Providence continues to put out elegant, exquisite, creative, and delicious food.  Their great scallops dish, wonderful crab dish and amazing carrot cake dessert truly show how Providence competes with the best fine dining restaurants in the country. There is free parking on the street.

When a dinner for 2 is gonna run you over $300, you expect only the best of the best and your expectations are very high. At Providence you wil get: Another overhyped, grossly overpriced LA place. Dismal at best. This place will run your bill about double it would cost at other fine dining spots in LA. The problem I had with the food was that it was too deconstructed. The separate components didn't work alone, which they always should. Even when properly "constructed" it was a big meeeh for me. The only wow factor of the entire meal was the yummy breads. They also give you a little dish of salt for your butter. KEEP IT, YOU'LL NEED THE SALT FOR THE FOOD The food reminded me a lot of Bazaar, and that's not a compliment in any way. The food was rather bland and forgettable. The crab dish-- overly deconstructed, lacking flavor, and boring as hell The beef dish-- wasn't too bad, but the bone marrow thing was just strange. I expected some yummy bone marrow butter inside but it didn't, it had what tasted like Stove-top stuffing inside The desserts (there was a chocolate one and a creme fraiche thing)-- The presentation was absolutely awful. Their take on gastronomy and deconstruction was a big fail. The creme fraiche dessert thing literally looked like a plate of shaving cream. FAIL I would never come back and my date also agreed he would never come back. It's simply not up to par with the quality of food that should be served for the price. Want to have a good meal at a better LA fine dining spot with a Michelin star? Head out to Hatfield's, you won't regret it.

went there for lunch with my buddy for his birthday, kinda disappointed!  heard great things about this place so i expected alot and of course for the kind of price i paid i expected more.  The clam chowda was the best i've ever tasted and the almond cake was to die for, but everything in between was just ok.  Had the bass and ny steak, nothing special about it.  Wonder if i could just go for the soup and desert only, haha!

Presentation and service are excellent as advertised. Food, however, was not. Had the 5 course tasting menu but ordered the foie gras a la carte hoping for something more savory and flavorful. Left very full but disappointed. And if it feels like you're eating in someone's house, it's because you are. Hatfields is a cheaper and tastier alternative...or Melisse for a few bucks more.

Food: The food matches the fame! We had the 5 course market menu which also comes with 2 small complementary bites before. The Japanese Kanpachi, the veal, and the Harry's berries dessert were mind-blowing good. The scallops and sea bass were good but didn't wow me as much. I also had the oysters, which were always divine...My boyfriend added the uni dish, which he did like as much (it was a warm dish while he enjoys cold uni). The really amazing thing was that the food was not only good but interesting that I found myself thinking about the flavors/textures even a day later. Drinks: My boyfriend got the wine pairing which was actually a good deal. You get a small half glass for every dish and they were mostly whites (of course, it is a seafood place). I got a cocktail called "roe me a river". It has rum, grapefruit and citrus juice etc. It was pretty good as well. Service: It was actually pretty slow, which was odd considering how many servers they have. We waited a while between dishes and after we finished for the check. I wonder if this is intentional for us to take our time tasting/thinking about the dishes? My boyfriend and I are fast eaters so we would like the wait to be a little shorter between dishes. But if you want to fully enjoy the place and don't want to be rushed, this might not be a problem for you. We went to Le Bernardin earlier last year and the service was at a much faster pace. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a wonderful dining experience.

4 stars, 5 stars...I honestly just get it. I was really looking forward to the dining experience of a lifetime...unfortunately, this was not the case. The atmosphere was pretty and quaint...similar to any other upscale restaurant. I tried the 6 course tasting menu.  Long story short, the dishes looked lovely but I never fully understood what was so amazing.  I kept looking forward to the next course hoping that THAT would be the one that made me understand why the people were ranting and raving...but no.   Hey, maybe my palate just isn't sophisticated enough to understand why a scallop dish with some watermelon and pistachio was considered hands down, to die for. For the price, I would 100% go someplace else...if you want this type of foodie experience try The Baazar...at least you'll get a better atmosphere too.

I'm a foody, and I really REALLY want to love this place, but I don't get it.  High end gourmet dining, love.  Location?  Not so high end (but that's la, you walk two blocks in any direction you're in the ghetto). Service? Very good.  Decor?  SO DARK!  I could barely read the menu let alone see my tiny plates of food! Price?  Overpriced.  I have no problem paying $200+ per diner if the experience is worth it, but the food was forgettable and mostly flavorless.  I've had better at $5 entree hole-in-the-walls.  I just don't get the hype.

The myth......the mayhem....the restaurant. That's right, the great Providence! How many LA restaurants are awarded 2 Michelin stars? Not many, but Providence sets itself apart by being one of them! And those stars are well-earned! Decor The decor is elegant and romantic, perfect for a night out with your significant other. It's also get for business meetings and just about everything else. It's warm, inviting and invigorating. The colors stimulate the senses, especially taste, and I'm sure that was the plan! Options They offer a number of courses and tasting menus and there's definitely something for everyone. We went with the 9-course tasting menu and here a couple of highlights. I recommend doing the wine pairing too! Wild Striped-Bass The presentation was breath-taking and the dish itself is remarkable, a true culinary delight. The flavors bounce around your palate and settle with a delicate touch. The bass melts in your mouth and the flavors are brilliant. Kumamato Oysters These are salty and briny and easy to become addicted to. They were extremely fresh, delicate, shucked to perfection and presented beautifully. Kumamato and Fanny Bay are my favorite oysters so these hit the spot. Wild Main Lobster Oh.......my......god, delicious! This dish was heaven on a plate, seriously. The butter was so delicately browned and flavorful, the lobster was cooked to perfection, and the mushrooms were to die for. This was the BEST lobster dish I've had in Los Angeles hands down. Downsides Two of the courses had foam. I am NOT a fan of foams, they look like snot. I was so annoyed when Marcelle on Top Chef kept putting foam on everything. I think they should lay off the foam, it's been done and it makes you seem like you're trying to hard.

Fine dining experience at it's best! I had dinner here last week for the last reservation of the night. It's a cool looking spot. When you enter.. they have a really romantic low lit setting. Be prepared to spend some good money here. This is great food, art, and amazing service as well. You must order from one of the pre fixe meals. I went with the 3 courses which ended up as a 7 course meal anyways. Our first dish was the spicy tuna taco in a green leaf. The small bite was delicious. The shot of squash soup was pleasantly good and I don't even like squash. The salmon crispy skin for the salmon cream dip was wonderful. I ate it all up! The three breads were next. Seaweed bread, bacon roll, and white roll. The white was the softest and easiest to eat. It also came with sea salt and butter. The bacon roll had a good hint and the 3rd bread was okay. We had thise Greyhound shot. It was grapefruit and vodka. It came on a spoon in a gelitan looking ball. It was delicious! My first ordered dish was the freshwater eel. It had chicken and risotto in it as well. My favorite! Lots of flavor and made me wanting more. Main course I had the Monkfish. I didn't like this at all. Probably my worst dish of the night. It had a weird scent and the taste was too fishy for me. Dessert. I had the carmelia dessert. The ice cream was the good part. The chocolate was good but a little too much. The final part was the macaron, dark chocolate, and sugar chewy cube. Overall a great dining experience that wow'd me! I enjoyed it!

Let me make one thing clear here: Providence puts the 'experience' in true dining experience.   I have been to Providence on over twenty different occasions and every time beats out the last.  I never used to consider myself a "seafood guy" until I dined at Providence.  Providence takes what used to feel bland about seafood and has turned it into something extraordinary - quality you won't find anywhere else.  I must also mention that Providence servers never go wrong.  I always allow the waiters at Providence to order for me and NEVER let anyone order for me. My last meal was comprised of the wild japanese sardines, a delicate little treat decorated with smoked celebrity tomato and sensational piquillos cooked with lardo de bellotta.  This starter was paired with the live scallop sashimi, a dish that offered great balance to the tastes the sardines had supplied.  My main course was the liberty farms duck breast with smoked rosa bianca eggplant pur chanterelles and brown turkey fig.  I have never tasted duck that has combined a sweet tenderness along with a vibrant crunch like I did at Providence.  I finished my light meal off with the artisanal cheese board, my favorite dessert. Unlike most restaurants, Providence doesn't rely on foolish tricks, I come to Providence when I want to be treated.

Absolutely amazing experience! This has to rank as one of the best restaurants that I've ever been to and I plan to come back soon. When my family got to the restaurant, the receptionist(?) told us that the chef's table was available if we wanted. It's this small, private that has a glass wall/door so that you can view the kitchen as they work. Pros - Japanese Kanpachi - Grey Goose bubble - Harry's berries - Scallops - Cod - Veal Cons - None! The meal was very well-paced and the service was excellent. I usually don't care about service but I just felt like this restaurant went above and beyond. The food was absolutely delicious too! We got to meet the chef afterwards and he was really personable. Our top 3 dishes were the kanpachi, the amuse bouche bubble and the dessert Harry's berries (?) which was this strawberry + creamy deliciousness. It might have been the best dessert that I've ever had. I'm not a fan of chocolate so I don't enjoy  most desserts. We got the chef's tasting menu but the shorter 6-course one. It came with 2 amuse bouches before and a small platter of desserts afterwards. It wasn't too bad at 105/person. I'll be back again!

I took my husband here for his birthday.  This is definitely a special occasions place.  I know he's never been here before (neither have I) so it was definitely a place I wanted to take him. A really nice touch was Providence printing "Happy birthday, James" on our menus.  I thought that was a really nice touch.  :) We both got the Chef's tasting menu complete with wine pairing.  Head's up - each course more or less comes with its own glass of wine.  That's key to remember. I wish I could tell you what I thought of each course but, to be completely honest, we were fall-down-drunk toasted. I think there was 16 courses.  We were full by course number 10.   Here is what I do remember : 1.  I am so happy I had the foresight to call a taxi service that night because we never would've gotten home after dinner. 2.  Each course was tiny, maybe 2-3 mouthfuls per course.  You wouldn't think you'd be stuffed and about to bust out of your cute date outfit but trust me.  To this day, I'm still surprised I didn't explode. 3.  The wine was delicious.   4.  "I can't wait to go back" was the last thing I thought right before I passed out in bed. The next day, we tried to piece together our night but the only thing that stood out was that we had a blast, we loved the food when we were eating it and we are looking forward to going back again.

I dined here last Saturday for a gf's birthday and it was, again, fantastic. It's been awhile since I dined at Providence and I was so ready for a return trip. This time around we opted for the seasonal 7 course tasting menu. i HIGHLY recommend going with the seasonal tasting, especially if you've had the chef's full tasting before. The items on this menu change seasonally, hence the name, and I think it 's even better than the full 16 course tasting menu. Why? You won't feel like you're insanely full afterwards, but still get to try the amazing dishes that really highlight the seasonal ingredients. I started off the meal with a cocktail that had grapefruit roe in it. Very clever and tasty. For the meal, the boys split a few beers between them. I can't remember the names, but they were very good. As for the food, here is what we ate: amuse bouche 1: greyhound spheres -  The spheres were a nice opening to the meal. A staple amuse of Providence, I always look forward to these. amuse bouche 2: scallop taco with shiso leaf - The rice crackers mixed in with the scallops added great texture, while the shiso leaf added a brightness to the bite. amuse bouche 3: squid, chorizo and abalone skewers - The abalone was cooked perfectly and great texture, not chewy at all. The squid and chorizo was a nice flavor combination of oceanic and richness. amuse bouche 4: salmon skin chips and trout roe dip - Awesome idea for chips and dip! I loved how the chips were salmon skin; it was salty and super crispy. The trout roe dip was full of flavor and so addicting. I could've eaten the whole dip by myself. course 1: wild fluke sashimi, grapefruit, cucumber - Our first course was absolutely beautiful, as well as delicious. It was very light and a good introduction to the meal to come. course 2: uni duo, uni canape with lardo and black truffle and Santa Barbara uni in a farm fresh egg - MY FAVORITE!! The uni in the egg dish has ALWAYS been a favorite of mine, but when this uni duo dish came out I knew I had died and gone to uni heaven! The uni canape with lardo and black truffle was amazingly fatty and delicious. But still, the uni in the egg is the better dish. Favorite course! course 3: salt roasted Santa Barbara spot prawns - Simplicity at its best. This dish truly highlighted the main ingredient - the prawns. The table-side presentation is impressive enough, but the dish itself is ridiculously good. The sweetness of the prawns are brought out by the olive oil and lemon. Simple and perfect. course 4: Nantucket Bay scallops, arugula, hazelnuts, bacon - This was probably my least favorite dish. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but thought it was missing some acid. I sure love me some citrus. course 5: black winter truffle risotto - Another fantastic and superb dish! They were not stingy with the truffles either! They shaved a good amount on top of the risotto. It was perfectly cooked and was oozing earthy and cheesy goodness. course 6: kamikubo farm wagyu beef A5 (Kagoshima, Japan), baby carrots, spring onion, charred onion vinaigrette - OMG. This dish was a VERY close favorite from the uni. The beef was extremely juicy and absolutely tender - amazing dish. A little bit of the charred onion vinaigrette combined with the beef paired beautifully together. So delicious and a definite MUST-ORDER. pre-dessert: tangerine sorbet, avocado - Before our last course, we were given a pre-dessert of tangerine sorbet with avocado. The sweetness of the avocado complemented the tartness of the tangerine very well. I love sorbets, so there was no way I wouldn't like this. course 7 (dessert): huckleberry syrup and sorbet, lemon meringue, tarte fromage - Our last course was a dessert that wasn't too sweet and more focused on tartness, which I love. I thought the tarte fromage was just OK, but the huckleberry sorbet and syrup with it was fantastic. We ended the night with mignardises of cayenne caramel, raspberry macarons and pineapple rum petit fours. What a great meal... as always. Chef Michael Cimarusti is a genius! I love him so much! If you haven't gone, please go now and get the seasonal tasting menu!

Came here for a 10pm reservation on the friday after Vday.  No 9-14 course tasting menus.  Just a 7 course tasting menu $155/person and pre fixe menu $85/person.  We did the pre fixe menu. We received 2 amuses each. One was a Tahitian squash soup with bourbon foam, spiced bread crumbs and micro chives with a lil puff ball of parm!  yummy!!! The 2nd amuse was the salmon skin chip with a smoked salmon dip.  I'm not big salmon so it was just ok to me. Choice of breads were nori focaccia, plain white, and this little pillow of bacon fluffiness. MMMmmm!!!! Now you know which one's my fav =) I wasn't drinking alcohol so we asked the waiter if they would be able to make a good virgin drink, and that they did.  Blood orange with pomegranate and lime juice.  I had mentioned I liked sweet drinks so it was definitely on the sweeter side but still good. $7 BF's 1st course: lobster 2 ways: one good sized piece served on top of a nori creme fraiche I believe and the other in small pieces along the length of an avocado something or other with spaghetti like strips of heart of palm. Avocado on its own was salty but was better with the buttery lobster and strands of veg. Sauce down the middle was a tabasco and lobster roe. Can't fail with lobster($10 supplemental) BF's Main course: prime new York steak with mixed veg (cippolini onions, baby turnips, etc.) and bone marrow.  This was plated table side on a cart.  Definitely enjoyed watching the plating. Steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and seasoned just right.  I wish I could say the same about the bone marrow.  On first bite, it felt like I had just eaten a spoon of salt.  Thankfully the waiter asked us how everything was.  When I mentioned the saltiness of the marrow, he had the kitchen make us another, which was definitely less salty but still on the salty side.  ($10 supplemental) my 1st course: scallop ceviche with rhubarb.  Hmm maybe this was a decomposed ceviche because it didn't look like ceviche at all. I didn't love this dish, just liked. I'd probably order seared scallops before this one but the table side adding of the vinaigrette and olive oil were a nice touch. my main course: duck breast with shitakes, burdock root, hibiscus sauce. Duck breast was cooked perfectly but I could have done with a different sauce.  I think it was lacking something to give it more depth.  I've never tried burdock root, at least not to my knowledge...made the bf try it and he spit it out...haha kinda chewy...maybe I wasn't supposed to eat it...idk Dessert: huckleberry sorbet or ice cream with little pieces of spongy cheesecake.  Huckleberries were a little too tart for me and the cheesecake was too eggy. BF's dessert was way better; decomposed carrot cake with coconut frosting. Delish!!! Check came out with 2 peppermint macarons, 2 crimson berry jelly squares, and 2 wrapped caramels with pink peppercorns. Macarons and jelly squares were meh.  Caramels were good but I've never had pink peppercorns so I didn't really taste any peppery flavor. I want to come back for the 9 course tasting menu but hopefully for the price, everything is yumful. Service was great.  There's only a one person restroom for women and one for men FYI. k...that was my longest review ever, at least that's what it feels like.  The END!

Teetering on a five star rating but it came in a little short, mostly because I've been to slightly better places, though they also probably cost more. All in all, this place is legit and I'd come back. My lady took four ba-thousand pictures so I was thinking I'd have all of the details ready for my review, but she's passed out on my bed - as usual - so this one is going to have to be from memory. Which is a bad thing for all of you out there. I killed a bottle of wine almost by myself and had a cocktail to start the dinner. And two before we drove there. So it may be a little hazy. The wine was a Godello, if you're interested. Decent. Somehow I have only had this varietal on a plane, and it tasted a little better up there. Back on earth, it was just alright. Maybe it was the actual wine, not the grape. I'll try again. Maybe on a mountaintop, to simulate the middle ground. There was a veal dish that was just about as great as a meal that involves a nearly tortured baby animal can taste. Damned good. There was an uni dish that was served in a hollowed eggshell that looked like it ran into some of the bad Native Americans in Dances with Wolves. The Pawnees. If you get this reference, you are my friend. If you don't ... you are still my friend. But you are less cool than my other friend who I just mentioned. The bathroom lock in the men's room - because that's where I go to the bathroom - turns the wrong direction. Counter-clockwise. Now, you may say, "Is that wrong? Maybe clockwise is wrong." No. It's wrong. Otherwise they wouldn't need a professionally printed sign next to the door that explains how to lock it. Why don't you just buy a lock that fits into regular society? The lock guy probably owns the sign company. Racketeer. Last item to mention. The macaroons. Hella bomb. Though it was the first macaroon I have ever had. So take that with a grain of almond flour. Three of us split the bill and it came to $240 each, all in, for four people. That's $720 total if you don't have your abacus handy. If that type of money is worth spending on food, in your opinion, then go here. It's worth it. If it's not, then stop reading my review, weirdo. This was way too long of a read just for the hell of it. Though I am flattered. Thank you, friend.

I would give this place a solid 4 - 4 1/2 stars, but with the service and attention to detail, I'll bump it up.  I came here for my birthday, and they made up menus with my name on it and gave them to me to take home. I would give this place 4 stars because not every food item was a hit, and for the price, it should be...  (We did the 5 course and added a few things): Bread - nori bread, bacon bread, and white bread were all great! Amuse bouche - Tahitian squash soup was good, the gougere was delightful, and the crispy salmon skin chips with salmon dip was also good. Kampachi with smoked apple sauce - One of the table's fave dishes.  Simple yet complex in flavor.  The smoke hit you in the face but was smooth and sweet on the palate. Scrambled egg with uni - Best spoonful bite.  I love uni and butter, so this was delicious.  They don't skimp out on the uni either.  (We added this to the 5 course meal) Ugly bunch - abalone, geoduck, and uni on top of a creme fraiche flan.  BEAUTIFUL and oceany good.  (Big enough to share.  We added this as well to the 5 course meal) Scallop with winter veggies - perfectly cooked and the veggies were seasonal and fresh. Seabass with heirloom spinach - least favorite dish at the table.  The seabass was just ok; didn't really like it crusted. The foam was too buttery  that it almost ruined the dish for me. Veal with meyer lemon butter - Tender and the meyer lemon was a great touch.  I couldn't finish this dish because after the seabass, my body didn't want to consume anymore butter.  Haha. Chocolate with ice cream and toffee - One of my fave dishes.  It was crunch, creamy, chocolatey, perfect. Petit Four - The macarons were ok, but were refreshing. The pepper cinnamon caramel was awesome. The earl grey gelee was great. Everything was a touch salty and buttery. Overall, the drinks were well balanced and tasty.  The ambiance/decor is a little outdated and minimal, but cozy enough.

**400th Review!!** Probably THE best wining and dining experience I have ever had. The service is unbelievable.  Every time I went to the bathroom and someone was in my way they moved out of my way and apologized profusely...I was like what's going on?? The sommelier was HILARIOUS and very knowledgeable about the wines he was pouring - LOVED DANIEL! We ordered the tasting menu with a wine pairing [to share] and the adventure began You can read all of the reviews about the food but this restaurant is something else.

Went to this restaurant  a few months ago with a friend and had a bad experience.  Before we even finish our meal, the maitre d approached us and asked for the credit card we are going to use to pay.  Now, granted at this point we haven't even received the bill for the meal, so were blindly giving this guy our credit card without even knowing how much the meal costs. I been to other high end restaurants in the L.A. area and not once were we ever have to show a card to pay the bill. Because of this bad experience, I can't even remember how good or bad the food was. It definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.

A culinary experience.  There's so much thought behind the ingredients and flavor pairings and food presentation, it's worth a visit.  Believe it or not this was my first experience with amuse bouche. They rotate, but on this occasion it was seafood themed and there was foam.  Another first for me. I'd say this place really kick-started the Foodie in me.  After Providence it was on to Craft, Jar, AOC, Mozza..... Providence is a champion among the LA dining heavy weights. The dining rooms are intimate and the staff is refined without being stuffy.  It's been several years since I've been back, but it was a true food occasion and I'd recommend it if you're looking for a meal with true creativity and the freshest ingredients. p.s. don't pass up dessert. Some of the finest you'll experience in LA....

There is only one thing to say about Providence. It's simply the best restaurant in Los Angeles by miles and miles. Chef Michael Cimarusti is brilliant. Do the market menu or the chef's tasting menu and if you like wine get that as well. It's a pretty penny especially for the latter with wine, but for what you get I promise it's a bargain. Food like this is very complicated, time consuming - life consuming. No one in Los Angeles is this inventive - it's simply the best.

We had the 9 course tasting menu and it was nothing short of incredible. Notable dishes included the seared scallop and veal tenderloin. All of the seafood was mind-blowingly fresh and flavorful and the service was amazing. Also, the cheeses were exquisite and delicious as well. All of the restaurant employees were extremely friendly and appropriately social. This place is a gem of Los Angeles and is a must-try. While it is expensive (but not outrageous), you really get a ton of food and the dining experience is more than thorough. Definitely worth saving up for a night of fine dining with friends!

Had the 9 course tasting menu which took around 2.5 hours + to finish. Dishes all contained seafood and meat, and I honestly thought it was just okay since the sauce or seasoning was more sour/sweet, and I honestly just wanted to taste something more mind blowing or different. Coming from Chicago, the land of delicious, exciting and innovative dining, this restaurant was a little bit disappointing. In the end I got so full that I decided not to have the desert. Providence was nice enough to comp me a 12 piece or 9 hand made chocolates and it was surprisingly good. TIP: if you get too full for desert, they will still give you that extra macaroon, and also maybe that chocolate box. :)

This is a hoity-toity restaurant that doesn't mind if you come in wearing jeans, tennis shoes, and a t-shirt (automatic 1 star).  The service is great - I wouldn't expect less from an upscale place on Melrose.  The drinks were soooo good.  The bartenders definitely know what they're doing.  I wish I could remember what I had but I can't.  Some sort of grapefruit sparkling wine thing with little jelly bubbles.  On to the food: Maine Lobster - crushed avocado, heart of palm, coral emulsion, and nori (5 stars) Nantucket Bay Scallops - rhubarb, watermelon radish, pistachio, bronze fennel (4 stars) Wild Norwegian Cod - artichokes braised in white wine, carrots, pearl onion, parsley-jalapeno pistou (4 stars) Prime New York Steak - pee wee potatoes, turnips, tomato confit, bone marrow (5 stars) For dessert I had some pomegranate cranberry goodness and tried some spice cake and vanilla ice cream thingie.  See my pics to enjoy the presentation, this definitely earned them another star.  Everyone in the place turned to us when they were grilling the steak table side.  Before we left they gave us passion fruit macarons, yuzu caramel candies, and vanilla gummies. All in all this was a great dining experience with good food, great service, and beautiful presentation.  Unfortunately it's just not affordable to come often but I'd definitely recommend for a special occasion.

Awww, Providence, I used to love you! Seriously, I used to love this place! (circa 2007) It was simple and sophisticated without trying too hard and the food was just mouth-watering delicious and explosive! For a long time THIS was my FAVORITE restaurant in LA! Unfortunately, not so much anymore. While the decor and the service have remain almost the same, the taste of the food not so much. Last time I was there I opted for the tasting menu and from the amuse-bouche to the main entree something was always off or missing. I never got the "Oh My G!" factor. It made me sad. On the plus side, they do have a bar where you can still get well-made drinks.

Good, mortgage the house and eat there. A year have gone by since i ate there last summer and i still talk about it. The decor is subtle and dark. Service is very good if not impeccable. But the food and that 5 course dessert  is really hard to describe because there is nothing like it anywhere, i mean a 5 course dessert ? The taste is not just great, but exotic, imaginative, outrageous and daring. The prix fix dinner is also ...what is the word..WOW! I am getting hungry thinking about it.

I'd have to say I was disappointed coming here, and my rating would be somewhere between 2 and 3 stars.   My group splurged and went for the 16 course Chef's tasting menu.  Out of the 16 courses, I'd have to say maybe 4-5 of them were hits, the rest were ok.  Also it bears mentioning that I did not come out anywhere near being full, and I consider myself a very light eater.

With over 1200 ratings, I know this place doesn't need another review but I just can't help myself.  Took my BFF here 2 weeks ago for Christmas, birthday, graduation, and any other occasion I could throw in...lol We had the 9 course with the wine pairing and like everyone else says, it was great.  The wine pairing got me buzzed as usual.   The last time I came here with my husband we had the 16 course but opted out of the wine tasting because that would just be gluttony.  Both options are a lot of food so eat a light lunch.  If you decide to get the 16 course, ask for the chef's table.  I only learned this in my recent visit so I will have to go back and try it.  The restaurant seems busier later in the night (9:00 pm) so if you are okay with having an earlier dinner I would suggest it; food comes to the table hotter and the wait staff is more attentive.  But don't get me wrong, the 9:00 pm seating still has great service.   Another reason I love this place is it's not a snotty restaurant and you can wear jeans!

When my friends and I talk about our meals at Providence, we joke around and say, "it's a feast made for Warlords." (inside joke) First, plan on spending some money. You can die tomorrow not being able to experience the unique taste of this fine restaurant. Second, the service at Providence is impeccable. For instance, every time you step away from your table, they will fold your napkin exactly as you first saw it. Third, the menu and prices are subject to change so plan ahead, make reservations, and decide on what set course or tasting menu to encounter (http://www.providencela.…). Our Warlord Feast 1.  Tonight's Wine - PFALZ 2008 Pinot Noir 'S' Dry "Tradition" from Germany. We loved it so much, we ordered more online (http://www.whwc.com/p/31…). 2.  Grapefruit Vodka. What a way to start! 3.  Don't be shy about their bread. They're amazing. You can always ask for more. 4.  Japanese Kampachi - smoked gold rush apple juice, daikon radish, sweet anaheim pepper. 5.  Santa Barbara Sea Urchin - hiding beneath soft scrambled eggs, fine herbes, champagne beurre blanc. 6.  Down East Day Run Sea Scallop - winter vegetables, la querica bacon, hazelnut, blis solera vinegar. 7.  Maine Lobster Nage - chanterelles, tahitian squash, black truffle. 8.  Wild Striped Bass - smoked butter, pee wee potato. 9.  Japanese Kamikubo Farm Wagyu Beef - crushed butterball potatoes, baby carrots, spring onion, charred onion vinaigrettte. 10.  Persimmon Sorbet - verjus, yogurt, black sesame. 11.  Market Cheeses. 12.  Warm Chocolate Chiboust - spiced cake, sour cream, toffee, toasted milk ice cream. Chris Eats Here. Why? The presentation is magnificent. The aura of this restaurant is superb, perfect for any special occasion. Dine with the best of friends or share that canny date with someone special. Ranks among the Top 50 list of any true Yelper. bon appétit.

I love it when I'm wrong, particularly when it means discovering a place I once wrote off as pure hype.  The Michelin stars don't lie, but sometimes this girl is a doofus. We got the three course prix fixe for $85. It sounds pretty basic, especially compared to the nine and 16-course menus (I don't like uni, or slimy textures in general, and it seems like it's pretty unavoidable on some of the other menus.), but Providence goes all out on the amuses, and the bread is something to behold: bacon brioche, nori foccacia, olive roll. Three courses end up being more like six, and you really want to have room for dessert, because that's also a piece of work. But first the beverage. Kentuckian(I think)--bourbon, apple brandy, and probably something fancy that escapes me. I loved every sip. Not the most gorgeous drink; it didn't have to be.  I wasn't intentionally nursing it, but it lasted the entire two-hour meal.  (Didn't realize that Monday is free corkage night either!) The first amuse is a tuna taco. I won't pretend like I remember what renders it  special, but the texture and lingering taste, not to mention the presentation, made this girl giddy. Amuse 2: Squash soup in a shot glass and cheese puff. Perfect for a cold night. (Tuna taco who?) Bread! Light of my life, fire of my loins! Crackly crack crackers and trout mousse. Best with the foccacia. Chowda'! My sin, my soul. Now this, this is a gift from the gods.  Even before tasting it, I knew I would never be the same. The sparkly eyed Armani model soused the soup over the naked clams, bacon and other foreign fattiness. I was touched for the very first time when the spoon's heart beat next to mine. I could have gone home happy (delirious) then. But we had our main courses: various types of sea bass with various levels of aesthetic loveliness.   And then there's the dessert: Huckleberries, Sunflower (This! This is the one! Look around the room and notice the resemblance on the walls.), and a cassis tarte. Mignardises included early grey macaroons, a gelatin thing, and a tubular caramel. The service is excellent, but verging on uncomfortable--still like a secret service detail.  I have a sincere question though, when the waiter is explaining the menu (the unabridged version), do you make eye-contact with him, or do you stare at the menu? I alternate, but I'm never comfortable.  Ever. You'll be here at least two hours. Enjoy!

I finally made it to Providence. Most of the time I'm in LA i go to hippier & trendier places. I finally had a couple of foodies with me, so I had an excuse to go to Providence. This is, easily, the best restaurant in Los Angeles. I'm not even sure why a restaurant this good is in LA. Its Le Bernardin West......just more exciting. From the El Bulli esque spherical Pinapple Vodka shot, to the ridiclous Uni-Scrambled egg-Brioche in egg shell....the spot prawns, Nancy's scallop etc. We had them substitute the Japanese Wagyu for the Veal......it was ridiculously good.....even with a $70 supplement. The Cheese course was one of the best I've had in years PS-Did I mention the Squash soup shooter amuse? Why is Michael Cimarusti not mentioned more as one of the countries great chef's? If he were in NY he'd be a legend.

Good service, can't say the same about the food. I know that when a person comes to a restaurant such as Providence, they go for the flavors and the experience. When I came to Providence I had a very mixed experience. The service was very nice, everyone answered all my questions I had, because let's face it, not everyone will know every ingredient on the menu unless you're a strong chef. The one thing I didn't like was the extra's they brought out and explained super quickly and left. Other than that, great service. The food wasn't as I had expected. I know culinary creativity to mix flavors with visual pleasure is key, but a lot of these flavors, although recognized, didn't seem to really sync together. I have to admit though, the Chowda' was very, very good. I think it just depends on what you order, some of these dishes were amazing while the others were sadly not so very good. Came here with my girlfriend and she ordered the john dory while I ordered the main lobster. The lobster came out of its shell in a creative little salad, came recommended by the waiter, unfortunately it wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. I tried a piece of my girlfriends john dory, whatever it was wrapped around gave it an awful aftertaste, and her salad didn't seem to be very good either, was a very strange mix of bacon and what looked like seaweed. The flavors weren't complementing each other. Maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes, but our experience wasn't what we'd hoped it would be. Hopefully for others it's better.

First Impression:  The hostess was very pleasant.  We were early so she escorted us to the bar and came to get us when our table was ready.  The bar was nice and the bartender very polite.  The service was prompt and the drinks (I had the ford cocktail) were great.  There was a unanimous decision that all the cocktails were made to perfection. After drinks we were escorted to our table.  I was not particularly impressed with the decode.  It was a bit on the needs renovation end of the spectrum.  Our server seemed quite stiff and a bit overly pretentious and not at all friendly/welcoming. We did order cheese to start and the cheese service was fun, informative and really delicious.  If you do go here - try the cheese. We ordered the 3 course menu.  I had the hawaiian tuna and we also got risotto with crab.  The tuna was not particularly flavorful and the risotto was undercooked.  As of now we were unsure how this place got even one michelin star.  Previous places with stars we have dined at wowed from the get go but we let it slide. The bread is delicious!  The crispy salmon skin with mousse is a bit on the salty side but creative.  They also bring a little soup/mousse which was good at first sip but ended up being also a tad too salty although I will say that I am quite sensitive to salt. The main course:  I had the sea urchin - it is tasty but this may be the smallest dish I have ever eaten.  The lobster was so so and the steaks were not cooked properly.  I expected that the restaurant would understand what rare means but it took a bit of explaining.  There was a bone marrow reduction and I was a bit appalled that the waiter put his nose very close to it and sniffed it at the table before setting it down in front of us.  Overall, the main course failed to impress. Desert:  I had the huckleberry with ice cream and it was absolutely delicious.  They also bring a plate of chocolates and macaroons and I was really disappointed by those.  I adore macaroons but these were neither fresh nor tasty. I was so disappointed in the service that I did not even bother asking the waiter for coffee although I usually like it to complete a meal. Overall:  Overall I was impressed with the bar but not at all with the food or table service.  I would definitely not classify this as fine dining, pretentious perhaps, but far from fine dining as neither the food, atmosphere or service is up to par.  I will not return and do not recommend.

The food was pretty good.  If it were a normal restaurant (price, status, etc) I would give 4, but it isn't.  For a meal that was $140 a pop, I expected it to be far more inventive and simply taste better. I was visiting from SF, so perhaps I had unreasonable expectations (I haven't dined in LA much), and was comparing it to the tasting menus here.  Overall this doesn't compare favorably to my most recent other tasting menus: Commonwealth ($70), Commis ($75), La Folie ($100) etc.  Maybe it was an off-day, looks like the menu has since changed only a few days later. The service was very good and attentive. No complaints there.

I was FINALLY able to make it out to Providence! I had friend visiting from out of town that I hadn't seen in a few years so my girlfriend and I wanted to take them somewhere tasty AND classy. Well providence fits the bill. It's definitely $$$$ but so worth it. I added pictures of every course, please check them out! So the way its structured is that you either chose the dinner option or one of the tasting menus. The dinner option is  $85 for one item from the "appetizer", "first course" and "main course" sections. The other options are the tasting menus, which are either 5 course ($105/$150 with wine pairing), 9 course ($130/$190 with wine pairing) or 16 course ($175/$270) which is at the chef's discretion. The 9 course are what you see on the right side of the menu, so if you chose 5 course you simply chose 5 of those 9 items (2 appetizers, 2 main entrees, one dessert). They also have seasonal selections that you can substitute with. If you are in a group you must all choose the same number of courses and odd substitutions are highly discouraged (trust me we asked lol). We decided to go with the 9 course tasting menu with wine pairing. Cocktails/Drinks: 1. Kentuckiana: (see photo) This is the cocktail I chose. It's Bourbon based with honey. Very strong and very tasty. I guess if you are doing a larger tasting menu with wing pairing (9-16 drinks) you may want to skip the cocktails, or you will be catching a cab home. 2. Vodka infused Grapefruit Jello: (see photo) It literally looks like a classy jello shot in a spoon. It was very refreshing, and I don't even like grapefruit. Very little bitterness. GREAT presentation Soup/Bread: 1. Squash soup: (see photo) Came in a large shot glass, warm with a custardy mix on top. This was REALLY tasty, perfect on a chilly night. 2. Bread: (see photo) They had bacon brioche, white bread and foccacia. As fun as the bacon brioche sounds, it was just okay. The bread wasn't really warm which I love, but it wasn't cold either. Appetizers: 1. Salmon mousse spread with fish skin "crackers": (see photo) This had a VERY strong salmon taste. A bit too strong for my liking, one of my least favorite dishes but still good. 2. Japanese Kempachi: (see photo) This was really fresh, felt like a ceviche of sorts. Tangy, tasty fish (raw). They poured a smoked apple juice over it which was REALLY smokey, kind of made my eyes water a bit but didn't stop me from enjoying the dish. Main Courses: 1. Santa Barbara Sea Urchin: (see photo) I know, lots of people don't like sea urchin. My guest tried to substitute this out, but our waiter convinced us to try it and I'm glad he did. First of all, the sea urchin is cooked (poached to be exact, I asked) and its under a "soup-like" mix of soft boiled egg with tasty herb flavoring, served warm. It's also superbly presented inside an eggshell. This was my second favorite dish of the night. I was still able to taste the sea urchin and its texture, but the flavor wasn't overpowering. Apparently this is the only dish that has been around since the restaurants opening 7-8 years ago. HIGHLY recommended! 2. Sea Scallop: (see photo)This was my favorite dish of the evening. The scallop was large, seared to perfection and accompanied by bits of bacon and veggies. Very savory, you HAVE to try it. 3. Wild Main Lobster: (see photo) Cooked with coos coos, really hearty, tangy flavor. I wish it was bigger, so good. 4. Wild Cod: (see photo) This was pan fried, the skin was flavored really well. It's a hearty piece of fish. Good flavor, nothing special. 5. Veal Tenderloin: (see photo) This was probably my third favorite dish. It was the largest portion of the night, cooked medium rare. LOTS of flavor, very savory. I would come back just to try this again. Dessert:: 1.  Cheese: (see photo) They have a large assortment of cheese. We tried the American cheddar, buffalo and Italian white with truffle oil. I really like the buffalo and American cheddar. 2. Persimmon Sorbet: (see photo)  Refreshing, I didn't like the black sesame seed too much though.   3. Warm Chocolate Chiboust: Chocolate cake, toffee and ice cream. Went well together but I don't like toffee too much. Still pretty rich, tasty. 4. Macaroon Plate: This was unexpected, came at the end. The plate had pink macaroons, gel candy cubes and caramel candy which I loved! Wine: Delicious selections to pair with our meals. The staff was uber knowledgeable. Be careful with cocktails AND a wine pairing on 9-15 courses, I was buzzing by the end of the night! This was by far on of the best meals I've ever had. Providence is definitely worthy of its two-star Michelin rating. I still liked the food at Melisse a little bit more, but the food here was still spectacular. The restaurant is divided into smaller private type rooms, real cozy and intimate. They have a nice looking bar (see photo) and their service is top notch. I would definitely come again.

Teetering between 4 and 5 stars, Providence fell short of expectations. We had a wonderful dinner, but service was subpar and dessert was a bit weak. My boyfriend brought me here to celebrate Valentine's Day last night, and we were seated quickly even though we were 15 minutes late for our 6:30 pm reservation. The overall ambience and decor was unexpectedly lacking and underwhelming, considering Providence's high-end status. Cocktails ($15 each) Roe Me Down - a bit sweet, a bit dry, with roe at the bottom Everything Nice - sweet, fruity, very strong Amuse-Bouche Vodka & Grapefruit http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Squash Soup & Cheese Puff http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Crispy Salmon Skin & Salmon Ceviche http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Bread Service I highly recommend the Bacon Brioche!

The ingredients and textures mixed wonderfully and it was a great meal overall. The only plates I weren't particularly fond of were the Market Cheeses (out of four selections, I only liked the Water Buffalo), Tangerine (too sour), and all three mignardises (jelly texture was terrible, caramel candy was too spicy for me, and I don't like peppermint). Service Our server and table attendants were extremely friendly, attentive, and polite. My only disappointment was one of the maître d' (had a thick French accent), who was not only unfriendly, but seemed like he hated his job and didn't want to be there. He never once smiled at us when speaking to us, or serving and introducing our plates. Maybe it's because he's French? Who knows? Apparently there was some confusion and misunderstanding at another table and instead of taking care of it privately and quietly, he decided to speak to the patron so loudly and aggressively, that everyone dining nearby (including us) turned to see what was going on. I felt so embarrassed for the party involved. I didn't appreciate his coldness or rudeness, and even though I had a great time here, I have to say he slightly spoiled the evening. 4.5 stars Michelin: 2 stars (2009)

If you like to dine just for the experience, then this is your place. If in the end you realize that you just need to eat to live, then you'd feel like a fool for compromising blank space on your plate for small portions of food. Off of the list of dishes, you get the impression that this place is very image-oriented but the decore is not up to par. Staff was nice compared to other restaurants but then again, either you eat healthy to live or you live to eat.

My hubby really loves me :D After being whisked away to a perfect vacation he made yet another surprising stop to Providence. We were 30 minutes late to our reservation but Providence didn't make a big deal out of it. After checking in, the kind hostess offered to coat check for me. The atmosphere was very romantic- dim lighting, with partitioned off rooms for added privacy. It wasn't one big open space, as Providence had many different sublets where you could dine. We were led into a room with 4 tables with the other 3 already eating. I opened up the menu and I thought it was odd how there was a section called "happy anniversary.." I thought it was coincidence that they happened to have a menu section happy anniversary when I realized it was hubby who had requested it on our personalized menu! :D So sweet!! Hubby and I both ordered the 16 course chef's tasting menu.. it took a total of 2 and a half hours for our meal to be over. The food was awesome although it leaves you wanting more..  The service is impeccable, I never had to ask for anything ever.. the water was always poured, the wine was always filled... whenever you go to the restroom or away from the table, the servers refold your napkin immediately!! That is crazy. We also got an extra dessert for our anniversary, the sunflower cake. They wished us happy anniversary and I was on cloud 9. Considering this was a Michelin 2 star restaurant, I thought that the dress code would be enforced.. but i saw some people dressed up, others not so much. I'm so glad I was fortunate enough to be taken here and its definitely an experience worth having. Thanks babe for a wonderful dinner and happy anniversary to us.. with many MANY more to come :D

This was my Christmas gift and I'm so glad I chose this restaurant! This place is really SUCH A TREAT! One of the best places I've eaten at... hands down. This restaurant is so discreet from the outside and on the inside, the decor is very simple and clean. We were running late so I called ahead to let them know and we were promptly seated when we arrived. I really liked the fact that they had coat check. We settled on the 9 course market menu and added on oysters. The oysters came out first and there were 2 of 3 different varieties. Of course my favorite were the kumamoto ones! Small, sweet, and super fresh! The 2 different sauces were very light and didn't overpower the oysters at all. Some interesting dishes: Salmon skin chips with dip- chips made from salmon skin were very crispy! A little salty for my taste, but still good with the dip. Greyhound gelee- this was a fun little bite. The gelee burst in your mouth and it really tasts like a greyhound. I wonder how they made this... My favorite dishes: Sea urchin in egg- I personally don't even like sea urchin and I COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS DISH! I mean, every bite was AMAZING... sooooo good. Veal- this was so tender and flavorful. Cooked to perfection Honestly, 9 dishes was A LOT and I only tasted a couple of bites on the last couple of dishes. EVERYTHING was cooked perfectly, but if I do have to mention one negative thing, it would be that some of the dishes were too salty. Also, the desserts weren't exactly my favorite and were just OK. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and gave a great suggestion for a bottle of wine. I thought it was interesting that the wine tasted different at the end of our meal when compared to the beginning... Honestly, this place is totally worth it. It is def a special occasion place and a real treat!

Woohoo, finally.  Providence is everything I had imagined.  Uber-attentive service, amazing, dreamy food and truly beautiful (food paparazzi worthy) plating.  This is the kind of place where you will never ever wonder where your server is. If you don't already know how it works, you can order from the prix fixe menu ($85/guest for a first course, main course and dessert) or a multi-course tasting menu ($105-$270/guest 5-course, 9-course or 16-course meal).  The entire table has to opt in for the same menu.  There are additional items available for a supplemental charge. Our entire meal was just perfect.  Absolutely nothing to complain about except that our meal had to end.  Damn.  Anyhow, we had the prix fixe.  Below is everything my two friends and I dined on that evening (listed in order of slight preference): We had two AMUSE BOUCHES.  One was a fancy cheese puffy thing with a shot of squash soup.  The other was a trout mousse with some fried fish skin strips to spread it on.  Soooo good! ------------------------- FIRST COURSES ------------------------- * Live New Bedford Sea Scallop (Uni, Japanese Sword Squid, Iciban Dashi, Geoduck, Pine Mushroom and Yuzu Zest) * Japanese Freshwater Eel (Buckwheat, Crispy Sweetbreads, Fried Quail Egg and Eel Glaze) * Chowda (Lardo de Bellota, Nueske Applewood Smoked Bacon, Manila Clams and Leeks) ------------------------- SUPPLEMENTAL ------------------------- * Uni Duo (Farm Fresh Egg and California Uni, plus Uni Canape, Lardo, Truffle Butter and Nori Focaccia) ------------------------- MAIN COURSES ------------------------- * Wild Cod (Artichokes Braised in White Wine, Nantes Carrots, Pearl Onions and Parsley-Jalapeno Pistou) * Wild Maine Lobster (Basted in Brown Butter with Juniper and Rosemary, and Matsutake Mushrooms) * Prime New York Steak (Pee Wee Potatoes, Turnip, Tomato Confit and Bone Marrow) ------------------------- DESSERTS ------------------------- * Huckleberries, Soy Milk Bavarois, Vanilla Ice Cream and Matsutake Genoise * Sorbet Flight (Raspberry, Passionfruit and Plum) * Warm Chocolate Chiboust Spiced Cake, Sour Cream, Toffee and Toasted Milk Ice Cream ------------------------- POST-DESSERT (incl) ------------------------- * Raspberry Macarons, Salted Caramel and Passionfruit Gel Chews

4.75 Stars I've heard about Providence for awhile now, and once our friends also expressed interest in checking it out, we made a reservation and went on a Sunday night.   First, location.  I thought my husband inputted the wrong address into our GPS b/c the area appeared a bit sketchy at night.  So in case you think you arrived at the wrong spot, you didn't.  Once we got inside, it was a different world.  Elegant yet not stuffy and staff was excellent and attentive.  They were willing to accommodate moving our table when I could hear the traffic noises from where we were seated.  I got over it.  I think I was just being high maintenance at that moment.   Next, food.  We read the Yelp reviews and ordered accordingly.  All four of us had the Providence Tasting Menu (9 courses) and three of us did the wine pairing.  I believe someone on here mentioned that it was worth it if you planned on getting more than 2 glasses of wine.  I enjoyed every dish we had.  And just an FYI, we had more seafood than red meats, hence more white wines than red.  In the end, we all thought that the wine pairing was not worth it.  Bringing your own bottle or just ordering one separately would have made more sense.  We only really liked one of our wines and the rest were just okay to did-not-finish.  The 9 course tasting menu also took about 3 hours to complete.  Just remember that when you book your reservation! So would I go back?  Definitely.  Now that I've had an introduction to their menu, I would just check out the entrees individually next time.  My hubby and my portion of our meal was about $550 (tax, tip, wine pairing).  Also, some people were dressed up, others weren't.  You can get by doing either!  I preferred being comfortable while I pigged out.   Tl;dr - Enjoyed it, 9 course tasting menu, wine pairing wasn't worth it for us, 2 ppl $550 w/ tax and tip, no need to dress up but you can.

Ate at Providence for dinner a few times with friends and was impressed every time by the combinations of the flavors.  The consistency and ability to deliver is essential for these types of resturants.  Their amuse bouche tastes exactly like a mojito exploding with flavor.  Tried the Chowda, Kumamoto oysters,  foie gras ravioloi, stripped base, wagyu beef (from Australia which was prepared table side & underwhelming & thus 4 stars), lobster & dessert.

Situated in a seedy part of town, lies this once 2-star Michelin restaurant. My husband and I went to Providence to celebrate my birthday. We had an early dinner reservation on a Sunday night - and were seated immediately upon arrival. We ordered the 9-course Providence Market Menu (tasting menu), no wine pairing. Service was excellent (5-stars). The wait staff was very attentive. Decor and ambience (4-stars) Food was great (4-stars) amuses were grapefruit infused vodka and pumpkin soup with brioche, both mediocre. the salmon skin crisp with smoke salmon cream cheese was great course 1, kampachi with daikon radish, fresh and citrus flavored, GOOD course 2, santa barbara uni with soft scrambled eggs, herbs, and champagne, EXCELLENT course 3, maine sea scallop, bacon, hazelnut, solera vinegar, GOOD course 4, maine lobster with israeli cous cous, lobster is EXCELLENT, we could have done without the cous cous (taste like chewy tiny wheat balls) course 5, wild cod, GOOD, taste like any good cod, the pee wee potato side is cooked to perfection, EXCELLENT course 6, veal, cooked sous vide, GREAT, very tender, but the dish was over powered by the amount of lemon butter on the shallot and broccoli trimmings course 7, market cheese, GOOD, if you are a cheese connoisseur, then pick your cheese, we weren't, so we were given a mixed selection, was not impressed. make sure you ask for the jams though, recommend passion fruit course 8, persimmon sorbet, yogurt, black sesame, EXCELLENT course 9, warm chocolate spiced cake, sour cream, toffee, toasted milk ice cream, OK desert. chocolate cake was mediocre and toffee chunks were too large breads were regular, seaweed focaccia, and bacon bread, they were all OK, the butter was hard (the breads should be warmed and butter should be softer) petite fours at end of dinner service was mediocre, the passion fruit macaron were GOOD, the rest were toss aways The restaurant was gracious to print "happy birthday (insert name)" on our menus in celebration of my birthday. :) Overall a solid 4 star restaurant, be prepared to pay $$$$($)

This is my favorite restaurant...ever. There were about 3 years in my decades of vegetarianism where I lapsed and ate fish because I was convinced that I was like Charlie in Flowers for Algernon except lack of protein was causing a cognitive decline. Luckily, one of these lapses coincided with proximity to Providence. Providence food is so incredibly delicious in every way that now and then I have to google tuna fishing videos so that viewing the barbarism functions as an aversion therapy of sorts or else I will find myself going, "Well, it's ok to eat fish again, isn't? I'm sure their nervous systems aren't all that developed [I mean Kurt Cobain said "It's ok to eat fish because they don't have any feelings...], and so long as they are sustainably fished it should be alright..." and come up with all sorts of other rationalizations in attempts to justify a trip deviation from vegetarianism and a trip to Providence [where their fish is sustainably procured, by the way]. All this is just a long, rambling way of saying that their food is so delicious it risks vegetarian apostasy. Really, the best food I have ever tasted. Best. Ever.

After dining at Providence on Christmas Eve, I now have a new and improved expectation as to great service in a fine dining atmosphere.  It was truly impeccable.  This was the best overall experience I have had in a restaurant of this caliber in Los Angeles, and it measured up to Gary Danko in San Francisco (my service gold standard).  I was truly charmed here.  I will hold all future fine dining experiences I am fortunate enough to have up to the level of the meal I had at Providence.

Came here with my hubby last night for my birthday dinner.   Pros:  The food was pretty amazing: I had the scallops as an appetizer, the maine lobster for the entree, and huckleberries for dessert (3 courses @ $85 per person).  The appetizer and entree were pretty small, but they brought out 4-5 other samples from the chef to hold us over.  Why would you pay for the Chef's Tasting (I think about $150-$185 per person) when you get to taste all these samples with the 3 course?  :)     Cons: our dinner was 2.5 hours long, even for a Wednesday night, and we had to rush them towards the end because we wanted to leave already.  Make sure you come to this restaurant with someone you enjoy being around, because it will be a LOOOONGGG dinner.  And the service wasn't great either, we sat down at the table for 10 mins and asked multiple times before they brought us the menu.  We found out it was because they personalized it with a happy birthday message, but STILL, sitting there waiting for the menu is annoying!  Also, plan on spending $150+ per person for the meal.  Restaurant decor is not so great either, kind of plain and boring.  Lastly, there is only one stall for the women's restroom.  One stall is never enough for ANY restaurant.   All in all, I'm glad I had the opportunity to try Providence.  However, not sure if I'd come back.  It would have to be a really special occasion because $360 for dinner for 2 people (including 2-3 drinks each) is a bit much.

My boyfriend and I opted for the 16 course tasting menu which took close to 4 hours to complete. Highlights: - Squid and chorizo / abalone and miso skewers - My favorite was the squid and chorizo skewer as I felt the two paired well together. - Uni canapé - Best uni I've ever had..so soft and melt in your mouth-Felt like butter. - Cabacerra ham, octopus, manila clam risotto - I could eat bowlfuls of this stuff. The saltiness of the ham went perfectly with the creamy seafood risotto. - Wagyu beef - Two small slices of soft, fatty beef. After just taking one bite, I decided this was the best steak I've ever eaten. - Creme fraiche Mont Blanc - So beautiful..almost too pretty to eat. Providence exceeded all my expectations and I actually prefer Providence over Melisse. The only things I didn't care for was the fish cheek dish (I found it bland) and the peppermint macarons (Worst macarons I've ever had. So hard and crunchy..literally crumbled when I bit into it.). The mousse dessert was also too sweet for my liking and I couldn't finish it. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if it was a smaller portion. The service was on point, making it the best service I've had in a restaurant to date. Dishes were served in a timely fashion with no awkward long gaps in between. Dirty dishes and utensils were whisked away and replaced constantly. Our water was never less than 75% full. We were checked up on enough and not overly so. I also enjoyed hearing a little about what was in each dish upon service and the table side preparation of the prawns. A request to diners (not just at Providence), please, please, please stop taking pictures of your food with FLASH and turn off the photo capture sounds from your cellphone!! It became so incredibly ANNOYING and really ruined the ambiance of everyone's meal.

Before going to this place, I checked out the menu online. It was pointless. It was a little to fancy, schmancy for me to understand.  Once we got to the restaurant, I got a delicious glass of wine. It was this glass of wine that changed my life forever and made me a wine lover...I am not joking. It was amazing! As I was drinking my wine, my friend told me that celebrities have been spotted at this place. I instantly got excited. Who doesn't want to see a celebrity move their food around their plate during dinner?! We ended up having 9 courses with wine parings. By the end, we were all feeling really...happy. The food was TO DIE FOR. It was all small and amazing. Eat everything they bring you, even if it looks weird. It is so good! The scallops, one word, orgasmic. (Sorry if that made you lose your appetite.) My taste buds have never been so tantalized. This was the best food I have ever had, ever. Also, the most expensive food, I've ever had, ever. Fortunately, I wasn't footing the bill, but for our table of 6, I believe the bill was over $2000. Dinner lasted a long time, so I got to observe the people coming in and out of the place. It seemed like it was a pretty popular spot for dates (ladies, if a guy takes you on a date here...sink your claws in okay, unless he makes you pay), anniversaries and affairs (okay the 20 year old may have actually been this 60 year olds one and only, but when in LA, I must make my own juicy gossip when celebrities aren't around). pros: everything cons: expensive, if you're an east coaster (like me) - you probably won't ever have food THIS good again...so why even put yourself through that heartache?! After dinner, two cabs came to pick up our group. They raced back to our respective hotels in downtown LA. They LITERALLY raced. Looking back on the video I took during the ride, it was kind of terrifying. Picture this....going 90 down the highway with a cab driver in a pink shirt talking with an extremely thick accent The driver is yelling out F*** you to the cab driving beside us and immediately looks in his rear view mirror, I assume because he remembered he had people in the car, and says, "Oh, that is my good friend...I say f*** you to him because we were lovers... just kidding. He isn't gay. Just kidding. He is. Just kidding, he's not. But, we are really friends. I am the gay one." Yes, that just happened. Yes, he is still looking in the rearview. Yes, he almost hit 10 cars. Yes, we could have died. Luckily, we survived and the multiple glasses of wine consumed at Providence made the ride extremely exciting.

Simply put, the best food I ever had.  A definitely must try for a special occasion. My boyfriend took me to Providence to celebrate our anniversary.  We decided to do a nine course tasting menu.  The following were the food that we had: 1. Japanese Kampachi 2. Santa Barbara Sea Urchin (My favorite) 3. Nancy's down east day run sea scallop 4. Maine Lobster Nage 5. Wild striped bass 6. Dutch valey farms tenderloin of veal 7. Cheese Plate 8. Tangerine 9. Warm chocolate chiboust In addition to the food above, we also got a salmon skin with salmon dip and a desert on the house.  Overall, the experience dinning at Providence was one of the kind.  The staff made sure to make each course special as they took their time explaining the dish, presenting the dish in a proper manner and explaining to us how to properly eat the dish.  Each dish was it's own special performance.  My favorite part of the night was when the staff congratulated us on our special occasion and gave us a copy of our menu as a souvenir with the word "happy anniversary" printed on it. I don't know when I will have the opportunity to go back there again but it was literally the best dining experience I ever had.  Totally recommend it.

My life has been full of fine dining and amazing foodie experiences in various countries around the world. So many extraordinary food memories pop out. One of the tastiest, exciting and elegant meals I've had was at Providence. Nice restaurant for a special occasion (minus the cheesy Spongebob Squarepants clam shell decor on the wall). Newbies must try one of the tasting menus. The food comes in very small portions, but you are satisfied by the end of the meal. It's pricey, but the service is excellent, presentation is beautiful, and the food is both tasty and creative. Again, great choice for a special occasion or to make a strong good impression.

I really should have done this review sooner as now i don't remember all the details! I want to preface this review by saying that i would have given Providence 4 stars if we had gotten the tasting menu (8 courses?) but instead we got the chefs menu (16 courses?).   The reason is because it seems like the 8 course meal just gives you a larger portion of the 8 best dishes from the 16 course meal.... it doesn't help when the 16 course meal costs twice as much as the 8 course?  Once again i'm estimating since i don't remember the exact details. Overall the meal was pretty good but for the price and for a restaurant of this level i expected every course to be great with a few of them being exceptional.  There was nothing particularly amazing or innovative about any of the courses sadly.

Just your average American restaurant.  The hype was overrated.  If you want to be around a loud crowd where you can't hear your friends' voice over dinner, go for it.  The seating took forever, the service took forever, the food was okay.

My friend and I treated ourselves here for dinner.  We loved the service and the food.  I would definitely go back.  Oddly, though they were advised about what I was trying to stay away from (meat), one of my dishes still came with tiny cubed ham the size of grains of rice so I sent it back.  We did the smallest tasting menu and were pretty full.  Everyone should come here at least once in their life.

My absolute favorite restaurant in LA. The food is delicious, creative, fun and the service is impeccable. I've only done the prix fixe menu (the 8 course I think with wine pairings, and another time I brought my own wine for only a $40 corkage fee). I've never been let down by this place. Its definitely an upscale, special occasions type of place.

GAH. this place is amazing and surpassed my expectations. got the five course farmers market tasting and everything was amazing. to drink: like eskimo. very tasty and warming with nice spices. amuse bouche: squash soup with bourbon foam was a great way to start. the salmon skin chips with wild trout dip was innovative and light. nori bread and bacon brioche was GREAT and addicting! five courses consisted of: kampachi, scallop, sea bass, veal and DESSERT! all of it was superb. not one course disappointed. it just kept getting better and better. i think the scallop dish was my favorite.....and dessert! i will definitely come back. the service was great too!

Providence does not disappoint!  The food is divine for seafood lovers. The five-course tasting menu was just the right amount to reach a good level of satiation without going overboard. The service was attentive, personal, and friendly. Great place for special occasions and for treating your significant other to a wonderful night.

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we were almost blown away... the things that didn't resonate were :  1) the chowda - it was served lukewarm and the flavor was  overpoweringly only bacon. (the first ingredient is "lardo de bellota" - go figure.) 2) the duck - it was too rare. (woke up in the middle of the night reminding me it was too rare) 3) wild striped bass was also extremely rare.  Rare to the point where the duck was too pink (and not warm) and the fish was glassy. Don't get me wrong, I love raw when I'm expecting it. The Ugly Bunch (abalone, sea urchin, etc.) was AMAZING and the desserts were TO DIE FOR. But for almost $300 I thought we could at least get 3 out of 6 TO DIE FORs. Oh well. Won't be going back anytime soon but would recommend for a unique foodie experience and will definitely try more raw seafood next time.

Had the 5 course tasting.  Everything was well presented and delicious.  Personal favorites were the seared scallops and lamb. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the salmon skin appetizer.  it was extremely salty. I will have to return one day to try the full chef's tasting menu!

I had long heard of the great Providence restaurant, but this was my first visit. The service is quite acceptable and at times inspired, but it's not consistent.  One member of the staff will move the heavens for you while others will inaudibly grunt when you ask for something and then disappear.  Some servers are warm and friendly, some are a bit creepy.  Overall, the service is not, at this point, quite two Michelin Star in my opinion, but it gets the job done. The food, for the most part, is quite inspired and is at the cutting-edge of molecular gastronomy.  I'm sure Ferran Adria would be thrilled with many of the dishes at Providence.  There were a few hiccups, but that happens.  The pork tenderloin was so tender that it scientists might not be able to classify it as a solid substance. In the city of LA where classless wealth tends to drive expensive but tasteless wine lists, Providence's wine selections show a great love for terroir and history.  Some of the best small houses of Europe can be found on their list, and the staff is quite knowledgable about all of them. Overall, I think Providence has room to grow, but it's certainly growing on me.  I'm looking forward to visiting again in the future.

I could just write a one word review: Amazing. But I guess I'll elaborate. Came here last night. Was slightly tricky to find as the restaurant has kind of a modern hidden look even though its right on the corner. Not really flashy on the outside. The inside is nice and comfortable, not one of those restaurants where you are 3 inches next to the other table. Ended up getting the Market Menu without the wine pairing and raw oysters. At first wasn't sure if the 9 course would be enough as I eat a hefty amount, but it ended up being more than enough. I don't even know how people can eat the 15 course one. The sommelier chose a wine based upon the description I have and the wine was superb. I would go into the food but I really am bad at remembering names... But I'll say what I remember most Scallop: amazing This uni in egg thing: I could eat this everyday all day. Put this on rice and.... I don't know.. but it would be awesome. Veal dish with some brown pepper thingies: Extremely tender and flavorful Salmon skin chip: This was really really good. Like really. This uni in egg thing: Yes that awesome I put it twice and by itself in a line. The service here is attentive and fast and friendly. There may have been more staff than customers... And the place was full. Ok so there wasn't THAT many staff but it felt like it with how masterful they were at cleaning tables/ clearing plates/ refilling water/ etc. Obviously due to price this won't be a every night kind of meal, but definitely a place to try.

I went here with my girl after Thanksgiving, craving for good seafood. I have been out of the LA food scene for a while so this place was recommended to me. We decided to go for the 3 course prix fixe because we generally never make it past the 6 or 9 course meals. The seafood appetizers were amazing. The oysters were high quality. The scallops, sea urchin, and geo-duck were fresh and delicious. It put smiles on our faces. Our main course and dessert was high quality. The fish were all fresh and cooked perfectly. Eating a main fish course is never that exciting though (especially after the awesome appetizers) and we wished that we could've tried the rest of the appetizers. I do understand why my friend recommended this place to me as his favorite place to take his date. In LA this is a really good place to take someone out for high quality seafood and I would come back here again.

Clear example of fine dining, from the service, decor and menu/wine selection. I am skeptical when it comes to tasting menus, as I like my servings a certain size and don't want to leave hungry. But I made the right choice as I tried to decipher the menu, I just went with the recommendation of a 9 serving taste menu..Out of the 9, I would say 8 were extremely delicious and flavorful. Servings are well thought out as the presentation is top notch. The service was completely on point, did not feel rushed at all and they were very accommodating. Our server did not steer us wrong with our wine suggestion either. It's definitely not cheap to dine here but you know what you are getting yourself into when visiting a restaurant like this. So be prepared to spend a little bit, but its well worth it to a foodie. I would highly recommend this place for a special occasion, something intimate and quiet for two to enjoy an evening. Decor didn't really stand out in any way for me, seemed typical. From the outside the establishment looks much larger. But definitely does not play a key in the experience.

Overrated! The decor was nice. The servers were friendly and knowledgeable. Unfortunately, most of the food was barely edible. I'm guessing that people (Michelin reviewers included) get caught up in the hype and intricate presentation of the many courses because when it came to the actual taste, Providence fell far short of the usually impressive Michelin star standard. In short, the prawns weren't cooked properly, the uni soup was over salted, the smoked fish just tasted like smoke and the filet was fleshy and absent of flavor. By the end of the main course I was so turned off of the whole meal I didn't try the dessert, so I can't speak to that. Although, other members of our party said the cheese and ice cream dishes were good. If I were to go back, which I won't, I'd stay away from the prix fixe and stick with some of the more staple items... water? bread? cheese? wine?

I've been delaying writing this review.  I had a hard time putting my thoughts together to write a fair review.  Some reviews are like that. I dined at Providence with a couple friends while visiting LA.  I was excited to try the famed food which was delicious. Our reservation was a bit delayed, but I didn't mind since we had called and changed the time earlier that day and they were extremely accommodating.  We had drinks at the bar and enjoyed a delicious cocktail and champagne before heading to the table. The food was excellent.  I was with a couple girlfriends so we opted for a three course meal rather than the tasting menus.  I was sad not to try these and would love to come back to do so.   The amuse was excellent and then we started off sharing these amazing prawns to start the food journey.   Next came my lobster appetizer and the john dory as my main.  Both were really pieces of art -- both in presentation and taste. Then, a 30 something year old man collapsed at the table across from us and the whole evening changed.  This was obviously an allergic reaction of some sort or a major medical emergency.  I saw it happen and gasped loudly from the shock.  He was unconscious and lying in the middle of the restaurant right in  front of our table. Several customers rushed to his aid and someone asked to call 911.  It was distressing, but it was also distressing to me how the situation was handled by the restaurant staff.   Although I understand that the restaurant doesn't want to instill a panic, or create a negative atmosphere, I was shocked that most staff members pretended nothing happened.  While people were trying to figure out if this man was breathing or had a pulse, cheese carts were still entering the dining room, desserts were delivered and staff members took pictures of other diners.  The paramedics came and service still continued as if NOTHING WAS HAPPENING.   I couldn't stomach eating anymore.  Our waiter even commented that none of us touched dessert , which was obviously because of the medical situation occurring right next to us.   I wish that there had been some sort of announcement to the general restaurant population about what was going on.  We were part of that experience and at that point all we cared about was his well being, not what course we were on.  It all seemed very inhumane and cold to me.

Cuisine as avantgarde art -- that's what Providence is all about. Every morsel of food served up in this gastronomic gem will make you think hard about the dining experience.  Providence isn't a place to simply eat -- it's a place to expose your senses to whole new universes of culinary delights and complexity. It's also damn fun.  For a place that boasts a celebrity chef (Michael Cimarusti) and more accolades than any restaurant really needs (including 2 Michelin stars), Providence keeps the pretension to a minimum.  It's located in a nondescript part of Hollywood, far from the busy tourist areas and with easy street parking (so feel free to skip the valet).  Everyone who pilgrimages here loves food, and everyone who works here is warm, charming, and eager to show off the wares of the house. Reservations are hard to score.  I recommend calling or OpenTable-ing at least 2 weeks in advance.  We arrived right on time for a 6pm reservation on Saturday night, and the restaurant was packed solid.  We were promptly seated and shared glasses of Sauvignon blanc to start.  After settling on the prix fixe dinner, we had a chance to sit back, relax, and watch the show unfold.  Here's a run-down of what I tasted... **BREADS** The bread tray featured some of the finest baked goods I've ever encountered.  My favorites were the seaweed baguette and the bacon brioche, but you can't go wrong with any of them.   **AMUSE BOUCHE #1** Salmon puree with crispy salmon skin chips.  The essence of pure salmon distilled.  Fantastic flavor and contrasting textures. **AMUSE BOUCHE #2** Cheese puff pastry with soup "smoothie".  The puff pastry was airy and elegant, while the soup was warm, satisfying, and incredibly complex.  (It was so complex that I can't even describe what exactly was in it.)  Serving it with a straw with a cute touch. **APPETIZER** Halibut sashimi with oro blanco, cucumber, and sorrel.  This dish was a gorgeous work of art.  The fish was served on little "coins" of tomato and cucumber, and the oro blanco (a.k.a. white grapefruit) provided a fun contrast of acid and texture.   **ENTREE** Wild striped bass with porcini mushrooms braised in Wagyu beef fat.  The bass itself was cooked immaculately, while the beef fat gave the mushrooms a beautiful unctuousness.  A few dollops of fresh mostarda brought it all together harmoniously.  This dish has autumn written all over it. **DESSERT** Passionfruit ice cream with frozen white chocolate spheres and grape gelée.  Fresh, sweet, refreshing, and -- again -- very complex!  There were so many components at work here that it blew my mind.   **PETIT FOURS** Served on a wooden board, the petit fours of the night were a lychee macaron, a chewy caramel candy, and a mango jelly candy.  While the petit fours were the most traditional items of the night, they were flawless in execution. While the food at Providence is of a mind-bogglingly high caliber, it is matched by the graciousness and professionalism of the staff (especially our server Steven).  Not only did they provide pitch-perfect service, they were eager to have in-depth discussions about our impressions of the food.  The highlight of the night: a visit from Chef Cimarusti himself!  (Cue excited fanboy squealing.) Providence is just exceptional.  Are you a food fanatic in search for a blissful and indulgent evening?  Look no further than Providence.

Still love it.  We went here a few months back to celebrate our anniversary, and my hubby asked for some special off-menu items that we hadn't tried before since we come fairly regularly.  We were offered a really interesting menu with some things we've seen (but haven't tasted) before.  Nothing blew my mind, but it was still as elegant, delicious, and delicatedly nuanced as always.  It all went really well with the 10 year tiraged Gloria Ferrer Carneros Cuvee we brought.  I would have hoped for them to go a little bit more out on a limb for us, but was still satisfied at the end of the day.  I'll leave the adventure to other places that we'll only go to once for the thrill.   Oh, and talk about service.  Last year we came for an anniversary dinner, their service was very backed up and we had to wait for about half an hour for our table.  We were patient and didn't complain, and our server ended up bringing us free champagne and a starter on the house for the wait on our special day.  I think this is the epitome of turning a bad situation into a good situation, and knowing how to treat your customers right.  Providence is my go-to classy night out with my hubby. I'll keep coming back to you, Providence!

I wish I could afford to eat here all day, every day. I've always wanted to go here and my amazing boyfriend decided to take me here for our one year anniversary. It's been a little while, but that just shows how AMAZING this place is that I can still remember it. We did the Chef's Tasting Menu with wine pairings. Our super nice, funny waiter asked us if we had plans after. (???)  I've never been asked that from a waiter before so I found it very odd... And... well, let's just say it was the BEST 5 HOUR dinner ever! If I listed everything we had, no one would read it because it would look like a novel. But trust me when I say this - you must do the Chef's Tasting Menu. Wine pairings are perfectly matched (and you'll be drunk by dessert), but not a must. Their cheese plate.. Yum! Except the crazy stinky cheeses (I love cheese but not the crazy, stinky kind). So ladies, just ask your boyfriend to take you here. All good boyfriends should treat you like queens... At LEAST once a year. So, if they can afford to spend 5 hours with you (and $600), there are no excuses! ;) Just remember - Chef's Tasting Menu (with wine pairings). You won't regret it. TIP: Drive slowly - this restaurant is in the middle of random, ghetto-town and easy to miss. I think it used to be a house or something.... Anyway - I couldn't care less where it's located, the food is great! Valet is most convenient and quick!

I just got home from eating here. I thought a lot about what I would write. I'm going to take Providence to the woodshed. There were two of us, and we had the prix-fixe. Prix-fixe is 85 for one app, one entre and one dessert. Par for the course for fine dining, you say. OK. She had the Dungeness crab for the appetizer, and I had the octopus. The crab was good but not amazing. The octopus was OK, but not amazing. There was precious little of the octopus though. It was a medium size place, and at first I was like 'they forgot to put the food on the plate' because it was all clumped along the wall, what precious little of it there was. Seriously, there was like 2 tablespoons of octopus and that's it. People were raving about the bread. Please. The bread was not hot, and it was nothing to rave about. There was the bacon brioche, the focaccia, and something else. They were OK, but hardly stuff to write about. The amuse bouche (and why does it arrive before the meal and not in between the interminable wait between the appetizer and the entree) was cold gazpacho soup renamed as 'zucchini with cream' or something. Now, they also offer, for a 'supplement', a prawn dish. They take three very large shrimp (which are called prawns if they are humongous) and they bake them in salt and rosemary. It smells really nice. By bake, I mean they take the prawns, and bake them in salt. The waiter then dramatically presents it at the table. Sounds impressive? It is. But not the way it was done for us. For one, when you bake something in salt, the salt is supposed to form a crust. Here, it was just like they pulled it out of flour. The other thing is that the salt is not re-used(I asked them). The thing is, the salt can be re-used, just google 'reuse salt used in salt baking'. It is hardly ecologically correct to dump out 2 pounds of salt each time. Now on to the entrees. I ordered the "wild queen charlotte island king salmon (british columbia)", or 'salmon' as I like to call it. It was terrible. I was upset at eating it, to think that this is what a Michelin star has been debased to. I mean, a chef in France killed himself over losing a Michelin star-and this restaurant, which was awarded TWO stars back in 2009, has the temerity to offer this nonsense? However, the vegetable medley that came with my fish, that was delicious. I wish I could have exchanged the fish for a plateful of the veggies. Isn't it Ironic, like the song goes. Her entree was the "wild black sea bass (rhode island)". It was far better than mine, pretty tasty. It came with a medely that included 3 small pieces of blood sausage, which is a mark of distinction in my book. The sausage was good, and her dish was alright. Not amazing, just alright. Now, on to the dessert. Her dessert was the creme fraiche, and it was outstanding. I went for the cheese platter (which had a ridiculous $10 supplement). The cheese cart came over. The way it works is that there are about 12-15 pieces of cheese on the cart, and you can choose three. And they always throw in one more. The cheeses were good, but it looked awfully familiar. And then I realized it. You can get the EXACT SAME CHEESE at Whole Foods. So I went to a two star Michelin restaurant and ate cheese that I could get at Whole Foods. Gee, thanks for the experience, guys. Now on to the price. It was $85 prix fixe, plus a whopping $39 for the prawns, plus $10 supplement for the cheese dish. Total bill came out to $280 with tax and tip. Worth it? Definitely Not. Yeah, service was good, but so what? A waiter is supposed to be nice and pleasant and somewhat knowledgeable about the food. At these prices, they need to be. So I think that Providence has OK food, good ambiance, good drinks. Definitely NOT amazing, and definitely NOT worth the money.     And about the MIchelin stars: I have eaten at Michelin star restaurants. To paraphrase the hapless Lloyd Bentsen, I know what a Michelin star restaurant is supposed to be like, and you, Providence, are NO Michelin star. And finally: we got our table reservation through OpenTable. We were told that we would forfeit $75 if we were a no-show. We showed up at the appointed time and were made to wait a half hour. That is ridiculous. If you tell me that you are going to charge me $75 for not showing up on time, and then when I do show up, you make me wait anyway, then you have not kept up your end of the bargain. They did comp our drinks for making us wait, which was honorable of them. Summary: Skip this place. I wish I had, and I wish she had taken the $280 and got some nice outfits instead.

We made a reservation for 6 people. Providence explained they needed a cc to hold the reservation and emailed the form to me. I never got it. I asked please email it again. I explained I was at the Beverly Wilshire and was waiting to leave my room could they please send it. I waited 30 min and it never came. I went to the concierge and explained the situation. Paul said not a problem he would handle it. When I came back. Paul explained he called two more times and still no form. I offered a credit card over the phone and Michael was rude explaining that's not policy. A second concierge called and explained the situation again.  The restaurant told him they were busy but wouldn't hold the reservation without the . We tried multiple times to abide by their request and they made it impossible to do so. Finally at 10:00pm tonight due to the persistence of the hotel staff the form was dropped off at our room. If Providence food is as inept & inconsiderate as their staff it's not worth it!

Came in on a Sunday night and had the chef tasting menu with wine pairings.  OK..since its a Michelin 2 star so I will overlook the $$$.  The food and pairings were exceptional.  BUT why four stars only.... I don't know if the standards for Michelin stars are lower in the states than they are in Europe but there were a few concerns I had with the caliber of this place. Service was attentive and good BUT when people are wearing black/dark colors, I'm accustomed to getting a black napkin.  That may seem minute BUT it would not happen in Europe.  Furthermore, if you are going to have a unisex restroom for the patrons, the restrooms should be immaculate. Men may be willing to overlook our horrible aim BUT if my GF is going to use the same restroom, someone should be cleaning it between visits.

**********500TH REVIEW********** Situated in close proximity to a neglected neighborhood featuring century old spanish style homes and apartment complexes in dire need of attention, not to mention an oddly placed self car wash, party supply store, and pawn shop, the juxtaposition of Chef Michael Cimarusti's luxe fine dining establishment is stark. Whatever the surroundings may be, setting foot into Providence will remove those visions thanks to its posh milieu and amiable staff. Then there's the cuisine... A sound argument can be made when claiming that Providence produces some of the finest dishes in all of Southern California, having been validated by two highly coveted Michelin Stars. An avid fisher and connoisseur of seafood, Cimarusti daily seeks the freshest fish, crustaceans, and exotic seasonal ingredients, translating into a menu that is subject to frequent changes and innovation conceived by la brigade de cuisine. Palate-whetting amuse gueule (amuse bouche) generally serve their intended purpose but lately have been a little less imaginative. Served with a delightfully brittle salmon skin, the Sea Trout Mousse amuser is beyond enjoyable yet seemingly long in the tooth, as is a bite-sized Gruyere Cheese Puff. A mild tandem of Slushy Mojito Cube and Reverse Spherification Screwdriver have been succeeded by an extremely potent duo of Frozen Watermelon infused with Champagne and Frozen Grape infused with Gin & Chartreuse. http://tinyurl.com/rlew-… http://tinyurl.com/rlew-… http://tinyurl.com/rlew-… http://tinyurl.com/rlew-… Three highly advisable first courses to consider are: Grilled Wild Spanish Octopus; Scallop Ceviche; and the seasonal Live Halibut Sashimi. Each dish is revolutionary in their own right and frankly, impeccable. Enhance your meal with some pleasant Kumamoto Oysters. You'll become enamored by their sweet aromatics and appeal to their silky smooth texture. http://tinyurl.com/rlew-… http://tinyurl.com/rlew-… http://tinyurl.com/rlew-… Selecting seafood dishes at most restaurants is much like selecting a mate: While there are plenty of fish in the sea, you still have to be discriminant. Guess what? That doesn't apply because the candidates have already been narrowed down for you. If only dating were that easy! But I digress. A fantastic Wild Rouget de Roche (Red Mullet) with a mild, delicate, and slight sweet flavor is perfected by a variety of textures and ingredients such as haricot vert, mussels, bacon, and summer white beans. Seasoned fish eaters will fall hook, line, and sinker for an intensely sweet Japanese Ayu and its dense yet gentle flesh. Meanwhile, a recreational fish eater will appreciate a flaky moist Trap-caught Jumbo Wild Black Bass. http://tinyurl.com/rlew-… http://tinyurl.com/rlew-… http://tinyurl.com/rlew-… Contrary to popular opinion, Providence is not solely a pescatarian utopia. One simply cannot overlook a few hoofed and feathered dishes available perennially. A handsome Medium Rare Prime New York Steak will more than satisfy a devout carnivore, but if said carnivore dines "pinkies out," there's always the melt-in-your-mouth goodness of A5 Wagyu ($30 per ounce, minimum 3 ounces) best enjoyed Rare Plus or Medium Rare. http://tinyurl.com/rlew-… Fowl-Mouthed individuals will swear by Providence's Liberty Farms Duck Breast prepared Medium Rare, complimented by a spectacular crispy strip of duck skin. In a time passed, an all together succulent yet unapologetically crisp Brioche Bread Crumb Ball mixed with Duck Confit and filled with Foie Gras accompanied this dish...but you can thank Democratic Party Chairman John Burton and those quacks at PETA, et al for California's absurd statewide ban. Unless the ban is overturned or Providence exploits loopholes (with risk of fine), you might as well say, "Au Revoir, Foie Gras!" in California forever! Lamentably, your chance of ever capitalizing on the opportunity of experiencing a superlative Foie Gras Sauté served with partially dehydrated strawberries, black sesame, and green almonds is rather gaunt. Ditto for their mouthwatering Foie Gras Ravioli that used to make your eyes welt up with tears. Are you salivating yet?

The ugly bunch? More like the hottest culinary bunch I've ever tasted and seen! Using Panna Cotta as the base for various "potentially too fishy/seafoody ingredients when combined" is shear genius. Doing so made salmon roe (which I can't stomach) pleasantly palatable.

Wow. I took my boyfriend to Providence for his bday in October and we were blown away. We chose to get the 12 course dinner, which ended up being at least 16 courses because we work in the restaurant industry. Each course was better than the last, and by the time we were done we were ready to burst. The owner came over to our table here and there to make sure we were enjoying our meal, which we were. Although it is pricey, it is definitely worth trying at least once.

The food here definitely is an experience. Wow, is all I can say. The staff was attentive to my needs and paid very good attention to detail. the presentation was beautiful. The food was very well prepared by people who definitely know what they re doing. Even if you don't know what the stuff on the menu is try it, it will taste amazing. I had the prawns and scallops for appetizer which came in a huge scallop shell, I just wanted to savor it and eat it slowly. Next I ended up with the steak, which was super juicy made to perfection and very tasty. It came with seasoned bone marrow. For desert, I went light and everything came together perfectly. If you have the cash to splurge, this place is well worth it! The chef is an artist here.

Girlfriend and I recently had the 9-course market menu and were blown away. This place was a truly special experience from beginning to end. Asparagus soup / salmon crackers Hamachi with heirloom tomatoes Egg / Sea Urchin Halibut Scallop Salmon Cheese platter Veal Green mango sorbet & Chocolate mouse The sea urchin and scallop dishes were our favorites, but there was not a single plate that disappointed. Everything was top notch, including our cocktails and bottle of cab sauv. The service was excellent. Our server had great knowledge of the food, and there was always someone around for anything we needed. Yes, it's a bit pricey, but really - you truly get what you pay for. Excellent, five-stars. We'll be going back for another special occasion in the future.

Came here again recently and i'm sad to say I have to bring down my rating by one start this time.  After my first visit, I ranked this as my favorite restaurants in LA and was waiting for another opportunity to dine here again.  On this occasion, there was four of us and we tried their 15 Course Chef's tasting menu (supposed to be the chef's best stuff).  The portions of each course were very small which was expected, and the presentation of each dish was very nicely done.  The ingredients that were used for each course and the way they were cooked was hit and miss.  If this was just any restaurant, I wouldn't be so critical, however this is a Michelin 2 star restaurant and I do expect perfection especially with the prices they charge.   So on to the dishes themselves....I'm not going to detail everyone of them but I will point out a few of the one's that stood out whether for good or for bad. Oyster dish - (I forgot what kind of oyster it was but it was probably Kumamoto based on the size and taste) Was very simple but good due to it's pairing with some leaf wrapped with some other stuff that was made to taste just like an oyster and it actually did. Uni - You can't go wrong with Uni and they certainly didn't.  It was prepared in a way I've never had before serving  it over a small piece of Nori  Focaccia before topped with black truffle...simple and delicious! Sardines - If it was prepared in a more unique way, I would not bash this dish so much but unfortunately there was nothing unique about this dish.  It was basically a whole sardine in tomato sauce and quite honestly, the one's you can buy in a can tastes better because the flavors are better combined. Australian Wagyu - I've come to the conclusion that Providence does not prepare beef very well (I should know better since this is after all more of a seafood restaurant)  either way, the quality of the beef was below PAR for Wagyu.  The first time i ate here, I also had their Wagyu, prepared a different way but was overcooked and very dry.  This time, it was cooked perfectly rare, but unfortunately because it was bad quality, the beef was tough and not "melt in your mouth" like it should be. So there you have it, those are the dishes that stood out the most for me and the rest were good.  I would still dine here again but next time I think I'm going to give their a la carte menu a try.

Providence needs another 5 star review like the world needs another season of the Jersey Shore (ABSOLUTELY UNNECESSARY) but I have to put my two cents in!     Providence is the epitome of FINE DINING!  It is just so decadent and elegant! Definitely one of the BEST MEAL I've had in my life!  HIGHEST QUALITY ingredients, insanely delicious flavors, and top notch meats!  They also do a great presentation of their dishes (ie. the manager comes out with a wooden box filled with truffles so he can shave it fresh onto your plate) and EVERYTHING is well plated.  IT'S LIKE ART SERVED ON FINE CHINA!   There was nothing I put in my mouth that I wasn't impressed with!  Well maybe this bitter leafy thing that was suppose to be just for garnish but that wasn't their fault!  :)  Compliments to the Chef! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the DUCK and the SALT ROASTED PRAWNS!  Just FYI, the duck is the BEST PIECE OF MEAT that will travel through your esophagus!   As for the ambiance, it's FANCY and there's a faint smell of RICHNESS & SUCCESS lingering in the air.  The crowd is definitely folks ballin' out of control!  And the service is just phenomenal.  It's the kind of place where you go to the bathroom and they come by and refold your napkin, origami style, into a unicorn!  Ya feel me? Expect your meals to be meh for the next few days after a meal at Providence!  Trust!

Great food marred by lousy service pertaining to an outrageous overcharge. I was told our tasting included wine and was lied to when the bill came and they charged  an additional $160 for wine . Ruined our whole birthday dinner. Felt like I was mugged.

Oh my gosh! What a dining experience! I had the pleasure to do one of their tasting menus. I had the 9 course meal and lost count with the plates! All in all, it was like 16 plates of food and by the time you walk out, you almost feel like you need someone to carry you out.  They also throw in extra dishes that are not even on the tasting menu, palate cleansers ...etc. They also bring you a while table of cheese selection and it's amazing. Save room for that! Presentation of plates are creative and beautiful. Service is excellent. It's a must try!

Wow, people seriously wrote dissertations about this place! that being said, i will keep mine short  and be a freerider- they seem to have it covered. i came here with my parents and brother for my birthday. we did the pre-fixe. it was probably one of the most expensive meals of my life - but it was certainly memorable. the serving portions were small - the dishes are presented like works of art. the ambience is great! the food is nothing like you have had before (unless you frequent michelin star restaurants...). I loved it. go for the experience people!

3.5 stars. The wife and I went to Providence last night for our annual birthday Michelin blowout. We both ordered the 15 course chef's menu ($175) expecting to be blown away based on the reviews. On the plus side, all of the dishes were at least "very good" and a few were "amazing." In particular, we loved the spot prawn ravioli and the oysters with caviar, reminiscent of "oysters and pearls" at French Laundry. Also on the plus side, service was friendly and understated, not snooty at all. Bread and cheese course were also fabulous. On the downside, I found that many of the dishes had the same flavor profile (Japanese, heavy on the dashi). That's fine and all, but it gets a little tiresome after 10 courses and you want the chef to show off a bit more versatility. Also, my wife and I were very much looking forward to the desserts (based on reputation and reviews) but were pretty disappointed. We had three dessert courses and all were SOUR (a sour yogurt palate cleanser, a creme fraiche sorbet, and a sour apricot-flavored cake) . Again, sour is a fine flavor, but you don't need three sour desserts in a row (particularly following the pungent cheese course). Other notes: Portions for each dish are pretty tiny, but even 15 tiny courses + amuse + bread adds up fast. Go hungry and expect to be wheeled to the car. If we go back, we'll probably get the 9 course menu instead. Monday is free corkage, which is an amazing deal at a fine restaurant like Providence. I found that my Napa Sauvignon Blanc had oceany notes and went well with most of the dishes and the flavorful olive bread. With the chef's menu, you have no idea what is coming next since there is no written menu. You can advise your waiter about food preferences and allergies - we asked for and received an "all seafood" menu. In all, our experience at Providence was hit-and-miss, and given the price point and reputation, I feel our dinner merits only three stars.

My husband and I have splurged at Providence three times now.  It's my favorite restaurant. Period.   Ambiance:  Gorgeous.  Simply gorgeous.  Elegant and luxurious. Food:  Spectacular.  Smaller portions, it's true, but the fine quality, the surprising combinations, the perfection of each bite... heaven. I'd highly recommend the Santa Barbara Spot Prawns and then just trust the chefs and go for one of the Tasting menus. The Chef's Tasting menu is truly a FEAST and a FEAT.  Plan to go really hungry and pace yourself.   Service: Impeccable.  The servers, managers, sommelier were perfectly courteous and not snobby.  I detest pretentious atmospheres.  This restaurant deserves their Michelin stars, culinary awards, etc., and I love that they make us feel welcome even though we aren't wealthy or famous.  I'm so happy we chose to celebrate our anniversary and birthdays here! Price Point:  It's expensive, so it's definitely our splurge for special occasions.

After about 6 years of wanting to have dinner here at the legendary Providence, I FINALLYYYYY made it! :D It was truly one of the best dining experiences and it definitely met my high expectations! Food was phenomenal, service was top-notch, and I loved the simple & cute decor with romantic ambience! Perfect! My friend and I decided to get the full tasting menu ($135) which included 9 courses not counting the amuse bouche. The other tasting menu options are the 5-course tasting ($75) and the chef's menu ($175). I think I would have been satisfied and pretty full with the 5-course tasting but since it was my first time here, I wanted to be a little more adventurous and go for the full tasting! Even though we were SUPER full and couldn't finish our dessert after this fabulous 3.5 hour meal, it was SO worth it! I highly recommend getting at least the full tasting menu if it is your first time here! Amuse Bouche: "Mojito" and "Screwdriver" - such unique creative presentation of classic cocktails! I love how it was presented in a gelatinous form on mini spoons. The mojito was my favorite of the two and came as a jelly cube. So refreshing! The Screwdriver looked like an egg yolk but it was more like a cute little edible water balloon that popped in my mouth with a Screwdriver cocktail inside it. So cool! ... and more complimentary dishes! There was a dried salmon wafer-like carpaccio cracker that came with a delicioussss creme fraiche type dip. MMM so good! Then came a mini cheese puff + a shot glass of parsnip(?) soup & port reduction that we drank through a straw. Also very delicious! There was also a man who came around frequently with a bread basket - I tried the bacon brioche and the nori foccaccia: both pretty good but nothing crazy. And now for the actual full tasting menu dishes: *japanese kampachi - salted cherry blossom, creme fraiche, crispy rice. I really liked this one! Everything was so fresh and delicious!! I wished we got another plate of this! *santa barbara sea urchin - hiding beneath soft scrambled eggs, fines herbes, champagne beurre blanc. This was one of my favorites of the night. I love how it was presented inside a real eggshell which was inside a metal eggshell! This dish was soft, delicate yet rich flavor goodness. MMM sooo good! *sea scallop - brentwood corn, pickled nectarines, vadouvan - this was also very good but not crazyy amazing. If you like scallops, you will like this for sure though! *wild king salmon - fingerling potato, mussels, sea beans - I loved the crispy potatoes! The salmon was done very well too. Not dry at all! But I didn't really love the beans too much. *wild pacific halibut - two peas farms fresh cranberry beans, basil, oven roasted tomato. - the halibut was good but honestly the dish was not too memorable in my opinion. *dutch valley farms tenderloin of veal - porcini, la quercia bacon, haricot vert, hazelnuts, nipitella - the only "meat" dish of the night and definitely not one of my faves. I'm not a big veal fan to begin with but perhaps you will like this if you're a big meat lover. *cheese plate - we were given 3 choices but we had our server choose for us and we just told her we liked more milder and softer cheeses like brie rather than sharp-tasting ones. I really liked the super soft cow's cheese out of the 3 we tried! And I loved how the cheese plate also came with bread, different jams & jellies (the apricot one is amazing!), dried figs, and caramelized walnuts. SO GOOD!! *green strawberries, yogurt, celery, green yellow plum, verjus. This was given to us as a palate cleanser. For some reason, it was the one dish of the night I disliked. Maybe because I don't like the taste of celery... but the green strawberries were a little too sour and I thought the flavors didn't really go too well together. Meh. *manjari 64% - espresso, sweetened condensed milk, gianduja, ube. Wow what a RICH dessert. As a fan of DARK chocolate, I really liked the bittersweet dark chocolate flavor. But I was so full by this time I wasn't able to fully enjoy or finish it. But the best part of this dish was the crunchy ube bits! YUMMY! After this, they even gave us MORE complimentary desserts but we were too full to even take a bite so we had them pack it for us. It was a macaron, some type of jelly cube, and banana caramels. I tried it the next day and didn't think any of them were amazing really.. but of course the macaron was my fave of the 3. ;) Overall, I had an AMAZING experience here! Definitely 5-star worthy!!  I would LOVE to come back again!!

Hubby and I came here to spend our 7 year anniversary.  As luck would have it, traffic that particular Saturday was worse than driving home from Vegas on a Sunday night. What should have normally been a 1 hour drive was 1 hour 40 minutes.  We were about 15 minutes late but they were very nice about it when we called to let them know. We went all out this evening...I could tell the despair in hubby's eyes when I suggested the chef's tasting but he gamely agreed.  We're not big drinkers so we did not choose the wine pairings.  I did order a cocktail which was pleasant (Larchmont Fizz) As you've probably read elsewhere, tastings tend to take a loooooooooong time at Providence.  The funny thing is they know it, they warn you about it and encourage you to "hang in there".  I wanted to say..."Why don't you just speed things up for us then, buddy?"   I won't bore you with details but some of the standout courses we had were: Bread - Nice...very nice.  The sea salt and butter were a great touch.  I ate a crapload of the seaweed bread. Uni, lardo and truffle on seaweed bread, looked like a piece of nigiri sushi Kompachi with yuzu creme fraiche and puffed rice Terrine of foie gras (we paid an extra $25 for this and it counted as a course!) Roasted octopus Copper river salmon and porcini mushrooms (I dislike salmon but this dish blew me away) Dessert - mont blanc - the different textures were so unique and delightful.  The whole dish was white but had different (and surprising) elements to it.   Most of the food wow'd us.  So why isn't this a five-star review? - Service:  Our guy was nice but hardly attentive; is this a new kind of service? Have one of your cronies drop your food off and then leave you to languish until the next course?  At one point, all the suited guys were so busy they would nod at the busboy holding the food to go ahead and just serve us.  Towards the end of dinner, I wondered who I had to wrestle to the ground to get more water - I was parched! Also, our table was a mess.  It wasn't until dinner was over that they finally came over to clean it off with one of those crumb pickier-uppers. - Where's the ice?  I asked for ice cubes in my water and was given a few measly ones from the pitcher.  Are ice cubes considered unrefined???  I was cold water, dammit! Not semi-room temp water.  Cold water!   - Time.  Really, 4 hours?  Hubby's not a talker and I can only gab so much.  I felt like we could have been out of there in three hours.  Four is just ridiculously long.  I understand wanting us to really enjoy and appreciate each course but with how much time elapsed between courses, it felt like they were also waiting for us to digest it first. Bonus: Entertainment - hubby and I eavesdropped on a couple who ordered a la carte (pish! j/k!!)  The woman really wanted cheese for dessert and the guy really wanted dessert.  "I don't really like sweet stuff but I love cheese!" Guy: "Let's just try the blah blah blah, it'll be good."  Girl: "Ok, I guess.  But I don't eat dessert.  I do enjoy cheese." In the end the guy gave in and ordered both. Crisis (2nd date awkwardness) averted!! This was a great experience and I'm very happy we did it.  However, it'll be a while before we can muster up the energy to spend that much time in a restaurant again.

Friendly service which is great in a place that could be pretentious. Inside felt a bit tired... especially the bathrooms (random criticism). Had a tasting menu. It was very good... good meat, good pacing... good job of adjusting for dietary needs or people in our party ordering extra items... nothing except for maybe the scallop dish was exceptional... my friend who had been before said all of the dishes were the same from six months before. Bread was not very good. Inside is small but it didn't feel crowded or loud. Overall A-OK. If you like tasting menus, and don't like pretense, it is worth a try.

This is the best restaurant in Los Angeles.  No question about it.  I eat here about once every 4 months.  The quality in food and service is consistently outstanding.   My preference is for the seafood dishes.  The tasting menus are also superb.   Providence is so good that it would thrive in any other good food city, such as New York or San Francisco.  Unfortunately, there are not a lot of restaurants in LA that you can say that about.

The food was amazing. The place is pretty intimate and quiet. I liked that there was a wide range of wine and that the server for the wine was nice and knowledgable. I do think that they treated us a little different because of our tattoos which is sad being that we paid 200+ dollars just like everyone else and always leave a 20% tip. But aside from the snobby service, the food is amazing!

I spent days contemplating where I wanted to go for my 24th birthday dinner. There were so many restaurants that I couldn't afford vying for my attention. While I knew they would all be marvelous, there was one that ultimately swayed my vote. Providence won the 6 pm slot on July 3rd. I couldn't wait. The first thing I will note is that the whole experience was really drawn out. We were eating, drinking and laughing for 2.5 hours. It was marvelous. We never felt rushed and I always felt like the staff was paying very close attention to our needs. We started with drinks. My parents had some wine; I had a cider mill cocktail. YUM! The apple cider like drink was served on the rocks but it did a splendid job of warming my insides and twinkling my toes. After a round of bread (bacon brioche, seaweed focaccia) we were treated to the chef's amuse bouche. We had a little cheesy puff with a small soup that was sipped through a straw. That was followed by salmon skin 'chips' with a salmon cream spread. Super fishy and super delicious. Finally, the entrees. My mother and father had the chowda' and some sea bass. My brother had the duck and I had the truffle risotto. The chowda' was brought to the table with the soup fillings sitting patiently in the bowl. One of the servers poured our cream broth over the other ingredients. It was lovely because you got to see all the delicious layers inside the soup. The clams were still in the shells. It was a different take that was still very scrumptious. Unlike other chowders, it didn't leave a heavy weight in me. It was more of a summer chowder. I highly recommend it. My brother gave me a little nibble of his duck. It was outstanding. I couldn't even get more than one nibble (okay a nibble and a half) out of him because it was so good. It was perfectly prepared and beautifully purple. Very good attention to the spread of the plate. Nice little veggies on the side. A major win. Now, the real treat for me was the truffle risotto. It was so dense and rich and sensational. Every bite swam in my mouth and fogged my brain. Even just the bowl I received was more than enough for the four people at the table. I'm telling you, so rich. So good. I got the white truffle risotto because it was about half the price compared to the black truffle risotto and I don't feel like I lost anything. It couldn't have gotten any better than it was. My true delight. We ordered the banana cream dessert. This was good but I could have skipped it. It wasn't even as exciting as the dessert amuse bouches. Those were fun and delicious and pocket size. I brought a jalapeno caramel home to CP. The mini macarons and bite size jellies were great too. At Providence the entire staff is at your service. I felt like every time I walked by someone or they were near our table they were checking on us. It was an incredible experience. I've never seen an entire restaurant so finely tuned. I thoroughly recommend you enjoy a special evening here. It will be an evening you will never forget. PS. Unrelatedly, they have the softest toilet paper in the world in those bathrooms. So. Very. Soft.

Providence was a nice surprise. I took my best friend for her birthday dinner here and it transported us to NY instantly. (Ultra) fine dining in LA, who would have thought? Very nice atmosphere; decor was great. Service had some hiccups and felt a bit rushed... Uni in egg was awesome, glad we added that to the 5 course tasting. We also added the winter truffle over risotto but it was underwhelming -- maybe cuz it's from Australia... :(  Everything else was pretty good! Desserts were an OK.

Yup, a 5 star meal! We got the 5 course tasting menu.   Amuse Bouche #1: Screwdriver bubble and mojito cube The screwdriver bubble was interesting.  It "pops" in your mouth so it was pretty fun.  The mojito cube is cold and slushy.  I expected it to taste more like a hard ice cube but it was more like a packed ice slush.  Excellent. Amuse Bouche #2: Soup in a shot glass and puff pastry The soup was great.  Lots of flavor and very warm.  You stir it with the small straw and sip it.  It was perfect. The pastry was also good. Amuse Bouche #3: Crispy salmon skin chips and smoked salmon dip The crispy salmon skin chips were flat like a cracker and held in a stone holder.  The smoked salmon dip was plentiful.  I hated to see so much dip go to waste but the chip to dip ratio was off...way too much dip left. Course #1: Kanpachi sashimi The kanpachi was excellent.  Sometimes kanpachi can get slimy if it gets a little old but this didn't have any of that.  The sauce was mayo based and nice too.  There was also some fruit which added to the fresh taste of the dish. Side course: Foie gras terrine With the liberals in California banning foie gras in the state starting 7/1, we had to get some foie gras.  We ordered 2 plates of the terrine for the table of 9.  The 2 places was plenty. It also came with a nice and sweet jelly that helped cut through some of the fat of the foie gras. Course #2: Scallops The scallops were cooked perfectly.  The sauce was poured over by the waiter and the fruit help bring out the taste of the scallop.  It was amazing how much they could do with a single scallop. Course #3: Foie gras ravioli with truffles and parmesan foam The best dish of the night.  The ravioli was rich and sublime.  It came with 3 pieces and each piece was absolute perfection.  The parmesan foam was a nice add to the dish and the truffles were simply awesome.  A+ and one of the best dishes I have ever had at any restaurant. Course #4: Veal with mushroom The veal was of course very tender but this dish just didn't stand out as much as the other dishes.  The marinade was nice and subtle but overall, I just wasn't as impressed with this dish.  This was the weakest dish of the night for me. Course #5: Dessert (Manjari chocolate cake and espresso sorbet) The chocolate cake was decadent and rich.  It had rows of different nuts, etc. in the cake.  The espresso sorbet was the perfect side to cut away at the heavy chocolate.   Dessert: Macaroons, salted caramels, cube jellies The dessert was great.  The macaroons were good with the right amount of texture.  The jelly cube was also good.  I also enjoyed the salted caramel - eat it in one big bite because it's sticky. Service was top notch.  My water glass was never even close to empty.  The sommelier came by to give wine advice.  The staff is quick to pick up your napkin and re-fold it if you leave to use the restroom.  Overall, the only place with service that rivals Providence are The French Laundry and Urasawa.  The staff explains each dish before it is served and if you need anything they will bend over backwards to get it for you. A+ meal and definitely a winner that is well deserving of the 2 michelin stars.

A Restaurant you would put on your bucket list! It cost quite a penny but Totally worth the money. I brought my bf here for his birthday awhile ago and I guess I never had the time to review it. Here it is: It was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Los Angeles.  We chose the 5 courses tasting which included wine pairing. Everything was delicious. Sea scallops were cooked to perfection and sashimi we had was amazing...super tasty! The amuse bouche was unique, a spoonful of solid mojito and a spoonful of screwdriver that looked like an egg yolk...nicely prepared. The plating of each dish was really nice. Although the portions were small, 5 courses were definitely enough food for each of us. Restaurant has excellent service and the atmosphere is great for romantic dinner. Restaurant was quiet and decor was clean and sleek. Parking: valet or street. Highly recommended

This is one of those that I REALLY wanted to like. So much so that I scheduled it on my actual birthday during a week of celebrations. I am comparing it to other Michelin rated restaurants I have been to. The place is very nice. Muted dark colors, modern yet cozy. The only standout was the foie gras ravioli, the salt butter with bacon brioche and the bottle of Caymus that we brought. That's it. The main lobster appetizer was disappointing as was the pastry salmon with the Mexican shrimp. Mexican shrimp? OOOOOK.  The amuse bouche was a cold carrot drink which looking back, probably did set the tone for the night because I did not enjoy it. Here is where I wanted to cry; since it was my birthday they brought out this platter with about 10 different types of chocolates which looked amazing. I was so happy and was looking forward to devouring them. We took a bite of one and put it down, then the next, then the next, etc. They were awful. I want to say that I feel terrible saying that but they were. Disappointing does not begin to cover it. I LOVE SWEETS. This tray looked incredible. How can it be so deceiving! The last insult was the partying gift. We were given some sweets to take with us. A very nice gesture a lot of restaurants have but they were just as bad. I have come to the conclusion that it must have just been a bad night. Service was perfect as I expected, the place is beautiful and we had a couple of small things we liked but not enough to make this experience stand out. With so many places to try on our next visit to L.A., sadly this one will not be included.

Truly an amazing experience.   Went for our 10th wedding anniversary, and we wanted something really special.  Providence delivered completely.  We were going to get the regular tasting menu, but instead upgraded to the chef's tasting menu, which was an excellent choice.  We did not get the wine pairing. They start off with some fun amuse bouche.  Then a series of dishes, all of which were amazing.  Standouts were the shrimp cooked in salt and prepared table side, the kobe beef, which was sumptous, and the truffle pasta, which looked so simple, but with the shaved truffle on it was probably the best single dish of my life.  The earthy woody buttery taste of real truffle is unlike anything else, and the usual oil you get at other places is just a pale comparison.  We ended up so stuffed we could barely move. Total bill with tip ended up in the $450 range for two, with only one alcoholic drink.  This is literally the only bad thing about the place, the price.  If I could eat here multiple times a year I would jump at the chance though.  We'll be back, once we can afford it again.

It's a bad cliche when you run into Asians celebrating birthdays here or writing yelp reviews about the annual celebration. I'm proud to say I haven't fallen prey to the same ethnic behavior (yet) There's a $50 reservation cancellation fee when you make it via Open Table. Grown folks understand small businesses suffer when consumers leave them hanging. I wonder if men can start charging a date cancellation fee. That might reduce all the dating angst in the world. So I cancelled my reservations last minute without giving any excuses. And they understood and would not charge the fee. 5 stars without question, class act. Oh and they were great about confirming the reservations before hand twice. Well there's always next year to see if I succumb to my genetic disposition...

Went here awhile back with my girlfriend and her sister and we absolutely loved it. We are crazy about food and trying new things and were not afraid to drop a pretty penny to go to a Michelin restaurant. The ambiance was really nice and the service was excellent. The food lived up to the hype that we've heard (we had the chef's menu). The serving size for each of the courses seemed at first a bit small, but after two or three, we all decided that the sizes were probably for the best, given that we had many more delicious courses to come. Needless to say, by the time we had the final course, we were stuffed! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys food and fine dining, even if it's to splurge - there's no experience quite like it!

Honestly, my husband likes this place more than I do. This used to be my favorite place (because we had our first date here, on top of many things), but there are 2 main reasons why Providence isn't my favorite anymore: 1. they used to have a spectacular sago dessert dish that they took out of the menu! :( I've been back several times since, but it's not the same when your favorite dish is gone. 2. Cali banned foie. Well, I guess you can't blame the restaurant for that, but since they used to serve a very delicious pan seared foie... and the fact that it's no longer around... :( not happy. The plus points: - that dish with the santa barbara prawns.. YUM - the menu is heavily influenced by seafood / jap style

Beautiful restaurant with impeccable service.  Got the 5-course tasting menu with wine pairing.  Would not recommend the appetizer surf and turf on a stick.  It seemed no one in our big party really enjoyed it.  The turf was tough and salty and did not go particularly well with the surf.  The oyster appetizer was pretty good though and so was the cheese and dough.  Enjoyed the salmon skin and zucchini soup amuse bouche. One cannot really have a bad meal at Providence.  Unfortunately, with the Michelin 2 stars rating, I was expecting more.  This was the first Michelin stared restaurant that I had bread that was not hot out of the oven.  Don't get me wrong, the bread was still delicious, even though not warm.  The house riesling that was paired with the scallop course really drew out the fragrance of the seaweed in the nori bread.  The bacon brioche had a great texture and wonderful flavor.  The olive bread was fine and I suspect it would have been much better if fresh out of oven.  Granted that we went on a weekday but it was a big surprise that my bread was cold.  A possible explanation maybe that our party was so big, by the time the server got to me, the bread turned cold due to the blasting AC.  But I doubt that was the case.... Each course were flavorful (maybe a little too flavorful for my taste but still really good) and well executed.  The paired wine went well with each dish.    But I left not completely satisfied.  Maybe because the lack of foie gras, or maybe because of the rocky start with the appetizer and bread.  But overall a very lovely experience.

I came with the significant half on his birthday. We both ordered the full tasting manu with wine pairing. Amuse Bouche was unique and cute, the screwdriver bubble simply popped in my mouth. Food was fine and delicious, the sea urchin and veal dishes were my favorites. I especially enjoyed the wine pairing, it went perfectly with the meal. Service was super attentive and wait staff really seemed to have good knowledge about what they served. At the end we both were stuffed and satisfied. Bf also received a happy birthday manu with his name. Overall, it was a great dinning experience.

5 star presentation 4 star Service from Robert 1 star Indoor architecture 1 Star noise level (On the street) 1 star uncomfortable sitting 1 star host lady 1 star taste I made the reservation for Mr.Q' s Birthday.   Valet parking is super easy and when we walked into the restaurant, this Asian host lady asked us about our reservation. She never welcomed us nor said happy birthday to Mr.Q. She said" Follow him", I was like '?!?!" and she pointed her finger to another waiter and told us to follow him. She had this Chinatown take out restaurant working attitude. We were led to a semi patio sitting. The decorated Slate Stone Wall didn't cover the wind that blows on my back nor the super loud car engine noise from the street. The chair is super heavy, it's very noisy with the metal legs and the chair is uncomfortable. The table is tiny and the seaweed lookalike candle holder is taking a lot space. The indoor patio area is very dark and claustrophobic.   The people on the table beside us had to use their Iphone lights to see what's on the menu. I can't admire how artistic the chef was, cuz the room is to dark to see any color on the plate. The main dining room is more bright, however the wall is in a moss green and the white ceramic shell lookalike pieces makes it look like a secondary school toilet. (When the kids were throw the wet toilet paper to the ceiling) It was a creative idea, but it didn't work out visually. We took the Providence market menu --+ The bread was just okay and the seaweed bread tasted like steamed bun. ---Chef's complimentary appetizer:  Water melon in champagne and grape: It comes out in a small transparent bowl and covered with crushed  ice and garnished with flower petals. It looks desirable. Water melon tasted like the fruits out of sangria and the coldness of the semi frozen grape almost murdered my teeth. --+Chilled zucchini soup and cheese puff: zucchini soup is creamy and light. The cheese puffy is nice, warm and salty. --+ The Japanese kampachi:The fish meat is sweet and tender. Heirloom tomato is sweet,  the tomato gelee is refreshing. However the tomato soup is salty and extremely sour. The soup was overpowering the whole dish. The soggy tiny rice pop gives the whole dish a weird texture and it looks disturbing.   There is too many flavors on this dish.   --+Crispy Salmon skin with smoked salmon paste: The crispy salmon is overly salted and the smoked salmon paste tasted fishy and bland. ---The WORST DISH of the night is the Uni/egg. It was overly salted.  It tasted almost bitter. The tiny crouton on the top is dramatically over salted, the egg/cream is overly salted after you try to scoop the uni. I can barely taste the uni. We left half of it in the egg shell. --+ Hokkaido sea scollop is overcooked and it wasn't fresh. The scallop meat is firm and the texture at the center is very stiff. The sauce that goes with the scallop tasted excellent. It was lightly sweetened and full with the flavor. --+Smoked salmon belly: The salmon belly is beautifully smoked, it smelled great, but the fish is bland. And it's textured like eating flavorless gummy bear.The green vegetable on the side tasted overly salted. When you combine them together? The over salted sides didn't save the bland chewy fish belly. --+Wild pacific halibut: The fish looks beautifully seared, the top was over seasoned and it was chewy. The center was actually beautifully done. It was translucent and the fish meat is sweet and delightful. The beans were tasty and the sauce that goes with the fish tasted just alright, there is nothing special about it. --+Tenderloin of veal: Is actually the best dish of the whole menu. The veal is a bit over seasoned, however the meat is juicy and tender. The green beans on the side is tender crisp, the rest on the vegetable sides were overly salted. The bacon is salty, chanterelle mushroom were overly salted(not edible). --+ cheese plate: You can get everything on this cheese cart at Whole foods market.   --- Our pre dessert: plum sorbet, apple tapioca tasted like eating Palmolive Aloe. The combination of buttermilk and kaffir lime tasted awful together.  Gross. --+ Dark chocolate mousse was frozen when it arrived, Ice cream is nice, but the cocoa streusel were dry. It tasted like crushed Oreo cookies. ---espresso macarons were overly sweetened, sea salt caramel paste is overly sweetened, fruit candy is surprisingly tasty. There is a lot bacon involved from at least 3 out of 9 dishes. The food looks amazing even in the dark, but it tasted from completely flavorless to overly salted, we had to drink a lot water at that night. Again, too much clue is clueless. The best dish of the night was the fruit candy. I will not recommend this over salted restaurant with extreme street noise to my Yelpers.

I didn't come here for a special occasion but Its not everyday I would be coming to Providence so I went all out. We got the nine course tasting menu WITH wine pairing. I must say they chose some delicious wine because some of the wine tasted BETTER then the food itself! i must go back to find out which wines they were!! does anybody know??? Towards the end of the meal, we were so stuffed, I couldn't think of taking another bite. SOme of the dishes are fun and so unique such as the amuse bouche, but some are just salty and some are just plain, nothing TOO special.. IT was a mixture of ups and downs throughout the courses.I remember I really enjoyed their fish. I think it was bass? but it had like chestnuts with it and the pairing was delicious. This is a place you must try at least once. It's really fun to go with good company and oohh and ahh over the presentation and wondering what will come out next.The food is refined and classy. They use top notch ingredients. It was a great food dining experience.

Since my old yelp account got deleted and I hadn't gotten to writing a review about this place, here it is - reincarnated in a less spectacular form. So, this is probably my favorite restaurant in Los Angeles. Now living in Southern California for the last 3 years and now moving to San Francisco, I realize how pretentious, fake and honestly "wannabe" the haute cuisine in Los Angeles is. Before I moved to the Bay Area, my opinions would have been much different and honestly I had great food fare in Los Angeles, but the City of Angels is all about appearances overlying an empty and lonely shell. Even with the retroscope, I will still say that Providence remains one of my favorite restaurants because it is one of the few that stand out. I came here for a Valentine's Day dinner and had a 9 course meal that lasted over 2 hours long. I can't remember everything on the menu but I recall that the wine pairing and cheese cart made it extra delicious. Also having a friend as a cook here made it nice to say hello and "great job with the meal!" Since that dinner, I had returned again for a normal dining experience and it was just as amazing. The combination of flavors reign supreme here. It definitely deserves its two Michelin stars. In a city of pretentious and underwhelming restaurants (I'm thinking of you - Nobu, STK, SLS), this place wins out.

I absolutely love Providence! Their seafood items are fresh and delicious. The servers are also very attentive and would create a show to enhance your dining experience. The prices are fairly expensive. But that's how most fine dining places are like. It is definitely somewhat a romantic setting and would be great to celebrate anniversary. I went there for my birthday and had a lot of fun. Dress code is not strict, but it's definitely a dressy setting. Parking is somewhat difficult because it's basically street parking, unless you choose to do valet. Overall, i give Providence FIVE stars! :D

Went here on my actual birthday...and for a 2-michelin star rated restaurant, I was surprised that the restaurant wasn't better not just in food, but service.  Not that the food or service is bad, but it's not up to par for what should be a 2-michelin star restaurant. There are only 2 restaurants in LA that have 2 stars...this one and Melisse and I found Melisse to be 10x better tasting than Providence.   Anyways, we did the full tasting menu plus added raw oysters a la carte.  The oysters were very fresh.  The tasting menu itself was ok...there were some very tasty items and others were mediocre...or not even that great (which should rarely happen at a restaurant rated so highly).  The seafood is inarguable very fresh...and all fish/meat dishes were cooked to perfection, tender, not dry.  I found the desserts to be a bit on the disappointing side, especially the dark chocolate dessert.  The jicama raspberry one was actually a very nice palette cleanser and very light.  Looking at the difference between the 5-course and full tasting menu, you might as well pay the extra $30 and try the extra 3 dishes + cheese cart.  In fact, the items that would be omitted if you ordered the 5 course tasting are some of the better tasting ones from the full tasting menu. Even though the seafood is really fresh and prepared well, I found Water Grill in downtown LA to have that same freshness at a fraction of the cost of Providence.  A main difference is that at Water Grill, you would order only ONE fish as your entree, whereas if you do the tasting menu at Providence, you get to try multiple fish (since the portions are smaller).   Overall, the food here is good, but not sure if it's worth the price that you pay.  As for service, the waiters are very nice & explain what dish you are eating before you eat, but I was just surprised that they missed the major detail that it was my bday and did not even stick a candle for me to blow out on one of my desserts...huge minus.  I was so surprised that I asked my bf after we had left if he had mentioned that it was my bday when he made reservations...he confirmed that he did...so it's not a mistake on the bf's end....*speechless*

Oh me oh my what an experience.. I took a good friend of mine here to celebrate her birthday (they even wrote her name on the menu). This was both our first time dining at Providence and also at a place like this that is so elegant. I made reservations via open table and note that you must provide your credit card number. If you fail to cancel your reservations at least 48 hours in advance, there is a $75 per person..yikes! This place is a bit hard to find, I was only able to locate it because of the valet service outside. There is free parking on the street, so if you want to save a few bucks, look for parking! Once I stepped inside, I was blown away by how beautiful this restaurant is! Be sure to be dressy, this is not casual dining ;) We arrived at 7:30 and didn't leave til about 10. Service is excellent but extremely slow.. We both order a fruity cocktail, which I forgot the name but it tasted like a mimosa. $15 per drink. We ordered the 5 course dinner ($100/person) + foie gras ravioli($28). ((Sorry in advance for not using the fancy food names)) The food items that stood out the most to me & I would highly recommend are the seared scallops (melts in your mouth, best I've ever had), the appetizers (crunchy rice salmon sashimi, cheese puff thing & soup through a straw) and the foie gras ravioli! The complimentary bread was pretty good too. I loved the one w/ bacon (yum) & the seaweed one wasn't too bad. It was a fun and different dining experience. Super romantic place. Go check it out ;)

In a single sentence, this was probably the best meal of my life. Taken here for my birthday, I opted for the full 15 course tasting and pairing. A decision only met after an exquisite cocktail. The amuse bouche, a mojito and screwdriver in a playful molecular gastronomy sense. The screwdriver, a delectable little orb that more resembled an egg yolk than a sip of a cocktail, while the mojito, a almost shaved ice cube. Things were off to a fantastic start. The subsequent three courses, light, whimsical, a lollipop of miso glazed abalone, scallops in oyster leaves, and eel left me wanting oh so much more of this evening. Such became the recurring theme of the evening, delightful seafood combinations prepared with such mastery that can only be found of truly remarkable culinary minds. Another highlight of the evening was a dish dubbed "Fish Face" the recently prepared fish was brought, and presented to us before being carved and plated for our enjoyment. I should extend a compliment to the sommelier as well for the evening as the pairings were amazing. I left with an extreme level of content. Also, the hospitality of the evening was amazing, we had met the general manager, Donato, a few weeks prior attending 5x5 at Melisse. An extremely friendly and generous fellow. He recalled my companion for the evening had mentioned our attendance for my birthday; extending his warmest greetings upon our arrival the evening was assured to be excellent. In all, the evening left me with only one desire: To make plans to return.

So this place is not for everyone.  It is not for those who want a "good deal."  It is not for those who want a quick bite to eat.  This is for those who want a fine dining experience that rivals the best places in the United States and are willing to pay for it.  For our anniversary, my wife and I had the 9-course tasting menu called the "Market Menu."  We even added another course because, after our honeymoon in Paris, my wife has grown quite fond of foie gras, which was not on the Market Menu, but which we added.  With the two rounds of amuse bouche before the meal starts, the 9 is really 11 (which made our 10 really 12).  We had the wine pairing too, which was both perfect with and accentuated  every course.  The service is friendly and precise, without being stuffy.  Truly a wonderful experience. Amuse bouche 1:  two cocktails in spoons (frozen mojito cube and screwdriver encased to look like an egg yoke) Amuse bouche 2:  trout rillette on a rice cracker, Gruyere stuffed mini puff pastry and a soup that was so rich it almost made me cry. App 1:  Kanpachi Sashimi with a champagne gelee and smoked sesame. App 2:  Santa Barbara Sea Urchin under a bed of softly scrambled egg, served in an egg shell.  Even trying this was a stretch for my wife, who ended up loving it.  I added the caviar to mine, which accented this lovely sublime dish. App. 3 (which I added):  Terrine of foie gras with grilled brioche, roasted grapes and a tomato jam that was awesome, Entree 1:  Grilled Maine Sea Scallop with squash, chestnuts and sorrel.  Another perfect dish. Entree 2:  Rhode Island Sea Bass  with pickled ginger and the sweetest carrot slices I have ever tasted. Entree 3:  Arctic Char with quince turnip and pork belly.  Simple and elegant. Entree 4:  Slow roasted veal tenderloin with baby broccoli and truflled vinaigrette, also served with an amazing single stalk of asparagus. Cheese Course:  3 lovely cheeses (that I chose with the assistance of the server), served with candied walnuts, figs, two different fruit compotes and olive nut bread. Dessert 1:  Guava sorbet with yuzu, sake and cucumber.  Light and refreshing. Dessert 2:  Chocolate bomb with a bite size dark chocolate cake, a teaspoon of a vanilla sorbet on chocolate nibs, with bitter chocolate piece and sauce drizzled everywhere. This meal was exceptional, rivaling some of the best food I have ever had.  The flow of the meal was elegant, with their insertion of the foie gras at the perfect place. Every wine was perfectly married to the course.  It was very costly and very very good.  This is a place to dine and appreciate what an artist can do with food.   Michael Cimarusti is an amazing chef and Providence deserves its Michelin stars.  I would love to go back again.

This place takes the #1 spot in my heart right now. The food was amazing! We did the 9 course tasting and every course had it's own presentation and unique taste you can't find anywhere else. It is worth the $$$$ people. On top of that the service and staff were very attentive as well.

Ambiance:  Gorgeous.  Simply gorgeous.  Elegant and luxurious. Food:  Spectacular.  Smaller portions, it's true, but the fine quality, the surprising combinations, the perfection of each bite... heaven. I'd highly recommend the Santa Barbara Spot Prawns and then just trust the chefs and go for one of the Tasting menus. The Chef's Tasting menu is truly a FEAST and a FEAT.  Plan to go really hungry and pace yourself.   Service: Impeccable.  The servers, managers, sommelier were perfectly courteous.  I detest pretentious atmospheres.  This restaurant deserves their Michelin stars, culinary awards, etc., and I love that they make us feel welcome each time we come.

The tasting menu with the wine pairing was AMAZING. The presentation and the food was just so well made. The wines there were also very good and the sommelier did a wonderful job pairing the wine. David, our waiter/sommelier is moving back to Berlin, Germany and he was wonderful. The fusion was really interesting and it wasn't over the top. The white truffle risotto was my favorite! The uni with the fat was also incredible. I would highly recommend the place, one of my favorite places so far.

Came here for husband's birthday celebration.  I somehow had thought that this restaurant is as big as Patina Downtown but nope, it's pretty small and cozy with very interesting decorations.  I was a little disappointed location wise since you have to valet park on a pretty dark street around the corner.   We were seated very quickly and the waiters were very attentive and nice.  We both had the 5 course tasting dinner. * Amuse bouche #1 = two cocktails in spoons...really cute! The frozen mojito cube was so yummy...the screwdriver somehow made to look like an egg yoke was a ok to me but my husband loved it. * Kanpachi Sashimi with a champagne gelee = yum!  Now me being Japanese, I would have loved some soy sauce haha* * Grilled Maine Sea Scallop = GREAT dish.  Perfectly cooked with just the right amount of flavor. * Rhode Island Sea Bass  = very yummy...really * Wagyu Beef = melts in your mouth good... * Chocolate bomb with a bite size dark chocolate cake = sad to say but it wasn't really impressive. * There will be 3 mini bite size dessert at the end with the check.  None of them were anything to rave for... Overall, it was a really nice experience and we will go back soon. * Price = expected for a restaurant of this caliber. * Location = a little off the main street but nice * Ambiance = calm and unique * Service = very good

Providence has the freshest seafood in town and a lot of their dishes were amazing looking. There are so much component to each dish and it is very creative. The people there are extremely professional and Chef Michael know his stuff. I only tasted a few plates but next time I am going try the tastering menu.

Food was mediocre, service was horrendous. I made reservations for 9pm, arrived at 8.45pm, seated at 9.30pm. Waited another 15 min at the table just for the menu. The only dish worth a mention would be the foie gras. Yet I've tasted better. Dessert was a great disappointment. Check came up to $240 for a dinner party of 2. Trust me-- when you have a budget like this, go to Melisse. You'll thank me ;)

My boyfriend and I came here to eat on our one-year anniversary. We had the chef's menu, which was 15 courses of small samples. The food, although in small portions, was amazing! Those 15 plates really, and I do mean REALLY, fill you up. The steak and the skewers were my favorite! I also remember we had a cheese course, and the servers actually rolled in a GIANT CART of over 50 kinds of cheese, and we got to choose six to put on our plate. We aren't cheese people, so we asked the server for recommendations, and everything she gave us was really yummy! The place is also VERY elegantly furnished and decorated, candlelight dinner and everything. Everyone was really nice and friendly too. It was an unforgettable dinner but too bad it will probably make your wallet sad xD

Wow. I've been meaning to write my Providence review, but I don't really think they need another review of their full tasting menu. So it's more for me to remember what I had...For starters, I liked the "under water" theme with the beaded seaweed centerpieces and translucent glass lit from behind by aqua blue under-the-sea ambiance. Because the food is all seafood and delicioussss. Start off with bacon focaccia and seaweed focaccia. I could go home happy with this. The seaweed one is definitely interesting and worth trying. It has the salty seaweed taste (maybe slightly overly salted). But the bacon focaccia is to dieee for. Fluffy and savory and bacon-y...MMM... Amuse bouche: We had a mojito gelee and a screwdriver sphere. The mojito gelee was delicious, but I REALLY liked the screwdriver sphere. Orange juice + vodka encased in a sodium alginate sphere that popped in your mouth after you slurped it up. It was like drinking a delicate balloon waiting to pop a delicious surprise in your mouth. Refreshing and yummy! Also had three little plates of savory amuse bouche...what looked like a salmon carpaccio on a cracker, a cheese puff, and soup with port wine reduction that was drank through a straw and a shot glass. Mm.. Japanese kanpachi: This was utterly DELICIOUS. The sashimi was fresh and seasoned with olive oil, sesame seeds, and paired with a champagne gelee...sooo good! Santa barbara sea urchin: mixed in with "soft scrambled eggs" and croutons inside the cracked top egg shell itself, this was a creamy, brothy delight. Which I probably would have enjoyed better if i actually liked uni. But most people love this. Scallops: this is a pretty good scallop if ever there was one. Scallops usually taste rubbery to me and thus I'm not really a fan of them, but these were cooked well. With a bit of wine in the sauce and pistachios, radish on the side, not too bad. Unfortunately, though the scallop was good, the flavorings of the sauce were just okay for me. Wild striped bass with foie gras emulsion and walnut and brown sugar streusel aside topped with parsnips. This was my other favorite. Quite a delicious grouping of flavors, albeit a tad excessive because so much was going on that I felt like a little kid at Disneyland trying to go on all the rides at one time. The streusel added a nice little texture touch and the foie gras flavors were awesome. Arctic Char...basically a slice of salmon with super crispy skin (added nice texture) in a fennel broth and vegetables in a mandarin orange sauce. I liked the salmon and the fennel brother but the orange flavors were just a little bit too weird to be paired with this. I know they wanted citrus with the fish, but lemon is still the way to go. And again too much was going on, but not in a good way this time. Veal tenderloin with a potato and asparagus puree, king oyster mushroom, and grilled giant asparagus. The veal was sooo good, cooked to perfection, tender and yummy. However, the oyster mushroom was wayyy too salty. My only complaint about this. Cheese bar...this is pretty cool! They tell you about different cheeses and you can choose 3. My favorite was this sharp swiss one. The brie was like melting...kinda weird. And the goat cheese...meh. I think I'll pass on that next time. You also get cranberry walnut bread, candied walnuts, and two jams you choose (apricot jam and a yuzu sauce for us) to pair with your cheese. I wish I had room for this but we had to take this to go. Frozen bavarian yogurt with fennel shavings, yellow chartreuse, and angelica root. A wonderful palette cleanser, great textures, and quite delicious! I called it a "frozen yogurt salad" cz the fennel was crunchy :) Honestly, the meal should have ended there, because the dark chocolate paste (looked like it was squeezed from toothpaste tube) with the mint ice cream and dried raspberries was just meh. I didn't care for it at all. They also gave a last complimentary dessert of banana caramels, dulche de leche macarons, and caramelized something jellies. All in all, one of the most delightful dining experiences I've ever had!

been wanting to try Providence for a while so I decided to go with my mom for a fun girls night. We got there right on time for our reservation, but they were running behind so they pointed us to the bar which was strangely very crowded...took a little while to get someones attention. We got seated about 15 minutes late without apology which was sort of irritating, but the service from that point forward was wonderful. I had the foie gras as an appetizer which was good but didn't compare to Melisse. The John Dory as my main.The waiter did help me choose a wine to match my menu choices which I appreciated.  I also split a dessert with my mom that i cannot recall..so obviously it wasn't that amazing. All in all Providence is definitely good, but for this kind of money, I much prefer Melisse in Santa Monica (that is my benchmark restaurant..the one to beat!)

Wow I did not expect to spend more than 3 hours here eating dinner! The food just kept coming out on a consistent basis. It just didn't end, not that I'm complaining. Another 5 star review...Big surprise Decor: Very modern, elegant, and luxurious. The interior is dimly lit and has a Little Mermaidish look just like Eli. G. has described it. There are what looked like flower petals and/or sea shells strategically located on the walls.  I also noticed some white Christmas tree-like lights. Food: 4.5 Stars***** We ordered the market menu, which was an endless flood of mouthwatering goodness for several hours. :) High quality ingredients and perfectly prepared dishes. I can honestly say that I enjoyed every part of my experience. 1) 3 Breads: Bacon brioche, nori focaccia, and Olive oil roll. I enjoyed all of them, but I couldn't stop eating the bacon brioche. I've never had anything like it and it's pretty addicting! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 2) Salmon skin with smoked ocean trout mouse with chives and garlic http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 3) Cold Zucchini soup - Parmesan Gougere with Bechamel, chives, and nori http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 4) Hokkaido Sea Scallops - These were my favorite of the night. Some of the best if not the best scallops I've ever had. It was almost as soft as butter. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 5) Wild Pacific Halibut with cranberry beans, nori, brown butter http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 6) Pork Belly - Best pork belly I've ever tasted. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 7) Assorted cheeses - Water buffalo was my favorite. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Dessert: 1) Bittersweet chocolate mousse, chocolate streusel - It really was bittersweet, but I enjoy a slight bitterness to chocolate, so I enjoyed it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 2) Rasberry Macaron with Apricot and Black pepper pate de fruit http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Drinks: 5 Stars ***** Operator - Atlantico rum, honey liqueur, white grape juice, lime juice, pineapple sage foam. Service: 5 Stars ***** Impeccable. Every course was perfectly timed. They gave us time to enjoy each plate and soon as we were done the plates just disappeared. After a few minutes, another course would arrive. I stopped keeping count and trying to remember each course and just enjoyed my company. Parking: I believe the valet was about $6. You can try to find parking in the neighborhood, but good luck.

Talk about overrated and overpriced!  This restaurant received the James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant in the US.  If you like overpriced food in an overbearingly pretentious setting, then I guess this is the place.  All the food I ordered arrived in a frothy buttery concoction that bordered on gross.  There are many outstanding restaurants in Los Angeles and that this was awarded top honors seems  a bit outrageous, but people seem to love it.  I just think Mozza outshines this place any day of the week.  And, at least there the food is delicious.  At Providence, what I ordered was mostly one-note and I definitely have no need to go back.

Took my wife here for her birthday because she loves iron chef and always wanted to be a judge so thought it would be fun for her to try the set course menus. We both tried the chef's menu and I had it with the wine pairing. It was SUPER DELICIOUS. Everything was amazing and you would think you don't get full from the small portions of each dish, but in the end we were stuffed. Would recommend this to everyone I know. It's kinda in the middle of nowhere and doesn't look all great from the outside, but once you go in its amazing from start to finish. You won't be disappointed.

A big thank you to Chef Cimarusti for a wonderful birthday experience! The level of service was great. Thankfully, the only holiday being celebrated the night we went there this time was my birthday, so the place wasn't packed like when we went for Valentine's Day years ago.  Enjoyed some time in the bar before our table was ready; comfy couch, lovely side table for our drinks, and the manager finds us when it's time to begin the evening's gluttony! We sat in a different part of the restaurant than last time; I really like it! It's to the left of the front door and it felt like a patio area, although not outside. It was comfy, cute, and gave me a nice view of the restaurant. Bobby, our server, was friendly, informative, and had great personality. I inquired if Chef was in and if he traditionally makes rounds; Bobby said that if not, we'd "go in and find him!"  I do love meeting talented chefs! We enjoyed most of the 15 course chef tasting menu. By 'most of' it, I mean that we were so full by the end that it's a blur! We took the cheese and petit four home and skipped out on a dessert or two. My goodness that was a lot of food! Everything is expertly prepared with exquisite ingredients. The menu changes a lot, so there's no reason to go through every dish, but a few stars: -Kumamoto Oyster with jalapeno, cilantro, and lime, served with Oysterplant and a "mignonette"  Such interesting flavors and presentation. Amazing how a plant can end up tasting like an actual oyster! And, the true oyster was excellent, as was expected. -Uni Canape was amazing -Fluke was outstanding; I swear I tasted a little bit of shiso leaf in there, and it was great! -Cheese cart was stunning and we were given so much cheese! The real standout of the evening, however, was getting to meet the chef. Our server, Bobby, came over to tell us that the chef wanted us to come say hi in the kitchen. Yay! Chef Cimarusti couldn't have been nicer or more gracious. He very much came across like a normal guy; I know that sounds odd, but some chefs do and others don't. He had no airs, no arrogance, nothing. Just kind and casual.  A little while after we returned to our table, our server brought a menu of what we had, which I had requested, but Chef signed it too! The server who brought our cheese mentioned that we were lucky as he doesn't do that often. So happy! What an excellent birthday! Even without such an amazing night I was thankful for all my blessings, but this night just pushed my gratitude over the edge. =)

Michelin stars?  As in the tire company?  What the heck does rubber have to do with a lovely evening?  (Well...depends on what kind of rubber we're talking about here.  Hehe...I kid, I kid) As much as I'd like to gush about everything from start to finish, I think Anthony N., Crystal Cuc N., Cesar R., Chad A., and Eli G. (just to name a few) have done such a beautiful job documenting EACH and every little bite and morsel that this review will focus on tips and highlights of the meal.  Mainly, what I've learned from this fine dining experience! TIP 1:  Keep your eyes open!  It's easy to miss the restaurant (we sure did!).  It looks like something you'd find in Architectural Digest.  Almost reminds me of a  condo complex from the outside.  Look out for the wooden slats that adorn the front of the building.  The uplights create such a dramatic effect at night.  It's beautiful! TIP 2:  The left side of the menu consists of an a la carte menu while the right features a tasting menu of either 5, 9 or 15 courses.  The 5 and 9 courses are shown on the menu whereas the 15 (not shown) is your Chef's Special tasting menu that includes the Chef's creations that evening.  Order this, and you don't question a thing.  To me, it's like Providence's version of omakase.  You leave it to the Chef.  No substitutions, no if's, and's, or but's! TIP 3:  Go for the tasting menu and come famished.  It's not every day that you get to dine in such an establishment.  Enjoy the experience.  Save the a la carte menu for the one Michelin star restaurants haha TIP 4:  Skip the cocktail and go for the wine pairing.  Faux pas number one on my part was to order a cocktail...and then decide to get the wine pairing afterwards.  I was tipsy by the second course!   TIP 5:  You can make substitutions with the 5 and 9 course menus.  We substituted some of the dishes with the Market Specials at the bottom right: 1. Bay Scallop 2. Foie Gras 3. Black Winter Truffle 4. Wagyu Beef.  There's an upcharge but well worth it.   TIP 6:  Remember when you got to dress up for Prom?  By all means, don't come in a ball gown, but it would be nice to dress up a bit.  That evening, I slipped on that little black dress.  The one that draped over one side, exposing my bare shoulder and hugged my every curve.  My hair fell in waves of curls and I wore a scarlet red lipstick.  It was called Russian Red...the khai-pleez-to-meet kind of Russian Red.  I accessorized with a satin clutch, fuschia peep toes, and my date...handsomely decked out in a finely cut suit.  I felt all grown up.  We were going to eat art! The French (say it with me now...FRAW-nsh...make sure you say it with a gargle) are known for their lavish decor, decadent fare, and artistic display of all things edible.  Providence, though reminiscent of French fare, dabbles in Asian fusion and highlights interesting combinations.  Each dish was a work of art in itself, from the presentation of the main items, to the compotes, and gelees that accompany its main star, as well as the vessels in which these works of art were displayed upon.  Each moment of this 3 hour meal was pure bliss.  From the minute we stepped foot into the restaurant, to the time we left, this was what it felt like to be spoiled. I close with a few quick lessons...after all, we are learning FRAW-nsh, oui? Lesson One: Amuse-Bouche [uh-MYUZ-boosh] noun - A tidbit, often tiny, portion of food to wet one's appetite.        Usages:            * Correct:  The Chef sent out complimentary amuse bouche before our entrees.              * Incorrect:  I'd like him to amuse my bouche. Now you'll know what to expect (or not) when dining at Providence.   Lesson Two: Don't be so serious!  Have fuuun!  Savor the moment.  Savor each, and every bite!

I haven't been here in years and they still are one of the top restaurants around! We recently went for Lissa G's birthday and everything was perfect. From the great service (thanks Bobby), to of course the amazing food, to actually meeting the chef and checking out the kitchen, it could not have been better. We did the full on chef's tasting menu (15 courses) with wine.  Be prepared for a marathon!  I wish I could have taken a little nap in between course #9 and #10, kind of a halftime for food. I love oysters on their own, but their version with jalapeno, cilantro and lime had a nice kick that I haven't experienced before. My other favorites were the Santa Barbara spot prawn with caviar, and the Wagyu was melt in your mouth amazing. We had a great night and this was one of those experiences that was well worth the money.

5 stars for the food and the service 3.5 for the atmosphere/ambiance Averaged out to 4 Allow me to elaborate: The atmosphere is extremely stuffy and a bit old fashioned. It's actually what I would think of when I think of a "fancy restaurant" and I didn't particularity like it. I didn't feel comfortable there even though I was dressed nicely and it was rather disconcerting to see people eating there in acid washed jeans and white Reebok sneakers (tourists???) when you're all dressed up. Like, I felt that I was the imposter because I was dressed nicely at a fancy-pants restaurant. Ugh. It's not really a place I wanted to linger in which is unfortunate because.... The food is phenomenal. I had the best fish I've ever eaten here. The best. Number one. Never had any better. It was a special that day so I don't know if would be a regular menu item or not but it was a whole cooked sea bass (don't remember which one, fail, but I doubt you would be any less delighted if you chose any other whole fish they have). They brought it to my table in all its cooked glory, head and tail intact, and then expertly filleted it table side. The guy preparing the fish joked that he had removed 99% of the bones and he was that good because I only ended up picking out two small bones out of the whole thing, which is impressive. It was everything you wanted in a fish, soft melt-in-your-mouth flesh, amazing seasoning, etc. etc. It was utterly perfect and I cannot sing the praises of that fish highly enough. Before the fish came we had some appetizers which didn't disappoint either. We had both the dungeness crab and the Santa Barbara prawns. What can I say, they were also stunning dishes. Amazing quality of both the crabs and prawns, perfectly paired seasonings (I wanted to lick the plate at one point), and beautiful presentation as well. We were also served a few amuse-bouche courses in between. Delightful. We went with the cheese plate for dessert and we picked about three or four cheeses off the cheese cart (now that was a tricky, having to pick three out of so many options!). I love cheese more than I love traditional desserts so any place that has this option gets automatic high marks in my book. Along with the excellent food, the service was truly impeccable. They were extremely attentive without being overbearing and on top of that, very very knowledgeable about all the dishes. That tip you're going to leave on that very large total? 100% worth it. This place certainly lives up to the hype in terms of food and service and I cannot praise them more highly. It is definitely very fine dining. However, I didn't much like being at the restaurant and though the deliciousness of the food distracted me, it was still not a place I felt comfortable lingering.

Very upscale place w/ nice/calm ambiance!  The food was absolutely delish.  We took my sister-in-law here for her birthday and went w/ the priciest tasting menu and I'd say it was over-priced but soooo yummmm!  I'd recommend going here if you're planning a splurge night - so probably a special occasion would be nice.  Definitely order the foie gras saute if you're into foie gras!  Service was excellent!  The reason they didn't get a full 5-stars is the price HEHE :P One note - make reservations in advance.  This place gets booked really early on.  We had to do a late 9pm dinner and weren't done until practically midnight.  Park on Cole Avenue - there's plenty of spaces but a couple blocks away (save on valet).  Lastly, when there and deciding on the menu - know that you'll hafta ALL do the same tasting menu.  Sadly we studied our menu for a bit and when we each decided on a different tasting menu - we were told all of us have to do the same one (no options).

I'm lost at words just trying to describe my dining experience here. We went here for lunch and all I can say it was well worth the drive & money. I came here on a Friday, for my friend's surprise BDay lunch. If you know LA traffic, then you know how bad it can get on a Friday. Anyway, it was both our first time dining at this place and the staff were friendly and very helpful when you're indecisive. I wanted steak but I had a hard time between their NY steak & Wagyu, I ended up choosing the Wagyu. OMG!!! very tender & very buttery, simply delicious. This is all I have to say about this place...you really have to dine here to know what I'm talking about and what other reviewers are saying. My recommendation: come to this place with good company or alone. Good company + good food, = memorable dining experience.

I came here one night for a business dinner and have nothing but praise for this # 1 rated restaurant. I had extremely high expectations as it ranks as "Best Restaurant in Los Angeles" in every publication I've read. We started off with some hors d'oeuvre, cocktails and several set menu courses. Everything about my experience dining at Providence LA was excellent. The service was impeccable and not once did I feel uncomfortable even while speaking with the sommelier about the wine pairing. To close we had had the dessert, in addition they sent us off with some candies and macarons! Set Menu dungeness crab (oregon) mandarins, blood orange, coriander, habanero, puffed rice wine pairing: txakolina, xarmant arabako 2010 new bedford sea scallops (massachusetts) bergamot, pistachio, blood orange, fava beans wine pairing: sauvignon blanc, te muna road vineyard, craggy range 2011 foie gras ravioli italian summer truffles, aromatics, parmesan wine pairing: marsannay, "cuvee marie ragonneau", domaine charles audoin 2008 prime new york steak (nebraska) charcoal grilled zuckerman farms green asparagus, california morels, emulsion of bone marrow wine pairing: aglianico, "donnaluna", de conciliis 2009 dark chocolate mint, cocoa nibs, pate a choux, strawberry Highly recommended if you can splurge for your meal here. One of the best meals I have had in Los Angeles.  Providence LA deserves the two-star Michelin rating ...  Michael Cimurusti has done a wonderful job here.

Went here with a couple friends for a Friday lunch. Great atmosphere, with very attentive service, but without being "intimidatingly fancy." The menu had several enticing entree options. I went with a fish dish, while my friends went for the steak. We were glad that we did not order an appetizer, since several light ones are provided, anyway; they were all very creative and quite tasty. The wine menu was good, with a few options that are not ridiculously expensive. Entrees were excellent. However, my fish dish was served without too much flair, while the steak (for just a couple of dollars more) included a little serving presentation and a lot more food, overall. Nevertheless, the ingredients were all clearly very fresh and high quality; lots of thought was put into the presentation. Very impressive place that I will gladly visit again.

My boyfriend and I had the Valentine's Day 7 course tasting menu. The tasting menu really highlighted the Providence's mastery of technique. The maine lobster was by far perfectly cooked and my favorite. The amuse bouche of their take on a screwdriver and mojito were also wonderfully done. I found a couple of their dishes to be a bit on the salty side and a couple to be a bit on the bland side. The flavors didn't completely wow me but they were very clean and the techniques used were amazing. The ingredients were fresh and highlighted very well. All around, the dishes balanced out and it was a very good meal. For Valentine's day, they offer boxes of chocolates for purchase. 12 pieces for $28. It was one really good box of chocolates. The box included various flavors such as Earl Gray + Bergamot, Soy Milk, and Mexican Chocolate. They were very high quality chocolates. Hopefully, they'll have them around for other occasions so I can get more. 4 stars ambiance 5 stars service 5+ stars technique 4 stars flavor 4 stars chocolate

Visited again for the 5x5 dinner.  This time, we were given all the courses that everyone else had received.  Hooray.  Service and Food were great.  It'll take another flawless trip for me to bump this up to a 5. My date and I were planning on having a romantic night out, but our table was right next to a large party of Cantonese people, so any hopes for having a quiet, private evening were quickly out the window.  Nothing you can really do about that though.  You could hear their conversation in the entire restaurant.

I came here for my good friend's going away dinner. All I have to say, I was blown away. We were here on a MONDAY. So, it didn't seem that busy.  Anyway, I suggest you make a reservation because last time when I was here it was extremely busy. Ordered the coure menu and more appetizers.  The course menu was simply amazing and was close to perfection. I could literally EAT THIS STUFF ALL DAY! Definitely a must go back place and you will not be disappointed.   If you are going there like us, I suggest you take some nice bottles of wine with you. There is no corkage fee on Monday.

Simply amazing.  The best meal I've ever had.  Twice.   Every dish was prepared perfectly...the way it should be.  The mixture of flavors were interesting, unexpected and like harmonious chords.   Try the Treacle cocktail. The service was not intrusive, yet prompt.  The atmosphere was quiet and comfortable.

This restaurant is a mixed bag.  Some of the dishes are good, others are less than.  Le Bernadin it is not. The staff is mixed as well.  We had a couple of staff who were quite nice and friendly. Unfortunately, our waiter was rude and condescending. Often rudely interrupting our conversation, and with an air of having better things to do than serve us. The sommelier was snooty as well. The atmosphere is not what you would expect for a Michelin starred restaurant.  The room is nice enough, but has an annex which appears to be a covered patio.  We were initially seated there, but it was hot and had a lot of road noise so we asked to be reseated.  We were given another table actually at the entrance to the patio so it suffered some of the same problems.  This was despite that fact that we had a 6pm reservation, the restaurant was empty when we arrived,  and did not really fill up until around 8pm. If I compare it to other restaurants, it does not measure up.I had been anticipating going to this restaurant for some time and had high hopes.  If you compare it  to some of my favorites, Alinea in Chicago, 11 Madison Park in NYC or Le Folie in San Francisco, it simply is not of the same standard. Neither the food nor the service is that great.  On the positive note, the valet is only 5 bucks and there was plenty of free parking in the neighborhood. Further, they appear to really differentiate among customers giving some good and friendly service and treating others poorly.  We were among the poorly treated.  Seeing as how we spent at least $700 for a dinner for 4, I would have expected better.  A really fine establishment should treat all customers well.  On that score it fails miserably. There are many fine establishments in Los Angeles.  I would avoid this one.

The food here makes me even more upset about the stupid foie gras ban that is going into effect the day after tomorrow. SIGH! Needless to say, the sauteed foie gras with black sesame and strawberries and the foie gras ravioli were a-m-a-z-i-n-g. I was trying to scoop up every last ounce of both dishes with the tip of my knife (because we didn't have spoons). I suppose it's not proper fancy restaurant etiquette to stick your knife in your mouth but whatevz. We also got the chowder, which, in my opinion, was actually probably the most tasty thing we tried today. There were big chunks of bacon, square cubes of bacon fat (yum), potatoes, and clams in their shell. The broth, although white, really tasted like fresh clam juice. delish. service was pretty good, too, for the most part. the chef, on his own accord, was nice enough to split some of the shared dishes into two separate plates for my boyfriend and me, and there was this one suited up guy that was so friendly and laughy. it made me feel less uncomfortable about my knife licking. but there are still a few reasons why i give providence 4 stars instead of 5. first, their raw oysters and their clam fritter appetizers were mediocre at best. the oysters had a weird smell to them and the fritters were mostly made of dough. second, the attentiveness the staff paid us was SLIGHTLY subpar to that given to the other patrons around us, who seemed to either be regulars at the restaurant or  were famous. that's understandable.... though i could be famous if i wanted... overall, providence was really good and i could definitely see myself returning! i'm excited to see what new dishes the chef will cook up to replace the foie gras stuff!

With over 1000 reviews on Yelp, I'm not sure I have anything original to add about Providence.  Only that dining here reminds me that there is real pleasure in eating...that eating is not about gobbling down, or shoveling food into one's mouth.  That eating is not a "because I have to" or an after-thought.  No, at Providence, it is the central player, THE entity you want to meet, and with whom you wish to relish your time.  It is also about a whole sensual experience: from the minute you approach the establishment, its people, warmth, and welcome, the restaurant design, mood, even its cutlery, and its lighting.  Every single detail has been attended to -- you included -- and I hadn't even gotten to the exquisite, delicate seafood-dominant menu yet.   For my birthday dinner, after the amuse bouche, we started with the Maine Lobster and Foie Gras Ravioli, followed by the Charcoal Grilled Wild French Turbot for Two, and desserts of Whipped Ganache with Kaffir Lime, and Lavender Ice-Cream.  Normally, I'd be snapping away at each dish with my camera, but tonight I just wanted to experience and let the food fully take me on a journey (besides, the lighting was too dim for my camera's exposure meter). What blew me away was the sheer amount of flavor packed into the small real estate of my fork.  Salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami...and textures of crunchy, soft, foamy, melty, unctuousness -- somewhere, somehow, it was all in there as I savored bite after slow bite.  Masterful!  I am still befuddled how Chef made the Screwdriver cocktail -- completely astonishing and delightful.  I loved it all, every single bite, from start to finish. This restaurant is not a place you want to rush through...it is meant to be thoroughly appreciated.  Let your eyes, mouth, nose, and tongue do what it's meant to do, and you will know what I mean. I could go on, but why bother?  I'd rather plan for my next meal at Providence.  Thank you Chef!!!

It's taken me a week or so to get my thoughts together about my dining experience at Providence. Much has been said, much has been Yelped... and in my experience, the P does not disappoint in the least. So I'll start where it starts and just kind of work outwards. A good friend of mine, we'll call her Ian, is an up and coming Hollywood agent. I've known her for around a year, but we don't get to hang out that much. At least not in LA. Anyway, last year, Ian mentioned that she wanted to take me out to a nice dinner and talk a little business. Read: expense that shit. I asked her if she cared if the place was 'violently expensive,' which is my term for something so expensive you kind of try not to think about it as you're enjoying the experience. I have shoes that fall into this category, books, cameras, furniture, vintage stereo equipment, watches... yeah. Anyway, I suggested Urasawa, and Ian said sure. I showed her a few reviews so she would know what she was in for and she was still on board. I was psyched to be going there, and then on the day of, when I mentioned that we were in for a thousand-dollar plus experience, she backed out. I can't blame her. Thus, this time, I knew it could be awesome food but maybe not quite that 'sawa spendy. Enter Providence. I'd wanted to check it out for a while, as my dialogues with Yelper Kayla from a few years back indicated, but I hadn't quite found the right occasion. I called and got a same-day reservation. Voila. Upon entering I was instantly seduced. The decor is muted, sophisticated, even a little unexpected. I liked it and I was excited as to what was to come as we sat in the bar and enjoyed a glass of wine. Less than ten minutes later, we were shown to our table, on the side of the larger dining room. It was on the little semi-indoor patio with space heaters. Probably a bit more cozy than the main room, in fact. I'll note that my friend had smoked some high-grade cannabis before dinner, while I had -- for some strange reason -- deep-throated a six inch turkey sandwich about 90 minutes before game time. At least I stopped before ordering a foot long. We opted for the 9 course tasting menu with wine pairings. I won't go into the specifics of each dish, but I liken the experience to being told a story by a master storyteller, cinematic in your mouth, sometimes shocking you, sometimes teasing you, sometimes seducing you, but always keeping you rapt and completely immersed in the experience. (my Yelp URL isn't 'foodporn' for nothing.) A server brings every course out and lets you know the specifics of what you are eating. The dialogue is fun and engaging. Each course is a master work of food art, a play of color, composition, taste and texture designed to spoil you and take your mouth to new places. The wine pairings were truly inspired. I'm a wine lover but I can't say I'm terribly experienced, and I felt my understanding grow with each successive pour. Ian likes food but she isn't really a foodie per se, so at every course we talked a lot about what we were eating and how the flavors harmonized or slam danced in our mouths. Among my favorite touches was the cheese cart. You ask some questions, select a cheese, and the server picks out (trying to think of a better word for accoutrement) ... stuff to go along with it. Pineapple yuzu jam. Currant-hazlenut bread. I don't even know what else. It was amazing. The staff was perfect, willing to have fun and talk and joke around a little. This isn't a stodgy restaurant who stoops to your level. This is a restaurant that knows just how special its offerings are and is willing to laugh about it a little. The whole experience is human, memorable, and warm. I don't know if this is an LA thing, a fine dining thing, a Providence thing or just a thing in general, but there was a shit ton of iPhone action happening. I don't mean covert tweeting/email checking. I mean like, people were watching YouTube videos. I'm not a Slow Food person, I like to stay in touch, but for reals, can you put the digital leash down for a few hours? As I walked through the restaurant, checking out people paying $200 plus per head to dine, each of them illuminated by the blue-white glow of an iPhone screen, I was a little disappointed. I'd suggest eliminating phone use from the restaurant, but maybe that's not part of their MO at Providence. I suppose creativity doesn't set limits, and I'm down to accept that as part of the experience. And on that note, my experience at Providence was perhaps the single most surreal dining experience of my entire life. I truly loved it and I can't wait to go back, although I may wait for a while, to let memory soften the edges of my first time there. It is nice, and I am lucky, to have experienced such a delicious, decadent tour de force.

I took my bf this time for his birthday dinner because we've been wanting to come back again for the past 2 years.  It was quite a memorable experience and we both enjoyed the food on our last visit.   The prix fix menu changes every so often but there are some items that stay the same.  We ordered the 5 course menu plus two appetizers.   Unless you're a light eater, I would get 2 appetizers along with the 5 course to feel full and satisfied at the end.  Otherwise you might go home hungry.   Appetizer one: -Foie gras ravioli with truffle *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!   Second time ordering this dish.  Of all the other appetizer selections, the waiter even agreed that is their most popular appetizer. -Ugly Bunch *Only order if you love Uni.  Don't let the name fool you.  This is the most prettiest dish I've ever seen in my life!   Love the decor and presentation.   Bf is a big fan of Uni and he said this is by far the freshest and best Uni he has ever tried.   I loved the savory Panna Cotta underneath which complimented the overall dish very well.  Hmm, wish I knew the recipe for the Panna cotta! 5 COURSE:  (not in the right order) First they bring you a Chef's complimentary dish.   -Parsnip pork reduction soup * At first I wasn't sure what to expect when they said "pork reduction" but quickly fell in love with it after the first sip.  We both looked at each other with a surprised look.  Amazing.   Course 1 -Mojito and Screwdriver Gelee *I liked the screwdriver over the mojito.  He felt the opposite.  It was a great palette cleanser after sipping the soup. Course 2: -Gorgonzola cheese puff and Salmon skin chip in nori topped with trout and creme fraiche *I could skip on the puff because it just tasted very cheesy.  Nothing special in my opinion.   As for the salmon skin chip, I could just eat that all day.  It is something that can be topped with almost anything and will taste exciting no matter what.   Course 3: -Scallop with light curry and squash *The light curry sauce was one of my favorites.   Course 4: -Bass with red carrot and turnip puree, ginger and some edible leaf (?) *LOVED the turnip puree!!  How on earth did they make the texture and taste whipped up so perfectly?   After trying the red carrot and turnip puree, it has spoiled my taste for how vegetables are prepared.   Course 5: -Kanpachi with jelly *We had this one last time.  Very fresh and delicious! DESSERT -Chocolate cake with Vanilla ice cream Didn't enjoy this dessert at all.  I preferred the last dessert that had a combination of sweet and tartiness.  I just ate half of the chocolate cake and gave the rest to my bf to finish.  We both agreed that dessert was a disappointment.   They also brought us a medley of Grey earl infused caramel, vanilla macarons and Habanero ginger candies.  We both enjoyed the candies very much.  That habanero just sneaks up on you after about 2 seconds of chewing on it.  Awesome creation!  As for the grey earl caramel, it was very different and something I see myself eating it with coffee.  We are both not a huge fan of macarons.   Overall our meal was excellent minus the dessert.   The price came out to around $160 a person including tax and tip.   For special occasions, I would definitely come back here again.  Next stop...French Laundry!

Providence has two Michelin stars and we've wanted to try it for some time now. Great ambiance but odd service (one waiter oogled the prettiest guest at our table while the rest of us did handstands and sent up flares to get his attention, the other waiter was friendlier but we felt like he was trying to audition with us for a tv pilot...all night.) The quality of the food was obviously high but the tastes were surprisingly imbalanced. I expected a cozier Water Grill, but the entire experience was nowhere near the quality and the service level of the Water Grill. Our dishes were all a little heavy handed - overly fishy, overly salty, foamy or squishy. It's obviously a good restaurant, but in a city with a lot of great restaurants, I'm not clear on what merited the Michelin stars. Good but not great.

I went for my birthday back in Dec. and had the tasting menu.  I don't really recall what I ate.  I think the dessert was quite yummy.  Other than that, I can't say I was impressed by this 3 michelin star rated restaurant.  Not to say the food was bad as greatness was expected.  Overall, doesn't live up to the hype so save your money.

A group of friends and I did the 16 course tasting menu at the chef's table - no wine pairing.  We all had very high expectations, especially since we were all about to shell out about $250 on dinner alone.   Good thing I was accompanied by good company.... We sat at our table by 9pm and by 11:30, we couldn't wait to get the hell out of there.  The food, as special as everyone likes to think it is, was anything but.  It was fishy dish after fishy dish, each more fishy than the last.  The smell of smoked seaweed as decor on every plate was not appetizing, nor did it help that we were confined in a small enclosed glass room without any air.   Listen, I'm all for skill and appreciating the years of culinary mastering it takes to take perfectly good fish, poach it in tons of butter, slab some foam on it, and shave some truffles on top - but I'll take a Langer's #19 or Papa Cristo's Gyro any day.   By the 7th dish, everything started tasting the same - butter and foam.  So rich and heavy that we actually elected to skip the cheese course altogether.  We just couldn't handle the nausea any longer.  The only dish that really blew us out of the water was the egg with uni in it - fantastic. The bread was also exceptionally good - seaweed foccacia and bacon ciabatta. Everything else was simply, and unfortunately, forgettable. I don't believe this is a representation of the restaurant as whole, so I'm sure there is good reason why other people come here and throw their money away - at least I hope so.

Come to this two-Michelin star gem for a special occasion and go all out.  We did for our wedding anniversary, and we'll remember the experience for a long time. They even had special menus printed with our names at the top! The full nine-course tasting menu with wine pairing was amazing.  They're famous for their seafood--everything is seasonal, shipped in fresh from the east coast, west coast, Alaska or wherever.  The wait staff are friendly, outgoing and knowledgeable.   If you're going to do the nine-course tasting or 16-course chef's menus, you should get there early and be prepared for a leisurely dining experience. The scallops, kampachi and foie gras ravioli with truffles and parmesan foam were highlights, but everything was exquisite all the way to the cheese course and desert. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. We'll definitely be back to our new favorite LA restaurant!

One of my favorite restaurants in LA...yes, it's a tad pricey but the only one I would say worth every penny. Service here is amazing,...this is one of the few places I've been in LA where the food and service is both 5 stars, yet it is unpretentious. If you are looking for an exquisite meal for a special occasion, look no further...providence fits the bill to the T. The sommelier (Drew) is amazing...suggested a perfect wine for our meal. I love that he is pretty friendly and did listen to what we like and suggested a perfect wine within our budget. We started off with amuse bouche, a frozen mojito and a screwdriver capsule. I loved the screwdriver. It had a dense, thick consistency and had an amazing flavor! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Then came some amazing scallops with Japanese eggplant. I loved the presentations, every dish that came to our table looked exquisite. I wasn't wowed by the sea bass, it was good but nothing that made me jump with joy. The Japanese kanpachi was executed wonderfully,....loved every bite of it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The Salmon with pork belly was another outstanding dish...it melted in my mouth. I also loved the veal..it was perfectly cooked. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I ordered the 5 course tasting menu while my husband had the 9 course tasting menu. Between the 2, there was just the cheese course and the sea urchin dish in the 9 course meal dinner that wowed me.  The sea urchin with soft scrambled eggs was truly amazing...It's a small portion, but every bite was exquisite! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The cheese server (Holly) was really nice and although she was supposed to give us just 3 cheeses, she ended up giving us 5 ( I guess liked that I said I love raw milk cheese!)....Tried a black truffle cheese from Italy and some amazing cheese from France. I wish they included this in the 5 course menu, would gladly give up the sea bass course for the cheese. I loved that although this was part of my husband 9 course tasting menu, they got me a plate so we could share....super nice!! They even gave me an extra dessert to try along with his dessert course. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Overall, one of the best meals I've had in LA....the ambiance, the service and the exquisite food all made for a perfect night. I love Providence!

4.5 stars and 1050 reviews. Just by looking at that statistics, who wouldn't want to try Providence? I hesitated at first, but finally I was willing to spare the $ since I believed it would be worth it. The caviar appetizer presentation was top notch. They served 3 different kinds of bread: white, wheat, and sour dough. I am not a fan for sour dough, so I tried only white and wheat ones, but my friends enjoyed their sour dough. In addition, we ordered a foie gras ravioli to share since my research calls "the most common and delicious" After appetizer, our waiter showed us a box of two white truffles. It was my first time to see it in real life since I only saw it on tv. Exciting! Each of us ordered different things on the main entree menu. Providence is a sleek seafood restaurant so I believe they must have great seafood dishes. Only one friend of mine ordered steak, which turned out to melt in your mouth as well. Three other dishes were wild striped bass (long island), wild river king salmon, and wild john dory (new zealand). The fish fillet was soft and juicy. Overall, my dining experience was very pleasant even though the paid amount hurt a little bit, just a little bit since I am still a student living off my parent's money. After all, I do wish one day I would make lots of $$$, dine out, and try truffle. What they say: Truffle isn't exactly aphrodisiac but under certain circumstances it tends to make women more tender and men more likable.

A friend of mine offered to take me out to dinner, to thank me for hooking her up for a new job, which was a 60% pay increase. She said it was absolutely my choice, anywhere I'd like. I told her that I would pick somewhere really fancy and she had no objections. Therefore, my only choice was to return to Providence, 3yrs later. Our husbands were lucky ducks to join us on this dining experience, even though they didn't contribute whatsoever. =P Our reservation was a table for 4 at 6:30pm, on a Thursday night. Thank goodness we started at 6:30pm, cause I didn't think dinner was going to take 4hrs long. Yes, four hours! We opted for the 16-course chef's tasting menu ($175/pp). I figured, why not?! =D Our server said it would take a minimum of 3hrs, but we didn't really think it would take that long. Boy, were we wrong. But thankfully, we had great company, conversation and a fantastic server named Daniel. He definitely made the evening that much more enjoyable. BTW, his faint accent is German. ;) I'm not gonna go in detail with all 17 courses (plus an additional foie gras ravioli course cuz we loved it so much last time). Here's a list that Daniel kindly printed out for me (see photo of detailed list): Mojito & Screwdriver Amuse Bouche-excellent Kumamoto Oyster, Oysterplant & Naked Cowboy-I could eat a dozen Abalone and Squid & Chorizo-I could eat another dozen Uni Canape-best uni, hands down Kanpachi-same family as Hamachi but leaner Live Sea Scallop-cooked to perfection Arctic Char-excellent flavors Fish Face-Bass cheeks were delicious Unagi-good Ouef de Caille Cuit au Plat-delicious Foie Gras Ravioli-not as good as the first time around Australian Wagyu Beef-best piece of beef I've ever had Cheese Selection-Daniel picked out the best 5 according to our preferences Fennel, Yellow Chartreuse, Angelica Root, Yogurt-didn't care for the fennel Creme Fraiche, Sable Breton, Almond Financier, Chestnut Jam, Vanilla Mousse-good Whipped Ganache, Kaffir Lime Banana, Blueberry, Galangal, Wild Rice-didn't care for the wild rice Petit Fours-loved the macarons and box presentation Before our dessert courses, we asked Daniel if he could hook us up with another round of the mojito & screwdriver amuse bouche and he delivered! That was very generous of him. Overall, I was only disappointed with the desserts. That wasn't a dealbreaker for me. However, it was still a wonderful meal/experience. Even better because we didn't have to pay! =D My husband was especially happy because our anniversary was coming up so this was a pre-anniversary dinner for us. LOL I think we will order a la carte next time, cuz we want to enjoy more than 1-3 bites. What a teaser these tasting courses are!!

Can't really say any more than what has been said before. They make great food with great presentation, with a great(as in big) price to match. First the location is in a very nondescript area of Los Angeles. It's in a residential area, and there are houses right next to the restaurant. When I went, the house near the restaurant had a yardsale, and had just bunch of junk on the front yard! I thought it was pretty hilarious seeing the contrast but some might not like the unsavory surroundings. The maitre d was very gracious and pretentiousness is kept to a minimum. I just had jeans and a untucked button up shift. My girlfriend had on a long skirt with a shirt and a jean jacket. The waiters were dressed in a full suit and everyone was very attentive. We ended up having the 5 course market menu because didn't think we can eat 9 courses! Price between a 9 course and a 5 course isn't that much and I'd suggest opting for the 9 course. Just make sure you're hungry enough. The providence is primarily a seafood restaurant and it shows. Most of their dishes are seafood based and they're the best choices. Not to say they can't cook their meat, they can. One of the courses is a sous vide veal medallion, that was very good. My least favorite was probably the seabass and cranberry beans(?). Compared to the other dishes, the flavors just weren't there. The best was probably the kanpachi with the celebrity tomatoes. Tied with the salmon skin with salmon mousse dip. Man that thing was delicious. More than a few people complained about the bread, especially about it not being warm/freshly baked. That's a legitimate complaint, and I do enjoy a freshly baked, warm bread. The bread was tasty, but wasn't up to par with rest of the restaurant. But for being cold, it was pretty good. There is a lot of hype associated with Providence. As well there should be for any Michelin star rated restaurants. I'm not sure I can say it lives up to the hype, but I certainly wasn't let down, and didn't feel like the food was overpriced. Combined with the amazing service, presentation and the quality/taste of the food. The whole package is worth the price of admission. Oh and btw, if you choose to do the wine pairing, be warned that they are GENEROUS with the wines. You get a wine with every course, and they fill it 1/3 of the glass every time. So imagine that for a 9 course meal! The 5 course meal took about 1.5hrs, we weren't chowing them down, but weren't exactly taking the uber lesiurely route either. I'd expect a 9 course meal to take about 3 hrs. It's an experience, and should definitely give it a go if you can.

Extremely disappointed. I've been wanting to go to Providence for almost a year and I left feeling empty handed. First off, the service was AMAZING . .  I want to give this place more than a 2 star because the service was incredible . . but unfortunately that doesn't make the food taste better. I ordered the Kampachi to start and what was really unfortunate was the bloodline was in a few of the cuts which made it unappealing but I ate it anyways. My sister ordered the King crab which was TERRIBLE . . it tasted water'd down and it's served with orange slices which is such a bizarre paring to me. Brother-in-law had the raw scallop which was decent. Next dishes were the claim chowder which wasn't that great, I had the scallop,prawn,uni dish with a kind of udon broth which was underwhelming but the Fois Gras Ravioli was DELICIOUS. Our main courses were the John Dory which was beautifully plated and tasted fine. Brother-in-law got the Wagyu steak ($180.00) and sister had the New York ($51) and honestly . . The New York was way better . . I have no problem paying for good food but this place is disappointing . . maybe they had an off night. Anyways, all those dishes + 7 drinks = $750.00 . . . .a little too much for something subpar . . sorry Providence . . I wanted to love you so bad . . .

I guess I should be labeled a Boston food snob because I don't tend to think of LA for high-end food.  Yeah, I've  had an extraordinary meal at Matsuhisa, but in general, I don't think of LA along the same lines as (say) NYC, SF, or even Boston.  Think again.  Michael Cimarusi is pushing the envelope every step of the way.  I had the 14 course Omakase with wine pairings and it was, in a word, extraordinary.  "This is not your father's fish restaurant." Since Yelp won't allow me to actually post the link to my full review with pictures (they say it is promotional and/or commercial), all I can do is tell you to go to the web site in my profile for more details.

I'm a little disappointed in Providence.  I recently came here with my friend Mike.  He treated me to dinner here for my birthday.   We were able to make same day reservations for dinner.  Thanks to yelp quick tips, we were able to find plenty of street parking on Cole Avenue. Once we arrived we were promptly seated.  Our waiter pulled my seat out for me, and placed a napkin on my lap.  LOL.  Then he told us what the specials for the night were. He left... for a brief moment and came back to our table with a wooden box.  Silly me, I thought there was chocolate in there.  Or hand towels for us to wash our hands with.  It was TRUFFLES!  He handed them over to us to smell. Our original intent was to try the 5 course tasting menu at Providence.  But when we go there, I wasn't too impressed with what they were offering.  If you want to know what they'll be serving on the tasting menu, you can view their menu online.   http://www.providencela.… Scroll down to "Providence Market Menu"  and the ones with the asterisks are what they'll have for the 5 course tasting menu.   The Full Course tasting menu are all the items under "Providence Market Menu". So, I ordered "chowda" and wild striped bass instead. The chowda came with bacon and clams in a super creamy clam broth.  The broth was thin.  And .. it tasted like as if it were just regular lowfat cream you buy from the store.  I didn't really like the clam chowder here.  I like the clam chowder from Water Grill in DTLA more. Next was the wild striped bass. The fish came half cooked half raw.  I asked the waiter if this was how it was supposed to be, and he said it was.  The bass came on top of a squash confit, with bacon.  The bass was a bland.  I didn't finish the whole thing... so I gave mine to Mike to finish. I've had better fish at at many other restaurants. The dessert we had was a little too sweet.. but it was good!  It was a Mango Panna Cotta. I am disappointed in the food that was served at Providence.  But, I am impressed by the service.   Thanks Mike!

While at work, my friend and I were talking about how we should go try some restaurants in which the executive chef there has been featured as a contender on Top Chef. We ended up talking about Michael Cimarusti. I've been hesitant to come try Providence for a while because one of my friend had insisted that Spago's food was better and so was it's presentation. I didn't like my Spago experiences, so I thought there would be no way for Providence to live up to my high expectations for a two star michelin restaurant. Boy, was I wrong. Maybe it was because I had dinner with the right company this time, thank you Regina for coming out with me that day after work, but my dinner at Providence was the best dining experience I've had in the Los Angeles region. It might even be my favorite restaurant in LA now, now that Ortolan and Bastide have closed down. Chef Michael Cimarusti's menu is just fantastic. My only regret of the night was being misinformed by Yelp reviewers, and settling for the 9 course tasting menu rather than the 16 course chef tasting menu. Sigh, thinking about the wonderful dishes I missed out on makes me sad. Oh wells, looks like it means I'll have to make sure I come back here in the near future! There's a misunderstanding that I do not like fusion restaurants. That's not the case. I do not like chefs that try too hard to make their dishes unique or stand out just to be weird and kooky. The ingredients and way of cooking must enhance the dish. And that's what Providence does successfully with every dish. I'm not going to go into detail with the dishes that are on the tasting menu (you can check out the pics though) because after over 1000 great reviews from fellow yelpers, you can find out about that on anyone else's post. I just want to give my compliments to the chef for doing a great job combining an oriental taste to American seafood. The seafood kept it's clean and fresh taste that I expect and enjoy from my seafood, yet whatever sauce or side that complimented the dish contrasted the dish well. The amuse bouche here are creatively presented. It reminded me of tapa dishes that are created by Chef Jose Andres. The service here wasn't swanky at all, and that's what I liked about this place. I'm surprised to read about how people received attitude from their servers. The server I had was friendly and we were able to engage in a few conversations about the culinary arts and what the dishes and courses were about. The cocktails here are delicious but seemed a bit weak to me. The interior design of the restaurant was very intimate. I liked how they turned on the heater to just the right temperature, making it a very cozy dinner. Providence does a great job combining a bunch of great little things from various restaurants around the neighborhood but making it its own.

Atmosphere and service were great. Food was unique at times, but nowhere near the price. Have had more unique and better quality food for less. Try Coi in San Francisco if you want to spend a lot of money and feel like it was worth it.

For $85 a person, you get a pre-starter, appetizer, main entree, dessert.  You can go fancier and get a 9 course tasting thing but you should literally starve yourself the whole day.  This isn't for the dining novice, your vegan girlfriend or vegan self, and your friends that like chain restaurants like Cheesecake Factory.  You have to come here simply with an open mind to taste all the wonderful flavors.  This isn't your average Ralph's fresh produce.  This is literally organic straight from the source quality ingredients, probably even having profiles of the chickens or cows from their farmers (do you know what show I'm referencing?).  Just because it's such a high rated place, doesn't really mean it's the best in the world.  I'll put it this way: the beginning was good, the middle was meh, the desserts were ummm, well, um.... yeah.  Not great.

We had the Market Special tasting menu - excellent choice. Cooking was well-executed and service extremely friendly and impeccable. An enjoyable experience! The only slight downer - we were sat in the funny annex that is next to the main dining room - they did quite a good job with disguising what is essentially a road-side shack, but it was slightly disconcerting hearing cars zoom by on the freeway just next to the wall every so often!

Came here with my boyfriend for our Anniversary and it was an absolute treat! This place is elegant, the food is amazing and the service is excellent. We had the tasting menu (I forgot how many courses) & had it with wine pairings. Yes, this place is expensive but who cares? DO IT! You won't regret it.

Providence is my favorite restaurant in LA for their fusion tasting menu.. If you're coming to this restaurant, make sure you plan to be there for at least 3 hours if you do their tasting menu.. Chef Michael Cimarusti brought the magic that he executed at Water Grill and punched it up a few notches.. His choice of seafood which he fuses with ingredients  with Asian influences sync in harmony.. The Mojito, Greyhound, and gin and tonic trio which are placed in spoons is an amazing start to the meal.. The last time I was there, this was unavailable but definitely a different consistency if you've never tried it.. And you'll know what I mean when you do.. The cheese cart has a really good selection of various types of cheeses and the wine selection to accompany the meal is exquisite.. The portions are small but the full tasting menu is very filling.. I really enjoyed the Kanpachi (Amberjack) dish as well as the Uni (Sea Urchin) with caviar..  The desserts are really amazing as well.. We have come here for their dessert tasting menu to cap off the night with some champagne as well.. Always seem to compare any prix fixe dinner I have to the one here at Providence... Not many stack up...

Providence.  2 Michelin Star restaurant. 4.5 stars on Yelp. Glowing reviews by  Yelp friends and people I follow on Yelp.  Even Mendostyles saved his Providence review to be his 700th.   With all these glowing reviews, my expectation for fantastic food was really HIGH!   There are only two restaurants whose food I LOVED and they aren't in the USA.  One is Ristorante La Scala (http://www.lascala.ch/) in Rapperswil, Switzerland.  The 2nd is The Quatre Saisons in The Hotel Cailler (http://www.hotel-cailler…)  in Gruyere, Switzerland.  Just like the girl you've loved and lost, where you always think about her, those two places I fondly remember for their gastronomic excellence.  These two places were the benchmark for Providence. After dining here, I felt like Daedalous after he flew too close to the sun.  Crash and burn...well not exactly, but not exactly the best gastronomic experience I've ever had. I came here to celebrate the Yelper I Hate the Most, Emily S, big 3-0.  I asked where she wanted to eat and she picked Providence.  Damn, she's loves to be pampered on my dime O.o.  I bet my birthday is going to be take out Chinese food that she bought using a Groupon.  O.O With all the glowing reviews, I agreed to dine here because I expected it to be AWESOME!  So you're wondering how did it drop from being awesome to just getting 3 stars?  Let me explain. Dining Companion: 5 Stars. I have to give 5 stars to Emily S. She does make dining a fun experience.  She can carry a conversation, make me laugh, be politically incorrect in a funny way, and make an evening that much more enjoyable.  Cheers to her and HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Service: This place had amazing service that you would expect from a 2 Michelin Star restaurant.  Waiters were polite, speedy, and attentive.  Emily S. is a camel when it comes to beverages and the waiter kept filling up her  glass.  She went to the bathroom several times to be amused by the fact that the wait staff had neatly folded her napkin. Immature minds are easily amused =) Ingredients: Again 5 stars.  Organic, imported, exotic...all the adjectives when it comes to ingredients you have at Providence.  Some ingredients we didn't know so we had to Google them to get an explanation.  But in the end, you know what you're consuming is good stuff. Ambiance: 4 stars.  First question. Why is this restaurant not in the nice area of town?  2nd question: what's up with the funky clamshell inspired decor on the walls? Other than those questions everything else was spectacular.  Premium cutlery, expensive napkins, and they even have cloth towels instead of paper towels in the bathroom!  Good stuff! Food presentation: 5 Stars. Like art?  Well just look at your food. Flavor: 3 stars: This is where it gets tricky.  Maybe it's the stuff we ordered b/c I was not wow'd.  90% of my grading is based on the flavor of the food.  Will this food make me go YUM and crave it forever more?  Unfortunately, what I ate that night was not up to that level.  I ordered the Spahgetti alla Chittara ($26) and the Prime New York Steak (medium rare @ $51) and Emily ordered the Chowda ($15) and the Wild Striped Bass ($48).  For dessert we shared the Cuatro Leches Panna Cotta ($12). Let me just say that Emily didn't finish her entree.  The Wild Striped Bass came with a Tahitian squash confit which was overly salty.  She didn't want to finish it, but at $48 I was not going to let a single drop be left uneaten!  The fish was bland and flavorless.  She only ate half of it and like you expect from a place like this the serving size was small.  So again, I played reliever and ate that too.   My spaghetti was tasty especially with the sword squid and and maine lobster.  I felt that the sauce was doused with too much olive oil and made it feel a little greasy.  The pasta itself felt freshly made and al dente.  I was comparing this dish to Ristorante La Scala where I had an egg pasta with white sauce.  That was delicious and I'm craving it as I type. The steak was okay too.  The steak itself was PREMIUM based on the marbling.  Specks of fat in the meat and cut and cooked well.  However, it wasn't the tastiest piece of beef I've had.  Presented fantastically though.  The emulsion of bone marrow and dijon mustard was overwhelming to tell you the truth.  I tasted more mustard than bone marrow.  The confit potatoes and the cipollini onions were fantastic.  I love potatoes and onions! For dessert the Cuatro Leches Panna Cotta was good.  Maybe it's by design, but I felt that the passion fruit sorbet and mango puree were a little overwhelming for my tastebuds.  The banana and the panna cotta themselves were good. So on Robot Mikey's craving this food scale, would I crave the stuff I ordered last night again?  Not really.  However, like everything in life I have to try things twice.  So on my next visit here, I'll try out the 9 course tasting menu with wine.  Maybe that'll excite my taste buds.

I had wanted to try this place for years so when a special occasion came up, I jumped at the opportunity. We were greeted by a petite Asian hostess who immediately made us feel at home. The GM, a dashingly handsome and charming Italian gentleman, also greeted us warmly and checked with us more than once during the meal. We were seated away from the main dining room, in a slightly claustrophobic room with 6 or so tables. We ordered the 5 course tasting menu ($95) and the Birthday boy had the 7 course full tasting menu ($125). Corkage was $30. The Seared Foie Gras with poached peach was OUTSTANDING, but not part of the tasting menu.  The only item that really stood out in both the tasting menu was the Santa Barbara Sea Urchin hiding behind soft scrambled eggs. It was a tiny portion, but every bite was exquisite! The Sea Scallops, Japanese Kanpachi, and the Wild Alaskan Halibut were well executed but quite forgettable.  Most disappointing was the dessert, which was Pear and Cranberries with Almond Cake and Burrata Icecream.   The star of the evening was their cheese cart, on which were displayed a stunning array of artisan cheeses, (unfortunately) mostly imports. Our favorite was an alpine beauty called Challerhocker.  The cheese server could have been friendlier and more informative.  Wish they had a real cheesemonger behind the cart! In conclusion, I would rather do Hatfield's 7 course chef's tasting menu ($98) but will return for their Sea Urchin appetizer and Seared Foie Gras before the ridiculous ban takes place.

Providence has been on my list of restaurants to try for awhile and seeing as how they had a deal for their 7th anniversary, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to check it off my list. I had a weekend reservation at 7 PM and was seating immediately upon my arrival. Service was impeccable and either the waiter or the server made sure to explain every dish. We had the 5 course tasting menu with cocktails, which they made very strong. The wine list was also very extensive and impressive. Bread service consisted of bacon brioche, seaweed focaccia, and some olive roll with my favorite being the brioche. For our amuse bouche, we got the mojito gelee and screwdriver spherification as well as the sunchoke port reduction, a gougere, and either trout or salmon mousse with crispy salmon skin. The mousse was amazing and I ate the rest with my leftover bread. The main courses we got were the kanpanchi, scallop, foie gras ravioli, and the veal with a chocolate cake as dessert. I did not think the ravioli was as good as everyone made it out to be on Yelp, as I felt the taste of foie was not very apparent and wished it was the black sea bass that was originally supposed to be on the tasting menu seeing as how Michael Cimarusti's strengths lie in seafood. I'm not a fan of chocolate so I can't really judge on the chocolate cake. However, I was disappointed that the macaron in the petit fours was also chocolate and basically reminiscint of the cake. I was impressed with the thai basil toffee on the other hand. All in all, it was a great, filling meal and definitely deserving of its two stars. I wasn't really blown away by anything but Providence provides solid cooking with exceptional service. Hopefully, I can come back someday and try the full tasting menu or the chef's menu.

We finally made it to Providence and they didn't disappoint! To start cocktails at the bar, manhattan's, glad to see the use of Antica vermouth.  Then on to dinner, very warm welcoming restaurant, not to go   on about every dish but the food speaks for it's self, fresh seasonal ingredients prepared to perfection. The highlight of the dinner was the roasted turbot, be of the most memorable dishes I've had Ina very long time! Without a doubt we will be back...

First of all, the place is pricey.  Expect to burn a few hundred, depending on your party size.  Now with that said, the food is AMAZING!  I would definitely recommend the 5- or 7- course tasting menu.  Which is about $105, $135.  They serve you the right amount, so when you leave; you won't be bloated, but you'll be full.  Great decor, the desert was delicious, and I would totally recommend the wine tasting with it.  ($50 more), however it was worth it, as each wine and course is explained to you by the chef or server.  Overall, 5 Stars for delicious foods, great service, and the magnificent decor.

Flawed compared to my prior visit - one of the 10 best meals of my life - but still putting out exemplary seafood at a relatively great (albeit expensive) price. Highlight dishes as below, the rest with pictures in context in the blog: "Uni in a farm fresh egg, Santa Barbara Sea Urchin, Herbes Fines, Brioche"  - every bit as luxurious as its ingredients would indicate and finished with champagne beurre blanc and American caviar we were instructed to spoon deep in order to experience all the layers together and doing as we were told I can now say that of all the cut egg dishes I've experienced - from L'Arpege and Manresa to The French Laundry and Le Bernardin - Providence's remains my favorite if for no other reason than the beurre blanc/uni/yolk amalgram; a taste too decadent to describe and perfectly offset by the brine of the caviar. "Rougie foie gras glazed with white wine and served with candied walnuts, roasted grapes, port gelee, and hearts of palm plus a side dish of grilled brioche" - Dense and well made with the liver's characteristic sapor nicely balanced by the sweetened wine glaze I particularly liked the rustic aspects of this preparation with the yellow rim of fat still attached and although the accoutrements were relatively standard the flavors were all on point with the grapes particularly wowing and the brioche every bit on par with the rest of the restaurant's top notch breads. "Black sea bass, matsutake, rosemary" - a flawless slice of the tender and flaky fish with impressively crisp skin was its focal point but the dish was much more on closer inspection as the matsutakes revealed themselves in four forms; butter poached, shaved raw, dissolved into clarified butter, and finally as an effervescent foam.  While a fan of Sea Bass in general and having admittedly been wowed by it at ink only two days prior I personally felt that this was one of the two best courses of the evening and even now it is a dish whose exemplary taste brings back fond memories of what high quality fish in the hands of a skilled chef can and should taste like. "Unagi, celery root puree, bone marrow, smoked sesame."  Starting first with the eel - fatty, slightly briny, and just a bit sweet even without the all-too-common BBQ treatment - this was without a doubt the finest quality unagi I have ever tasted and obviously knowing the quality of the fish the kitchen opted to pair it with a number of complimentary ingredients that not only helped to enhance the fish, but also that shined on their own - particularly the smoked sesame foam which served a stark contrast to the hefty marrow and slightly bitter celery root puree. "Liberty Farms duck, cauliflower, braised rhubarb, Brussels sprouts."  With the breast expectedly tasty and succulent while each accoutrement was equally well prepared and drizzled with foie gras gastrique as an added bonus what really put this dish over the top was a tiny sphere, approximately the size of a golf ball, deep fried and stuffed with duck confit - a particularly nice flavor when matched with the unctuous sprouts. "Miso Cheesecake, sesame, plum, blueberries" would prove to be another surprisingly light dessert as the cheesecake itself was nearly as smooth as a pana cotta but with just enough grit and savoriness to make you aware that it was not.  Complementing the cheesecake with the fruits noted above in the form of a blueberry gelee atop the cake and macerated blueberries strewn alongside with the juices trailing behind plus tart plum sorbet the flavors were all brought to a sharp point through the use of black sesame sauce and a soil of ground white and black sesame seeds.  An intense dessert with both sweet and savory served up in balance this was precisely the sort of dessert I expected from Vasquez.

Definitely 5 stars for a 5 star restaurant.  I enjoyed my first experience here, and there is absolutely no doubt that the food will have me coming back a second, third and fourth time.  3 words -- Chef's Tasting Menu.  Don't think about it, just do it.  Yeah, I get that 14 courses sounds like coma toast waiting to happen, but I ensure you that you will finish each and every one of them because the portions are small... Like 3 bites or less, small.  I totally got a kick out of the bread guy, I swear he asked me if I wanted more bread like 15 times, but that just goes to show what great service they provide.   Really worth the $1150 for 4 ppl including tax tip and cocktails!

He that takes truth for his guide, and duty for his end, may safely trust to God's providence to lead him aright -- Blaise Pascal An unexamined life is not worth living. -- Socrates And so it is on a Saturday night, that I took a close and special friend out for her birthday to Providence...one of only 4 LA restaurants to receive 2 Michelin Stars during the 2009 Michelin Guide update.  With almost 1000 Yelp reviews, once again no one is anxiously awaiting my take on this highly rated restaurant :)  But this was a special night beyond just a birthday...both of us starting journeys with destinations uncertain...a time to ruminate over the past, discuss the future...hopes, dreams...regrets...fears...these are the kinds of talks that a serious meal should initiate...and in this hurried, rushed world too many people avoid.       We were seated in the main dining room with a soaring ceiling (as opposed to the claustrophobic smaller rooms that Julie L. mentioned).  The decor of the restaurant is lovely...a subtle nautical theme....with barnacles on the walls...seaweed like decor around the table lights.  Theatrical, artsy, interesting...but also restrained...the decor did not draw attention to itself.  The ceramic barnacles were the coolest part....there might have been one missing at the end of the night from the ladies bathroom but that was just an unsubstantiated rumor ;)   We started with an amuse bouche that generated laughs only because I kept threatening to call it A MUSAY BOO SHAY :)  (Okay, so we were not completely serious during this evening) But I kept the Beverly Hillbillies act to myself (to my friend's relief) :)  The highlight of the attractive box of goodies was definitely the chilled tomato consume...very refreshing and almost summery.  The tarts included were quite interesting too... The wine list was interesting, a lot of local selections, and fairly priced.  I ordered a half bottle of Fiddlehead Cellars Happy Canyon Sauvignon Blanc for my friend; and a half bottle of a nice Bergstrom Cumberland Reserve Pinot for me.  Both went exceptionally well with our meals. Bread was provided throughout the meal with the standout by far to be the Bacon Brioche.  Mmmm...Bacon. We did not do the tasting menu as the reviews were inconsistent...we ordered off the a la carte menu.  Oysters, Wild Crab Dungennes, and Wild River King Salmon for Birthday Girl...the Hokkaido Scallops Sashimi (from Japan off of Market Menu), the chowda, and also off of the Market Menu, Australian Wagyu Beef...4 oz.  For our Foie Gras fix, we split a plate of the Foie Gras Ravioli. Oysters were outstanding...almost like fresh fish they were so good.  I tried one and it was the best oyster I ever had.  Birthday Girl loved her crab pasta...I thought my scallops were heavenly...definitely tasted just out of the fish market and sauce was complementary and subtle.  Chowda had a nice smoky broth but went the other direction as the scallops, the bacon flavor was too overpowering even while eating the clams.   On the other side of the spectrum, the shared ravioli may have been the second favorite dish after the oysters...cooked just perfectly with large chunks of black truffles, it was an earthy and smoky revelation.   Entrees did not hit this level...The Wagyu beef was mouth watering tender but the sauce and accompaniments were disappointing.  The bone marrow Bearnaise was too salty...the potatoes and vegetables provided were also too skimpy although the asparagus tasted just picked fresh.  The beef dish should have been fit for a king...instead it was more like it was made for an out of favor Prince (although the glass of Rioja I paired it with was an absolute delight.  Balanced, soulful...I wish I had ordered a full bottle of it)  Finally,  the salmon was a complete failure...just flavorless, didn't seem like an effort was made here. Dessert was presented with a candle for the birthday girl...chocolate raspberry ganache with ginger fire roasted meringue and a graham cracker ice cream.   This was an inventive, & fun way to end the evening...the ganache was shaped like an overly long kit kat bar; the meringue tasted almost like a smore...ice cream was refreshing and flavorful.  With the check was an added bonus of chocolate marshmallows (disappointing), macaroons (outstanding), and a jellied candy. Service, like the food had its moments but also a few misfires.  The busser made no mention of the half eaten salmon nor did our server ever ask us how we enjoyed our dinner. There is free parking on street so Valet, while the cost is reasonable, is probably unnecessary.   In the end...we both agreed it was a solid four stars.  Not perfect...not two star Michelin quality...but not a disappointment either.  The wine...the oysters...the ravioli...the scallops sashimi...the bacon brioche...the dessert...all of it...along with the deep conversation will be  remembered long after the misfires are forgotten.

Had the 14 course chef's tasting.... talk about inventive dishes! Too bad I didn't know about this place when I lived in L.A. This spot is a good choice for a date or special occasion because the food (and the presentation) are exceptional. Great wine list too. The food was really good but we (unfortunately) had to call it quits when it got to the dessert courses (there were 4) because we couldn't fit anymore food in.

Providence has always been my go to place for fine dining.  I've always respected Chef Cimarusti with his accomplishments and accolades.  Every year he brings something new to the table and gives the diners that wow factor.   I've been here several times since they've opened almost 7 years ago this coming June.   For my birthday, I decided to have a special celebration at Providence, I contacted them for a special degustation menu.  They obliged and made sure I did not eat that day. No menu were given.  A special 22 course custom menu was served which took 5.5 hours to complete.  Thank God my reservation was at 6:30pm. LOL I did this dinner exactly a month ago tomorrow.  $325/pp.  No wine pairing.  It's something you'll never forget.

Birthdays are a big deal to me and the hubster, so know that I am not exaggerating when I say THIS IS THE BEST DINNER WE'VE EVER HAD IN THE U.S. We've compared it to some of the monumental dinners we've had around the world, like the turn of the century duplex converted into a gourmet restaurant in Barcelona; and the first time we tasted Kobe beef in a tiny izakaya in Kyoto. This might have topped them all . . . and especially memorable because it was my birthday and we were home. You've seen the reviews on Yelp so you know this can't be a fluke. The thing I can add to the raves is this: If you LOVE food, then why not go to a place that loves serving fantastic food with impeccable service? Yes, expensive doesn't even begin to describe it (though we've had more expensive at said Barcelona gem) but it is WELL WORTH IT. You will feel treasured and you will be fed possibly the best meal of your life. To get it, you simply must experience it. That's it.

Part 5 of a Series: The PMD Chronicles (How I Fell in Love with a Murderer) Men of America, take note: the way to a woman's heart is indeed through her stomach. Well, perhaps just mine, because other ladies I know would rather you pepper them with liberal compliments or diamonds. They are, after all, a girl's best friends. Me, I'd rather you surprise me with a tin of caviar instead of some jewelry. You can only eat one type of baguette, and it's not the 3.5 karat kind. Luckily for me (though perhaps not my waistline), my darling knows just what gets my motor purring, and he made a reservation for the two of us on a recent Sunday evening at the eatery Providence in Los Angeles. After a few minutes of conferring, we agreed on the nine course tasting menu sans wine pairing (125$/pp). I started with the Slow Burn, a superb tequila based cocktail infused with jalapeno. It was potent but stoked my appetite. From the bread basket, I opted for the whole wheat nori slice, while my date went for the bacon brioche. He dispatched his within moments, grunting happily. What a blood mouth. The march of amuse started - a playful screwdriver suspended in a sphere and a mojito cube, served beside one another on spoons, followed by a cracker basket which included the most luxurious salmon skin, crisped and redolent with the fish flavor. Fantastic! The Santa Barbara sea urchin hidden beneath soft scrambled eggs served in an egg shell was superlative. If I could be drowned in something, it would be this, not a poorly thought out midnight swim in the Pacific. (Take note, murderer!) Each course was timed expertly, prepared precisely and plated as lovely as artwork. This is exactly what it was: edible art. Yet, somehow, between the halibut and the salmon courses, I felt the alcohol working its soporific effect on my body, a dastardly combination with jetlag. Do you see where this is going? Yes, dear reader: I fell asleep during a nine course tasting menu at a two Michelin starred restaurant. OK, perhaps "asleep" is an exaggeration; I only nodded off. Repeatedly. I might have sleep eaten the veal course, dumping most of it unceremoniously onto my date's plate because I was stuffed. Whenever I opened my eyes, I saw other diners grinning at my drowsy face. Whatever, you jerks! I was on vacation! You are all celebrating birthdays! (No, seriously: it seemed that everyone dining here, with the exception of me and my date, had a birthday candle plunked into their dessert plate. Is there something I need to know about Providence being the birthday destination restaurant? Doesn't anyone go to Friendly's anymore? Don't you have Carvel cakes and Fudgie the Whale out in California? Stop laughing at me!) I managed to perk up during the cheese course when a server trundled out a laughably enormous wooden cart topped with an array of cheeses. "I suggest three or four," he said. "Give me your stinkiest cheese," I mumbled, and he laughed, swiping through a curd with a spoon. It looked like a custard and smelled like feet. Yes: it was delicious. We also went with a Comte, a blue, and a truffled cheese. "Most people shy away from the smellier ones," the server said, gently slivering our selections onto a plate. "You cut that cheese," my date intoned. "If I had a nickel for everything I heard that..." The server laughed and wheeled the cart away. If this were a cartoon, there would be stink lines emanating from everything. I felt like the poor cat with an accidental white paint stripe being pursued by Pepe Le Pew. "This is the best meal one could have after getting out of prison," my date sighed loudly. "The parole board was kind to you," I agreed, patting his arm. I devoured my entire dessert plate - a burrata ice cream beside an almond cake that supplied a much needed spike of sugar to my blood stream. Normally, I don't like sweets, but this was savory enough to pique my interest. The mignardises were three charming bites of fruit flavored macaron, gelee and marshmallow. Excellent: more sugar to keep me awake during the car ride back to Los Feliz. As we sat there, savoring each flavor and sipping coffee, the party that had been seated beside us got up to leave. One of the women stopped in front of my date and said, "Congratulations on your parole!" before exiting. He and I just stared at each other before erupting into laughter. Total damage: 125$ per person for nine course tasting menu, 34$ for two glasses of Gruner Veltliner, and 15$ for the Slow Burn cocktail so you are at about 325$ before tip. Try not to fall asleep during your dinner. Dear Providence, may I suggest a new motto for your restaurant? "Providence: Where You Go to Celebrate Birthdays and Paroles" has a nice ring to it, no? It's got to be better than "Providence: Providing Somnambulists Sustenance." Hey, sleep eaters need a good meal too.

If you are looking for a special dining experience and want seafood, eat here.  Dining is by a choice of prix fixe menus.  Though they say it is the same amount of food when choosing amongst the options, I find the Chef's Tasting Menu too much food for a normal person to consume.  We generally choose the 3 course or the Market Menu.  Save room for the cheese cart as they have a fantastic selection.  One of the best restaurants in LA.

What an experience! We came here for a gf's bday and were pleasantly surprised that it was much less pretentious than we imagined, in comparison to Bazaar by Jose Andres, where you were lead to a different room for dessert. The restaurant is small and intimate, tucked away in an unassuming part of LA. Food: The pace of the meal was timed perfectly - they let us rest a bit between each course to let the flavors sink in. Amuse Bouche: *Mojito Gelee - I think I overhyped this one in my mind, but it seemed to me just like a snowcone-esque square, nothing too over the top. *Screwdriver sphere - taste like alcohol and orange juice concentrate, though the texture from the molecular gastronomy-ness kicked it up a notch **Salmon skin crisp with salmon mousse - ahh soo delicious! The salmon skin was dehydrated to a crispy and paired perfectly with the creamy mousse * Sunchoke Soup - had a straw but felt awkward sipping soup through it. The soup itself was a very umami experience, delicous and well-balanced. **Kanpachi - almost made me cry tears of happiness. The sweetness of the fish, the subtle saltiness of the cream with the crispy flecks floating on top. It hit ALL the right flavor notes and made your tongue dance! I still dream about it. **Uni Egg - Uni is characteristically an acquired taste because the strong ocean aroma is too much for some people. This dish was like a mild umami of the sea. So delicate and tasty... gone so soon. Even the bday girl who disliked uni gave it a thumbs up! **Scallops - They do it right! Perfectly cooked (as scallops are very easily over cooked) atop a delicious sauce **Salmon - wasn't crazy for this dish (the vegetables on the side were pickled, which I personally don't have a taste for). Although the detail in every component put into the dish can be noted and duly appreciated. **Wild black Sea Bass - The fish was cooked perfectly, flaky and buttery. I'm a sucker for mushrooms and the sauce that the morel mushrooms were cooked in enhanced its earthiness and balanced out the fish. **Veal with Trumpet mushroom - Interestingly enough, I wasn't wowed by their preparation of the veal itself (I enjoyed the veal at Studio more because it was more flavorful) but the side pairings on the plate made the dish. I liked the crunchiness of the dehydrated mushrooms on the side - my bouche was amused :) At this point, I was stufffed so I welcomed the cheese platter, just so I can have some room to breathe and digest the awesomeness that just entered my tummy! We let the server pick the cheese. They were all delicious (except one with a creamy orange rind that was wayy to pungent for my taste). **Jicama, raspberry, lemongrass, perilla - Light and refreshing! **Chocolate ganache - amaaazingly velvety chocolate, with dehydrated strawberries (reminiscent of special k) and a minty scoop of ice cream. I would've enjoyed it much more if I weren't so full! Petit Fours - Some rasbery jelly, caramel, and pistachio macarons. Loved the macaron but the others were mediocre. I was a little disappointed that we didn't get oysters, but that's what happens in a Chef's tasting menu! A top-notch culinary experience to say the least! Damage: Four 9-course tastings, 2 cocktails, 1 glass of red wine, 1 glass of prosecco = $630 sans tip. A very memorable night!  (my wallet says so too!)

As the 5-star rating suggests, this place is about as good as it gets.  I won't deny, I've been to Providence probably  6 times at this point and I've even had the chef's 16 course tasting menu in the past.  A word to the wise, the two times I've gone that Chef Cimarusti wasn't there was a little disappointing.  Still good mind you, but not great like it is when the Chef himself is there.   On this go 'round we had the five-course tasting menu and I opted to add a couple of foie gras dishes which I split with a friend.  But I'll get to those details later.  Be sure to get their bread, I like 'em all but the bacon popover is great as is the seafood one.  The food is the main star, so course by course, here we go: Amuse Bouche(s) 1) Frozen Mojito - Tasty but not extraordinary.  The fact that is was frozen didn't add anything. 2) Screwdriver - Pretty cool.  It has this gelatinous shell around the "shot" so the flavor explodes in your mouth. 3) Salmon(?) Cracker -  this was excellent.  Light yet still flavor full. 4) Cheese Puff - Like a really high-end puffy and soft Cheez-it.  I love Cheez-its so I loved it. Main Course 1) Kanpachi - this is similar to Hamachi but leaner.  The sauces it came with were fantastic. 2) Sea Scallop - This was cooked perfectly and came with a nice sauce 3) Veal Medallion -  The veal was cooked to perfection, however, I found the crunch nature of the dehydrated mushrooms that accompanied it distracting. 4) Foie Gras -  A friend of mine and split the terrine and the saute versions of foie gras.  It'll be illegal soon so we gotta get our fixes in now.  The terrine is a cold mousse served with gelee and frozen grapes and some fruit I did not recognize. All of the accompaniments were perfect accessories to the terrine.  The sauteed foie gras was good by itself and the bread it came with was good. Deserts 1) Some kind of chocolate pudding and coconut ice cream -  the coconut ice cream was flavorful but this desert really didn't work.  Plus it looked gross.  I would love to see what some celebrity judges would say about this desert.  Definitely a fail! 2) Petit fours - Creamy macaroons, spicy banana and salted caramels and a lychee gelee.  All were excellent.  I really loved the macaroons and I ate everyone's caramels so obviously I thought they were good as well. Really a top notch meal barring the two small errors mentioned above.  And we partied with Robert California himself, James Spader, who sat at the table next to us.  OK, we didn't party with him. We just watched to see what he ordered but it was hard to tell since he basically had two or more staff people surrounding him at all times. This normally isn't a place for star-sightings but it's always a place for great food.  It is not cheap by any stretch as my five-course meal with foie gras added and a bottle of pellgrino came to $175 including the tax and tip.  So be prepared to spend!  Don't worry, though, it's worth it.

I only had one night in LA to make to make the most of my company's per diem.  Of course I called my friend Melissa W and asked for her top 5 places to eat in LA.  I believe this was number 1 on her list.  I've been really curious about Providence for a while and by magic (or the fact hat it was a Tuesday) they had an open reservation for 5 people.  When we arrived (a bit early) we were immediately seated and brought out the drinks menu.  The service all night was impeccable.  My water glass was refilled the second I emptied it and the food came out at the perfect pace where the meal didn't drag or seem too long even though it ended up being close to 3 hours! Before our appetizers came, they brought us shot glasses of a delicious mushroom soup (so good!), bread (seaweed focacia, it makes no sense but its prob the best focaccia i've ever had) and the following amuse bouches: -smoked trout with creme fraiche on a crispy fried salmon skin (delicious!) -a gougere cheese puff (fell a bit flat, it was good but not THAT good) For appetizers, we ordered: -63c duck egg with polenta, fondue, and black winter truffles (my personal fave!) -farro dish with smoked shimeji mushrooms (I could have eaten this as an entree, we almost had a fight over who got to finish it lol) -artichoke vegetable dish with some kind of jalapeno sauce (i didn't like this at all) My entree was a wild sea bass with sweet onion sauce and roasted pearl onions and nasturtiums.  when the waiter brought it out he said "this is like a study in onions."  At that point, I knew i ordered the right thing.  I love onions and this was a delicious fish with onions cooked 5 ways!     1. crispy fried scallions   2. braised scallions   3. roasted pearl   4. sweet onion reduction/sauce   5. some kind of crispy onion caviar (yum) I felt that this was a perfect compliment to the fish; it enhanced its flavor but did not overwhelm.  As for the nasturtiums, they looked like tiny water lilies and had a tart flavor (similar to grape leaves i guess).   My coworkers got: -grilled turbot for 2 (i tried a bite and it was a bit too "fishy" for my taste) -NY steak (he loved it) -striped bass with nettle sauce (looked delicious, but i didn't ask to try any) For desert we had the creme fresh ice cream with financier and meringue.  It was delicious.  By that point, we were all stuffed and even though I would have devoured it in any other situation, I couldn't. So why only a 4 star?  I guess I just cant get over the sticker shock!  Food is something that nurtures me, but also something that makes me happy.  I feel like my meal was just not worth the $100 it cost (I didn't have wine, that would have brought me to $140.)  if i had paid all of it myself, i would have left slightly disappointed.

I had high expectations for Providence, but was rather underwhelmed by the dining experience there. My dining companion and I both had the 5-course tasting menu with wine pairings. I sat facing Melrose ave with lots of cars whizzing by--not exactly what I expect of a decent restaurant. Another oddity: the soundtrack--I do like Beck but would prefer not to hear tracks off of Odelay while dining. We thought that the decor was rather odd; it was some sort of underwater aquatic theme. The candle holder that took up about 20% of our small table and didn't seem to match anything in the whole place. Three out of five wines were meh, the other two were good. Sometimes I couldn't figure out the intention behind the pairings, but possibly that is my fault. The only dishes that were memorable: screwdriver cocktail in a spoon, blackened cod (yum!), some sort of chocolate dessert. I'm in no hurry to return, as I'd like to give some other places a shot first, especially considering the cost of dining here.

I went here a year ago for my birthday and honestly, it was not that great. I've enjoyed a lot of fine dining in my life and while this was definitely not a bad dinner, it was by no means great. At best it was enjoyable. The service, decor, etc were top notch. The cocktails were outstanding. But the food? Not memorable in any way. Just prepared and plated well. Not wow worthy, not worth the money, not worth going back. To be fair, I prefer bolder flavors and my plate had a very balanced taste. Also, did not do the tasting menu, so I could have just ordered the one boring dish on the menu.

I knew it! We should've gotten the 9-course full tasting instead of 16-course Chef's menu. BF was lured by the thrill of omakase-style Chef's menu. Not knowing, in his experience, meant also the luxury of hanging out for hours without knowing what dish will come out next. True, every single dish was paramount both in taste and presentation and we were blown away especially by their Kanpachi, Uni Canape (drizzled w/ black truffle butter), Spot Prawn Roe, Sweetbreads (you might not want to know where this thing came from), and their extensive cheese selection. But we definitely overestimated our stomach capacity. It was simply no fun when you could barely eat the last 4 dessert course T___T So people, I beg you, do not give in to this "Beginner Syndrome" temptation unless you've had solid experience in multi-course tasting menu. Moral of the story: more abdomen training is needed before my trip to Yountville ^___^

Cohesive menu, great wine pairings, generous portions. We opted for the 9-course full tasting menu and shared a wine pairing. Each course was a delight and the really came together to make a great meal. Some highlights: - bacon brioche, comes complimentary with your meal and it's o so delicious. fluffy bread with bits of bacon, amazing. - veal tenderloin, such a well cooked, tender piece of meat. i would order this course on it's own if it was offered on the a la carte menu. - a soup in a shooter glass as part of the amuse bouche... I'm kicking myself right now for not being able to identify this amazing concoction. it was so savory and flavorful. great dining experience here at Providence, the staff was very friendly, each course more like an entree, rater than a tasting menu. i was definitely left full and satisfied. *parking may be a bit difficult in the surrounding areas, valet was $4.

Providence is the King of all LA restaurants. It has been #1 for I don't know how many years. I always knew coming here would be a pricy affair but eventually this dangling, diamond-tipped carrot had to be mine! Who needs to buy groceries or gas when you can have a night out in food heaven? (If this doesn't make up for the Chef Boyardee post below, nothing will!) There wasn't a single fault I can find at Providence. Trust me, I tried. If I had to pick something, the decor was a bit lacking. When you're spending this kind of money, you wish there was more to stare at. Our own personal Picasso would have been nice. But screw that, the fish was PERFECTLY cooked, the flavors were fun and inventive and the service was so friendly, you almost forget you're dining at a place where you'll spend that little sum you were saving...for a downpayment on a house! Order one of the tasting menus or don't even bother! BUN BOY EATS LA

Providence is a truly wonderful dining experience, with some very unique dishes, and worthy of its two Michelin Stars... is it worth $300 for two? I'd say yes... but I wish my options weren't as limited.  You can pick food from an a la carte menu or a tasting menu, and some of the tasting menu dishes aren't available a la carte.  The service and atmosphere are both five stars, you're treated like a king from the second you arrive... I'll get into those later on. We went here for my birthday and brought our own bottle of Silver Oak, which kept the price down.  My wife and I each got the 9-course tasting menu, which I believe was $135.00 each (or more if you want to do the wine pairings).  Some of the dishes were immaculate, while others were slightly more than mediocre. So, onto the food - first thing after sitting down is the bread.  You're not given a basket of bread, but rather a server comes over to you with a selection.  The sourdough was great, and I even enjoyed the wheat roll with olive... but perhaps one of the best breads I've ever had was the Bacon roll.  That's right, bacon, cooked right into the roll.  It was divine, to say the least!  The server also gave us a plate of warm butter which came with a small spoon of rock salts... I've never sprinkled salt onto bread before, but since that's all a pretzel is, I figured I'd give it a go... butter + salt + bacon bread = flavor explosion!  Remember that equation, it's on the test. But don't stuff yourself on the bread, because even though the portions are small, they add up and you'll fill up fast!  We ordered the Clam Chowder to share, and they brought it out for us in two cups but still just charged the bowl price.  But the waiter did warn us that it was heavy, and might take up some precious stomach real estate, but we got it anyways.  It wasn't as good as most New England chowders, but as far as LA goes, it was right on par with what you'd expect. The meal started off with a cocktail, the frozen mojito and screwdriver.  Both were great, a unique and unexpected way to kick off the evening.  The mojito was served almost like an egg yolk, frozen within some sort of membrane, topped with mint.  You put the whole thing in your mouth at once (it's served on a spoon), and it explodes the second it hits your tongue.  It was wild, and I loved it oh so much!  The screwdriver is more or less a frozen shot, and you scoop or shoot it, depending on your style. I don't recall all of the remaining eight dishes nor the order they came out in, but it's obvious that the chef thought about the order long and hard.  One dish complimented the next, from light to heavy.  The second course was a soup which I recall loving.  The third was a selection of fish, served three ways - the sesame crusted salmon skin was my favorite part of that.  The John Dory was great, but the Striped Bass was not very impressive.  The pork belly was probably my favorite part of the menu, I could have eaten a ton of those and been happy.  And for desert, the most rich and delicate chocolate cake I've ever had. The decor isn't trendy or overly fancy - it's quite simply... simple!  They didn't try to over do it, allowing you to focus on what you came in for... the food.  The bathrooms are super nice, the tables are set in presidential fashion, and all in all you're very comfortable.   The service is also top notch.  From the second you sit down, people keep coming around with breads, cheeses, waters, refilling your wine, cleaning your place, refolding your napkin, changing out the silverware... seriously, I haven't ever been served that well before or again in my life. So... the million dollar question... should you eat here?  Yes.  Bring your own wine and an appetite, and prepare to eat one of the finest meals in Los Angeles.

Me and my BF go here on special occasions because it really is a special place. I cant even begin to say how amazing the food AND service. I always feel the minute we walk in the door we are being waited hand and foot. It always feels like we are the only ones in the restaurant. Our last experience, we went to celebrate our anniversary, and let me just tell you that it blew me away with their service. For example, We were seated in the middle of a room which I DIDNT mind because I was happy to be there and my bf only mentioned that we had a great corner table last time to me and I guess they might have heard because as soon as a table opened up they offered us a romantic corner table for just the two of us. They also overheard me mention I was getting full so they offered to box up the rest of our courses. HOW NICE! The food is hands down amazing. My favorite is the scallops! Yum! Everything is made to perfection and the flavors just dance in your mouth. I literally smiled every time I took a bite because not only do they present your dish in an art form but it tastes like something you have never tasted before I can promise you that. Providence is worth every penny. I have been to places where the food is great but the service is HORRIBLE and I dont get to enjoy my food, but HERE you get to enjoy both. Go to Providence, and your standards will be raised when you go to other  fine dining restaurants.

Of all the fine dining restaurants I've been to, this one and Moto have been my two favorite.  Moto was more about the interaction and atmosphere...its kind of a unique experience whereas providence is more of a quality of food, sophisticated experience.   The restaurant is dedicated to seafood and relatively easy to get a reservation at.  We each did the standard 9 course tasting and shared a wine pairing.  It was a good amount of food (more than bazaars 22 course tasting) and because I love seafood, the dishes were delicious.   Couple notes: I feel like they seat you based on how you're dressed.  In the back room if you're casual and in the front spacey room if youre dressed up. Come dressed up.  They dont really do anything for your birthday though it may be to preserve the atmosphere of the fine dining restaurant.  Ive heard that french laundry sings to you though...but it may depend on who you are. I believe it was $125 for food plus half the wine tasting came out to be around $200 with tax and tip per person.

Providence, the LA queen of prix fixe tasting menus. Fair: $95 @ five course Good: $125 @ (12 courses) full tasting Best: $175 @ (15 courses) chef's menu If you're scared, just start with the five course but I have to say the 12 was fantastic. You will be stuffed, so be warned. Expect to spend a least two and half hours for the full tasting (we were there three). You really get to enjoy the flavours of each food dish- their uni is a good way to die, I think. K died his own way after having too much cheese (one course is of course the dessert cheeses on a cart). Plating is lovely, although chef does seem to love foam. The seafood dishes were by far, the best. If you're an alcoholic foodie, the first serving of amuse bouche will make you oh so happy. Michelin 2 star with great service (tiny bathroom) and fantastic food. A good way to end the year, if you haven't been here, you have to come try it.

The food is just about as good as it gets. They were 45 minutes late for our 9:00pm reservation, so to appease an angry hungry crowd, they gave us what seemed to be the fanciest jello shot around. It was essentially a jelly ball infused with alcohol - incredible. The amuse buche they served throughout the meal were fantastic. Everything we ordered was made to perfection, except for one $75 fish that we asked to switch because it did not taste $75 dollars worth, and they did so without argument. Beware the snobbery of the waiters.  As one of out servers told us, "we aren't trying to appeal to the masses". Just know going in, they are serious about their food!

Came here for my birthday with my husband. I had been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile since LA doesn't have too many Michelin star rated restaurants. I had a good time however there is room for improvement when it comes to some of their dishes. We had their 5 course tasting menu. Here are my pros and cons list Pros: -Service overall was very good. Courses were presented in a timely manner and the staff is warm and inviting. -Kanpachi crudo dish. Fish was well cut, fantastic consistency and their accompanying mini heirloom tomatoes gave the dish just the right amount of acidity. Stellar dish! - Cheese plate (we paid a supplement to add this to our tasting menu, well worth it!) Fantastic assortment. Leave room for this as it is meal within itself! Totally delicious! - they added my name to our menu, wishing me a happy birthday... nice detail. - Wines by the glass, nice variety. Cons: -Some dishes were forgettable and not as savory as I hoped. Dishes overall were not as inspired as I expected from a Michelin star restaurant. I think NY has better 1 star Michelin restaurants. LA falls behind in general. -The prawns were not cooked well, not as moist as they should be. - Veal was a little over salted and the flavors were not exciting, the dish needed some acidity to add some complexity. - They forgot to bring my husband an espresso and they had already delivered the check, when we reminded them of this the waiter removed the check so he could update it. I found this a little tacky. You already forgot to bring the espresso, you're now going to fix the check to adjust it, when you forgot to bring it...? - Restaurant is in a shady neighborhood. Overall nice experience but I was underwhelmed. I would probably give this restaurant a 3.75, but I can't on yelp, so I decided to give them a 4 because of the total experience was more of a 4, but food strictly would have been a 3.5.

They lost a star for service. The food was honestly amazing, with the very unique amuse bouche they served and one of the best foie gras I've tasted, even better than the one I've tasted at Le Cirque here in Vegas. The prix fixe is bit pricey for what they serve, but each dish served was very unique in its flavor, so I don't mind paying for it. But as far as the service goes, I swear.. California servers can be weird sometimes.  Let me describe my experience that night though. The server comes over to the table with our foie gras that didn't come with the prix fixe, but I wanted it since I always like trying foie gras at each place that I go to that is at least remotely French in its cuisine. She explains the dish and its sides in graceful fluency, but she finishes up explaining the foie gras saying, "..try to enjoy this." Try?  Try to enjoy this?  What does that mean??  Try.. Then she continues explaining the sides, but I was just dumbfounded at that moment.  On top of that, at EACH DISH she explains, during the last three words of her explanation, she already turned her head and started her next line of work, as if she was in a rush or that we didn't care for her explanation. We tipped her fine since essentially, she did her job.  But still.  I just felt it was a bit off.

Truly a perfect dining experience!!! The food is amazing and the service is great.  I felt like I was eating art...in the best way possible. Worth all of the hype--definitely try it!

quality of fish and other ingredients was very good. not sure i'm into the foam thing but otherwise very flavorful meal. had the crab appetizer, scallop ceviche, french rouget, seabass and duck breast, which were all good w/the french rouget being my fave. liked the amuse bouche and bread/butter. service could be better considering it's a high end resto that costs an arm and a leg. service shd be at bazaar or mozza level at these prices. but overall good. full review w/pix on my site.

I was lucky enough to get dinner here for Valentine's day this year and it did not disappoint at all. I've been meaning to give the place a try, but boyfriend beat me to it in making reservations. Valentine's had a set menu, as do most places, at $150 a head for 7 courses. Boyfriend tacked on the premium wine pairing onto my dinner for an additional $150. The regular wine pairing was an additional $70. My friend warned me ahead of time that they are fairly generous with their wine on wine pairings and she was not joking. I think I was drunk by the end of the night. That being said, everything was AMAZING (including the bread). The menu for the night included: Tai snapper sashimi Santa Barbara spot prawn Maine Lobster Wild New Zealand john dory Hudson Valley duck breast Fennel, yellow chartreuse, angelica, yogurt Dark chocolate with mint, croquant and cocoa nibs If I had to say anything bad, I would just say that I was least impressed with the duck breast. It was tender and flavorful, but not as juicy as I was expecting. Service was on point and the atmosphere is just elegant and relaxing. We were seated in a small room that made it even cozier. Overall, a lovely and DELICIOUS dinner. Worth it for the wine pairing if you're in the mood to really splurge. If you're celebrating something big or in the mood to feast and have no concerns for your wallet, then this is the place to go.

still reigns supreme as my favorite restaurant in LA. some old favorites and new surprises in their 9 course tasting menu made for another unforgettable evening my favorites: 1. melt in your mouth, bursting full of flavor amuse bouche of the mojito and screwdriver. 2. the kamachi; leave it to providence to be the only other place that can serve sushi that can actually hold a torch to the magic of sushi zo. 3. sea urchin : this is providence defined for me in one perfectly chiseled egg. i could eat 20 of these and still beg for more.  one of my favorite dishes in all of LA. 4. sea scallop: cooked to perfection with the most pleasurable texture from a scallop imaginable. 5. veal: so soft i swear that baby cow didn't move an inch in his life.  beautiful presentation with the pea puree. 6. black truffle pasta: we couldn't resist that night's special and added it to our 9 course prix fixe menu.  pricey ($70 a plate) but our waiter practically doubled the size of our pasta with heaping mounds of shaved truffle.  the dish was so decadent i had to take a nice long break to let my overwhelmed taste buds come back to order. i think if i weren't so full i'd have also fallen in love with the salmon but alas, i could only eat half of it.  the cheese table selections were overwhelming and of course, i pick the stinkiest available, which were too strong to enjoy at the time.  we had a nibble of each and packed up the rest for later.   the service was outstanding, personable and completely not pretentious.  we spotted michael cimarusti and he was gracious enough to take a picture with us despite my teenage crazed giggling. my advice: don't eat for at least 24h prior to your reservation. it's a 4-5 hour marathon of pure hedonistic consumption.

I don't excessively rave about many places, but Providence is definitely in a class of its own.  I totally understand why it is a two Michelin star restaurant.  I don't use the words "amazing", "outstanding", and "excellent" very often, but Providence is certainly worthy of such adjectives.  Although expensive, Providence is worth the splurge, especially since I was celebrating my birthday. We had the 5 course tasting menu and it was exceptional.  I think if I ordered any of the larger tasting menus, I really wouldn't be able to enjoy it because I was already stuffed with the 5+ courses I received.   I also ordered the Savory Sling drink and although I really liked it, I'm not used to $15 cocktails. Service and presentation were superb.  The only negative would be the not-so-great surrounding area.

The food here was beautiful and delicious. I wish I could remember what we ordered (we were there in February for my birthday). Two of us ordered fish - it was made to perfection. My husband got some sort of steak (?) and he loved it. The portions were small, yes, so get an app or two. The foie gras app was fabulous; however, I don't think I'll ever eat it again (I watched a scarring documentary piece of the way they treat the poor ducks/geese.. to each their own!) Anyway, all in all, it's a very nice place. Dress up or you'll look out of place.

Overall thought: Excellent food, excellent experience! Occasion: Came here with a friend for my birthday dinner Experience: The food was delicious. I also like the introductions they give before they served you your food. I'm personally really picky about my food so having the introductions of what's inside each plate and how to eat it was something I really enjoyed. Favorites: - Their non-alcoholic fruit cocktails. YOU MUST TRY. I had three different non-alcoholic (because I'm underage) fruit cocktails and they were all so unique, yet amazing tasting. My favorite concoction had grapefruit, lemon, and a hint of vanilla. - Truffle Spaghetti (I still have dreams about eating it) - Wagyu Beef. It really is as delicious as it looks

I finally got to try THE Providence.  I heard mixed reviews and my assessment is this: The seafood dishes were outstanding but the meat dishes did not wow me. Most of the seafood courses in the chef's tasting menu were solid 5 stars.  The meat... 3 stars. I thought the chef's tasting menu (9 vs 5 courses) was wayyyy too much food.  There were around 4-5 amuse bouches altogether and it was about a 3-4 hr dining experience. My recs: get the 5 course and order the foie gras ravioli and/or the seared foie gras to share.  You'll save some money and you won't be painfully full.

An amazing restaurant.  I did the 16 course Chef Tasting menu which $170/pp.  I thought the price was worth it for the number of course and the intricacy of each dish. From start to finish, the wait staff did a great job of explaining the concept behind each dish.   Here is what I had that evening: Screwdriver & Mojito spheres Kumamoto and oyster flower Naked Cowboy Oyster from Australia (warmed up to room temp) Abalone & squid/chorizo Brioche canepe with fresh uni & truffle Hamachi Crudo with Champaign gelee Scallop, Santa Barbara spot prawn with Ichiban Dashi Arctic Char Striped Bass cheeks with smoked mushroom & peas Unagi with veal bone marrow & chestnuts Foie gras with quail egg Wagyu beef Cheese Course Guava Sorbet Almond Meringue Dessert While I loved each course, if I had to do it again, I would probably do lesser number of dishes.  It just wasn't enough to get a good taste of each.     My favorite of the evening:  The Scallop and Santa Barbara Prawns in a scallop shell.  They pour Ichiban Dashi broth, which is suppose to be the top notch dashi broth.  The santa barbara prawns were AMAZING.  Sweet and very plump and juicy. Bottom Line: Worthy of its two Michelin stars (2009)

We enjoyed the tasting menu with paired wine. The food was exquisite and innovative. Presentation was beautiful. The wine pairings compliment each dish. They did a wonderful job of explaining each course and its presentation. Its definitely one of the top restaurants in the US; its a great place to go if you like innovative and good cuisine. Although one is not supposed to, its fun to eaves drop on the amazing conversations of others in the restaurant; a real slice-of-life experience! :-) Valet parking is $8.00; which is best way to park if one cannot find a place on the street to park. Its close by to both Hollywood and Paramount Studios.

I was taken to Providence for my birthday this year, and it was very special. Everything feels artisanal and lovingly put together. The waitstaff was well mannered and actually treated you like you were special and they wanted to be there, which added to everything. Seaweed bread is amazing better than olive or Bacon bread. Foi Gras ravioli was my starter which was unctuous and lovely but could have used some acid. I was too embarrassed to ask them for some lemon as everything seemed so well put together I didn't want to be critical but it really could have used something to cut the richness, and give it a lift the dish seriously needed. Adam had the Ugly bunch - Uni, Salmon Row, and Gewy Duck, with gold leaf, which was rather lovely, although it had a slight metallic taste which I didn't dig. I had the wild bass with a trio of onions, which really was a let down, rather bland, and dry and the onion vinaigrette over powered the flavor of the fish completely - I would not recommend this dish at all. On the other hand Adam had the duck which was perfectly cooked and tasted like a steak - moist, tender, meaty wonderful - it came with a foi gras sauce which was sumptuous, and a deep fried ball of sous vide duck which was AMAZING shame it was just one small ball. Overall I would recommend it, but I think it's over priced, and not as amazing as teh hype. Only go if you think it's worth it to spend $250 on dinner. Definitely go once to say you've done it but I think your money could be better spent else where.

I came here for a birthday dinner a year ago and fell in love.  If I had to choose a last meal, it would be anything off the Providence menu.  The duck was perfect, the 9 course tasting menu was amazing, and the bread is divine.  I really can't complain about anything here.

I had a chance to finally dine at Providence for a friend's birthday this past weekend.  Our party of 6 got lucky and got seated in the private chef dining room where we got to see all the food being prepped and the chefs running around.  If only we had more time, it would have been awesome to get a tour of the kitchen. Traditionally, I would have opted for the tasting menu, but we were short on time and I'm not a big fan of veal tenderloin.  So has a table, we opted to do the a la carte menu choosing hot/cold appetizers and an entree. Now onto the food: Amuse Bouche: Mint Mojito Ice and Spherification  of Screwdriver (see picture attached) Foie Gras Saute with Crest Peaches, Jalapeno Corn Bread and Rosemary Brown Butter: This was probably the best dish of the night for me and one of the best foie gras pairings I've ever had.  (Must Order!) Chowda: had a bite of this bacon chowder, only soup option but great to order if you love corn Foie Gras Ravioli: Nicely presented and quite delicious, on par with the Foie Gras Saute Wild John Dore with Morel Mushrooms and Smoked Butter John Dore with Bacon, Black Truffle, wrapped in puff pastry with smoked lobster butter (this was the special of the night and the description made my mouth salivate)  The portion was quite hearty, I could hardly finish all four pieces. Coffee was the best way to top off the night after our amazing meal.  I definitely will be back to try tasting menu.  Definitely a dateworthy place to take someone you're trying to impress or someone who loves food as much as you do.

With close to a 1000 reviews here, I relay believe I am wasting my time. Yes I am the minority. I am the 1% and I did not like this place. We did not partake in their fixed course meal. I like flexibility. We orders the steak and the salmon. Some wine and  some Big Eye Tuna to start with. The steak is pan seared. Aging I am shocked. It needs to be grilled. Its steak. Even in my own kitchen I grill. I came to providence like every other foodie captivated by tales of greatness. I arrived to a wobbly table and a dirty wine glass. Really here!!. I asked them to fix the table and replace my glass. They seemed angry about it. I was shocked. The waiter did not come back to talk to us for another 10 minutes. I am not sure how this apple is Michelin rated or so popular. I can only assume that my experience is  a one of. Unfortunately I won't come back. It was too horrible of  a night and I had such a big build up coming here. All the hype, made for a bigger let down. I guess at least now I can assay vie been to Providence.

NOTE: we were seated.  before we started ordering, we saw a fly in the dining room.  the first thing i thought about was what the fly was going to land on..  eww.. **************************************************­************************** i have been to several 1 star michelin places.  don't think that providence deserves even 1 star.  maybe someone paid them for the 2 stars or slept with someone.  no idea.  if 2 michelin stars mean that you will have a main condescending waiter with attitude...no thank you. every restaurant that i've ever visited with a 1 star michelin rating has always had better service.  even the front hostess has dressed much better than the one at providence.  miss...that dress was way to casual for your job... =p - - - wow.. i'm glad we didn't pay an extra $5.50 for valet parking since they were nonexistent during that time.  there is plenty of street parking!! btw, my husband and i both had diarrhea from the meal...most likely from the kanpachi.. **************************************************­************************** my mom was in town.  i had wanted to try providence for quite a while now.  so i decided to make a reservation for sunday night @5:30pm with hubby and mom. Food -- 4.5 stars (for creativity, flavor combos, and tenderness of food) Service -- 3.5 stars (since there were many younger wait staff helping out with description of the food...i don't think i could stand seeing our main waiter for the whole meal.  if you want really great service (and i mean STELLAR), go to gary danko in SF) we opted for the 5 course meal (with wine, it's $45 more).  i didn't like that if someone wanted the 5 course meal, everyone had to order it.  it makes more sense to make that rule for the 9 course (2.5 hr) and 14 course meal (4 hr).  it would have been nice to have 2 of the 5 course meals and one a la carte...a meal you could build. each dish was delicately placed.  it felt like each bite had a myriad of flavors that all complemented each other. i loved the first bites (before the meal you order arrives).  two spoons are in front of you.  this time it was a screwdriver but it looked like an overeasy egg.  they call it a bubble dish.  basically they submerge whatever they choose for that night into a gelatin-like mixture to create that look.  in the other spoon was the mojito...a bit of shaved ice with a mint leaf on top. out of the breads, i like the seaweed bread best.  my mom liked the bacon brioche one.  the sourdough was a plain round mini-one. hubby and i don't like asian fusion.  with that said, we felt that this kind of asian fusion was not the norm.  the flavor combinations were creative and pleasing.  my fav combo was the kanpachi because it came with tapioca pearls, plum powder, enoki mushrooms (but it might have been the dish that made my stomach uneasy later). the scallop dish was the best of the night...superb and flavorful. veal was perfectly cooked.  quite a generous piece of tender meat...and the most visually pleasing dish of the night.   at the end of the meal, they give some sweets.  i'm a big sweets person, but i felt that their sweets were TOO sweet.  a mint chocolate marshmallow, lychee jelly (the ones you get from neiman marcus), and handmade ginger flavored caramel.   here's the thing about service: i felt like the younger waiters were very good...explaining everything, etc.  but, as for our head waiter, i felt like he was saying things in his head as he paused.  it's like when you watch a soap opera and someone is thinking..  like he was mocking us or something..   he was a total dbag.  i actually was tempted to ask the front desk for another waiter...sooo tempted.  but i just sat there thinking about it..  good thing other younger wait staff were gracious in bringing dishes and describing them to us.   yes, they use good ingredients...however, when i got back, i could not help but feel that my stomach was uneasy.  (i was in the bathroom for a while..)  the next morning, my hubby said that his stomach felt funny too.  people aren't supposed to feel this way after having a 2 michelin star restaurant...right?? don't get me wrong, it was not a bad meal...  but not the best i've ever had.  i also did not like the fact that there were only 2 unisex bathrooms.

Warning: SALTY!!! Everything I tried had an obscene amount of salt infused into the dish AND sprinkled on top. You can taste greasy fatness in everything. The food was definitely unique and very tasty but it makes McDonalds look healthy by comparison. I had the duck entree. The duck breast was seared and slightly pink the middle. I guess that is how they do it in fine restaurants. Before our meal, they treated us to alcoholic drinks  on jelly spoons. How do they get liquids into those delicate jelly packages? It is amazing!

This has to be one of the finest meals I've had.  I had a bit of difficulty finding the restaurant.  My GPS unit told me I was there, but I saw no sign and wasn't sure I had entered the address correctly.  I phoned and a woman told me exactly where i needed to go.  I had been by and missed it.  It's a small building with wooden slats for exterior decoration with no elaborate, large sign. I ordered the full tasting menu--9 courses that were simply amazing in execution, plating, and flavor.  It was a slow dinner over the course of two hours and it was a lot of fun tasting things I have had in other restaurants but done with a different take or presentation.  Some of the courses that were simply amazing were: the Santa Barbara sea urchin served in an egg cup with scrambled eggs hiding the sea urchin at the bottom; the salmon encased in pork belly; the tenderloin of veal; and the cheese board which was rolled on a trolley to my table. The staff was very attentive and my server explained each course as it was delivered and offered suggestions for ways of eating the food to enhance the flavors. This was a great evening in Los Angeles, and I have to thank two Las Vegas Yelpers for cluing me into this place.  What a grand dining experience!! I've only added two photos.  Since there are already over 1,000 posted, you can get more information from the many posted.

Review 700... Providence. Perhaps the most procrastinated review, I've purposefully put off until now. Granted the memory and experience isn't as vivid as it used to be and my companions especially the birthday girl and Yelper friend (Christy L.) have eloquently written about: (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) Here's my P.O.V. (point of view) from our experience: I came here with my newfound friend and Yelper Christy L. for her 2nd 23rd Birthday. All jokes aside it was privilege to partake in the festivities especially with the type of meal we were going to be feasting. Valet is necessary, but affordable. Got inside, and so far the front of the house escorted me to the table promptly. Got a couple of snobbish looks from the front of the house staff, but that's LA fine dining for you. After becoming seated with the rest of the Birthday girl's attendance, they finally wanted to ask what would we acquire.  The 5 Course or 9 Course (wine pairing for either choice is optional) offering. I chose the 5 course, and sampled a bit off of Christy's wine pairing option throughout the course of our meal (which memory has escaped me as of the moment) The highlights of the meal (in their 2010 menu) are as follows: -A flight of drinks turned gastronomy: jelly square tequila and lime,  greyhound gelee and ceviche (bloody mary style) -Kanpachi, accompanied with rice cracker, fennel and aioli -Seared Sea Scallop with an Complex Indian Spicy Emulsion - (2x) pieces of Veal, Cauliflower Puree and various vegetables -Blood Orange Sorbet with Creme Fraiche The biggest negative: -The In-House, Raspberry Macarons (my first taste of Macarons ever in life), and Cocoa dusted marshmallows. Both items were dry and difficult to digest. It wasn't a fitting conclusion to our above average meal. For my share of the tab with gratuity and costs, was about roughly $170.00 plus tax and tip. Would I ever come back? Perhaps, considering a year is enough for their menu to change and their kitchen staff to really hone in on their skills. Otherwise, it was a pleasure to finally dine at one of LA's finest. Now is the time to catch up and write the rest of the reviews... cheers.

I was wanting to be amazed and blown away by the 15 course chef's menu instead I found myself comparing it unfavorably to similar meals at Eleven Madision Park and Fleur de Lys. Most dishes tasted good but some were very good but none reached greatness. I had pick the place because I had been told about the all vegetarian tasting menu. I had also been told to request it in my reservation because they would need time to prep it. So when I made my online reservation I added a note about wanting the vegetarian tasting menu. I guess I should have called because when we arrived they could not do the 12 or 15 course menu as vegetarian only the five and as it was a special occasions I wanted to go balls to the wall and get one of the tasting menus. Instead the French Spouse got an all pescatarian meal while I was eat everything as I like to do. At this price point I expect food that is comparable to Le Bernardin, EMP or French Laundry. I just did not find it to be that level. Some dishes were good especially the mushroom dish with mushrooms made into broth, foam, saboyan and left in the natural form. They must have just gotten a smoke gun because four our dishes used it but only 2 were successful uses. The other two dishes were overwhelmed by the smokiness. The service was odd too. It was formal without has that classic flow and grace and instead just seemed really stiff as if the servers didn't really know what was going on. They didn't always seem to know what the dishes were even as they were explaining them. It was a good meal but not very memorable and I probably wouldn't go back.

Next to Spago, probably the best restaurant I've ever been to. The service was impeccable... the staff would watch you (in a non-creepy way) to meet all your needs. I love places where they give you little tastes before and after. The meal started off with little tasters of seaweed crackers topped with caviar and such in a beautiful box.  It ended with a little platter of salty caramels, macaroons, etc. This place is famous for seafood and it was presented beautifully. Bright, vivid colors of foams and sauces... everything was delicious including the wine.  It ended up being about $300 for two. Come here for a special occasion... everything will be perfect.

Yummy food. Tasty tasting menu. Great cheese selections. We had tried the two different tasting menus. Will definitely return to try their a la carte dishes. Something called "ugly bunch" that contains geoduck, abalone, and sea urchin sounds interesting as well as enticing. The wait staff was attentive and friendly which made the experience very pleasurable.

Providence comes highly recommended as one of only 4 LA restaurants with 2 Michelin stars (Melisse, Spago, and Urasawa are the others). In fact, there has been considerable on-line debate over Melisse vs. Providence being the best, despite many similarities. Having already eaten at Melisse earlier this year, my girlfriend's birthday seemed like the perfect opportunity to see how Providence compared. While the standard menu is excellent, I was told that the tasting menus are where Providence really stands out. There is a choice between a 5-course menu, a 9-course full tasting menu, and the deluxe 15-course chef's menu - all available with or without wine pairing. After some discussion, considering the special occasion, we decided to splurge on the chef's menu and wine pairing. While valet parking is available, there is also plenty of street parking. The restaurant itself is a bit like being inside a large house, with smaller dining areas sectioned off. Service was friendly and very professional. To make a long story short, this may have been the most spectacular meal either of us has ever eaten. (Also the most expensive, but totally worth it.) For 4 hours, we sampled the full spectrum of the chef's menu, encompassing 15 dishes and 11 wines. Simply amazing! By the end we were totally stuffed and completely satisfied. For those wanting more detail, here is what we were served... Molecular cocktails - an egg-yolk-like screwdriver and frozen mojito cube served in spoons. A fun and interesting way to start off the evening. Bread - I tried both the bacon brioche and nori focaccia, which were very good. Beau Soleil oyster w/ jalapeno, cilantro, & lime - kind of like a bite-sized ceviche Abalone and squid & chorizo skewers - smoky and very flavorful. Cracker box w/ ravioli-like stuffed crackers... - smoked trout - basil, mozzarella, tomato - egg & caviar This course also included a shot of tomato consomme w/ foam and a spoon of molecular consomme w/ a mozzarella cube. Very interesting and flavorful. Kanpachi sashimi - definitely some Japanese influence on some of the dishes. Soft-boiled egg w/ uni, cornbread, and black truffles. This was served in the egg shell and paired with some Taittinger champagne. Wow! This was unbelievable delicious and luxurious, creamy texture but without being too rich. This was one of the highlights of the evening. Spot prawns - peel with your fingers and dip in prawn butter (which was so good, I couldn't resist dipping my bread, too).  A washcloth was helpfully provided afterwards. Japanese sardines w/ romesco and chorizo - salty and savory, this item  didn't appear on any other menu. Sweetbreads w/ strawberry, beet, and almond nori crust - I was skeptical about the sweetbreads, but this was much better than expected. Sauteed foie gras with masumoto peaches - my girlfriend loves foie gras, so we requested this dish and received it in place of the black sea bass. King salmon w/ eggplant, fig, & fennel - Excellent! Even the skin was deliciously crispy. Wagyu beef w/ bone marrow bernaise, chanterelles - Outstanding! Cheese cart - we got to choose 4 types from an impressive and exotic selection. Cucumber mint frozen melon yogurt soup - a palate cleanser, but this wonderful dessert was refreshing and probably my favorite. Miso cheesecake w/ berries - I'm not usually a dessert person, but this was really good. Chocolate ganache w/ raspberry & ginger - delicious, but at this point it was a struggle to finish it. Petit fours - candy while I'm contemplating the damage to my wallet. While 15 courses and 11 wines sounds like a lot of food and drink, the portions were small and the pacing was perfect. Still, it adds up. Overall, this was a spectacular once-in-a-lifetime dinner and quite possibly the best either of us has ever had. The wines covered the full range of available options and included champagne, several whites, a rose, a few reds, and a port for dessert. I strongly recommend the wine pairing option if you are so inclined, as it definitely added to our enjoyment of the overall experience. We would definitely return for a more "ordinary" dinner another time.

LOVE.  love love love. I finally got to go to Providence and have their 9-course tasting menu, which is $125/person. The first amuse-bouche to come out looked like an egg yolk on a spoon placed next to a weird whitish cube, so I thought "omg, I'm in for some weird culinary shit today."   However, it turned out the "egg yolk" was a little bubble of a screwdriver, and the cube was a mojito!  They were absolutely amazing, and the same can be said of every other course that came out.   The food here is divine.  It does take a while to get through all 9 courses though, so come when you are not in a rush.  Otherwise, I highly highly recommend.

This is a fine restaurant and worthy of much of the praise it receives but it is not the be-all and end-all of the LA restaurant scene. The food was mostly excellent with a few misses. The tuna tartare was deemed average at best by everyone at the table. It was simply flavorless. If Gerber made Tuna Tartare baby food, this is what I imagine it would taste like. Furthermore, I know Wagyu beef is marbly but mine was too chewy and, some cases, grisly. Everything else was outstanding. The exterior of the restaurant was cool. The interior, however, bordered on the edge of outdated-ness. The barnacles on the walls reminded me of a gulf coast seafood house. I couldn't describe the atmosphere. It was neither intimate nor elegant. Maybe old? Passe? Our server was extremely knowledgeable and pleasant but the service was exceptionally slow. He would sort of rush us to make a decision and, if we needed more time, wouldn't come back for some time. The entire meal took about 2 and a half hours. If I've been at your table for that long, don't make me wait 10 minutes for the check while you chat it up with other tables. Some of the food was great but with all the advance billing, the substantial price and the air of pretentiousness, I can only give this a slightly upturned face.

NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THE PROVIDENCE BAR. after dinner, we decided to stop by at providence for some drinks.  we were in luck because zahra bates was behind the bar, and the bar was EMPTY (8:30pm, monday night)! the providence cocktail list has five classic cocktails (dark and stormy, martinis, etc.), and five other cocktails based on what's in season.. all at $15 a piece.   we ordered a "savory sling", which is zubrowka polish vodka, pineapple reduction, ginger infused sake, contreau, pickled strawberries, and soda.  this is probably the greatest vodka cocktail i've ever tasted. we also ordered "the aresenal", which has bulleit bourbon, blackberries, agave nectar, passion fruit. also, really good.. (and really strong). to top it off, as a dessert cocktail, zahra made us some old-fashioned infused marshmallows, served on stick, poked in a plant. FREAKIN amazing. as she said, everything's better with bourbon. we've been meaning to try to eat at providence for a long time now, but have been saving it for a special occasion. the bar at providence is like no other, especially if zahra is behind the bar. watching a genius at work makes the experience worth it.

There are far too many reviews describing how amazing the food is, how beautiful the decor is, and how top-notch the staff is, etc,etc. So I'll leave that up to you to scroll down and read. So all I'm going to say is..this is the first time in my life that I was left speechless upon tasting each dish of the tasting menu, and I don't mean that in a metaphorical sense. I mean literally. My only complaint, though hardly one at all, was I felt the waiter could have been a tad more friendly and informative about questions I had about the dishes. But then again, I'm just being nitpicky. Well, well, well deserving of its two michelin stars, and when I have the chance again, I'll be back here in a heartbeat.

We went here last night for our wedding anniversary and were blown away. In my opinion Providence far surpasses Melisse and all other fine dining restaurants in Los Angeles; the food was that good. We had the 5 course tasting menu and by far my favorite dish was the kampachi course. Perfect fish, perfect garnishs and so fresh I felt like I was next to the ocean. While all of the other dishes were extremely well executed they just didn't compare to the first course of the evening. However, the amuses of the mojito gelee and the trout mousse?? Oh I could eat that every day for the rest of my life. Heck, if they let me bathe in the mousse I would happily do so. The bacon brioche and the nori focaccia were perfect accompaniments to the meal and the butter and salt served alongside couldn't have been better. The perfect temperature and amount portioned were like heaven. I realize I have used the word "perfect" many times above but really Providence deserves the word, the food was perfect. The decor is amazing. Simple but made us feel welcome and calm. After a long and stressful week this is exactly what we needed. the tall banquette backings begged for one to truly enjoy themselves and what they were eating. I loved the seashells on the wall and how they were arranged. Dear Michael, I wish I could give your restaurant five stars but our captain (Attila) was awful, just awful. He treated us like we were a waste of time since we weren't ordering bottles of wine even though my husband did do the wine pairing with the menu. He didn't present any of the courses and rarely checked on us. When he did it was abrupt and he definitely had somewhere better to be. However, Ernell (sp?) and Javier were phenomenal. Their attention to service, presentation of the courses, and warm style made the evening what it was and their service (plus the food) made us want to return. Javier's quick clearing of the dishes but never in a hurried manner was what I look forward in every restaurant experience. I hope that by the time we return Ernell is a captain and he can be our server. Thanks!

^ -^ A revelation ^-^ Little did I know A food revelation Would be experienced While dining at Providence Didn't know LA still had it in her As the fine food scene Is seemingly lacking But one of her Angels Is watching over Providence ------ It is a must for every LA foodie to dine here at least once!  Find a reason and go as this is one of LA's very few fine dining experiences.   Please note, that I tend to not over-rate restaurants as i hate to set up falsely high expectations for other Yelpers.  Trying to keep it good with my homies, as we say in LA. Upon asking our waiter for his recommendations, we decided not to order any of the three tasting menu choices.  We opted instead for the Big Eye tuna tartare and the Santa Barbara spot prawns to start, along with the foie gras ravioli as a second course.  For our entrees, we ordered the wild King salmon and the striped bass.  I ordered the wine pairing from the sommelier and he explained each glass in a very rushed manner.  I guess he was very busy but he did choose two very good wines. The amuse bouche arrived in a wooden box filled with golden lentils and I could see the artistry of the Chef unfolding in this dish.   It is difficult to describe, you just need to see it : ) ***The foie gras ravioli is a revelation and not to be missed.***   All dishes were phenomenal with the bass being a tad over-salted, but still delicious.   The service was good but not great as we had to ask for more bread and water.   The buttery bacon brioche and nori focaccia were perfect, by the way! The presentation of the Santa Barbara spot prawns is spectacular but the shrimp themselves did not have that "WOW!" factor.  The tuna tartare was pure artistry and the better appetizer choice, in my opinion. Dare I say the food at Providence is better than Gary Danko's in SF, However, the service at Gary Danko's is spectacular with everyone spot on!  I'm just glad there is a dining establishment in LA that I can compare to GD's as I didn't know one existed!   Bon appetit!

Definitely an experience worth trying!  To celebrate my quarter-life existence, a Boy was nice enough to take me out.  We did the 9-course tasting menu, and we were both ... so incredibly stuffed, surprisingly, 3 hours later. We had checked yelpers' pictures, and I thought "seriously, how does one get full off these tiny little ... amuse bouche things?"  I didn't even know what amuse bouche was.  Shows how much I know about fine dining. Highlights of the dinner: Screwdriver amuse bouche; Santa Barbara sea urchin with soft scrambled eggs; Japanese kanpachi; veal tenderloin.  The sea urchin and the kanpachi tied for best dish for me. The service here is top-notch, very attentive.  The busboys are even dressed up in full suits.  The women's bathroom was heavenly, they included some brand name lotions and soap.  The winner: the full-length mirror in front of the toilet.  I totally enjoy watching myself peeing.... GREAT EXPERIENCE! FANTASTIC PRESENTATION AND TASTES!

It definitely lived up to the hype... with a few qualms. Service started out a bit odd, but definitely was on par with the price throughout the rest of the night. Servers always came with all the dishes at once, always folded our napkins as we left, and always kept our glasses full. Not much to complain about with the service. We had a party of four, and all did the 9 course tasting. Per yelp's suggestion, shared 2 wine pairings-- our waiter mentioned that there is an additional charge to actually split glasses, so we just did 2 wine pairing orders and shared the glasses. Don't think I saw that mentioned here. I did feel a bit cheap doing this, but since we did not want to get drunk off our butts with so many wines, it was definitely the way to go. while i'm at it -- the wine pairings were GREAT. Definitely better than any I've had at other nice restaurants. The food was...AMAZING. I have only been to a few Michelin (or former Michelin, since they don't do LA anymore) restaurants, but the food here definitely is the best if not in the top 3. I won't go into detail since the courses change and people have talked about them ad naseum here, but yeah.. they're good. Highlights for me included the sea urchin and the striped bass. Excellent, delicate, tasty. Even the cheese platter was fun, although it was a mistake for us to dare to try the stinkiest cheese. We were warned. That brings me to the only negative point of the night -- our seating area. I'm not sure if this is a new patio area that was converted to be indoors, but we were seated along with a few other tables in a room that needed heat lamps. It was okay at first but definitely got colder throughout the night as people left, even with the heat lamps on. The temperature overall was a bit of a distraction, but not as bad as the noise... of cars whizzing by?? Very odd.. it was such a nice meal, such nice service, not to mention quite an expensive meal, and overall it was slightly ruined by the traffic noise. I'm not sure if there's anything they can do about it but next time I will definitely try to request to be seated in a different area. Overall... if you're still reading this review.. that means you want to try it. And you should. Don't even doubt it!!

Disappointing... I had high expectations going to Providence, a receiver of 2 Michelin's Stars. Instead, I was disappointed from the service, to most of the dishes, to the manager's response to our complaint. The waiter was rude, never checked on our table, didn't refill the $8 bottle of Pellegrino I ordered and was overall unprofessional. When he asked how our evening was (while handing us the check), I told him I was disappointed and he thought I was joking. When he realized that I was not, his face turned into stone. No apologies was given. When we addressed our concern to the manager, he did not handle it well at all. No wonder his team serviced just as poorly as himself. Most of the dishes from the 9 courses tasting menu were over-sauced. I like my food simple with one flavor focus. It was trying too hard to impress while forgetting that good food is prepared by bringing out its best flavor. The one thing I was impressed with was the fried salmon skin appetizer which was perfection. If you goof curiosity, I would suggest sticking to ordering your few favorite foods and get a feel of the restaurant's likeliness as opposed to trying their elaborate tasting menus which leaves your taste buds confused due to flavor overdose. I don't know why this is a top 5 for many but it is now my 5 worst. To quote our dinner companion, it surely was a "forgettable $200/each person night" we'd all like to put behind us.

What else can I say that hasn't been said already?  The place was amazing! Came here for my 30th birthday dinner and we all got the tasting menu with wine pairing and added the foie gras ravioli.  Everything was amazing from the presentation, variety, creativity, plating, taste, amuse bouche....I could go on forever.   The wine pairings were good, but I've had better (pairings, that is). This is definitely a place for a special night out.   And we even had a celebrity siting, Jason Segal at the next table.

My boyfriend and I opted for the a la carte menu, because we weren't sure if we can finish the chef's 5 course pre fixe menu which was i think 95/person there was also wine pairings available which we skipped on.  Honestly, this was a pricey restaurant! However, the quality of the food was excellent! I really got a kick out of the chef providing complimentary tasting of 3 items, when our server presented us with the plate we questioned him because we didn't recall ordering it. IT WAS FREAKING GOOD! I have no idea what they were called cause they weren't on the menu, but there was like minced salmon and roe on top of crispy fish skin (which we initially thought was a cracker), this really yummy chowder, and this little cream puff. For appetizers we had half a dozen of oysters, foie gras ravioli -- and dig this, they split the platter for you so you don't have to figure out how much a person gets at the table. the FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI was SUUUUUPER! it was rich and lathered with truffle oil and it was so good i didn't take a picture of it haha. For entrees, I had the salmon that was wrapped in prosciutto, which was actually part of the pre fixe chef's menu, but our server was able to ask the chef to make it as an a la cart order for me and mentioned that I will be the only one that night to receive it that way. My bf had the red snapper fish, it was good too! What i liked about our entrees was, that the fish tasted like meat! No gross smell, or lack of flavor! There wasn't a dessert menu, but again, they gave complimentary raspberry maccaron, vanilla jelly cube, and this peanut butter/jalapeno candy. Delicious! I had a nice experience there and really enjoyed dinner and their staff is great  :)

Providence, I love you. I feel comfortable saying yay!!! as good as it gets!!! For me, this is the best fine dining experience I've ever had. Elegant without being pretentious, I'm just so thoroughly pleased with every meal I've had here. I had been with my parents twice before, but the real kicker was my birthday dinner. With my family and friends, we enjoyed a 7 course menu in the private back room. This is definitely NOT the only way to enjoy providence - come in for just an appetizer and dessert, and you'll walk away shell-shocked. The incredible manager let me choose two options for every course, and agreed to do a separate, 7 course vegetarian menu for one of my girlfriends. The manager worked to make it so incredibly special, with champagne to start and wine pairings for every course. (Obviously, this didn't come cheap. Lucky for me, my pops gritted his teeth but smiled through it all. Providence is definitely expensive, but with a three course meal for two, you won't break the bank.) You have to be smart about ordering at Providence. Some things are just WAY, WAY better than others. Cimarusti is clearly known for his seafood prowess, but some of his meat dishes are just off the hook! Even the amuse bouche is powerful. Smaller dishes: MAINE LOBSTER with GINGER CREME FRAICHE: my god. cimarusti's dishes are complicated, but come together just beautifully. i need to taste this bad boy again. JAPANESE KANPACHI: the kanpachi was heavenly. he kept it simple with this one and let the kanpachi shine. a soy creme fraiche added a beautiful touch, and was so f-ing creative. SANTA BARBARA SEA URCHIN: my favorite of the evening. a must-eat for sure. FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI: I was surprisingly not a fan. I felt like the foie got lost somewhere in there. (the foie gras saute is a different story.) SEA SCALLOPS: with japanese eggplant and rhubarb??!? so creative, so incredibly delicious. another must-try. you won't have anything like it anywhere else. WILD STRIPED BASS: came highly recommended, and with crispy pork belly! I could've gone without it, though.   DUCK BREAST: surprisingly, michael cimarusti, the seafood man, gave me THE BEST DUCK that i've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth. blood orange confit put a little twist on the classic duck l'orange, and just far exceeded my expectations. the CHEESE PLATE: when you request a cheese plate, they come around with a cart just heaped with every cheese you could imagine. they give you a very personalized experience, asking about your tastes - what you like and dislike, and every suggestion was so on point. I love a good set of accoutrements to go with my cheese, and the crystallized honey, quince paste, and gorgeous apricots made this plate exceptional. And now, the thing I can still taste on my lips, and dream about when I go to sleep at night... PASSION FRUIT-MANGO GELEE with litchi sorbet and in a white chocolate coconut milk. WTF?! It's everything I could possibly want in one place!! So tropical and refreshing, it was divine. Just plain awesome. The pastry chef is really special. The decor is beautiful, elegant and modern. I prefer the patio to the main dining room - a little more casual out there. This is by far the best fine dining in LA, and blows places like Melisse out of the water.

This place USED to have two Michelin Stars back in 2009.  USED to.  They don't anymore.  The Michelin Guide decided that they would no longer rate restaurants in LA because the food here is generally not as good as anywhere else in the country, despite what many Angelino self-described "foodies" think.   I came here to have a go at the chef's special tasting menu with wine pairing.  Before I comment on the food, I would like to stress that in a supposed Michelin Star restaurant, the servers ought to be seen and not heard, and seen very little for that matter.  They should appear from nowhere to give you your food or take away the empty plates.  They should not be loitering in the hallway, having arguments in front of customers, or looking as if they don't want to be there.  Most of the cause for the 3-star rating rests on the shoulders of the exceptionally horrific service and unprofessional waitstaff.  Arguing with one another in front of guests?  Really??  Two different servers coming up at different times to explain one dish?  Really??  Get it together, people!   So back to the food.  It was fine.  My favorite dish was the squid and chorizo on a stick.  Very flavorful.  We also had the mojito/screwdriver, abalone, a tomato "soup," "crackers," tuna tartar, rabbit terrine, prawn, pasta with truffle shavings, wagyu beef, and the ganache dessert.  That with the wine pairing ended up being close to $500 for two.   Providence experiments a bit with molecular gastronomy, but doesn't quite pull it off as well as Bazaar (at the SLS Hotel) does.   The mojito/screwdriver was an example of how molecular gastronomy can go wrong.  It shouldn't be on the menu if the result isn't perfect every time.  The abalone lacked any flavor, but was cooked well enough.  The tomato "soup" was nothing at all special and could have been made from a can.  The crackers' internal components were muddled by too much actual cracker.  The tartar was fine, but I've had much better elsewhere (at Boulevard in SF).  The terrine was as you would expect and not that interesting.  One prawn on top of a shell...  Who comes up with this stuff?  Truffle pasta was good and subtle.  The beef was unremarkable in flavor but perfectly cooked.  The ganache looked like feces on the plate, and was too sweet.   As for the wines, there were a few that matched quite well with the given items, but generally speaking the sommelier didn't know what he was doing.  A wine should complement the dish rather than stand on its own, which most of the wines did.   I will likely not go back.  Simply not worth the price of admission.  3 stars.

This review is a little overdue, but it's never too late to give Providence the recognition it deserves! I definitely had one of the best dining experiences, ever. We got the 5-course Tasting Menu and an order of Oysters as the appetizer. The oysters were really fresh. They came with a consomme that was really interesting. It reminded me a little of fish sauce-- it was slightly acidic and had a kick to it. We were served amuse bouche "drinks": a screwdriver and a mojito. They each came on a spoon. Solid, jelly-like on the outside, but it bursts in your mouth. I don't know how they do it.. Molecular gastronomy? Magic? Who knows, but it was a fun way to start the meal, and I could taste the alcohol. :) The Tasting Menu included Japanese Kanpachi, Scallops, Halibut, Veal Tenderloin, and Green Tea Sponge Cake. The first two courses were my favorite. I absolutely loved how light the kanpachi was, and the crispy soba was such an interesting/nice touch. The scallops were cooked perfectly. They were really fresh and went well with the pesto and potato puree. The other courses were delicious as well, but it's hard to remember the details because I was in a hazy food coma after the third dish haha. I didn't expect to love the green tea sponge cake as much as I did. It had a strong tea flavor from the matcha powder, and the dehydrated chocolate was a delicious pairing. We also received a complimentary dessert dish with the cutest little macaron. Overall, I was beyond impressed by the food and service at Providence. It almost seemed like the staff outnumbered the patrons because they're on top of their service. They clear your plates right when you put your fork down after your last bite, and the water in your glass is never less than half full at all times. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable as well-- just top notch overall. Providence is definitely the perfect spot to celebrate a special occasion, or just to enjoy a yummy tasting menu if you have the money to blow. :)

For our last night in the LA area, my fiancee and I came here for dinner. We made a reservation ahead of time, so there was no trouble getting a seat. That said, it does fill up - so don't expect to walk in and get a table. It was a bit unfortunate that we had to wait about 5 minutes after we got there for a table, but otherwise, getting seated was a cinch. Service was pretty standard for a high-end restaurant, but I did appreciate the fact that they had a selection of craft beers. A lot of high-end restaurants simply eschew it for wine and cocktails, but to see a very nice selection here made me a fan right at the beginning. The food itself was delicious, with a definite tilt towards the sea when it comes to the tasting menu. Everything was well done, but I would say the highlight was the meat dish on the menu - the veal was extremely tender and juicy and almost melted in my mouth. I was also a big fan of the kampachi sashimi...very fresh and well-cut as well. I forget the fish entrees right off, but they were good and fresh as well (I do remember one was the wild salmon). You also get a live scallop, which I am not sure is actually alive(?), but it's decently sized and cooked just right - not overseared, but not undercooked either. For the cheese selection, our waiter made very good selections. The blue cheese he picked out was extremely good - better than most blue cheeses that I've had at other places. The uni in the eggshell was great as well - interestingly almost similar to how Melisse served their poached egg caviar the night before. Both places had very fresh uni that was pretty much sushi quality. That said, I give Providence 4 stars because I wasn't blown away by the flavors as much as I have elsewhere. All of the food is delicious, but some of it wasn't as memorable. In particular, I feel like for a place that clearly identifies seafood as its specialty, it wasn't as delicious or as memorable as something comparable (like Le Bernardin in NYC). That said, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's looking for classy place to have dinner, whether for a special occasion or just a date with a special someone. It is a delicious 2-3 hour experience (if you do the tasting menu) that you won't regret! And for a place that has a definite Asian fusion bent to the cuisine, it doesn't overdo it with bold and gaudy flavors like other fusion restaurants I've been to, which is greatly appreciated.

We were excited to finally try Providence for our 3rd year anniversary. And woohoot, hubby & I decided on the 15 course meal plus wine pairing. Keep in mind folks, it's ALOT of booze and sadly we only made it to Course 13. The wine pairings went exceptionally well with almost all the dishes, EXCEPT for one of which I agreed..  The mild fish was very subtle but the wine pairing had a strong acidic bite to it..   My husband decided to tell our sommelier his opinion b/c he thought it would be appreciated. Well, it wasn't..  The friendly sommelier suddenly became rather unfriendly..  C'mon, he was just being honest.. Onto the food. It was alot of courses...  But very small portions..  I'm talking tiny almost. My favorites of the night were: Abalone skewer:  literally half a bite, but tender, chewy and smokin good. 15 courses of this would have made me happy! Bacon bread & Sourdough:  Stuffed myself silly with the bread..  Sourdough could compete with the best in SF (imho!) Cheese platter:  ate it at home, the next day..  Course #14 had to be packaged up.. Other than that, I really can't say the rest of the meal was an out of body experience or anything..  After spending $275/person, the meal didn't WOW me and TRUST, I wanted to be wowed...   The service was good and everyone was very attentive.. Great date place but be sure to bring plenty of benjamins!!

A perfect little spot on melrose off of cole avenue!  My bff took me here for the best birthday dinner ever!  The food presentation was out of this world & the service complimented the perfect dining experience.  As if it couldn't get any better, they personalized our menus with my name and happy birthday at the top...how special did I feel that night! This fine dining establishment blew me away with their array of amuse bouches to set the tone...and when our 5 course meals took center stage, it was a standing ovation everytime! A hidden little spot in the heart of LA just got a new patron for life.

I took my husband here for his birthday and had the full tasting menu. Providence definitely lived up to my expectations as it was one of the best meals I ever had! The service was just OK... the servers didn't seem too enthusiastic about explaining the dishes.  They all spoke super fast, only one (out of 3-4 servers) smiled, and one of them actually trailed off at the end of his explanations numerous times, so I didn't get to hear what the dish was. Good thing the food made up for unfriendly waiters. Here are some highlights: Nori Bread - YUMM (hubby preferred the Bacon Brioche) Frozen Mojito and Jelly Orange Cocktail as a palette cleanser - the frozen mojito was so refreshing and the jelly orange burst in my mouth releasing a delightful orange juice Japanese Kanpachi - absolutely perfect combo with the pickled cucumber and tiny taro balls Santa Barbara Uni in an egg shell - one of my favorite of the night!!! Decadent and delicious Pan-seared Scallop - Good..  But my husband's scallop had a pebble in it.  I hate when that happens!  The crunchy bread crumbs the scallop rested on help mask the fact though. Halibut - one of the best halibuts I've ever had.  It had a little Mexican influence as it was served on top of something similar to salsa and had hint of cajunesque seasoning on top. Wrapped Salmon - this was the disappointing dish of the night. Whatever it was wrapped in tasted like it was fried in too much butter.  The salmon was slightly seared, but the breading around it was too overpowering.  The dish was too heavy and made me full. Veal - OMG.. the veal was cooked to perfection and sliced through my (butter) knife like BUTTER.  It seriously melted in my mouth and I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I was full. Cheeses - we let our server pick the cheese for us.  Big mistake.. We asked for milder cheeses he gave us this weird pungent blue cheese-like goat's milk one that didn't taste so nice.  The others tasted more like sharp cheddar which went very well with the fig spread and bread. Cucumber Mint Sorbet in Melon soup - another palette cleanser, but it SO refreshing and DELICIOUS, I almost asked for seconds.  I'm surprised at just HOW  much I enjoyed the palette cleansers. :) Dessert was a salty sweet sorbet and a vanilla sorbet (?) served with Matsumoto peaches. At first, I think my mouth was confused trying to comprehend the flavors but then it started making sense and I was enjoying every bite more and more. They brought out little strawberry macarons and jellies at the end. Perfect way to end the meal. Overall, it was worth every penny spent, and Providence deserves its 2 Michelin Stars.

I really enjoyed my experience at Providence. I was very excited about coming here for the first time and decided to make it even more special on my fiance and I's 8 year anniversary. We both knew already before coming that we were going to get the full tasting menu of 9 courses. We didn't care what was on it but knew from the reviews here on Yelp that we'd be missing out if we didn't get it. From the very start the service was great. The restaurant was practically empty at the 6:30 reservation time we had made. It did start to fill up rather quickly after we were seated though. The main waiter we had was very knowledgeable of all the food and wine and could describe to us all the characteristics of each and what we could expect when we eat/drink it. My fiance also noticed there was a Veal course on the tasting menu we ordered. She doesn't eat Veal so they prepared a great salmon dish in it's place. All the wine pairing were also spot on with each dish My favorite things of the night were the bacon brioche they serve before and during the meal. I also enjoyed the Furikake (seaweed) bread as well. My favorite dish of the evening was the egg dish with sea urchin. It was so rich and flavorful. It left me wanting to eat just that dish the rest of the night. Every dish was expertly prepared but not everything impressed me as I thought it would. Some dishes almost seemed over-thought and the flavors would get lost in the dish from the use of too many techniques or ingredients. Overall it was a great meal. However if I came back here I would probably order A La Carte. I felt myself wanting more meat and less seafood on the tasting menu. I love seafood but I got bored halfway through the tasting. The ambiance is higher end but also understated. It has a darker dining room which is the norm in LA but did have enough lighting to actually be able to see your food and the person sitting across from you. I thought the murals on the wall were original but also brought the ambiance down to a more casual feel. This might have been their intention however. The bill came out to $550 for two with a 20% tip. Not bad really for such a large tasting menu with wine pairing. However I was hoping they would live up to their 2 Michelin star rating from a few years back. I would say they are more of a single star restaurant now.

Providence fucking brought it! Period. Everything was amazing from start to end. Worst part, not having 4 hours to kill for the chef's tasting menu. Full tasting menu was a great substitute. They also accommodated us, removing all pork from the menu. That attention to detail and service make us Providence loyalists.

Although everything is consistently good here, but the uni/spot prawn/scallop is outstandingly extraordinary. Simply put, all of the other dishes turned pale compared to the Santa Barbara Uni, doer smooth and creamy, with not even a hint of the unpleasant pungent aftertaste found in even the highest quality I had at Japan. Who knows the best uni is just right next door!!

Great service this time around. We had the nine course tasting menu with wine pairing. It was a lonnnnggg night but well worth it. We had a number of amuse bouche prior to our courses which was very awakening to our palates. Some kind of mojito shot gelee, and other unique molecular gastronomy items. Course 1: kanpachi with munak ranch celebrity tomato, australian finger lime, red onion, crispy buckweat. Course 2: santa barbara sea urchin hiding beneath soft scrambled eggs - Both our favorites - Wow, exquisite! Course 3: bobby's block island scallops, pickled apples, smoked celery root puree, serano ham - this was my second favorite Course 4: wild alaskan halibut - weiser farms butterball potatoes, scallion oil, romesco - I've never had potatoes that were this good. Course 5: Tasman sea trout (more like salmon), brentwood corn, pork belly, maitake mushrooms - corn was so sweet. Course 6: marcho farms veal tenderloin, roasted sweet scarlet grapes, fennel, saskatchewan chanterelles market cheese - I love the cheese cart, but we were so full we had to take this to go. cucumber mint frozen yogurt - very refreshing pear and cranberries, almond cake, olive oil, burrata ice cream - hhhmm..not my favorites, maybe because we were just way too full. What an exquisite evening dining here this time around...

Providence's 2 michelin stars knock the pants off of some same rated restaurants in NYC! Pretty far down Melrose in an interesting location, not what you typically expect for such a great restaurant. But hey, there's street parking! I can use this saved money on valet/tip for another drink =) Did the 5 course tasting menu and added on some raw oysters. Simply 1 of the best meals I've ever had and the price to justify for it. 2 courses of amuse-bouche! whoa! and they were amazing! These mini cocktails in the form of a frozen mimosa and screwdriver in a spoon. So delish and I can ever taste the alcohol - perfect start! Every course was simply amazing - the salad, scallops, salmon, veal, dessert - almost licked the plate for all of them.  This is a seafood restaurant in the end but for certain the salmon is by far the star - best piece of fish eeever. Dessert was this salt and pepper ice cream (all their flavors are interesting) which I really enjoyed, but I think overall that's a love or hate thing. Even the coffee... so thick and flavorful and comes in your own french press. We had to ask and they get their brazilian empanema coffee from LA mill. No milk or sugar needed (and I generally load that coffee up...) Bless my luck and I was able to come back again a few weeks later and man did I still enjoy every second of it. Only if I had an unlimited budget, I would come here once a week.

Its very hard for me where to begin: I came here for Tasting Table's Dinner Tales, which highlighted the "best dishes" from past and  present. The experience was very very memorable. I loved the wine and food pairings. i feel like i've never had it right until I came here. I started out with appetizers blue crab cakes with sirracha mayo, and these little potato poppers, and what appeared to be bottomless champagne. We then all migrated to the dining room, where we all had place cards and sat at 2 large tables- a great opportunity to mingle with other foodies. They sat us down and served us 2 cocktails on spoons: one was a screwdriver in a gelatin casing and a frozen mojito.  We also had bread: choice of bacon brioche,  focaccia bread, and sourdough. The menu was as such and hey also had wine pairings: Santa Barbara Sea Urchin:  in a small egg cooked with egg white and some bacon bits, it masked the briny salty flavor of the sea urchin which I'm usually not a fan of. I don't like bacon, but the flavor did enhance the dish in a good way for me. Did I mention it was served in a little egg shell? Very cute presentation. Maine Lobster: cooked in between beets cooked 2 ways steamed, and in agar/gelatin. I don't usually like beets, but the delicate flavor complimentary the sweetness of the lobster. What took this dish to another level and made it the most memorable was the wine pairing- a Rose wine that seemed to bring the sweetness out of the tenderly cooked lobster. It was magic I will never forget. Japanese Sword Squid with dehydrated olives We were supposed to have Wild black sea bass, but because nature was unpredictable, we got wild blackish: it was sweet and tender. Chocolate-Whiskey panna cotta with coconut milk encased in such a way I was able to break it and let it flow out and mix. It was nothing more than amazing. Then we were served Petit fours with tea (or coffee). Service was amazing, the staff was very friendly, and the ambiance was great. The food was complex and the flavors were delicate. They really showed me that they truly had bragging rights and why people tell me they really are the best of the best. Now, if only I had the money to go there once a week, I would do the drive just to eat here.

For the past 6 years, Providence has been my greatest desire as a food destination in LA. What once started out as an idea that was lost in the wind the moment it was given breath, finally came to realization. Due to the nature of this desire, I had come to accept the fact that this meal wasn't going to be as perfect as the image I had conceived in my head. I was somehow lucky enough to score a weekend reservation at 7:30, but we still waited 30 minutes until we were seated. There were only about 20 tables in the restaurant area, and I was absolutely thankful for this, since the tables were spaced very well, allowing for a very intimate meal and perfectly audible conversation with normal voice level. I had already decided beforehand to get the full tasting menu, so I busied myself with the wine novel, hopelessly looking for a chardonnay that met my date's "a little sweet, but not too dry" request. Our waiter immediately sent for the sommelier, who knew of one with those exact characteristics. Once our order was in, a server came by with the bread basket, and finally the famous bacon bread. I also decided to try the seaweed bread, which was interesting, although I didn't particularly like it. The bacon bread was just as I had hoped though, warm and fluffy, with just the right amount of bacon flavor baked into the bread and also filled with bacon bits. I must have had 5 pieces of this throughout the course of the night. They gave us sea salt with the bread, and I figured it wouldn't hurt to try and sprinkle a little on the bacon bread, and it somehow managed to enhance the flavor. Try it and thank me later. Soon we were brought a series of amuse bouches, starting with the mojito gelee and screwdriver egg-yolk sphere thing. We were in agreement that the mojito was the better of the two. Then came the roasted sunchoke soup, which was by far the best soup I've ever had, and I'm normally not a fan of sunchokes. Next up was a salmon mousse with crispy salmon skin and a fresh gougere. The salmon was well thought out, with the crispy skin to give the right amount of contrast in texture. I wish this was one of the main courses so we could have gotten more. The gougere tasted exactly like a Cheez-It. Not entirely a bad thing. At this point in the meal, with the way everything leading up to the main courses were executed, I was ready to have my mind blown. The first main course, Japanese Kampachi, did precisely just that. It was served with plum sauce and creme fraiche with crispy rice on top. I love yellowtail, and this was the best yellowtail dish I've ever had. Again I was amazed at how every element of the dish had a purpose, and eating everything together created a sensation that would have otherwise been lost if the components had been eaten separately (I tried, trust me). After that came the sea urchin served in a hollowed out egg shell. As I was talking about how impressive the perfectly circular cut on the egg was, my date took her first bite and was overcome with an expression that basically told me to "just shut up and try it." And that's the story of how I came to love uni. That dish was so good I wanted to shatter the perfect egg capsule they made and lick the insides. Luckily they took it away before I could. Next up were the scallops, by far the largest and also most perfectly cooked scallops I have ever had. I didn't like how the blood orange flavor was overpowering in this dish, but that was forgiven since the scallop was so amazing. Have you ever had a scallop melt in your mouth like a good steak?? It's life-changing. Sadly the next 3 dishes were a bit of a let down, but that may have been my fault since the previous dishes were the best I've ever had of that kind of main ingredient. Simply put, the salmon, striped bass, and veal just weren't the best of those I've had. Actually, I take that back. It's the restaurant's fault for leading me to believe they would be the best. Shame on you, Providence. Shame on you. Don't get me wrong, they were still very good dishes, just not as memorable as the ones before. The cheese course (the first cheese course I've ever had in my life) ended up being one of my favorite courses of the night since it was fun, and different. We just took the recommendations of the server, and everything turned out well. A palette cleanser of jicama and rasberry was served before the final dessert course of triple chocolate cake, which I wasn't a fan of since I don't like chocolate. We were also given some petit fours, of which the peppered caramel was the most interesting. At the end of it all, Providence was the best meal I've ever had in my life. You'll hear people say that it's the best restaurant in LA, etc. My advice is to curb your expectations and don't let the hype predispose you. While not every single dish was amazing, the overall experience was. Yes, it's expensive, but for a true lover of food, Providence is a must.

Best. Place. Ever. No joke. Worth the couple hundred dollar per person costs. Had the pleasure of being taken here for my birthday a couple of months ago :) Service: Perfect. There was not a moment where my drinks were not full, not a moment where there was an extra plate on the table. Extremely kind and professional waiter/hosts/etc. The food was all mouth watering food.... my taste buds tasted flavors I didn't know existed. The Prawns were prepared table side, and you could smell the rosemary from afar, arguably the best prawns I've ever had in my entire life. Scallops were Fing amazing. No joke. BUTTTT the Halibut was better! Dessert.... I live Dessert... it was...different here to say the least The SALT and PEPPER ice cream was unique for sure...had a strong aftertastes. I liked it...but..not enough to want to get it often...would love to have it once a year or so Since it was my bday, they gave me a box of chocolates! which were AMAZING. so many different flavors in each piece! Would love to come back here again one day..

Fabulous overall.  You pay for what you get.  If you got your eye on Providence, it's likely because you've eaten just about everything else out there.  You're looking for a culinary adventure.  And if you haven't, you'll want to experience everything first, because then you'll truly appreciate what Providence has to offer.   Even as I write this, the tastes and flavors of the night still linger in my mouth, embedded into my mind.   As expected of a double Michelin starred restaurant, everything is upscale. Dimly lit, subtle but classy.  Even the guests that come in and out are upscale.  I guess you'd have to be, to afford to eat here.   And perhaps you'll laugh at me for getting giddy over silverware.  To feel the handle of the fork, the butter knife in your hands... I was in awe like a chimp, marveling at such an exquisite alien tool.   The breads alone are baked perfectly.  They come to you warm.  The options for the night were bacon brioche, nori foccaccia, and sourdough.  My favorite was the bacon, which was fragrant, and tender.  Let the butter thaw at room temperature so it's more easily spreadable.  There's also a small bowl of rock salt, although I never really saw a reason for it. You can go a la carte, or with sets of tasting menus.  If you want the extensive 16-course chef's menu (quite appropriately an all night affair), you have to come in before 8:00 PM.  And when you do tasting menus, they urge everyone at the table to do the same course.  And for those adverse to alcohol, it isn't so for wine pairings. I won't go into too much detail about the different courses I had, since there's plenty of good reviews.   Due to the nature of the courses, most of my wine pairings were whites.  Trout, halibut, diver scallops, kanpachi, shrimp.  I'm honestly not a big fan of white wines, and I'm not that versed either.  But I actually quite enjoyed what was paired.  Just know that everything is soft, or flaky, tender, so easy to eat.  The flavors are elegant, yet harmonious.  Between the residual flavor of the whites, and the dishes served, the scents and tastes continue in our mouth like an endless waltz.  Deliciously artistic gastronomy. The veal tenderloin, cooked sous vide, is probably the first veal dish I genuinely liked.  It is so soft, cuts easily the dull silverware.  I won't say it's as delicious as say, a wagyu or dry-aged rib eye... at least not the meat itself.  The accompaniments are not just garnishes.  Everything is purposeful in creating intricate complimentary flavor. And just reveled in the tempranillo-based Rioja that paired with it. Thank goodness, finally a red wine!  I'm sure I looked nutsoid, swishing it and admiring it's color against the lights.  Taking in the aromatic bouquet.  The residual flavor is addictive.   It should be noted, the waitstaff is attentive and constantly on stand by.  There is always someone to top off your water.  Breadman makes rounds between the courses served.  Plates and silverware are replaced with each tasting.  Hell, my friend stepped out to use the restaurant, and one of the staff came by the chair to re-fold the napkin. Unnecessary, but cool! At some point, I'm gonna have to make a point of coming to the dessert tasting menu. Yes! They have a multiple course centered around desserts~!  Though what was served for this night is salt and pepper ice cream, with what looked to be sticks of fudge, with a splashes of raspberry coulis.  The yuzu macaron is vibrant, bursting with yuzu's natural taste, and the texture of the macaron itself is just spot on disintegrates on your tongue.  The pepper in the ice cream adds a spiced aroma, the touch of salt contrasts for sweetness.  I just wish the saltiness didn't carry over into the fudge, which itself is tastes light, but feels thick.   The glass of port that went with dessert, it is still impressed upon me.  I love the amount of sweetness, but the essence of it feels alive.  It tingles and dances on the palate, as if aged with tablets of curiously strong Altoids to impart that minty, aromatic quality.  Luscious, and the perfect end for me on this particular meal.   And be patient with the restrooms.  Nice design, but they're for one-use-at a time.  Hand lotion is available, just like at an upmarket hotel.   Is it the best food of my life?  I can't say that.  There aren't any specific dishes where I found myself smiling silently like a grinning idiot.  I did have an overall feeling of happiness and joy.  It's an experience, and I'll definitely be back.

Save your money, Go to another upscale yummy place, service was average. I had better service at Morton's and better dishes at Spago, etc. We went here because we heard of the Michellin Star and due to the high ratings on yelp. Overall, we wanted a supper yummy meal. We ordered the Special Course Menu for $185 a person. Do not confuse this with the regular 5, 7, and 9 course. 1.We had all 3 bread in the beginning-bacon, french roll, and the seaweed nori. They were good but not enough for me to want seconds. 2.Then came the cocktails-screwdriver in a bubble and a gelatin square. Very interesting and good. Not that good to come back for it. 3.Then came abalone and calamari on skewers. The abalone was not fresh, very fishy. No taste, wouldn't order this at all. 4.Fennel soup, mozzarella basil bubble soup, quiche like tarts (3 dif. ones). deep fried seaweed rice cracker and deep fried salmon skin. The tart like quiches were not good. Deep fried stuff was yummy but what deep fried stuff isn't? Soups were ok. ****Start of Special Menu*** 5. Scallop, geoduck, abalone? in cherry tomotaoes and tiny cucumbers? It was good but not yummy good. For the price and the amount, I would not come back here. I am a geoduck and abalone eater, and had better at other places. 6. Tuna Tartare with egg. It was ok. They brought toast along with it. 7. Grilled Shrimp. It was Fresh and cooked just right. Now, we are talking about yummy BUT the sauce was a flop. 8. Risotto with white truffle or pasta. YAY, they have fresh truffle that they grate over your dish! White truffle is cheaper than black. The truffle is what made the dish. The pasta and risotto were good but didn't have any other flavor to it and it shouldn't if it is paired with truffle. 9.Australian Waygu Beef. SkIP IT. Filet mignons are better than this. I have been to Japan to eat the actual Waygu beef and nothing compares. My cubes were stringy and it was a bit tough. It was cooked in a sous vie so that was a plus. You can get that at French Laundry. 10. Chocolate gnache. It was average. 11. Chocolate marshmallow, macaroon, ginger gelatin square- Macaroon was a solid yummy but the other two were ok. SOOOOO, it was a disappointment. I felt like I had been taken. The price does not reflect the food. They had a lot of wait staff and the presentation was a solid 5 but the taste was a 2-3. They are suppose to scrape the table when there are food debris which they didn't.  I had to ask them to refil my water one time. The cocktail drinks are solid and good, so they have a good bartender.

providence did not disappoint. our table ordered the 5 course tasting menu for $75 (special June promotion - usually $100 pp) take advantage of it! such a good deal -kompachi: fresh sashimi flown in from japan. delicious and perfect way to start the meal -scallop: scallion sauce, dehydrated blood orange, fava beans. the sauce was flavorful and amazing. the scallop is on the rawer side, which i thought was an interesting way to prepare the dish. soo good -FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI: by far the best dish of the night. our server said this is the only menu item that's been continuously on the providence menu for 7 years. and it'll be GONE come july :'(((((((( the pasta texture was unique, the sauce was amazing, and the foie gras was buttery and perfect -veal loin: the. tenderest. veal i've ever. had -manjari chocolate cake with espresso sorbet: super rich but omg what a delectable dessert. I had extremely high expectations for this place, and Providence lived up to the hype. great service, beautiful interior, wonderful meal

Truly is as good as it gets in LA. Crazy inventive amuse-bouches (gelatinized gin and tonic?!?!).  The grilled octopus lollipops and wagyu beef filet pretty much ensured that this was a life changing dining experience. Chef's menu with the wine pairing is definitely the way to go and completely worth the splurge.  A fantastic way to celebrate my 5 year anniversary and now my favorite restaurant on the planet.

I am a Chef and have worked at the French Laundry.  I brought my daughter to eat here a few weeks ago for her thirteenth birthday. I live in San Luis Obispo and I promised my daughter a two Michelin star dinner but everything in the Bay area with two stars is closed on Monday.  Therefore I drove her 3.5 hours south to dine at Providence.  I am not a fan of the LA food scene as I have dined in NYC, the SF Bay and have been a Chef in one, two and three Michelin star restaurants.  The LA scene just doesn't do it for me.  Providence was very worth the journey and impressed the hell out of me. We each ordered the 6 course market menu.  Remarkably delicious.  The presentation and execution was suagne and totally on point.  My daughter and I felt special and were excited with each delivery to our table. The service was also spectacular.  Unintrusive and they anticipate your wants quite well.  I met the owner and Matre ' D, Donato. Very nice man. He gave my daughter and I a tour of the kitchen and let us watch service. The Chefs know what they are doing back there for sure. The bill came out to $364 before tip and without wine.  I had no problem with the check whatsoever and would travel another 3.5 hours and spend the same money to eat there again. I have no complaints other than for some of the clientele I saw come in there.  I knew I was in LA when I saw people coming into this fine establishment wearing Jeans and Shorts. WTF people? Just because you have some cash, doesn't mean you have class.  The table next to us was a bunch of D Bags just bragging about business and their money (as they were all in jeans). Very tacky. That's the difference I guess between LA & the Bay, I suppose. But this is something tangible and the demographic is not in Providence's control. I would recommend Jackets be required for gentlemen, and shorts/jeans not be permitted. But thats just me. Bravo and Graci Chef Michael and Signori Donato. Chef Michael Reyes

Did the 5 course testing menu here. A friend of mine told me that it might not be enough to fill me up so load up on the bread. Boy was I wrong to listen to him. I mean yes the bread was delicious but I loaded up on wayyyy tooo much bread. By the time my veal came out I felt soo sick I almost vomited all over the table. LOL But of course I didnt. Dinner plus 2 glasses of wine and coffee was almost $300 for a party of 2. You bet your ass I ate everything!!!!!!!!!!!! Definitely a great place for any special occassions.

4.5 stars. For our 4 year anniversary, my boyfriend surprised me with a full course tasting at Providence. I hadn't heard too much detail about it before, but I was aware that it was a very highly celebrated location for fine dining in Los Angeles. With that in mind, I had very high expectations for this restaurant... Our experience overall was nothing short of wonderful. The restaurant is beautiful and service was delightful. A bouquet of fresh flowers even awaited my arrival at our reserved tabled (ordered, of course, by my amazing beau!) The meal consisted of the following: I. Amuse Bouche: These items were so amazingly creative. I'd never tried anything like them in my life. We were served a Mint Mojito Gelee (pretty much a mojito in the form of a rectangular jelly), a screwdrive bubble (pretty much orange juice + vodka served in the consistency of an isolated egg yolk), a gougere cheese puff, and a deelicious parsnip soup with port reduction served in a shot glass. All were definitely amusing to my palette. II. Bacon brioche: They offer you an assortment, but this was honestly the only memorable of the bunch. It's quite possible the BEST bread I've ever had in my life. III. Japanese Kanpachi: Served sashimi style. A light delicious start to the course. IV. Santa Barbara sea urchin: I'd never had uni before. This was good, but I'm not sure that it made me an avid lover of sea urchin. V. Nancy's scallops: Cooked to perfection. Perhaps my favorite dish of the entire course. VI. Wild striped bass: A very interesting dish.  The spices in this fish gave it a flavor that I felt was very different from the other courses. The fish was tender and cooked well, but I'm not sure that I loved it. VII. Wild king salmon: Another sashimi style dish. The fried fish skin was a nice touch. VIII. Veal tenderloin: The veal was cooked very well, and was good, but not amazing. I enjoyed the black truffles in the dish though. IX. Market Cheeses: Served to you directly from a cheese cart. The cheese server was so helpful and knowledgeable about the cheeses. We tried a wide assortment --some we liked, some not so much (and I'm pretty open to trying different cheeses.) X. Lemongrass granita with sake jelly: Palette cleanser. So different. Not everyone might like this, but it's definitely refreshing. XI. Dessert: Chipotle chocolate marshmellow and thai gelee: interesting. As I said, the meal was delicious and the experience was wonderful. Was it the best meal I've ever had? Sadly, no. I can't exactly pinpoint what it was, but there was something lackluster about this meal for me, although menu was creative and quality was definitely superb.  I base this off of the fact that no dish was quite memorable to me.  I'd like to give Providence another chance to wow me someday though. 4.5 stars!

This is one of only three restaurants rated with 2 Michelin stars for dining.  As a reference point, I've been to Spago, another 2 star, and had a much better experience at Providence. Restaurants like this are a haven if you're a demanding guest, as I can be, especially when paying top dollar.  The service is professional and elegant.  Never absent, never crowding, and unlike other snobby places, up front about their pricing e.g. market prices, wine prices, etc.  The staff is a bit on the inexperienced side, but make a good effort. The sommelier paid us a visit and offered us tastes of several different wine choices after we discussed our preferred characteristics.  His choices were spot on.  The wine list here is probably the most impressive I've seen, spanning every notable wine region world wide. The food was fantastic.  I would describe the chef's style as elegant and refined.  The dishes are nicely focused, often incorporating distinct, sometimes unlikely elements that come together in interesting and novel ways.  You will have a blast trying to describe the food with your company.   My appetizer of grilled squid with white asparagus was mind blowing!  The freshness of the seafood overall is unreal.  Outside of Spain, this is some of the freshest seafood I've ever tasted. The menu presents ample choices that can easily suit any craving.  It's nicely balanced and regionally broad.  My duck, served with turnips and radish, was distinctly German, yet the John Dory fish preparation seemed Caribbean inspired.  Japanese influence is prominent.   Added to this, the ambiance is quaint, casual, and unpretentious.  The design throughout is impeccable.   For most dining in L.A., emphasis seems to harp on atmosphere or overplayed themes.   Providence certainly stands out in a city where the cuisine is rarely inventive.

Wow...what a tasting menu...the wine pairing was exceptional. Added bonus, we had the Chef's table... If you are going to spend this type of money (over $200 per person) and it's a special occasion plan ahead and reserve the Chef's table and get the Chef's menu with wine pairing... Now, mind you, I like crazy, funky, fusion, exciting food...this isn't it.  The food isn't trendy or on the edge of the next big thing.  This is food before Anthony Bourdain and Jose Andres.  What it is is refined French-style cooking methods done well. Worth repeating, repeating, repeating...

My daughter and I dined at Providence tonight and we had an amazing dinner.  This consisted of a 9 course meal but with amuse bouche, it ended to being about 12.  We were very full at the end of dinner and definitely worth every penny we spent! We had the Tasting Menu which consisted of the following dishes: * mojito, screwdriver The mojito was a gelee and definitely tasted just like the drink, the screwdriver was just ok as we couldn't really taste the vodka. *crackers a. smoked trout b. basil, mozzarella, tomato c. nori and salmon skin (wine pairing: crémant de bourgogne blanc de blanc, domaine parigot & richard m.v.) of the 4 crackers, the best one is the smokd trout, very tasty and definitely the one bite is not enough but a good teaser on what to expect next on the menu. *kanpachi munak ranch celebrity tomato, australian finger lime, onions and crispy buckwheat (wine pairing: txakolina, xarmant arabaco 2010) The meat was as expected firm and taste very fresh. the lime was subtle and definitely allows the fish to stand out. *santa barbara sea urchin hiding beneath soft scrambled eggs (wine pairing: crémant de bourgogne, "prestige" moingeon m.v.) This was presented in an egg shell and was to die for. I think this was the best dish of the evening. *bobby's block sea scallops smoked celery root purée, jamon serrano, pickled apple (wine pairing: riesling kabinett trocken, "al alba vincero" gerhard 2009) This dish was my 2nd favorite.  Scallop was so fresh and the serrano ham penetrated through the scallop that it made it taste smoky.                     *wild alaskan halibut (sitka) * weiser farms butterball potatoes, scallion oil, romesco (wine pairing: rosé, "majoli" tenute sella 2010)                         *tasman sea trout quince, vadouvan, turnip, pork belly spatburgunder,  louis guntrum 2005 *marcho farms veal tenderloin (franconia, pa) * roasted sweet scarlet grapes, fennel, chanterelles (wine pairing: plavic mali, "peljesac", dingac 2009) market cheeses vin de pays de l'hérault red, "cuvée des colosses," baptiste cuvelier 2008 cucumber-mint frozen yogurt melon soup pear & cranberries *almond cake, olive oil, burrata ice cream sainte-croix-du-mont, château la rame 2005 'til the next beefoodie adventure!

Overall it was a good experience. The quality of the food is great but it's not very creative. Solid restaurant but definitely not the best I've been to. None of the dishes stand out too much except the uni in the egg. Presentation that's been done and done again at many other restaurants. Foie gras with peaches. Quality of the foie gras was good. Quality is better than Animal's foie gras but not as good as Gary Danko's foie gras. Just talking about the quality of the foie gras itself.

What we ordered: The Chef's Menu. The cost: $600 for 2. The boyfriend also had the wine pairing while I had one cocktail. The drinks: The wine pairing was excellent! The wine improved the food and the food improved the wine. If you enjoy wine I suggest that you shell out the extra money for the pairing. The food: Good but for a few of the courses it seemed the focus was on molecular gastronomy. But some of the courses left my SO and I wanting more and practically begging our server to bring out extras. The desserts were amazing and I wish I hadn't been so full in order to better enjoy the sweets. How long it took: 3 hours. Dress code: This is LA, anything goes from business suits to jeans and a t-shirt. That being said... Ladies would probably feel comfortable in heels and nice dress/top. Gentlemen slacks and a button up would be best. Parking: Although valet is offered why pay for it when you can park for free on Cole Ave next to the restaurant, literally next to where the valets have you drop off your car. Tips: - Schedule 3 hours to enjoy the food at a leisurely pace if the chefs menu is your thing. -The five course menu (which the couple next to us got) is probably a better option because it seems to cut straight to the heart of the matter (good food) instead of having extra courses to demonstrate the chef's ability to do amazing things with food. - The comparison will be made to Gary Danko. Gary Danko is by far superior as they seem to recognize that food is made to be eaten and not contorted. I as much as the next person enjoy the creativity that is put into food some of the courses felt like the taste wasn't as important as what the presentation. For the $600 we would have rather grabbed a couple of southwest tickets up to San Francisco and had dinner at Danko. - This place although good is definitely over hyped.

One of the most memorable dining experiences! Everything about this restaurant is superb- the decor, ambiance, friendly service, and the FOOD. My boyfriend took me here to celebrate my 25th birthday, and boy was this a treat!  We went for the full tasting menu.  The presentation of the food was remarkable- even too pretty to eat!  Of course, we took millions of pictures of our food before digging in.  Each dish had unique flavors and surprises in texture and taste.  I was amazed at how certain ingredients blended so well together.   The amuse bouches were a pleasant surprise and also very creative. This is a classy, modern, and stylish restaurant.  They even kept with the holiday spirit by placing a Christmas tree in the front.   One thing that is important to me is service.  Everyone was friendly and the atmosphere was not stuffy.  Our servers also explained to us in detail what we were eating and we were not rushed.   It was almost a year ago that we visited, yet the whole experience still remains fresh to my memory.  It was, and is, well worth the money.

Going to providence we had a lot of high expectations. We weren't let down. The chef sent out some complimentary appetizers which were fun and different. We started with the dirty bunch which was a mixture of shellfish uncooked. I honestly liked this dish out of everything we had. Then the quail egg came out. It tastes like butter...mmmm Next we did the steak which was good but not amazing. The staff was very attentive and the restaurant had a nice ambiance. A very cool experience. I would like to try the chef tasting menu next time, it might this place 5 stars .

Came here for my BD with my man. Cute and elegant interior. We chose to go for the ala carte.   He ordered the Chowda and the steak. I had foie gras sauté and lobster. 3choices of bread were good.  I liked their sourdough while he liked the seaweed focaccia. Each piece was small so being hungry, we managed not to overeat before our entrees came (which happens from time to time).  I even liked that they bring the traditional unsalted butter along with a little bowl of salt so while he enjoyed his bread with unsalted butter, I enjoyed mine with the salted. Muse was ok. Chowda was good and the steak was excellent according to him. Foie gras was great with the fruity sauce. Lobster was good but I wasn't wowed. Creme freche for dessert was good.  Coffee was rich and creamy - excellent. Petite Four was cutely presented in a box. Food presentation was beautiful for all dishes. Great service.  People were attentive, knowledgeful, and nice.  It seemed we didn't have to get OUR server, but could ask ANY server for questions and requests. The bill was expectantly expensive and not surprisingly expensive.  It was rather reasonable considering their atmosphere, presentation and quality of food, and the service. I should come back to try their course menu.

I went to Providence for a celebration dinner with my boyfriend.  I love great food, great wine, and beautiful atmospheres; at Providence I thought that I would get all of those things wrapped in one well-buttered package.  Not so much. It's not that the food wasn't good, it was... just good, not mind-blowingly-delicious.  The wine list was well rounded, and we had a beautiful Zin.  The atmosphere looked pretty, but we were seated next to four howling young girls who were getting more and more drunk by the minute. I know I sound like an old fogie but I really wanted to enjoy my meal in a peaceful, relaxing space.  Having girls at the next table doing shots and yelling back and forth with slight screeching sounds intermittent wasn't my idea of a good time.  And, my big complaint is:  Providence, DO SOMETHING!  Seat them at a table away from the middle of the dining room, ask them to lower their voices (I promise it wouldn't be the first time). Again, the food was good-ish, wine list was excellent.  The service was slow and neglectful.  I think that if I ever go back I'll sit at the bar instead.   Hi-Ya!  Take that you underaged minions!!!

I've been to the location that Providence now presides when it was Le Saint Germain & Patina which qualifies me to be a superannuated witness to the vast culinary changes in LA since the 1970's.  Providence is a high quality  restaurant with a hushed, almost reverential atmosphere as though it's a temple of haute cuisine, which it is. The 5X5 CHEF'S COLLABORATIVE DINNER followed the usual paradigm throughout dinner, but at the conclusion of the dinner,  we were briefly invited to visit the kitchen, to give homage to the participating chefs.  That was when the magic began. It was truly interesting to see the Chefs in action and uplifting to be able to interact with the very people who actualized the food courses presented to us during dinner. (Sorry to get in the way while you guys were slinging the "hash", but also glad to be able to connect the food to the chef which made the evening memorable.) 1)  Since Providence is Michael Cimarusti's restaurant, he had all the resources right there so plating was amazingly complex.  A hollowed out egg was blown out and rested on a large river rock & was filled with a Uni emulsion in  egg yolk.  You had to sip the Umami, sea scented, minerality of the Uni that was enriched by an egg yolk sauce through a straw. Crispy salmon skin chips were placed in a stone toast rack to be dipped into a pink puree made from smoked salmon. A nasturtium leaf "taco" on a polished natural wood branch dais contained chopped up scallop ceviche mixed with a bit of Japanese steamed rice & nasturtium flower. This "Sushi" harks back to a type of Sushi wrapped in Japanese persimmon leaf, but the nasturtium leaf is totally edible & adds a wasabi-like bite & green herbal aroma.  A prosecco infused with orange zest was paired. 2)  Blue Crab Jelly, Coconut & Rice Milk Ice, Tomato Pickle, Ice Plant:  A white coconut/rice "soil" which was soft & airy, ice plant that was slightly briny with crispness, tomato with a bit of gastric, with a bottom layer of jelly with what was probably a herbed egg white sauce and crab meat.  Stirring the entire mixture up blurred the taste of the individual ingredients into an alternate universe version of the Crab Louie. By Chef Voltaggio.  An exquisite Junmai Daiginjo  Sake called Bon, Nihon no Tsubasa in Japanese, but Americanized to "Born", Wings of Japan was rich, dense in body with slight anise, Hinoki wood barrel, Kinako or sweet, roasted powdered soybean flavors. 3)  Twice Shucked Peas with Yellow Pea Shoots, White Chocolate, "Chocolate" Mint, Macadamia in a Consomme:  This is the best "raw food cuisine" I have ever had....no exaggeration. Eating fresh, raw peas initially is sweet, but continuing to eat them brings out a slightly bitter, raw green flavor that gets old quickly. Addition of white chocolate, mitigates the bitterness.  Chocolate mint is raw and is refreshing but also reflects the flavors in  white chocolate.  The consomme is more like an infusion of pea pods, and comes off delicate & slightly sweet. All the ingredients complemented each other, & this gestalt became greater than its parts. This was an expertly nuanced exercise in freshness and IKI.  By Chef Fox.   An unusual Champagne was presented in that it was MultiVintage whereby Krug champagnes from different vintage years were blended together to create a rich, almost sherry or cognac-like complexity full of oak & slight oxidation. 4)  Ravioli al Nero di Seppia:  black squid ink ravioli filled with crab dressed with a sauce of "hedgehog of the sea" in Italian or Uni. The orange-red color of the sea mineral rich uni contrasted with the dark black of the ravioli.  By Chef Angelini.  A Pouilly-Fume from the Loire Valley made from Sauvignon Blanc was full of minerality, astringent with citrus undertones. 5)  Spanish Mackerel, Chorizo, Marinated Firefly Squid, Pickled Jingle Bell Peppers, Fennel Cucumbers, Extra Virgin Olive Oil Jam:  The mackerel was grilled with a thin layer of brioche.  An added ingredient was finely chopped dried black olives with an intense earthy olive/bitter flavor to act as a contrast to the oily, rich gamy mackerel.  By Chef Herrmann.  A  Rose, Chateau Simone 2011 from Roussillon, was dark, strong with strawberry, cranberry flavours with good acidity to cut through the strong fish taste of the mackerel. 6)  Dry Aged Lamb Loin and Zucchini Flower Stuffed with Braised Shank, Santa Rita Hill Porcini, Green Almonds, Lamb Jus:  A small square of grilled lamb with a layer of sweet fat.  The gamy shank was braised in a meat reduction red wine sauce.  Porcini was lightly braised in possibly sage broth.  This was a good medley of strong tasting foods appropriate for the end of the meal.  By Chef Citrin.  A Syrah from, of all places, Ventura County called Sine Qua Non or "what is absolutely necessary" was deep dark, purplish red, fruit forward with ripe blackberries, black  plums, dark  plums, dark cherries with bit of leather, smoky, dark chocolate.

The food was like a dream. The textures blew my mind, and the flavors mesmerizing.  It changed my perspective on fine dining and my concept on what culinary arts were. Innovation, creativity, and great quality. The service was splendid. The cheese cart put my taste bud's world upside down. I have been to many 1 and 2 Michelin Star restaurants from Napa, San Francisco, to Las Vegas. So far, NONE have surpassed Providence. I plan on coming back very soon. Love you guys, never change.

This was by FAR one of the BEST meals I've had in LA: We were promptly seated and began right away with cocktails. HOLY S... those drinks were effing strong. I had a "pina y pina" and I instantly got a good buzz goin, weird bitter after taste though... I wouldn't recommend it. OF COURSE we had to have the tasting menu.  Portions were small like most high end places....but don't let that fool you!  I was STUFFED and couldn't even finish everything.  Not to mention we thoroughly enjoyed the entire bottle of our favorite wine...hehe Service was excellent, we were always checked up on and surprisingly they didn't charge for corkage.  Now on to the food. First off, the seaweed bread was interesting, I liked it, but stopped myself from the usual second serving of bread to save room for the 9 course menu. I unfortunately can't remember the descriptions of each dish but here are some highlights: ABSOLUTELY LOVED the plates with: -salmon skin -uni in the egg shell -pork belly -scallops -cheese plate -the macaroons are to DIE for....mmmmmm Wasn't too much of a fan for: -veal (personal preference...just don't like the taste/thought of eating veal) -guava sauce (that was too overpowering for...i think it was the sea bass?) We were one of the last parties still dining but it was a GREAT dining experience.  I would DEFINITELY come back here and would recommend!  We were seated near the enclosed patio area but the heaters were on and it stayed warm for the most part, so no complaints there. All of our servers were courteous and friendly and made sure we were taken care of.  Can't wait to come back for this phenomenal food!

4.75 stars... Had the full tasting menu like all except for one dish was just OK, maybe I was getting full or the flow of the flavor didn't go with this dish in the order?  But seafood it can be very particular in many ways and margin of error is very little from very great tasting to just good and not "wow". Even the freshness of the item itself is plays the most factor, hence the range of ups and down of reviews lately. Also the cost of the food for some people plays a big big factory in the expectations be high, Anyhow, like everyone had said food is tastes great, looks beautiful, service is excellent, all those combine is the reason they were awarded 2 Michelin Star and remember that was in 2009 now, which I first visiting this place.

I've been dying to try Providence for quite awile and was so happy to finally have an occasion to come dine here. I have to admit that it was very very good but I was a tad underwhelmed by some of the dishes, which rarely happens to me at a michelin starred restaurant. The service started out fabulous but seemed to go downhill as the evening got later and they got busier. I'm used to the service being impeccable at restaurants of this caliber and I'd have to say it wasn't. I was with two friends, one of whom was a vegetarian, and since they require you all do the same menu we were forced to order ala carte-- which was actually fine as the tasting menu had a few items I was less than thriled about and they didn't offer upgrades or choice selections. All the food was very good but the standouts were the fois gras ravioli -- served in a browned butter sauce that was a perfect compliment to the rich fois gras. The lobster was also very well prepared and flavorful but nothing spectacular. They also had this fabulous seaweed bread and bacon bread that is a MUST try. I also tried the rissotto w/the black truffle mushrooms- they offered your choice of pasta as an accompaniment to the truffles. It was tasty but seemed somewhat too basic w/just risotto and truffles... needed something else and for $70 I found it underwhelming. My friend ordered the seared fois gras and I tried a bit and have to say it wasn't cooked exactly right... almost maybe a tad overcooked, if that's possible. Regardless, it didn't compare to the seared fois gras I had earlier in the month at Joel Robuchon. For dessert we ordered the chocolate ganache and the tropical pannacotta. The chocolate was okay but very very bitter. I like dark chocolate w/a high cacao content but this was too bitter. The pannacotta was served IN a bowl.. not inverted and was kind of difficult to eat. It was also a HUGE portion of pannacotta which overwhelmed the accompanying fruit. Neither of the desserts were really a hit for us and I'd pass on them next time. If you want something sweet they have some very good drinks.. the pear martini and the strawberry drink were very tasty and might squash the sweet tooth anyways. All in all it was a very good meal and the restaurant is lovely but I was really hoping this was gonna be a five star experience and it just wasn't quite there.

I am one of those rare bay area natives that actually likes LA (your weather and beaches kick our asses), but one thing we def do better in SF is fine dining.  If this place were in San Francisco, I bet it'd net about 3 to 3.5 stars. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not 4.5 stars with almost 1000 reviews good.  I ordered a la carte and the stand out dishes were the foie gras ravioli, the bread, and the dessert.  I was somewhat underwhelmed by my entree as well as the bite of my dinnermate's entree (the John Dory).  I realize I just said that approx 80% of my dinner was great, but when the entree is just kinda okay, it kinda dampens the meal.  There wasn't anything special about the bass, it wasn't terrible but it also wasn't terribly good.   The service wasn't that hot either.  I think it's a two way tie between SF and LA for world's douchiest service in restaurants.  Everyone seemed to be on auto-pilot and it took forever to get our check.  Also, the hostess kept coming and going to the area behind our table, which happened to be the emergency exit, and squatting down and fiddling with something.  It was distracting as hell.   LA-your casual dining scene is phenomenal (hello Pizzeria Mozza), but your fine dining still has a ways to go.

Been eyeing this place for awhile, finally to celebrate my gf passing her bar exam we came here for a group dinner of 4 girls. Super cute elegant, classy decor. Sat at the bar while waited for our table, took about 5 mins or so. Appetizers we got the oysters and maine lobster.. Entrees, sea bass, steaks and halibut.. all delicious! not heavy just perfect. Didn't leave there feeling gross. We brought our own wine, had 2 bottles of red. Corkage fee is 30 per bottle. Great night over all with great convos and catchup with friends. Def coming back to try the tasting menu with wine pairing!

I have to say I was disappointed! I went there on Feb but just have a chance to review this restaurant. From yelp reviews and per friends that went there, I have to admit that I had a very high expectation for this restaurant. First impression on the atmosphere and the greeting were really impressive. My fiancé and I selected the 5 course tasting menu and 2 additional dishes, spot prawns and truffle pasta. Mojito was great but after the second plate, everything gets boring. After the third dish, we look at each other and tried to count how many left to finish the course. We never experienced this type of situation where we can't wait for the last plate.  The prawns were too dry. The scallop and the veal were bland and desserts was so so. For the truffle pasta, I'm not a big fan of truffle but my fiancé said it was good. Overall I would say, great place for a date but pricey because I think there are other places with same atmosphere with great food but lower price out there.  We ended up spending $300+ and came home very disappointed.

Best restaurant I've been to in Los Angeles. With 1000+ reviews, there isn't anything new I can say here. I don't mean to be a Bay Area food snob, but I've found that generally, the nice restaurants in LA do not compare to the nice restaurants in the Bay Area, even at the same price points. However, I was pleasantly surpised by my meal at Providence. I enjoyed it much more than some of the two Michelin Star restaurants up in SF, like Coi. One of my best friends generously treated us and we ordered off the a la carte menu. The portion sizes were surpringly large and we completely over-ordered. My favorite was the charcoal grilled wild french turbot, which was AMAZING. I'm only sorry that we ate it last, as I couldn't enjoy it as much on an already full stomach. The decor is a little distracting, I find. But, then, I prefer simple decor when eating as to not distract me while I'm inhaling my meal.

I am one lucky, lucky girl and one of my best friends treated me out here when he was in town. We did the 9 course taster with wine pairing and it was easily one of the best meals I've ever had. Each dish was carefully crafted and each bite of every dish was delectably flavorful. The meal was quite expensive though. My friend hinted that the total bill was over $600 after tax, tip and the 2 additional cocktails we got. He told me recently that even after eating at some of the top restaurants in the Bay, this was still the best meal he's had. I guess it was worth the price then. :)

The food and service was incredibly wonderful! Enjoyed their tasting dinner with wine pairing. Exceptional food quality, incredible attention to detail, fantastic presentation, delightful sensory explosions... Foie Gras Ravioli with truffle was the best of entire night. It melt in your mouth!! The only thing I would complaint: We had a lot of private partied there, but the bills was a little bit off two out of three. We had to go through each items and adjust, especially the wine. But if you only go with small party, then you should be fine.

5 stars!! Long story short: Considering how long I have been talking about coming here, there's no other way I wanted to spend my 30th birthday dinner than at the Chef's table. Long story long: It was my 30th birthday.  As a chef and the foodie I am, I wanted to go big and go out to one of this countries' best restaurants, but since a trip up to Napa Valley and getting a reservation at French Laundry being near impossible unlikely, nor a trip to New York to go to places such as Le Bernadin, Per Se, or Eleven Madison Park, I knew I had to stick to LA. Actually, for a couple of years, Felicia C and I have been talking about going to Providence, and even though she just recently moved to New York for a job and I had first decided when I turned 29 that I will be going to Providence for my 30th birthday, that wasn't going to stop me from fulfilling a life long dream.  Yes, this has been a dream.  Also, not only was I planning on coming here for my birthday, I was planning on reserving the Chef's table.  Yes, that's how I roll. A month before my birthday, I called to make my reservation.  I originally wanted to make it for a Sunday, but I was told Chef Cimarusti was not in on Sundays, so I opted for a Friday.  I specifically asked for the Chef's table and immediately he told me it required a reservation of 4-6 people, and that they highly recommended the party partake in the 14 course Chef's tasting menu at $175 per person, $270 with wine pairing.  I made a reservation for 4.  Yes, that's how I roll. Upon driving up, I could feel the exciting percolating from within.  It was almost like having an awesome dream come true.  Wait... it IS an awesome dreaming coming true. My party and I were lead immediately to the Chef's table, which is its own little room with a full view of the kitchen, only separated by floor to ceiling glass door. Now, for the sake of the unfortunate 5000 character limit here on Yelp, I will only provide some highlights. - Everything was beautifully presented.  Most of if was near perfect, but I will say there were a couple of things here and there that I didn't like, but overall a near perfect meal. - Meal included scallops, chorizo, minimal molecular gastronomy, slow cooked eggs, konpachi, crispy salmon skin, foie gras, pork belly, American Wagyu, lots of seasonal vegetables, chocolate and a whole lot of other stuff. - Service was impeccable.  Everybody treated us almost like we were royalty, or at least thats what I felt like, haha - They have a live spot prawn tank!  Just like at Asian markets!!! - Watching the kitchen run like clockwork was inspiring. - Chef Cimarusti is a master of his craft and a really nice guy.  I looked up to him before and I continue to look up to him. - When all was said and done, 18 courses of food in 4  1/2-5 hours. I couldn't have imagined celebrating my birthday any other way: in the company of good friends, sharing perfectly crafted food from a Chef that I aspire to be like and look up to.  I would definitely come back for maybe the 5 course menu, etc.  Definitely would take a date here or my future wife here, haha

Providence has two (2) Michelin stars that shine brighter than the others, but Yelp's rating system can't relate their brilliance. Prepare to enjoy excellent fish preparations, attentive service, and inspiring decor - all components of a beautiful evening out. We ordered the five course tasting menu and requested one add-on of salt roasted Santa Barbara prawn. Spoiler alert! I'm going to walk you through our tasting menu, so don't read on if you wish to preserve the mystery. *Spherification of Screwdriver paired with Mojito Ice *Sous-vide prepared shrimp, gruyere cheese bread, shot of carrot Ginger soup with shellfish broth *Live Santa Barbara Prawns quick roasted under salt and extravagantly prepared and filleted table side (highly recommended add-on especially if you want to impress your guests and those around you. *Seared diver scallop from Belmont, MA *Pan-fried Halibut with a memorable red pepper sauce *Sous-vide Veal Medallion *Dessert - Chocalted Grenache, Macha Grenache, Freeze dried Chocolate Mousse The preparations highlight the flavors of each protein.

The bf took me here for my birthday! It was a memorable time and he thought he ought to make it extra special by treating me out to a nice meal. The waitstaff was definitely helpful in our selections as well as explanation of what was set in front of us. We ordered the full tasting menu which included 9 courses and a surprise little course in the very beginning, some cocktails (small and cutely served in a perfectly cut and drained egg shell). Everything was perfect! I was extremely pleased with the pork belly wrapped salmon. That was by far my favorite dish out of all 9 courses. It sounds so simple and boring but it was amazing! The pork belly was thin and crispy and the salmon was soft and not fishy at all. We were so full that the waitress actually packed our cheese course to go and even gave us a sampling of everything and labeled all the cheeses for us. Impeccable.

I experienced the full course tasting menu and all I have to say is Wow Wow WOOOW! The wow's don't justify how amazing this establishment is. Decor is simple and elegant. Great ambiance. Amazing amazing service and staff. Everyone is so tentative to your every needs. (Almost) every single dish is a work of art. I don't even want to eat it, but how can I resist!!!  You get salty, sweet, rich, nutty, sour, juicy, crunchy...there's so much going on, but each component of each dish meshes so well together. Its a steep price tag, but it is very worth your time and money. The full tasting menu took my party over 2 and a half hours to complete (and we even told them to speed it up!). We were so full at the end. It was ridiculous. So wear those stretchy pants or prepare to unbutton a button. Chef Cimarusti, thank you for creating such a wonderful menu. This is the reason I have so much love for food. I really can't wait to tackle the chef's 15 course menu!

There are many good reasons why Providence has over 1000 reviews from Yelpers everywhere.  This is fine dining at its finest. We opted for the five course tasting menu.  Each little dish was absolutely superb.  The chef here is truly gifted as he understands the careful balance of savory-sweet and texture.  A truly amazing dining experience...! The five course menu offers just little bites, so be forewarned not to come here if you are starving.  Because my husband and I had eaten a huge lunch, we weren't that hungry for dinner and almost canceled our reservation here.  Boy are we glad we decided to go anyway because despite our lack of hunger, each delectable course was perfection.

This is one of my recent favorites from fine dining. We ordered the full course from the menu, and we were so stuffed at the end of the night.  My favorites were, of course, the seafood dishes. The scallops, especially were cooked to perfection. Not stringy at all.  Many of the dishes were quite creative but not strange enough for me to avoid the adventure.   The service was friendly but not out of the ordinary.

First off, excuse my less than satisfactory pictures. It was really dimly lit in the restaurant and with so many patrons I felt bad using flash =(. They were taken mostly to help myself document what I ate, because lord knows in an epic feast such as this, I wasn't going to remember everything that went into my mouth the next day. So ignore my photos, look at the other pretty ones on yelp. My boyfriend took me here last night for our anniversary. I'm spoiled, I know. The restaurant was so tastefully decorated, with decorations along the walls reminiscent of barnacles, as well as coral like votives and in keeping with the coastal theme of the restaurant. Simple elegance. It just gives the feeling of dining in the ocean. My bf suggested the chef's menu, with an order of the raw oysters. Who was I to argue? I'm such a spoiled brat. So here's where the pictures come in handy: We started off with amuse bouche, a frozen mojito gelee and a screwdriver capsule. I absolutely loved the screwdriver. It had a dense, thick consistency when you broke into it that was almost yolk like, and had great flavor! The mojito had a granita consistency in block form. The next was baby abalone, grilled yakitori style. This was followed by a squid and chorizo also done yakitori style, and then a 'seafood smokey', which was a paste of scallop, shrimp, and ramps, molded and smoked on a stick. All three of these were executed well so that you got the grilled, smokey flavor mixed in with the simple flavor of seafood. Next was the raw scallops, layer between leaves that I do not recall the name of, with a potato salad-like quenelle and parmesan crisp. This was absolutely DIVINE. The texture and taste of raw scallops are so simple and clean, I could have 10 more servings of that dish, easily. Next was the kanpachi sashimi, with shiso and smoked soy. Very good, but nothing crazy. We took a break at this point and were served our oysters, which we had requested half kumamoto, half beau soleil. The cocktail sauce consomme was very clean and had good flavor, but I preferred the mignonette. The beau soleil was larger and brinier than the kumamoto, which my boyfriend preferred. I personally liked the kumamoto more, as it was saltier than the beau soleil. Back to the menu, next was the uni, hidden under scrambled eggs and topped with brioche crumbs. Now, I really wish I had used flash for this so you could see the beauty of this presentation. Imagine, if you will, a disc of wood, like they had cut a slice of a tree trunk. On top of that is a 'nest' made of brass, and carefully placed on top is an egg, with the top open. This, was what the everything was placed in. It was recommended that we mix everything to combine all the layers, to get a taste of everything in every bite, and it was an EXCELLENT recommendation. The mix of it all was heaven in every bite. Next was the spot prawn, stuffed with caviar and served with white asparagus. An excellent dish, but not one of my favorites. This was followed by the sweet bread, which was breaded and fried, served with a white creamy sauce that I don't recall the name of. Delicious nonetheless. Next was the unagi, served with green asapagus and sauce. Good, but not the best unagi I've had. Following was the king salmon, which was wrapped in pork belly and fried, but fast enough to still maintain a raw center. SO GOOD. I was seriously starting to get full at this point, so I let my bf have the other half of this dish. I wanted to make it to dessert! But this was Oh-So-Good. The pork belly...omg. A beautiful crisp that just complemented the salmon SO WELL. Next was the American wagyu beef, also very good. The beef, honestly, was not the most marbled I've had. I've had better melt-in-my-mouth meats. But this was still really, REALLY good, and OMG the potatoes! It was smoked somehow where it was like biting into pillows of smoke. The flavor slowly but surely envelops your mouth and it's all you can taste. WOW. This was the end of the savories. I made it! Next was the cheese cart, and I don't remember any of the names of the cheeses that our server selected for us, but they were good. It was followed by grapefruit sorbet on top of fluffy yogurt topped with tarragon. My favorite dessert of the night. The yogurt was Amazing! Next was a mochi cake topped with bosenberry, and soy ice cream. I loved the ice cream, it was like Asian soy milk, not the Americanized soy milk, in flavor. The mochi cake was good too, but not as impressive. The baileys panna cotta with coconut ice cream and salty chocolate cookie crumbs. Rich, decadent, and delicious. Finally, our petit fours consisted of chocolate marshmallow, citron pate de fruit, and strawberry macarons. My favorite of the three has to be the pate de fruit. The flavor and texture was just perfect. Our server had told us it was going to be an epic meal, but I don't think we understood the epicness of it until we ate it all.

I rarely review so when I do it made an impact on my palette.  Like what others said, Providence really does live up to the hype.  My friend took me there to celebrate my birthday last week & we both left extremely full and blown away. Amuse bouche ~ screwdriver and mojito followed by carrot juice w/ passion fruit foam, shrimp skewer and mini gougere. We wound up doing a market menu tasting for $160 per person (6 total tastings including dessert - no wine pairings).  It included the ahi tuna tartare, foie gras, the american wagyu style beef, black winter truffles, and giant prawn followed by whiskey panna cotta.  Throughout the meal we had several chef's compliments of random skewers (I can't remember exactly after all the robust flavors, but they were so good).  In the end, we finished with a french macaron & 2 jelly cubes. I caught of glimpse of the bill after my friend signed.  $460 for the tastings and 2 cocktails.  Ouch.  Worth it?  Totally.  Amazing service was another plus.  It was a wonderful birthday gift =)

Have dined here 4 or 5 times, and really enjoyed each trip.  I've done the chef's menu at the chef's table, which was of course the best, as well as the five-course tasting, and several a la carte trips.  I won't go through these dish-by-dish, although I will say that ordering the spot prawns is a very good idea, and uni anything is great.  The meat/poultry dishes are certainly competent, and in some cases exceptional, but certainly are not the starts of the show.  Stick to seafood for the most part, and you'll leave 100% impressed and satisfied. This is likely the best fine dining spot in Los Angeles, and certainly worth a trip to impress some folks, including yourself.

Had the pleasure of dining here for my birthday and I have to say it was a delightful experience. I can totally see why this restaurant has 2 Michelin stars. The ambiance was nice, the staff was extremely attentive and friendly and last but not least, the food was delish! We decided to order the 5 course tasting and the best of santa barbara as an appetizer. The meal started off with some of their yummy bread. My faves were the seaweed focaccia and bacon cheese bread. Then we had the amuse bouche..screwdriver and mojito followed by carrot juice w/ passion fruit foam, shrimp skewer and mini gougere. I loved the presentation of the screwdriver and mojito. The best of santa barbara consisted of uni with gold flecks, prawn and panna cotta. Uni is one of my fave things to eat so of course I loved this dish. Our five course tasting consisted of konpachi, scallop, halibut, veal and a chocholate dessert. All were very good. My faves were the konpachi and the scallop. Although the courses were quite small, I was pretty stuffed by the time the veal came out. For drinks I had the wonderlust..it was yummy but a bit on the girlie side. I also tried a japanese white ale beer and that was super good. Overall a good dining experience. Total bill was 450 for three people. Pricey but definitely worth a try.

I give Providence my highest recommendation for any occasion. --But more on that later. Ours was the last table to be sat on a rainy Monday evening. Pale accents that evoke both poppies and orchids (others are calling them barnacles) seemingly sprout organically along the frame of the mushroom colored dining room. It's suitably lit both for an elegant atmosphere and for being able to see the spectacular food you will be given. Service feels effortless and warm, creating an environment in which it's very natural to find yourself laughing more freely or conversing with the couple at the table next to you. We had the smoky "chowda" and tuna tartare to start. The chowder was light in viscosity, which was really interesting, though the intense, earthy smokiness of bacon gave it a rich aroma. The tartare was incredibly fresh and bright, and perfectly seasoned. I didn't want to share it at all, but the portion was big enough that I could do so without feeling wistful that I might miss out. Of the bread choices offered, we opted for the bacon rolls first, and I'm so glad we were offered another round because the seaweed focaccia is the best. It reminded me so much of the scraps of spaghetti dough I used to pull out from underneath my mom's hand-crank pasta machine when I was little--chewy and eggy and savory. Sigh! How we happened to decide to eat at Providence--again, more on this to come--involved their offering sweetbreads on the menu we saw online. Sweetbreads are my favorite food. I've had them at some of the best restaurants in the country, and I was thrilled that Providence would be among them. Except sweetbreads weren't on the menu! I would have been very happy with duck or John Dory, of course, but my boyfriend asked our server if, by chance--and of course he understood that it was very unlikely, but it would make his girlfriend happier than they could ever know--there were any sweetbreads in the restaurant to be had. Our server came back. There were. And so I ate four enormous, delicately pan fried sweetbreads, plated with accents of a light cream sauce and an herbal oil, creamy root vegetable puree, and watercress. Some restaurants do so much to add flavor to or mask the texture of sweetbreads, whereas I suspect Providence did a lot that wasn't easily detectable, which really elevated it for me. As I said, sweetbreads were my favorite before Providence, but Providence's have rendered them insurmountable. My boyfriend ordered the foie gras ravioli, which arrived with slices of black truffle on it, and it was the most unctuous, aromatic, and texturally smooth dish I've ever tasted. He could not have been more pleased. Or full, quite frankly. Most people plan a dinner at Providence in advance, to honor a special occasion, and I recommend doing so. But if you happen to suddenly find yourself unemployed one Monday evening and your boyfriend says he's taking you out to dinner anywhere you want, and after a year of curiosity you finally have the chance to eat at Providence, and they probably have sweetbreads on that night's menu, and even if they don't, I also recommend Providence. Sometimes the best nights turn out to be the ones you can't plan.

this place opened up a new world of food for me. the chefs are so creative with their dishes..  you realize that cooking can be a form of art. i had a wasabi marshmallow-- compliments from the chef and i thought.. wasabi? marshmallow..? but DAMN IT WAS GOOD. ...it was peanut-sized but for a good reason. if it were any better, i could've died and gone to food heaven, prancing among spicy green marshmallow fluff... and my poor boyfriend would never be able to see me again. my entire experience consisted of moments like these... when i went back for a second time, i wasn't as mind-blown as the first time -- simply because being mind-blown is a one time thing, ya know..  it was still good.

This was my third visit here. It was Monday, so brought some wine without charging corkage fee. We ordered chef course & tried ordering 4 or 5 dishes from A la carte & Main for me, but the server (Manager?) told me to order only course menu, not from A la carte because they wanted t serve us at the same time. It means both of us had to order same menu.  So, I had to change to Course menu even though I couldn't eat some of them. Some dish couldn't be seen any change at all through 3 years & Foie Gras I got wasn't right. I didn't like it. Appetizer dish like tartar wasn't good. After all, I tried 3 times but didn't enjoy & it wasn't worth $350. I won't come back again

So after reading yelp reviews which claim this place is "ALL THAT", I decided to see for myself. I'll be damned, Providence was AMAZING! We enjoyed the 'experience' with another couple that also left feeling the hype was legit. I was cynical to begin, c'mon, have you read the reviews? But, that changed quick, our waiter was well versed and afforded great explanations on each course, he also helped navigate the somewhat intimidating order process which can be daunting your first time. We all ordered the special for the night, which was an assorted 9-course tasting menu (plus we added an extra sugar course at the end), every single moment of the experience was, for lack of a better word, perfection. All the dishes were impeccably prepared. I could write all day about the food, but GO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF! The presentation of the dishes was beautiful. The attention to detail and respect that each ingredient is given on the plate is remarkable. Providence is without question one of the best, if not THE BEST, restaurants in Los Angeles. If you're looking to treat yourself, this is the place to go. As the reviews indicate, you will also probably pay handsomely to enjoy the experience, but I venture to say it was worth it.

Beautiful restaurant with 2 Michelan stars. Definitely a must try at least once for a fancy dinner or special occasion. Made last minute reservations for 4 people at 930pm on a Friday night. Looked around for street parking, ended up valeting out front for $5. Started off with a few cocktails (would recommend the dorian grey- gin, rosemary, aperol or the Arsenal for those who like bourbon) and bread. LOVED their bread selection-- seaweed focaccia, bacon brioche, and sourdough. Amuse buches were amazing- the first was cocktail bites (total molecular gastronomy) and then the 2nd was carrot soup with passion fruit foam with mini gougere and shrimp. For our meals, 3 of the 4 of us ordered the 5 course tasting menu for $70, and the 4th person (me) ordered the turbot. So before I ordered, I asked the waiter if I had to order the tasting menu also because there were courses with shellfish and I am allergic. The waiter said, no I dont have to but they could make the shellfish course without it. That didn't sound worth it for me and plus I dont like i when everyone at the table gets the same thing, so I opted out since he said it was ok. Apparently you aren't supposed to do that at fancy restaurants?? I didn't know. They gave me an empty plate so I could share with every course which was nice, but also made a few comments which was awkward. The tasting menu was actually a better deal though, so note- get the tasting menu! Even if you are allergic. :-)

I took my bf here for his birthday - as well as to enjoy our one last foie gras meal before the CA ban and requested something extra special (nice table, etc.) for his birthday. All he got was a candle on the dessert, which was ok, but I was expecting a little more, as I felt that other restaurants have gone out of their way to make special accommodations in the past. I was looking forward to the tasting menu but was disappointed to see that it was only being served until 9pm. The foi gras ravioli was simply AMAZING! My bf had the softshell crab which was also fantastic as well as my japanese fish! Overall, service was excellent, but kind of slow. Food was A+ and ambiance as very nice. We'll be back for our next special occasion.

I went here for my birthday and I liked it.  I ordered saute foie gras, the ugly bunch, John Dory fish, soft shell crab, creme fraise and banana custard for dessert. Everything tasted really fresh, cooked perfect with nice presentation.  The favor is slightly on the bland side but still good. I've been spoiled with good food from SF and Napa, so I'm a little picky. My favorite dish for the night was the saute foie gras.  We had to wait 10-15 mins for the table even with reservation but other than that the service was great. Our waiter is very informative and attentive.  We would come back to try other dishes next time.

Try having a 9 course meal at a fancy restaurant sitting next to a music rapper and a wannabe dancer from the hood. It goes something like this... The menu: 1. Yellow fin tuna, blood orange, green onion. "Sir, for the first course we have - - - "DAMN, GIRL! YOU LOOKING FLY, OH, WAIT! MOTHER FUCKER! I'M GEETING A  MOTHA FUCKIN TEXT ON MY MOBILE FROM MY EXEC...GOT TA TAKE IT...DAMN THAT BOY HAS MY BACK! See gurl, this is how I do business. Watch and learn gurl, watch and learn." Am I making this up? Um, no. And with that our waiter puts our first course down. It's going to be a loooong night. Yeah, it only gets better as the people (Rappers? Ghetto execs?) next to us get WINE PAIRINGS with every course and get LOUDER as the night progresses. How many courses did we sit through? Let me say I learned an AWFUL F*KING lot of about the ultra self important music exec/thug's private life including his baby's mommy and how he does business. If you think it's a silly act on TV, ha ha, think again. 2. Nancy's scallops with squash, shitake mushroom and black truffle. 3. Razor clam risotto, parsley, preserved meyer lemon. The dancer  to the waiter: "We have an expensive line of clothing we produce. Who does your uniforms? -----?"  The music exec/thug says "Hell no, he's just a waiter, he can't afford that. His pants are Old Navy right?  Waiter: "No, this is DKNY." The exec thug: "Nah. He can't afford that. I look at Linden G. He did NOT JUST SAY THAT, RIGHT? Yes, he did. 4. True cod, artichokes, basil, spring onions, courgette. They're drinking and turn on their speaker phone on the cell so he can impress her with people he knows. Huh? 5. Arctic char, shimeji mushrooms, roasted potatoes, cinnamon espuma, mitsuba. I decide to take a picture of the course. I've got an obnoxious flash on the camera. The couple looks over at me and gives me this look, like I've just taken a picture of THEM and I'm going to splatter it all over People magazine!  He starts bragging about how he knows P Diddy and saw him at the Oscars. What am I supposed to do? Say I'm "Elite" and it's good to take pictures? 6. Tenderloin of veal, roasted salsify, petit pois, Himalayan truffle, jus de veau.   Perfection. More heavy drinking from the couple. He's talking loudly, dropping names and I just want to stab my fork into his hand and start a fist fight but I'm holding it in. Thug: "I know ----. He don't know sheet about business but I do. I take care of my people. I knows people. People don't fuck with me because I'm blah, blah, blah." Yeah buddy? Well I am about to fuck with you and I know no one. Did anyone tell you you're in PROVIDENCE? Not Denny's, but an expensive French restaurant. Do I care who your people are? Perhaps they'd like to pay for our meal. 7, Market cheeses with nuts and jams. Need I say more? Well, yes I must. We were absolutely delighting in what they brought. I mean it was magnificent. So we are trying to enjoy this course and I'm playing it cool and the couple has had a few by this time. I'm being polite as hell. But then the sommelier comes over to their table and the dancer says to him, "Take this bread away, I'm done with it."  He doesn't move, he's a sommelier, NOT a bus boy. He shows them the next selection of wine which is port. The exec/thug tastes it and she does too. She says, "I don't like this." So exec says, "Take this back. It doesn't taste FRESH."  How does a $28 glass of port taste UNFRESH? The dancer says AGAIN to the sommelier, "We're done with the bread now, take it away." The sommelier doesn't budge but instead gives her a priceless look of disdain and offers the original selection of wine which the couple accepts because "WE PAID FOR IT." The sommelier leaves the bread there, walks away. Then the exec turns to the dancer and says, "Look how I take you to the best restaurants like Providence. I know what I'm doing." 8. Tangerine and vanilla. This was like a sorbet with creme. The couple at this point is going through their anthology of dating. "Um, who's your baby's mama?" Exec, "Oh she's working in the office. I take care of her now."  She (moving closer to him): "Oh, and do you still got the hookup with her?"  She takes off her blouse revealing a small tank top overflowing with boobage. The waiters are staring, my guy is staring, everybody is staring. 9. Some sort of liquor popsicle. The thug exec puts his phone on speaker again and call everyone he knows. Then he gets off speaker phone. "Do you answer your own calls?" Dancer, "Yeah."  Exec, "No, you DON'T answer your calls. You busy. You BUSY. You don't answer that shit. If you answer, you nobody." 10. Petit fours. They're making out again, but finally get up to leave. If I could have morphed into Joan Rivers on PMS, I would have and then bitch slapped them. @*#&$^! Dinner Impossible. Minus one star and you know why!

TWELVE STEPS TO PROVIDENCE 1. Amuse bouche of gin & tonic gelee, mojito ravioli, and fennel and saffron soup The gin & tonic gelee was a whimsical start to this 12 course tasting menu, marking the beginning of a 4 hour culinary adventure. The mojito "ravioli" gave us a taste of the molecular gastronomy exploration ahead, with the sodium alginate skin bursting to release the mojito inside. And the fennel soup layered over saffron syrup moved us into more savory territory and towards our first course of redemption. We surrendered to the dining experience and: "We admitted we were powerless over food." * 2. Yellowfin tuna sashimi, blood orange reduction and brown rice balls The tartness of the blood orange complemented the yellowfin tuna sashimi, and the crispy brown rice balls added crunch. After often uninspired Asian fusion: "We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves (ie chef Cimarusti) could restore us to sanity." * 3. Scallops, puree of Tahitian squash and shiitake mushrooms These scallops were perfectly cooked. Sweet, succulent and lightly caramelized. At this point we: "Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of Chef." * 4. Razor clam risotto with parsley and preserved Meyer lemon A good risotto, simple with clean flavors, but not my favorite plate. Had I become too picky? We decided to: "Make a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves." * 5. Cod with artichokes, sundried tomatoes and olives This didn't blow me away. I was looking for something more innovative. I had become the critical armchair foodie, expecting perfection and only getting greatness. It was time we: "Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs." * 6. Arctic char, shimeji mushrooms and roasted potatoes in a red wine reduction with cinnamon foam and a crispy salmon skin chip This was the dish I had hoped for. The arctic char was well complemented by the red wine reduction, and the crispy salmon skin chip a playful textural counterpoint. The cinnamon foam was disconcerting on its own, but in combination its sweetness and strong taste worked well. Not what I expected but we: "Were entirely ready to have Chef remove all these defects of character." * 7. Tenderloin of veal, roasted salsify, petit pois, black truffle and jus de veau The veal tenderloin was a revelation. Slow cooked in a 100% humidity steam oven, it retained its moisture and resulted in an incredibly tender piece of meat with only a slightly pink center. After years of eating my meat bloody, I was a changed man and: "Humbly asked Him to remove my shortcomings." * 8. Cheese course We tasted five cheeses, accompanied by an incredibly good fig marmalade, an olive tapenade, candied walnuts and freshly baked raisin bread. The cheeses were excellent. We regretted not ordering cheese more often and: "Made a list of all persons we had harmed (i.e. us) and became willing to make amends to them all (by eating more cheese in the future)" * 9. Tangerine granita and vanilla cream This was a refreshing pre-dessert and the vanilla cream paired surprisingly well with the tart granita. We were both getting full although we were determined to: "Make direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others." * 10. Chocolate cake, fudge and wafer stack, hedgehog mushroom ice cream and caramel I don't like chocolate. After nine courses, I was almost ready to give this course a miss. But I had to taste the mushroom ice cream. It was surprisingly subtle. Despite my misgivings, I finished the plate. Maybe I had been wrong about chocolate. At this point, I: "Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it." * 11. Pineapple jalapeno chocolate lollipop Put the whole lollipop in your mouth and pull out the stick. The chocolate shell breaks to release a jalapeno spiced pineapple juice, sweet with a kick. Playful, whimsical and reminiscent of the mojito ravioli amuse bouche, this dessert brought the menu full circle. We had been blessed by the kitchen and: "Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with Chef, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out." * 12. Chanterelle mushroom caramel, olive oil jelly, and short bread The chanterelle mushroom caramel had a surprisingly strong flavor given the subtle ice cream. The olive oil jelly was like a grownup's gummy bear. And the shortbread was a crumbly end to this meal. We came in with jaded taste buds and challenged chef Cimarusti to excite us. Not only did he excite, but he reawakened our love of fine dining. We walked into the night and: "Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to carry this message to foodies and to practice these principles in all our affairs."

C:  Lets do the 5-course and add the foie gras ravioli and the Santa Barbara sea urchin M: Great Idea, but is that going to be enough food? C: Yup, just trust me on this one.  And we can always order more if you're still hungry. M: OK.  I'll just fill up on some of this seaweed foccacia for now and see how I feel after a few courses C:  The seaweed focaccia is so good.  I think I like it better than the bacon brioche. M: No way! The bacon brioche is the awesome.  Hello it has BACON in it. C: Seriously though you gotta try this one more time... M: (bites into a piece of seaweed focaccia) OK you're right.  The seaweed focaccia is definitely better. (takes another bite) WOW that is delicious! M:  OK I have to admit you're right about this one. C:  Hello, I'm always right -- From beginning to end I can say that I have never had a dining experience quite like Providence.  The food was phenomenal, the service was impeccable, and the experience as a whole was quite delightful.   I am going to keep my review short because words cannot describe flavors, sensations, and feelings that I felt during my time at Providence. It is truly something that you have to experience and there is no better time than now.  Through the end of July, Providence is discounting their 5-course tasting menu and offering it at $65, which is an absolute steal. Now while the 5-course is perfectly portioned and will leave you feeling satisfied, I would also recommend adding the foie gras ravioli as well as the Santa Barbara sea urchin.  Both dishes are absolutely divine and make for the perfect accompaniment to the anniversary tasting menu. Overall I would say that Providence is a perfect place for a night out on the town, and an absolute MUST for any foodie. It's quite pricey ($250 for 2 including tax and tip) but well worth it.  I cannot wait to come back and try the full 14 course menu, so if you're reading this and are interested in a night of gluttonous indulgence shoot me a PM and lets dooooo this!

Dinner was epic.  Full stop.  I got treated to the chef's tasting menu, which required me to use all ten fingers and seven toes to keep track of everything that came out of the kitchen with amazing aplomb and delightful yet unobtrusive attention.  Service was 10 stars.  They know how to treat you like a lady and make one blush something marvelous.  Plus, we had the best seats in the house--chef's table.  I don't know what kind of illegal activity transpired, as you need 4-6 people to sit here, and it was just two that night.  With a view that satisfied the culinary voyeur in me, I was on cloud freakin' nine for four hours. (!!) *Note 1:  We had one wine pairing.  I can't recall the names of the wines, but many times, different flavors emerged or it was simply a case of food and wine doing what it should--creating that sublime and super cool symbiotic/synergistic effect. *Note 2:  I tried to keep my paws off the fabulous warm brioche with baked-in bacon bits.  Tough. 1) Amuse bouche trio - The signature now famous mojito gelee that bursts into your mouth with true mojito flavor, gin and tonic cube that you drizzle with lime juice to get it to fizz like a science experiment, and a mini beer mug of lovely carrot soup.  Awesome, tasty start that made me excited for more culinary fun of the first order. 2) Kanpachi - Accompanied by crispy rice crackers, sitting artfully in a pool of whipped smooth soy creme fraiche, the julienned kanpachi was top-notch with perfect firm texture.  Delicious. 3) Scallop with black truffle and shimeji mushrooms - Great mushrooms and the best scallop I've ever had in my young epicurean lifetime, it was of pristine quality and here's the kicker:  they actually cooked it right.  It wasn't overcooked, which is so often the case, a good sign for sure that the kitchen was in talented, expert hands. 4) Fois gras ravioli - Oh. My. God.  I love fois gras, black truffle, and cheese, so this unison had my eyes rolling, the legacy of which is my now incredibly attractive lazy eye. 5) Halibut with balsamic - With a wonderfully moist texture, again, just perfectly cooked. 6) Turbot - Paired with burdock roots and aromatic shiso, this dish betrayed a distinct Asian influence and had a beautiful balance to it. 7) Salmon with matsutake mushrooms and sake foam - The stop-in-your-tracks brilliant mushrooms outshined the flavorful salmon and crispy skin.  The hints of sake in the sauce were a nice touch. 8) Lobster with shiitake mushrooms - Loved how Chef Cimarusti turned to mushrooms (and truffle) all night to accessorize.  Succulent and juicy lobster with super tender mushrooms.  Definitely memorable. 9) Tenderloin of veal with chantarelles - Accompanied by a celery root puree, the veal was amazingly cooked sous vide.  It truly disintegrated in my mouth and the gorgeous chantarelles performed an aria in their wake.  Outstanding, I was on my feet chanting, "Encore!" 10) The cheese cart - Our cheese expert could not have been sweeter and he supplied us with pungent slices of heaven.  Very nice selection of blues, gorgonzola dolce, goat, brie, raclette, and gruyere paired with jams, candied hazelnuts and walnuts, and dried fruits, including fig which I love, this was a lovely intercession separating the entrees from the desserts. 11) Blood orange sorbet - Nicely tangy and tart, the first of the four desserts of the affair, this served as an ideal palate cleanser. 12) Kalamansi gelee with litchi-shiso sorbet - Marvelously inventive and uber delectable, lychee jelly underpinned shiso-flavored sorbet, both of which sat in a moat of white chocolate coconut soy milk with tapioca pearls.  The different textures (cool sorbet, bouncy jelly, chocolate soup, chewy tapioca) and different flavors simply danced with flair. 13) Basil ice cream with marshmallows and candied pecans - Reminiscent of basil, this was paired with fresh strawberries and a playful mix of housemade marshmallows and candied pecans.  My taste buds were giddy. 14) Milk chocolate panna cotta with Kahlua sauce - I had something similar to this at La Mill, where the menu is, in fact, designed by Cimarusti and Adrian Vasquez (pastry chef at Providence), too.  For whatever reason, it tasted better here.  Panna cotta was accompanied by coconut strands and glazed, toasted almond slices and everything was impeccably embellished by a divine Kahlua syrup. Arriving with the bill was a box of chocolates.  Definitely some of the most fascinating chocolates I've ever tasted, of which include rosemary caramel, raspberry gelee with curry spice, peanut butter cups with sea salt, and white chocolate kalamansi mint. An exceptional dinner experience, I was impressed.  However, I would redecorate.  While the outside takes the classic road with neat lines of lights, weird tortellini-looking attachments are suction-cupped all over the inside walls.  Great airy space, otherwise.  I can't wait to come back!

What kind of an IDIOT goes to one of LA's Michelin 2 star rated premiere high end seafood spots and orders beer with bacon and eggs!?....THAT. would be ME. So, its part deux of my birthday dinner and the wife treats me to a memorable meal for two at Providence.  Street parking is easy to find and the wife teaches me the finer points of parallel parking (another reason I'm an idiot)  We inform the hostess of our reservations and are seated promptly.   Order up the Arsenal cocktail ($15) and it's a delicious blend of Bourbon, blackberries, agave nectar and a passion fruit puree...a lip smackin apertif.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I'm all set to order the tasting menu and sadly the waiter informs us that they require the participation of the table...the wife doesn't  "do the whole fish thing"  she's quite fond of the little mermaid....or was traumatized by it apparently.  So, we order a la carte. Anywho, they practically won me over with the bread alone...a BACON Brioche!  Warm, soft and bacony....yes, indeed.  Next came the Amuse Bouche which consisted of a delicious warm, gruyere filled gougere (the wifes favorite) a wasabi coated marshmallow (nothing special) and a shot glass filled with a terrific combination of sea trout type of sashimi, creme fraiche, trout roe caviar topped with an edible fleck of gold leaf. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… It was excellent...and don't tell my dad I ate a gold leaf or he'll smack me upside my head. Time for BEER, so I snag an Allagash White Ale ($6) that pairs great with my appetizer, the Salt Roasted Santa Barbara Spot Prawns ($33), these 3 little guys are alive literally minutes before they hit your table and are covered in 500 degree rock salt which cooks them whole; all you see are the little antennae poking out from the rock salt.  The server then removes all the salt, precisely butterflies them in half and prepares them with some French Olive Oil and lemon.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… So simple, so perfect...  I was sucking out brains and eating eyeballs having a grand ol time and grossing out the wife. The wife claims this was her first time ordering lobster and gets the Maine Lobster appetizer ($25) with pickled ginger creme fraiche, avocado and basil seeds.  She ate it all up, and didnt even offer me a bite, nuff said. Time for another Allagash, another Bacon Brioche roll AND TIME FOR MORE PORK.  My main course arrives in all its glory, Low on the Hog ($35) and it is Pork Belly Confit, braised pig's trotter, polenta, summer truffles, a beautiful fried egg in the center and frisee.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… It was rich, savory, fatty, crunchy, yolky, salty, crispy, sweet all in ONE DISH.  Wash it all down with the Allagash and I am once again a happy mahfu*kin birthday boy. The wife got the Prime New York Steak (Nebraska) with bacon, aromatics, porcini, duck fat potato and bone marrow. ($49)  Dare I say, i enjoyed it as much as my dish...EXCELLENT! The night ended with Petit Fours http://www.yelp.com/biz_… tasty macaroons, interesting salted caramels with mushroom bits, and these pistachio taffy type squares, not bad.  Also overindulged in the dark chocolate mousse ($12)  with kumquats, ginger and goma ice cream....food overload, but also a delicious dessert. Needless to say....I arrived at Providence, an idiot... and I left...well...A FAT AND HAPPY IDIOT!

You know that commercial, where the couple goes to some fancy Shmancy restaurant and get served bite size courses or a steak which can be eaten in one bite and then they leave that joint to grab a burger or hit AmPm to grab snacks before going home.  Well, this AIN'T that commercial! Yes, small plates but each and every bite is so amazingly perfect.  I can honestly say that I have not experienced a restaurant like this in LA.  I have too many good things to say about this place so lets start with the food. Unfortunately I'm writing this review weeks after.  I can hardly remember what I ate today so my recall may not be the best, but I do remember a few dishes....oh wait, all hail the internet, I found my dishes! First we were given a cocktail appetizer sampler.  A trio of three cocktails all served in little gelatin like bubbles on a spoon.  Not a Jell-O shot mind you, just a gelatin coating that once you ate, popped open with a burst of alcohol.  Ummm...THANK YOU! The mojito was my favorite. Japanese Kanpachi w/ Satsuma tangerine, black olives, piquillo peppers and dry muscat-  Great way to start the dinner off and rivaled any of my favorite sushi spots. Bobby's Block Island Sea Scallops w/ truffle vinaigrette and juliet tomatoes-  The best, let me say that again, the best scallops I have had to this day.  The juliet tomatoes added the perfect tart balance to the deep flavor of the truffle vinaigrette. Tenderloin Veal w/ chanterelles, weiser farms tropedo onion and celery root pupleiades-  Did I say that the scallops where the best I ever had, well so was this veal.  I know I know veal is supposed to be tender but this was on another level. Turbo w/ Shiso and lemon- This was like a heavenly little cloud masquerading as a piece of white fish.   Kumamoto Oysters w/ traditional mignonette, cocktail sauce consommé - Great even though I'm not the biggest fan of oysters Japanese Wagyu Rib Eye w/ bacon-parmesan risotto, porcini mushrooms, pomme fondante and spring onions-  I only got 2 oz of this but by this time I was almost full.  It didnt matter, that was the best two ounces of delicious, tender, perfectly flavored beef.  The risotto was a bit salty but I mean...sheesh, that is my only complaint of the entire meal. Ended with.. Kalamansi gelée w/ white chocolate coconut soy milk soup, litchi-shiso sorbet- Grub!  That is all. So, the food was great, but what about the service?  Well, I cant speak for the rest of the crowd, especially the guy next to me, who was obviously on a first date and wanted to constantly tell his date that he has had better this, better that, better whatever at other places.  It seems that the servers forgot about him but maybe they just over heard him being a dick!  Either way, our servers were amazing.  I remember that I actually got up to go to the bathroom and as I was about to start standing up, someone swooped behind me to bring my chair out.  I was like, "good god damn"  Now that is some service!  Also, the wine sommelier was right on with all his choices.  We didnt do the pairing but I don't think I would have been able to make it out standing if we paired each course with a new glass.   Last but not least, the host took us on a tour of the wine room and Chef's room which was awesome.  I would highly suggest that you try and reserve the Chef's room if you ever have a chance.  You are in a little room which is basically right in the kitchen separated by a glass wall.  You get to see all the masters at work, the masters of my universe for all I care! All in all one of the best dinning experiences of my life although since then, I have been working my ass off to get enough money to pay my credit card bill for that night.  But...it was worth it!

Providence, a seasonal seafood restaurant, is one of only three L.A. restaurants that has received a 2 star michelin rating.  With recognition like that, that's an ideal place for a foodie like me.  It's a place where special occasions are celebrated, and on this particular night the celebration happened to be me and le girlfriend's Anniversary. First off, we were given a choice of three different breads...  sourdough, foccacia, and a bacon roll.  Both of us chose the roll with bacon bits.  Came out hot and buttery - soft and crisp.  I could eat these all night.  Glad I didn't because we ordered the nine course prix fixe dinner. The amuse bouche: mojito gelee, screw driver gelatin bubble, gruyere cheese bread, shooter of parsnip with port reduction in bottom.  These were wonderful palate cleansers.  The mojito and screwdriver were my favorite.  The mojito gelee was oblong and cuboidal in shape.  Clean and citrusy tasting.  The screw driver was in a spherical bubble.  Another refreshing shot.  Bursts of tingly flavor upon mastication.  You're instantly hit with orange vodka. First Course: Japanese Kanpachi (amberjack), crispy rice crackers, lime crème fraîche.  This yellowtail sashimi tastes milder and leaner than hamachi.  The bits of rice crackers added a fantastic crunch.  The lime crème fraîche gave it a refreshing, creamy, and tangy flavor. Second Course: Santa Barbara sea urchin.  Bits of sea urchin that's served in a brown egg shell.  It's swimming in a bath of champagne beurre blanc, herbs and a slow cooked yolk.  It's hard to discern each component.  But when meld together, this dish was rich and buttery.  The yolk and champagne beurre blanc cut out all the brininess of the sea urchin.  This was easily my favorite course of the night.   Third Course: Scallop with brown butter mashed potatoes.  Scallop was perfectly seared...  firm yet tender.  The mashed potatoes were velvety smooth and decadent.   Fourth Course: Wild stripe sea bass w/ a grilled asparagus and sun-choke puree. The bass had a nice pan roasted crust on top.  The filet flaked off into nice tender sheets.  Flaky, meaty and moist.  You could taste the richness and mineraliness of the fish.  Not the prettiest of plating, but it was good never-the-less. Fifth course: Smoked Salmon wrapped in Pork belly.  I thought I would love this dish.  However, it turned out to be my least favorite.  The pork belly was cooked crisp like a fried pork rind.  The Salmon was a bit overcooked... becoming dried out.  Just an unusual combination which didn't work for me. Sixth Course: Veal tenderloin w/ chanterelles & sweet peas: This is the lone meat course of the entire meal.  Veal was tender throughout.  Since veal isn't fatty, the meat was mild.  That mildness worked well with the red curry sauce and the savory chanterelles that were cooked in a wine reduction.  By this time, I had to loosen up a notch on my belt. Seventh Course:  A server pushed out a cart filled with assorted cheeses.  We got to choose three b/w us.  I don't remember which one I had.  Just remember picking out a brie.  They were accompanied with a dried fig, apricot preserves, apple jam, candied walnuts, and rye bread with fig, hazelnut and raisins. Eighth course: Our "pre-dessert" was a lemon granita.  Another nice palate cleanser.  The foamy concoction had just the right amount of tartness to reset our palatte. Ninth course: Green tea w/ chocolate wafers cake and a scoop of ice cream.  It was okay for me.  The bitterness and smokiness of the chocolate paired nicely with the sweet sponge cake and ice cream.  Also a nice contrast in texture too. Finally, Petit fours: A trio of candies to go. We got a salted caramel, a macaron and a fruit jelly.  All tasty in their own right. Other notables:   ~ Wine corkage was $30.  That's very expensive.  Yet, for a fine dining establishment of this caliber to even allow you to bring in your own wine, is highly commendable and rare.   ~ My gf's pear martini was delicious. ~ Service was professional and well polished.  When dealing with a team of people serving you, you don't get that personable attention.  Though we were one of the last ones in the establishments... we never felt hurried.   While there was some slight disappointments, overall it was a memorable experience.  The food is innovative here.  I can see why Providence's creativity led way to two Michelin stars.  Too bad Michelin doesn't stop into Los Angeles anymore.

#500: Dedicated to my wonderfully awesome wife. You're the best, honey!!! For my last birthday, my wife decided to treat me to a dinner at Michael Cimarusti's restaurant, Providence. What. A. Gift. From start to finish, our meal was fantastic. A beautiful dining area coupled with superb service made for a meal I won't soon forget. Since we aren't big drinkers, we weren't sure what to order. Our server suggested that we trust the bartender as he can mix a drink to cater to any palate. As promised, we were in good hands. The wife received a fruit cocktail complete with fresh berries. If it weren't so pricey, we would have ordered several more. I decided to try the "Dark and Stormy" (rum and ginger beer). Mmm-mmm! I could drink these things all day long. After perusing the menu, we finally decided to go all-out and try the chef's menu, but without the wine pairings. Fourteen courses in about four and a half hours was a lot to take in, but I was up to the challenge. The wife? Not so much. Ready? Here we go. Artisan bread: nori focaccia, bacon brioche. Amuse bouche: goat cheese wrapped in hearts of palm, gruyere filled pastry, savory marshmallow rolled in crushed peas, carrot vadouvan (in shot glass). King crab on crispy rice cracker, topped with nasturtium petal and dab of wasabi. Kampachi sashimi: served with endive, coriander flowers, soy creme fraiche, and topped with fried soba noodles. Santa Barbara sea urchin served in a farm fresh egg with champagne beurre blanc, fines herbes, and topped with caviar. Salt-roasted Santa Barbara spot prawns (butterflied table-side and served with French olive oil and lemon). Unagi served with summer truffle, crushed potato, topped with quail egg and frisee. Turbot served with fried burdock, shiso, lemon, and tomato confit. Pork belly with carrot-orange puree, pickled ramps, mizuna, and carrot ginger butter. King salmon belly served with kumquat, peas, junancon, and topped with pea tendrils. Lamb served with eggplant, shishito pepper, and celebrity tomato compote. Since the lamb was the last of the entrees, we knew the end of this fabulous meal was near. Well, not exactly. That's only ten courses thus far... Cheese selection (Hooligan, Sally Jackson, St. Augere, Sofia, and Mount St. Francis) served with figs, walnuts, chutneys, and various breads. Kalamansi gelee, lychee-shiso sorbet, white chocolate coconut soy milk soup, tapioca. Blackberry gelee, melon soup, lime granita, vanilla ice cream, and mint. Harry's strawberries: some of the sweetest strawberries I've tasted, served with a delicious ice cream. Chocolate/peanut butter ganache, chocolate covered pretzels, peanut butter, crushed peanuts, Bailey's ice cream.* Petit fours: Thai curry caramel, Moroccan spiced gelee, chocolate rolled in crushed nuts. In short, everything was excellent. Everything.I really wish I could elaborate on every single dish, but then I'd go over the word limit for this review. Standouts from our meal were the breads, sea urchin, cheeses, and the desserts. Just know that this place is amazing. Make reservations as soon as you finish reading this. Seriously. Well, what are you waiting for?!!! Chef Cimarusti, I applaud you. Thank you for one of the most enjoyable (and filling) meals of my life. I can't wait to return. For photos, click here: http://www.flickr.com/ph… *note: this item was a last minute change; this was served instead of the milk chocolate-whiskey panna cotta listed on the menu.

Drive around on tires for a year past their tread life if that's what it takes to afford a night at Providence. A great "event" restaurant - it certainly lent my birthday a special quality. I am still recovering from last night's three-hour-long nine-course menu tasting with wine pairings. Every plate was interesting, immaculately presented, and - most crucially - preternaturally delicious (the dishes are creative without being overly fussy). We had a nice rapport with our server (who was so good at his job that I nearly had an homoerotic attraction to the man) and he truly tricked out our cheese plate; Christ in a wheelchair, that spread alone was almost worth the price of admission! I'm not at all surprised by other Yelpers comparing a meal at Providence to good sex, but the analogue isn't fun, bedframe-banging, flesh-biting, hair-yanking bootknocking - this is akin to emotional lovemaking that, as it jumbles the sensual and the psychic, as it fuses body and spirit, substantiates the soul. That may sound excessive, but isn't effusiveness itself a kind of testimony?

Be jealous, be very jealous. If your significant other does not take you here for a full chef's tasting menu, it's very obvious they don't love you. For half of my 28th birthday present, my amazing woman took me here (the other half: http://ecx.images-amazon…). I have to say I loved the interior of this place. Very nautical and Little Mermaid-ish but not in a gay way. All the staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We both wondered how they were able to coordinate our meal so well. After a quick scan of the mostly seafood menu, we decided to go all out and order the chef's menu for the two of us and a single wine pairing to share. Let's get to it! 0) They have bacon bread! So smart! Along with it was chive bread and one other. Taking a bite of the bacon bread with the chive bread was quite nice, as was the small platter of butter and salt. 1) Amuse Bouche One: A drink trio of a greyhound, mojito, and gin and tonic. But this was no ordinary set of drinks, the greyhound and mojito were both encased in a translucent ravioli like shell and rested on cool metal spoons. The gin and tonic was a perfect, rectangular cube of liquor saturated shaved ice.  All three were perfectly mixed, very inventive, and fun to eat/drink. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 2) Amuse Bouche Two: Kanpachi with shiso and wasabi oil. The julienned, yellowtail-like fish was just incredible. Even though the thin strips of fish was no more than two toothpicks wide, it still had a great slightly firm texture and a heavenly mouth feel. The subtle wasabi oil was amazing. I could have eaten a pound of just this and been happy all night. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 3) Amuse Bouche Three: The best serving of uni I've ever had! A long rectangle of cauliflower parfait was the base, atop that was the uni, on top of that was a generous pile of white truffles, and then crispy buckwheat pieces topped it all. It sounded and looked strange when they brought it out, but somehow it all worked perfectly together. A true, "close your eyes to chew" dish. The cauliflower base was such a subtle flavor, but enhanced the texture of the uni so well. This may have been my favorite part of the night. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… By now I started to notice the odd but nice mix of music they were playing during our meal. I counted 3 Radiohead songs, a Commodores song or two, and a random mix of soft adult alternative and classic R&B and soul. Nice but weird, that's all. 4) The first real course of the night was poached big eye tuna, Hokkaido scallop bubu, yuzu kosho, avocado, and crème fresh with caviar. The tuna was thinly sliced and was so amazingly good with an avocado slice, crème fresh, and caviar all together. The scallop "bubu" was interesting but not magnificent. It was prepared into an almost jello like mash and had lost some of its natural texture. This course was served with Junmai Dai Ginjyo, Kanchiku (sake). http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 5) Spot prawn Thai style, with peanuts, mint, carrots, and red curry. The almost raw, but cooked enough prawn was served with some very nice curry foam and some damn fine carrot slices. This dish was good but my least favorite of the night. It was served with Riesling Kabinett, Oppenheim Sachtrager, Kuhling-Gillot 2002. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 6) Sweetbreads, almonds, salsify, summer truffles, served with salsify foam and a potato soup base. God damn I love sweetbreads, so amazingly divine no matter how you spin it. Don't worry, I had to look up "salsify" too, it's some weird flowering weed like plant, no idea where that flavor was but the entire dish rocked. Almond slivers with pieces of sweet corn and veal thymus glands just worked so well in the soup. This was served with Chenin Blanc, Leo Steen 2007. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 7) Halibut, with burdock, shiso, and lemon. Good but forgettable, meaning I forgot the details except for the amazing tomato chunk that topped the fish. Served with Auxey-Deresses, "Les Ruchottes" Domaine Boyer-Gontard 2002. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ***Click "Show All" below to read the rest***

"Are we there yet?" That was me. On my way to an impromptu dinner at Providence - I felt like a kid going to Disneyland. This time around we went for the Providence Market menu which is nine courses, including cheese and intermezzo. Overall, the dinner and the wine pairings were even better than the previous visit. Service is still outstanding and Chef Cimarusti was in the kitchen, coming out every now and then to greet patrons. Onto the food: Amuse: Gelee of gin and tonic with lime, a margarita ravioli and a small glass containing cured trout, trout caviar, wasabi marshmallow. Japanese kanpachi with crispy rice crackers, coriander and soy crème fraîche. Sea urchin served in a farm fresh egg, champagne beurre blanc, fines herbes. My favorite dishes of the night. Hokkaido scallop with Japanese eggplant, ramps, reduction of vadouvan and sauternes, and cashews. Wild day-boat pacific halibut with summer squash, black olive, dried apricot, basil.   King salmon - sorry, don't have the info on this one. =/ Veal tenderloin cooked sous vide, with almond, morels, roasted baby carrots, port wine. Assortment of 20 or so stinky to mild cheeses with dried figs and bread. Cucumber ice cream, kaffir lime, juniper berry and yogurt. Yuzu curd, meringue with blackberry sorbet, jasmine. Phew... it was more than enough food. The dishes and wine pairings complimented and enhanced every dish...unlike the Dining Room in Pasadena, where the wine pairings made the seafood dishes taste like rotting corpses on a plate. But thats another review... The tasting menu options are five courses $85/$115 with wine pairing, nine courses $110/$155 w/ wp or 14 courses $155/$240 w/ wp. The nine takes about 2.5 hours. If you can't make it for dinner, go for the dessert tastings, your choice of 3, 5 or 8 courses of uniquely crafted desserts. Its safe to say, this is one of my favorite restaurants in LA. With every dish, Providence evolved from great to exemplary, with the combination of unpretentious service,  simple elegance in the decor, innovative, delicate flavors from start to finish. Providence is, still amazing.

PERFECTLY BALANCED. [According to wiki] "Perfection is, broadly, a state of completeness and flawlessness..." and when you're paying $$$$ for flawlessness, you better damn well believe I'm looking for perfection. We arrived a little early for our 8:30 reservations and decided to wait at the bar until our table was ready. This was completely fine with me because now I got to sample a couple of their reknowned cocktails. I watched the mixologist doing his thing while also being distracted by their lovely display of top-notch alcohol. It was already after 8:30, but we figured we'd wait patiently and not rush the experience. By the time 8:50 rolled around, there was somebody going around with little tastings to keep our minds busy from the delay. We finally decide to check on our reservation and get our table around 9p. (If I were in a rush, I could see how this might ruin my experience - especially in a fine dining establishment  - but what are you going to do? You can't force people to pay their tab.) My date had already done lots of research on this place so I told him I didn't even need to look at the menu and that he could order for me. He made the brave decision on the 5 course meal with wine pairings and started us off with a 1/2 dozen oysters. "Oh my... mmm... WOW!... SO GOOD!!" That was about the extent of my vocabulary for about 2.5 hours. The cuisine had personality, the combinations were on par for my opinionated yelper taste buds, and the service was exceptional (our plates were cleared with a blink of an eye.) The only point of service I didn't see going around was crumbing, but everything else was so on point, I didn't care. Providence reminded me what it's supposed to be like to eat again. It was fun playing with the multiple textures and subtleties and reminds me that paired with a perfect wine, something simple can unexpectedly blossom into complexity redefining it's flavor. Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to dine with a near flawless perfection. One last thing, Salt & Pepper ice cream!

I feel so lucky to have been given the opportunity to try the 9 course tasting menu with wine pairing at Providence. I wont go into details of every dish, but I will just say that this is a once in a lifetime experience/meal and I was blown away by each and every dish. I've never had fish prepared so well and such fresh unique ingredients. Don't even get me started on the sauces..... I was full by course 6, but I'm glad I persevered through all 9 courses to truly get the full experience. The cheese course alone was worth the upgrade to 9 courses. I am still full almost 24 hours later- but I dont know that regular food will ever taste as good now that I've experienced Providence.  The service was on point and the restaurant itself is very approachable and understated. I didnt find Providence to be snobby at all (unless you approach it that way!). The food really speaks for itself here. Come here for a special occasion- you will never forget it!

We did the Chef's tasting + black truffles, full review with pictures on my site "A visit to Providence is an event in itself.  Add Chef Cimarusti's 15+ course Chef's tasting menu and it becomes a truly special occasion. Throw in a few more black truffle dishes and the experience is damned near surreal - but that sort of thing really happens, and for me no less. Thanks once again to the extreme generosity of my main man Mooms, and a timely Birthday reservation for our  LA broham, Tim. The three of us took part in such ballerdom last Saturday evening."

If you want food, go to a restaurant. If you want to experience gastronomy that combines time-tested cooking methods with cutting-edge, avant-garde culinary applications, go to Providence LA. Providence is best described with superlatives like "best" and "top." It's no coincidence that it's Michelin 2-star rated. Mark my words, Providence will satisfy the most discriminating, most discerning palate. If you can taste the difference between a cheese made from butterfat milk or one from settled butterfat skim milk or between grade A foie gras (no visible veins) and grade B foie gras, Providence is your place. This is a "go big or go home" place. The 16-course menu is their flagship product. They also offer a wildly popular 8-course dessert menu.  I settled in the middle with the 5-course option. Wash those dishes, book those billable hours, work the spreadsheets; do whatever it takes to order the tasting menu. The service was phenominal and they cater to just about any request such as pouring another glass of wine you loved. However, this isn't a restaurant you go to experience service or beautiful interior designs (both of which Providence boasts). Instead, this is a foodie's Shangri-La. The wine pairing was perfect. E.g. The Gessami Gramona Muscat paired wonderfully with flowering coriander that accompanied the silky, fatty konpachi sashimi. The amuse bouche was cutting edge. A "margarita" encased in a molding made with nitrogen. The raw Tasmanian trout dish was dusted with edible 24k gold flakes. Only the best and freshest of ingredients are served. No crap coming from the kitchen. Their diver scallops are real diver scallops. I.e. caught by hand (not dredged) and no sodium tripolyphosphate. Other examples. They took the time to carefully marinate (not just season) their baby morels. Their baby chantrelles were artistic in apperance, sublime in taste. YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE; MAKE SURE IT'S ENOUGH.

Well, it finally happened. The day I have been waiting for for the last few years. No, I haven't met "the one" or won the lotto. I finally experienced the wonder that is Providence. How anyone could give this place anything less than 5 stars is waaaaay beyond me. Although, I will say that I had the pleasure of incredible company. Incredible company that also picked up the check. Whaaaaa...? How did I get so lucky? I have been driving past Providence for as long as it has been opened and each time I drive by I look longingly at the unsuspecting building there on Melrose and sigh. I was treated to a lovely lunch, they only do lunch once a week, and it just so happened that it was perfect in every way. Just as I expected. We started with the kampachi and tuna tartare for our appetizers with a nice glass of steel barreled wine. We moved on to our main courses, I ordered the chilled lobster in a raspberry/jalapeno-infused reduction with slivers of granny smith apples. Yum! My lunch date had the striped sea bass and calamari with parsnips in a paprika sauce, also very very good. I ended up eating off of that plate most of the time. For desert we had the panna cotta and the sorbet in coconut milk with tapioca and slivers of baby coconut (see my pictures). The baby coconut were adorable, I didn't even know there was such a thing! The service was impeccable, he was well versed in the menu and offered recommendations upon our request. The design is contemporary, clean, and an excellent use of space. I loved the bathrooms, and the bar area is calling my name right now. I will be back as soon as I get my tax refund (that is wishful thinking, I know).

The highlights of the meal include: Scallops and halibut. Having Salma Hayek dining at the next table doesn't hurt either. Girlfriend is absolutely gorgeous! The lowlights of the meal include: stuffy setting, pretentious so-called foodies whose main conversation revolved around "ahh yes.. I believe it is foam. How very exquisite!", disappointment in dishes' quality and creativity due to yelp's over-hyped reviews, $$$, salma hayek's boobs were all covered up. Overall, go for the ambiance and the hope that your date will put out. Unless you're treating family out ya sick bastards...

Serious food made here.  If you questioned why it was prepared the way it was you can ask your waiter without upsetting them or making them "ask the manager".  They know what they are doing, they put together excellent menu items.  I had the duck, still drooling about it, and while this place would be considered "snooty" it never felt that way at all.  Excellent, looking forward to the next special occasion to go!

Providence was not the most incredible meal of my life. In fact it doesn't even register in the top 20. But, it was a lovely evening regardless. Let me start with the negatives: - I prefer when valet is located directly in front of a restaurant, not on a side street. If you're questioning my issue, then go ahead and dine there on a rainy night. Then you will understand. - One bathroom for women with a janky door lock. Women may have to wait longer than they have to already because no one can figure out the lock. If you have to attach a tacky sign as to HOW to lock and unlock the door, perhaps it's just best to fix it. - One of my ultimate tests for fine dining is whether or not they have color coordinated napkins according to your attire. This means that people wearing dark clothing will be offered dark napkins as to not leave a lovely trace of white lint on their clothing. Providence does not provide that service. Bring a lint roller.   Onto more positive things: - The service is stellar, as it should be. Our server was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. We were most impressed with the female wine sommelier (yay for chicks who know wine!). She knew her stuff, asked the right questions, and nailed the right wine for each meal. - The decor is dark, sexy, and chic. I loved the seashell motifs that lined the dark grey-colored walls. Most importantly, the restaurant was quiet. I didn't hear any music except for the main entrance area. It's always nice to dine somewhere that has excellent acoustics. The food: Let me start by saying that although no one in LA eats bread, please do not miss the bacon brioche. It is truly outstanding. If you don't eat bacon either...well, then, I just pity you. The amuse-bouche was very interesting and tasty. There was the light and airy wasabi-infused tofu "marshmallow", the decadent Gruyere-filled pastry, and a shot glass of trout sashimi, roe, and edible gold leaf layered with a lemon gelatin. It was a delicious way to begin the meal. I started with the dungeness crab served with mandarin slices and an avocado crepe roll. It was the perfect portion and the presentation was beautiful. The crab was obviously very fresh and tasted like it just arrived from the ocean. There's nothing like a well-prepared bottom-feeder, imo. For my main course, I devoured the sea bass. The fish was absolutely delicious and very fresh, but I did have an issue with the aioli type sauce  drizzled around the plate. It tasted like pure mayonnaise, which was not appetizing for me at all. If I wanted mayo on my fish, I would have ordered a tuna fish sandwich. I tasted a few other menu items, including the duck breast, lobster risotto, and foie gras. They were all delicious and prepared perfectly. However, I was surprised that the duck was such a large portion. In fact, it seemed almost too big and the cuts were rather dense. Also, I was disappointed that the Santa Barbara prawns were not served that night since I was told from one of the biggest foodies I know that they are not to be missed. Unfortunately, we had a time constraint and had to skip the cheese plate and dessert. This was extra disappointing since the cheese cart looked (and smelled) incredible. However, the cheese cart alone is a good enough reason for me to come back very soon.

I saw this restaurant on a major magazine, rated them top 50 best restaurant in the United States. It was local so I told myself I had to try it. 2 years later, after changing plans the last minute for mother's day, I called Providence thinking there is no way I can make reservations at 5pm but they had something at 8:30pm. Just my luck. So Mother's Day at Providence. What an experience. It was a true culinary delight. My parents are picky eaters and mainly stick to chinese food but they loved it. They price wasnt cheap but it was for mom and you get what you pay for. The service was excellent. Very polite and accommodating. Keep in mind that most dishes are not big portions. So order enough. :) Appetizers: Maine Lobster Risotto (Nice buttery type of lobster sauce. Real lobsters pieces) Foie Gras Ravioli (Didnt get to try it. My family ate it all so I guess it was good. :) ) Entrees: Me: wild leigh fisheries john dory (new zealand) Mom: wild black sea bass (rhode island) Dad: wild day boat pacific halibut Sis: wild black sea bass (rhode island) All the fishes were very fresh, very tender, all with special sauces, presented nicely, accompanied by some vegetable or a version of mashed potatoes. After the entree, there was a server that came around with a cart of cheeses. So we ordered various slices of cheeses per their recommendation which came with thinly slices of bread and a few fruits. The cheeses were excellent as well. This was not part of the meal, sold separately which at a moment I thought it might of been free but who was I kidding, its a top 50 restaurant! For dessert, we had strawberries and rasberries, each came with fruits and nicely presented. They also gave us a complimentary dessert and a gift box for mothers day with cookies inside. Overall great experience, pricey but worth it.

This is quite the sophisticated place - great place to impress a date.  It's small and intimate but you don't feel like you are sitting on your neighbor's lap like you do in some other places.  Noise level is moderate.  Food and presentation are just beyond awesome here, with prices to match.  The food is unlike any dishes I have tasted.  There are cold and hot appetizers Appetizers: * Cold - Wild big eye tuna came lightly seared and dressed with a truffle vinaigrette and crushed avocado although it looks like wasabi. * Cold - Dungeness Crab was served with kiwi, melon and mint.  The dressing was a little overpowering for the crab but it was refreshing * Hot - Spaghetti alla chitarra - noodles were slightly thicker than traditional spaghetti and was the perfect base for the squid, prawns, lobster and sauce of olive oil, basil and tomato.  It was so simple, but tasted so complex.  I would have loved to have had this as a main meal. Entrees: * Wild King Salmon with the artichokes, onions and bone marrow was cooked perfectly * Wild striped bass was crisp on the outside, tender on the inside and came with figs, porcini and rosemary * Spot prawns - now this was really worth writing about - they take a big dish of heated salt and rosemary and cover the prawns in the heated salt to cook, then they  dust the salt off, filet them for you, put the heads on the side, add touch of the most amazing olive oil I have ever tasted and serve it to you - I cannot speak enough about how awesome the presentation was and how delicious they were.  Yes, I ate the crispy heads too and sucked the brains out. We skipped dessert because we were too full on the food, but they brought out a small plate of jelly cookies and mini macarons, which was such a sweet and perfect finish.

It's been a long, long time coming, but I finally made my way down Melrose for a meal at Providence.  After much pre-meal deliberation on the pros and cons of the various tasting menus versus ordering a la carte, my dining companion and I elected to get the 5 course tasting menu with a split wine pairing, and then supplement with the individual items we fancied in order to maximize our menu coverage. The tasting menu featured kanpachi, cod, Hokkaido scallops, veal tenderloin, and cheesecake which I subbed out for panna cotta.  Unfortunately none of the aforementioned items registered much if any impression on the "wow" scale.  The cod was prepared sublimely and may very well have been the best cooked piece of fish I've come across but the flavors of the dishes just didn't do it for me. However the items we ordered separate off the menu, Santa Barbara salt prawns, foie gras ravioli with truffles, wagyu beef, and "chowda", all shone brightly on their own save for the soup.  The prawns and ravioli were my favorites and the wagyu was deliciously tender and marbled albeit the most expensive 3oz of beef I've ever consumed.  The "chowda" was presented essentially deconstructed and then reconstructed as our server poured the cream base over the contents in a bowl.  Interesting technique but the soup itself was somewhat forgettable.  Towards the end of our meal the kitchen bestowed a couple small pots of risotto upon us gratis, and while the bacon, mushroom, and truffle accompaniments sound great on paper, the rice was tragically undercooked. Damage done for two was a touch under $600 tax and tip included, making Providence the priciest dinner excursion I've partaken in.  Sadly, and perhaps due to a combination of sky high expectations and humble upbringings, I don't consider this to be the best or even one of the best meals in my lifetime.  The food was good but far too many dishes came across as merely above average rather than extraordinary to justify the cost.  Still, I truly enjoyed the experience and would return for a more modest meal from the a la carte menu.

Providence is one of only four two-starred Michelin restaurants in LA (of which I've had the pleasure of dining at three). That's saying a lot and it's definitely worth the high marks. The décor is beautifully minimalist with Asian influences complete with barnacle looking sculptures on the walls. The restaurant is separated in several different dining rooms for a more intimate feel. The both times I've been here we were seated in rooms with approximately 4-5 tables. I highly recommend ordering a tasting menu so that you can fully experience all of Chef Cimarusti's offerings. Whether that's 5 courses, 9 courses, or the chef tasting menu of 14 courses, I'll leave that up to you. The wine pairing is also a must as each course is carefully paired with the precise wine to enhance the flavors on the plate and elevate your palate. The tasting menus are seasonal and vary. The two times I've been there, the tasting menus had similar dishes but varied in preparation. Tasting Menu #1 *Japanese Kanpachi w/ crispy rice crackers, flowering coriander, soy crème fraîche *Hokkaido Sea Scallops w/ chanterelles, flageolet, applewood smoked bacon *Wild Day-Boat Pacific Halibut w/ burdock, shiso, lemon *Roasted Tenderloin of Veal w/ crushed king edward potatoes, spring onions, hazelnuts, spring garlic confit *Miso Cheesecake w/ masumoto peaches, black sesame, cassis sorbet Tasting Menu #2 *Japanese Kanpachi w/ crispy rice crackers, flowering coriander, soy crème fraîche *Maine Lobster Ravioli w/ bulgarian chanterelle, fines herbes, lobster nage *Wild Day-Boat Pacific Halibut w/ summer squash, black olive, dried apricot, basil *Marcho Farms Veal Tenderloin w/ english peas, bacon, almond, and maitake mushrooms *Salt roasted santa barbara spot prawns roasted in salt (supplement of $20) *Yuzu curd, meringue w/ blackberry sorbet, jasmine My favorites from both tasting menus are the (1) Japanese Kanpachi w/ crispy rice crackers, (2) Halibut w/ burdock, shiso, lemon, (3) Veal Tenderloin w/ maitake mushrooms, and (4) Miso Cheesecake. As you can probably tell, seeing how my favorites show a trend of seafood (fish in particular) and Asian influence, these are the points where Providence excels. (1) Japanese Kanpachi w/ crispy rice crackers - every component of this dish is expertly designed to enhance the dish as a whole. The crispy rice crackers add great textural contrast to the delicate kanpachi. The hint of bitterness from the flowering coriander added depth of flavor to the soy crème fraîche. This dish alone is worthy of the two Michelin stars. Pure genius. (2) Halibut w/ burdock - halibut was featured on both tasting menus but with different ingredients. Both dishes were exquisite but having to pick one, I am leaning more towards the halibut with burdock, shiso, and lemon. The flavors were delicate but impactful all at the same time. The fish was beyond perfectly cooked, more like geniusly cooked. (3)  Veal Tenderloin w/ maitake mushrooms - this was my first time having maitake mushrooms and they are awesome. Their great earthy flavor grounded the veal and the earthiness of the dish was freshened by the english peas and almond. And bacon, what's not to love about bacon? (4) Miso Cheesecake - AMAZING! I never would have thought to put miso in cheesecake but it is absolutely divine. Add the black sesame and you're in heaven. My taste buds were jumping up and down in joy for this one. Overall: *4.5 stars.* Chef Cimarusti knows how to do seafood right and earns both his Michelin stars.

Providence is everything you would expect and more. The service was impeccable, the food was outstanding and the decor was really lovely and romantic. Our friend treated a group of 20 to Providence to celebrate her bday. She had booked a large private room next to the bar which was quite intimate. We all had a 5 course tasting menu which consists of scallops, veal, salmon sashimi, wild black grouper. Most of us opted in for the pairing menu so  we were lucky enough to have the sommelier explain every bottle of wine that was being poured at the table. I was just excited that I got to try one of the two Michelin star restaurants in LA. I was very impressed and will definitely go back.

Unsuspectingly tucked amongst pawn shops and automotive repairers; Providence, with its boxy architectural exterior and spot lights angled on its grey walls, lies superimposed  in a moderately sketchy middle class neighbourhood.   Behind the heavy wooden framed frosted glass doors, I was greeted by hosts and servers who seemingly awaited my arrival. We got seated by the stone walls with various floating candles alongside. A mini lantern suspended above our table. A clusters of shells set on walls of the other side of the dining room; there was a hint of romance in the atmosphere of this cozy restaurant. I was slightly sick with a meek appetite so I opted the 5-course tasting menu out of the 9 and 14 course menus, for $85. Thus, my boyfriend was also required by the restaurant to order the tasting menu. (but you must order the tasting menu if it's your first time dining here!) Service was very prompt and our amuse bouche arrived before we even had to wait. The amuse bouche was a 3 section cocktail. A gin and tonic gelee with a dash of lime. It was a snowy texture and refreshing while it tingled slightly inside my mouth. I could indeed taste the tonic that was a slightly bitter for my sick palate. The vodka with grapefruit juice was served in another spoon and was at first glance, mistaken for an egg yolk. The juice burst in my mouth as I took it whole. The last one was non-alcoholic, ironically served in a shot glass. Salmon on a cool gelee base, sprinkled with gold flakes, mini rice crackers and wrapped with cream. A myriad of cold savory flavours danced in my mouth. The first course was the Japanese Kanpachi, topped with cilantro blossoms and a smooth creamy. It was a little fishy and warm for my taste, but the mixture of the dressing and herbs spruced it up very well. The scallop was one of my favourite. A single scallop swimming in finely japanese eggplant, cashews and reduction of vadouvan and wine sauce. Roofed by shredded rhubarb. The scallop was very tender. Each bite combined with the sauce and the kick of eggplant was simply splendid. I'm not a big fan of halibut and this dish was rather forgettable. But I do remember it being very well cooked, not dry at all, garnished with miniature edible flowers, black olives, apricot and summrt squash. Combined with a green dressing that provided the halibut a slight crunch. My veal was cooked flawlessly medium rare and extremely tender topped with english peas, bacon, almond and maitakel mushrooms. 3 dollops of creamy mustard-like sauce surrounded it. The final course was a yuzu curd layered with sorbet encircled with blackberries and meringues. A little tart with a cooling sensation, the meringues was not too hard but slowly melted in my mouth along with the blackberry sauce. Petit fours were presented when we asked for  the check, Consisted of nougats, sugar coated jelly cube and wrapped caramel. I liked the nougat but the jelly was a little too sweet. The caramel was smooth and soft but not a mushy mess, and I believe, slightly salted in the centre. Service was impeccable, although I did not get as friendly of a vibe as other top tier restaurants I've been to. Everyone was courteous and water was refilled consistently. *** Tip: 5 course takes around 1.5 hours, and i heard the chef's tasting menu takes up to 4 hours! Favourites: scallop, food came in the right pace. Did not want: alcoholic amuse bouche...was rather interesting, but what if you don't feel like starting off with something bitter =/ Last words: Two Michelin stars, enough said!

The Arsenal cocktail here is by far one of the best drinks in all of LA. And this comes directly from my liver who can attest to such a bold declaration of muddled blackberry and bourbon awesomeness. So go and order one and until you do, don't even attempt to call yourself a connoisseur of cocktails until you have called one of these your own. Just sayin' As for the rest of the place, my review still holds up and continues to exceed the 5 star mark as this is seriously one of the finest restaurants in this city.

My fiance and I try to go out to a nice dinner every month or 2, but due to our busy schedules, holiday get togethers, and recent engagement, we haven't had our usual date night. So being the wonderful fiance that he is, he surprised me with a dinner date to Providence. We decided to get the tasting menu since it's not everyday we'd be dining at a 2 Michelin Star restaurant. I got the 5-course tasting menu with: - Japanese Kanpachi - Bobbys Block Island Sea Scallops - Wild Pacific Halibut - Marcho Farms Veal Tenderloin - Banana Bread Pudding I also HAD TO get the pasta with white truffles. I love truffles and the scent was just so amazing that I couldn't resist. The fiance got the full tasting menu with everything from the 5-course tasting menu and: - Santa Barbara Sea Urchin - Wild King Salmon - Market Cheeses - Persimmon with Sesame Crisps There were a few complimentary items: fresh bread (seaweed focaccia and bacon brioche), amuse bouche, and bite-sized sweets (macarons, truffles, and caramel). Everything was amazingly delicious. There was not a single dish that we didn't like. All the flavors were amazing, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly cooked. Of course, there were some dishes we loved more than the others. For me it was the pasta with white truffles, whereas the fiance absolutely loved the Cheese Platter. The fresh pasta dish was so simple (butter and parmesan sauce), but full of amazing flavors and tasted amazing because of the truffles. The Cheese Platter is not just an ordinary cheese platter with brie or gouda. They have a lot of special, "exotic" cheeses that I've never heard of or tasted. The service was also excellent. We love going to places that don't have a pretentious attitude. Our servers were constantly joking around with us and answering any questions we had about a dish. The dinner came close to $500 (including a generous tip). The pasta turned out to be about $80 (yes, truffles are pricey!) so that was the reason why the bill was so high. BUT ohhhhhhh the $80 pasta was so worth it. If I were a Food Network star, I would definitely talk about it on the "Best Thing I Ever Ate".

All I have to say is "HOLY MOLY!" Chef Cimarusi hits it out of the park with this one. Winemaker and I did the full tasting making it a total of 9 gorgeous courses.  This ended up being a five hour dinner and we didn't even notice where the time went!? My favorite dishes were the Maine Lobster - yellow beets in two forms, American caviar, tarragon with a beautiful Chenin blanc from Foxen 2004 Bobby's Block Island Sea scallops - Tahitian squash, porcini mushrooms, rosemary with a late-harvest Gewurztraminer, Girlan 2005 (Winemaker felt this was the best pairing) Medallions of Veil - crushed potatoes, chanterelle mushrooms, soy and spinach Cote du rhone paired with Domaine de la rejarde, 2003 The staff was on point and pours of the wine were generous. But, in all honestly ever dish was executed beautifully by the end I was so full but couldn't help finish every bite.

Finally I had a chance to come back to this dream land after all these years. It's been long over-due but who can really afford dinner at Providence? Well, if you stick to non-course meal, maybe it's much cheaper, but as my first visit was for 9 course meal, there was no way I was gonna down grade my experience to 3 orders, an appetizer, an entrée, and a dessert. So the boy's BD became my perfect opportunity to come back here and thank him for my last BD meal at Ritz Carlton's Dining Room that he took me to. Well, maybe not. It was a perfect excuse for sure, to say, "hey baby, I'm gonna get you this gorgeous meal for your BD," but the reality is, "mwahahahaha, he doesn't even know that I'm plundering his BD present!" The food was as good, if not better, as the last visit. Every single dish that came out was just simply breath taking and out-of-this-world experience. We were both blown away by how creative the chef's mind works in terms of presenting the perfect harmony with food in an unique way. I mean, who comes up with the concepts of cauliflower mousse and Uni together? Or curry and ice cream?  Eel and foie gras? Clearly the chef's mind is somewhere completely different than us commoners'. Another mind blowing thing was the wine pairing. Unfortunately I was not a fan of their wine selection when I first came here. But this time... oh man, this time was a completely different story! Every wine had such an unique flavor to it, yet it magically worked with the food. When we took a sip before the food came, it hit us strangely like, "wow, this tastes funky," or "hmmm... this has really really strong flavor." But once we ate the food then took a sip of the paired wine, everything amazingly came together. No more "funky" or "too strong" flavor, but a total, utter harmony within the mouth. The meal that had perfect food and perfect wine ended with 5 desserts and it literally put me through what heaven must be like. I don't know if things get much better than this. Granted that I've only lived 29 years and lived in 2 countries, but my poor brain can't comprehend the possibility of "a place that's MUCH better than Providence" somewhere in this world. I'm not stopping my life-long food search by any means, but I can safely say that Providence will remain on my top 3 restaurant list for a good while.

Nestled away in an inconspicuous corner of Melrose Avenue is one of the best seafood restaurants I have ever had the privilege of dining in. Simple, inviting, and relaxing atmosphere paired with ingenious and delicious food prepared by Michael Cimarusti makes for a very enjoyable meal. The fresh seasonal ingredients are cooked so that they stand on their own. The Wild Black Sea Bass, the John Dory or even the NY Steak (I know, not sea food, but definitely shows the versatility of the kitchen) is cooked, seasoned and presented perfectly. No complaints. Certainly no complaints for the freshly backed Bacon Rolls or the Seaweed Focaccia. Nor do I have anything bad to say about the Malecular Gastronomy amuse bouche of a Mojito Caviar and the liquid nitrogen frozen Screw Driver. Something to really get your taste buds going. When you visit Providence do not be surprised to see a celebrity or two enjoying the Chef's tasting menu. Of course, you can have your pick at the 5, 9 or 15 courses as well, no need to walk the red carpet for that privilege. As they say the proof is in the pudding, or in this case the Dulce de Leche-Miso Panna Cotta. Enjoy!

Technically: about 4.5 stars... but because the food was SO DAMN EFFIN INCREDIBLY AMAZING... I will just say 5 stars.   The food: 5 stars - hands down.   The service: 4.5 stars (It was great and completely attentive, but for the price I paid, I expected it to be impeccable, polished, and flawless.) The ambiance/atmosphere: 5 stars The fiance and I dined here last night for our New Years/Engagement Anniversary celebration. (Yeah, we're having a long engagement... now shut up about it.)  I have a few one star Michelin restaurants under my belt (Sona, Water Grill, Mori Sushi, Sushi Zo, Asanebo) but this was my first time dining at a two starred Michelin restaurant. Upon entering the fine establishment, you are first greeted by the greeter, then by the host at the podium, and then escorted to your table by another gentleman.  We were seated in the intimate, romantic covered patio within view of the main dining area.  Providence is definitely modern and simply elegant with it's minimalist interior and I love the artistically placed shells on the pillar/ceilings. For New Year's, Providence was offering a set chef's multi-course menu that was generously "truffled" up and the fiance and I both decided to add the wine pairing option as well. Bread Servings consist of: Focaccia, Bread w/Bacon, and Bread w/Chives. Amuse Bouche 1: Shrimp Toast on a stick w/a dash of sriracha sauce. Amuse Bouche 2: Lobster Knuckle Sandwich (served w/champagne) Course 1: Malpeque Oyster w/Celery Root Veloute, Fino Sherry (served w/Taittinger, Cuvee Prestige M.V.) Course 2: Kanpachi Sashimi w/Black Truffle, Toasted Nori, Crispy Buckwheat (served w/Vinho Verde, Encostas do Lima 2006) Course 3: Sea Scallop w/Parsnip, American Caviar, Leeks (served w/Chenin Blanc, Leo Steen 2007) Course 4: Black Sea Bass w/Chanterelles, Jurancon, Petit Pois (served w/Macon-Milly-Lamartine, Heritiers du Come Lafon 2005) Course 5: Arctic Char w/Pork Belly Confit, Truffle Fondue, German Butterball Potatoes (served w/Pinot Nero, "Meczan" J.Hofstatter 2007) Course 6: Dry-Aged Sirloin of Beef w/Musque deProvence Pumpkin, Bone Marrow, Shallot Confit (served w/Malbec, Tiza 2005) Course 7: Tomme De Chevre d'Aydius w/Turkish Apricot, Riesling Vinegar, Hazelnut Bread Crisps (served w/Corvina, Palazzo Della Torre, Allegrini 2004) Course 8 (the palate cleanser): Mandarin Gelee w/White Chocolate-Fennel Sorbet, Black Olive Course 9 (dessert): Chocolate Ganache w/Yuzu Curd, Salt & Pepper Marshmallows (served w/Banyuls, "Odysseus" Josph Nadal 1996 Petits Fours: Amaretto Truffles, Sweet & Salty Caramels, Olive Oil Gelees. I ended my meal w/an espresso while the fiance had a French press coffee.   I was beginning to get pretty full by course 6 and I felt that I was going to pop out of the corset that I was wearing... but it's soooo deliriously ambrosial that you just have to keep going.  Not to mention, you don't want to waste one single penny!  (Note to self: Do not wear corsets to multi-course tasting dinners.) All of the food was EXCEPTIONALLY PHENOMENAL & JUST ORGASMIC that it's hard for me to pick out a favorite.  They also did very well with the wine pairing.  My favorite wine was the Malbec, Tiza 2005 - oaky, spicy, with hints of vanilla and black cherry... it had a really nice nose!  I didn't care for the Olive Gelee that was served in the Petits Fours... I ate one and probably wouldn't eat another. Like I said, the service was great but compared to Le Bec Fin which is equally priced, it could certainly use some polishing...I like the casual attitude, but they could fancy it up slightly.  After our last course, they had forgotten to bring us our Petits Fours but had asked us if we wanted coffee/tea/etc.  When we mentioned that we hadn't been served the Petits Fours, the waitress said, "Oh, we must have forgotten to bring it out.  I'll go get it right now." On an entertaining note, Charmane Star (porn star) was dining right next to us with a date/boyfriend/or whatever he is to her.  She was directly at my fiance's 12 o'clock... and I'm sure he was just hoping that she would be served a phallic edible at some point during the evening.

I love this restaurant and was sad to see protestors outside of it last night when I drove by.   (http://blogs.laweekly.co… )   It's been a while since I've spent time in California, but in NYC I've seen foie gras on the menu so many times I (and I didn't order it) I thought that it was standard fare. The food here in incredible with foie gra on the menu or not.   The signs were disgusting with the ducks being abused, force fed, all around it was really disturbing.  I've always had mixed feelings about foie gras.  Then there's the classic argument that it's good for you;  there are are websites/research that boast of its health benefits.  But there are other sites that link the dish to Alzheimer's and type two diabetes. Either way, though the Govenator decided to eliminate the dish from restaurants in California so we will see if other states follow.   Apparently there are other ways to farm the dish without force feeding the ducks. Check out this Ted Talk where Chef Dan Barber talks about bringing sustainable, Humane Foie Gras to America http://www.ted.com/talks… (if you're really interested in the subject). Perhaps this will be the future for the dish. I love the part about Eduardo, "The Goose Whisperer," laying in the grass with the geese taking pictures of them. Great Ted Talk. Anyway you look at it, Providence is a DELIGHTFUL place to dine in Los Angeles regardless of the protesters/bad press. Date Rating: 8 Pick up Scale: 3 Strong Suggestion: Come hungry.

The big one hundred. The big hullabaloo. The big snakeskin. The big soap. I thought I'd celebrate my 100th with a positive review of one of the only restaurants in L.A. that's truly worthy of the "gourmet" title. I understand that restaurants sometimes have their "off" nights, which  might explain some of the lesser reviews of Providence, but I assure you that I am as snobbish a foodie as you might find, and have incredibly high standards for a joint that has upper echelon pricing like this (and such hype). The vibe is cool and understated, if not a bit stuffy. It's open and subtle and is more about the food experience than the scene, which I appreciate. We started off with some great wine selected with the help of our sommelier. I should note that both the sommelier and our waiter, while excellent, knowledgeable and attentive in a non-invasive way, seemed to be trying a bit too hard...but that's neither here nor there. I know about as much about wine as Bob Saget knows about humor, so who am I to say anything? We had the lobster ravioli and the seared scallop appetizers; both were rich with complex and original flavors, luscious texture, and artful presentation. Top of the line, truly. Next, we moved on to the wild halibut in a basil crust and the cod served in a curry sauce. Absurdly stellar food; that's really all there is to say. The chefs are deeply aware of the combination of appearance, texture, and unique taste that set their food apart from most other less-than-stellar high end restaurants in this town. You will probably need to have a fairly refined and open-minded palate to eat here - the flavors are far from standard and are rich with complex flavor. I should mention the bread: no "artisan" bread which masks plain sourdough as somehow being an artistic endeavor, no; both selections were astounding, especially the bacon rolls. I hear you: "bacon roll" sounds like something you would catch in a dingy diner down south run by a grimacing, aging couple that has "Remember Pearl Harbor" bumper stickers on their foreheads; but no, this was quite an experience. I've never had bread that started out one way and transformed into others while chewing it. We both tried to savor these small rolls as long as possible (with our eyes closed, natch). Perfect for a very special night or simply when you want to pimp yourself to some stellar, expensive food, I can recommend Providence without reservation.

Perfectection.  6 courses of euphoria.   Providence is a perfect little restaurant off of Melrose, and has a very relaxed vibe.  The inside decor almost reminds me of being in a H. Murakami book.  Not so much in the bizarre way, but those random lackadaisical moments on the beach, with the beige/brownish walls and shell decoration.  Asian influence can be felt, though never blatantly outright.  The same theme is present in the dishes.   We started by ordering cocktails.  The wonderland cocktail was definitely unique in taste.  I'm not even sure how the mixologist even achieved so many layers of different tastes.  From the fruitiness to the tartness to the lavender agave nectar, each sip awakened a new sense.   Next, the amuse bouche.  Each little appetizer demonstrated gastronomic marvel.  From the frozen mojito gelee to the screwdriver with egglike consistency.  The gorgonzola cheese puff and the shot of parsnip soup (with port reduction at the bottom) had my taste buds dancing.   Throughout the meal, every time they asked if I wanted more bread, I couldn't say no.  The bread infused with nori, the one with bacon, and the normal roll were all equally good.  Just smelling that fresh baked bread aroma sent me to heaven. The japanese kanpachi was topped with crispy rice crackers and some creme fraiche.  It was the most amazing blend of flavor and textures.  Tender fish, crispy topping, sauce that melts on the tongue. The santa barbara sea urchin in the poached egg were served warm  in champagne white butter and "fine herbs".   The scallops were large and perfectly cooked, sitting pretty on top of a bed of buckwheat, dashi, and napa.  Another amazing blend of textures.   The wild striped bass was also picture perfect on top of cannellini beans (which I thought was strange until I took a bite).   The tenderloin was served with daikon radish, chanterelle.  The best part of this dish was the tenderness of the veal and the hints of black truffle fondue.   The dessert was a banana bread pudding paired with barley ice cream.  A delightful end to a meal that you wish could go on forever. And if that wasn't enough, petit fours to seal the deal.   Providence, my love.  You've swept me off my feet.

My parents' wedding anniversary is two days after Christmas, and in the last few years, we've started taking them to restaurants that normally aren't on their radar. Last year, we took them to Osteria Mozza, and this year, after reading my French Laundry review, my mom said she wanted to go somewhere like that. Granted, it's impossible to find something comparable to The French Laundry in Southern California, but L.A. is no slouch when it comes to great restaurants. I ended up choosing Providence because of its seafood-centric menu and more affordable five-course tasting option, but two Michelin stars didn't hurt either. One of the first things we noticed about the tasting menu was that the dessert course featured a kalamansi gelée. Kalamansi is the citrus of choice in the Philippines, especially in one of my favorite dishes, bistek tagalog. My parents were especially excited to see this versatile Filipino citrus featured in a fine-dining setting. For us, it was the second time in a month we've seen Filipino ingredients on a high-end tasting menu. (The first was the Ilocano salt and Pili nuts at The French Laundry.) So while the rest of the tasting menu looked fabulous on paper, we already had our eyes on dessert. We started with an inventive amuse bouche trio. The Gin and Tonic Gelée had a little tonic powder on it that started fizzing once you squeezed the juice from a lime wedge on top so that when you put it in your mouth, it replicated the carbonation of the tonic water, while the gelée supplied the gin. The best way to describe the Mojito Raviolo is that it's a mojito shot in a bubble. When you put it in your mouth, it bursts with all the flavor of a good mojito. The third amuse was a mug-shaped shot glass filled with celery root soup on top of black truffle syrup. Since the soup was lighter than the syrup, it took up the top half of the mug. You drink this like you would a shot of liquor so that the soup and syrup combine into a tasty mix of temperatures and viscosity. Before we got to the tasting menu, we ordered another appetizer, just because it sounded good. The Fatty Big Eye Tuna and Santa Barbara Sea Urchin was served with soy crème fraîche, crispy soba, mache, black truffle. This dish sounded interesting because of the contrast in textures between the tuna and sea urchin, as well as the addition of the crispy soba. The first course of the tasting was Japanese Kanpachi with Satsuma tangerines, black olives and Piquillo Peppers. The combination of all the little elements of this dish were excellent together, but the Satsumas were especially impressive on their own. Next was Nancy's Day Boat Scallops, which were perfect cooked and served with a subtle truffle vinaigrette, Juilet tomatoes, and frisée. The Norwegian halibut was the last fish course in the tasting menu and another perfect dish. It was served with fried burdock, which my wife wasn't a fan of because it's too woody, but I thought it was pretty good. The lemon butter sauce and shiso foam were great complements to the halibut. My parents and wife enjoyed their Veal Tenderloins served with chanterelle mushrooms, Weiser Farmers torpedo onion, celery root purée, but when presented with the $50 Kobe ribeye supplement earlier in the evening, I jumped at the opportunity. It was served tableside by Providence owner and General Manager Donato Poto. The Kobe ribeye was cooked medium rare, had a nice salty crust and literally melted in my mouth. I liked the pieces of veal I got to try, but was even happier that I did upgraded to the Kobe. Plus, I got to share it with the table, so everyone got to try it. It was served with porcini mushrooms, pomme fondante, and spring onions and a really nice bacon parmesan risotto. Providence is also the home of cutting-edge desserts, and pastry chef Adrian Vasquez is one of the best in the business. In fact, you can go to Providence strictly for their dessert tasting menu, which we are planning on trying on a future visit. The kalamansi gelée was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The kalamansi flavor was instantly recognizable and the texture was a perfect complement to the litchi-shiso sorbet and the tapioca balls in the white chocolate coconut soy milk soup. Our tasting service had ended, but the kalamansi gelée was so good that my wife and I looked at each other and knew we wanted to try some more desserts. She ordered the pumpkin "pie" and I ordered the "cheesecake." Both of these desserts were "deconstructed" and while they tasted really good, the platings were a bit fussy. Providence is regarded as one of the best restaurants in Los Angeles, and it's hard to argue with that assertion. It's definitely a place I want to return, but I think our next visit will be for the dessert tasting menu. If you're looking for a world-class restaurant with fresh, modern cuisine, Providence should be a at or near the top of your list.

Ridiculous (in the best way possible). Honestly, I've been holding off on this review for over a year now since I wanted to be really thorough with my descriptions. But then I realized, there's only a few things I really want to say: 1. If you go, you HAVE to do one of the tasting menus. It's SERIOUSLY the ONLY way. The first time I ate at Providence, I had the tasting menu and was completely blown away. The second time, I ordered a la carte and my experience wasn't even close to my first. There are 3 types of tastings: a. five courses - $95 / $130 with wine pairing b. full tasting (9 courses) - $125 / $180 with wine pairing c. chef's menu (14 courses, I believe) - $175 / $260 with wine pairing I was pretty full off of the 5 course tasting, but if you can handle it, the more the better! Plus, apparently, Providence's tasting menus are a bargain compared to other restaurants. 2. Try to get seated in the main dining area. It's the prettiest. 3.  You may not like this place if you don't like seafood.

It would get a 4.5 for the wait, but the food was exceptional, so HAD TO bump it to a 5! Here's the low down. 1.  Be patient.  Everything here takes a while.  By a while I mean, make sure you bring good company cos it's not a place you want to go with a bum date you settled for. Proof:  Our dinner reservations were for 930, did not get seated til about 1030 (thats being lenient). But then again...  We did get a cute table near the bar and drinks are stiff so if you feel like pounding away cos you brought an ok/so-so man.  They're drinks be stiff & delicious. 2.  Atmosphere & dress- It's classy.  Don't be the scumbag in jeans.  You will be stared at.  Gents if you're bringing a date, make sure to tell her to keep it classy & you wear a damn slacks at least. 3.  Questions.  I'm a food junkie yet this place caught me off guard with some of their delicious creations.  Ask away to any of the staff, they were all very knowledgeable and willing to answer and spill their magic unto you. Now for the review.  As mentioned there is a bit of a wait time on things from being seated to having your order out.  If you're looking for a quickie, sorry bro not this place. Drinks- Cider Rum was stiff & delicious.  Millionaire was not as good but still good.  Had the recommended a glass of their Pinot Noir from some river I forget.  Warm but not overly dry. Foods starting from the beginning:  All of their food presentations were beautiful (attached a ton of pictures so enjoy) - OMG if you are a bread nazi and eat all the restaurant bread like I do.  Be prepared.  They have a pretty good variety of breads such as their seaweed bread, but bacon lovers be prepared.  Bacon bread.  Warm, fluffy, mmmmmmmmmmm...  Try not to overindulge. -Starter: Cold maine lobster.  One side had crushed avocados layered with some thin noodles, topped with lobster and some fresh herbs.  Divided by a layer of a red sauce.  On the other side had some lobster on top of a coral sauce.  Delicious.  Seriously nom nom. -Sample: They brought some samples of a sunchoke soup, salmon skin cracker and dip.  Fabulous.   Mains: Duck breast...  OH heavens...  They were so juicy, tender, and all you could ever want in any type of breasts...  Trust me, they're awesome.  Their cherry sauteed sauce...  Heavens... Soft shell crabs:  crispy, not greasy or oily as many places tend to be.  Amazing.  they were on top of some season veggies.  MMmMMmM! Unfortunately, with the wait time, drinks, and my carb overload I could fit any dessert.  However they did bring a little sample platter of little desserts.  Some macaroons, caramel, and hmmm what was the last thing...  Anyway it was delicious. All I can say about this place is, it's an amazing place.  Surprisingly, I've passed by it many times without realizing where this place was.  It's delicious, comforting, and just a real gem of a place.  Do it and check it out!

First, I felt uncomfortable Second, I felt unwelcomed Third, they literally chased us out towards the end. The only reason why I gave those two stars is because of the daring  dishes and the adventurous delicate dishes they offered. Of all honesty, I was not in love with my experience from providence. The service appears to be good but I felt extremely uncomfortable here. Every single staffs here starting from the host, hostess to the waiters... were extremely unfriendly. They are professional for sure, but it is so apparent on their faces that they are dreading their work and just doing what they are supposed to as a "worker". If I may continue, I received my lemonade on my 3rd dish... ( they claim the lemonade is freshly squeezed... but it takes them over 30 min to squeeze them?) And  I cannot possibly believe they substituted our 7th dish cheese platter selections with a tiny cucumber sorbet...( speaking of daring desserts...) We chose the 9 course chef's menu. I do admit, the dishes were excellent... the first 5 dishes were great... until they switched over to overly daring almost disgusting desserts. Cucumber Sorbet... I will never forget... Anyways... back to my complaints about their awful service... Call me sensitive... but of all honesty, I believe dining experience is the harmony of service, ambiance and food. However, if you constantly get those cold shoulders from the waiters.... There is something seriously wrong about this restaurant. I think my favorite cuisine is Japanese because of their cozy environment and fun interactions with sushi chefs, very friendly waiters and waitresses. I'm just really bitter about this whole everyone raved about " Providence" experience... Btw,  the dishes takes FOREVER to come out.... Plan on being there at the restaurant for about 3-4 hours if you are ordering the 9 course selection.

I still think Providence deserves 5 stars, but I just wanted to say this: it's a waste to go to such a nice restaurant if you have a large group. I went last night for my cousin's birthday dinner, and we had a group of about twenty people. The service was still absolutely amazing (thank you, Providence staff, for putting up with us!), but because we had such a large group, we had to choose from a limited set menu. The food was still good, but it wasn't as great as the first time I went (with just three people, mind you). Nothing really stood out except the dessert, which was phenomenal. Coffee mousse shaped to look like a canele, served with canele ice cream and crushed hazelnuts...probably the best ice cream I've ever had! One more negative: because we had such a large group and they had to bring out all of the servings simultaneously, the food was never quite hot. I mean, I can't say that I had a bad dining experience, but it just seemed like such a waste! I felt bad for the restaurant, for the servers, for us diners...we should have just broken up into separate groups and did our own thing. Anyway, I really do have to stress that Providence probably has the friendliest (and most patient) staff out of all of the upscale restaurants in LA. I can't wait to go back and try things off of their full menu!

Oh my gawd. This place was simply ... in one word orgasmic. Had the 5 course tasting menu and the only let down ( to me at least, was the course #5, the desert. I'm not a big chocolate fan, so maybe that's why.) The 5 course actually came with 2 pre courses and 1 post course so I was actually full. Also the bread there is amazing.

Second time at Providence and it continues to amaze me.  It was my gf mother's birthday, a world renowned food extraordinaire, whom deserved something special. Providence runs like an extremely well oiled Patek Philippe Sky Moon Tourbillon.  That is, so much work and attention go into every detail contributing to a memorable event.  I say event because that is just what Providence is all about.  Expect one wait staff per patron, 15 forks and knives per patron, a detailed explanation of everything that is brought to the table down to the type of salt, and above all an unfolding of Providence's purpose and vision as the night goes on.   For Providence's 5-year anniversary they have dropped their 5-course market menu $20.  That is, 5-courses of tongue titillated artwork for $65.  While this isn't exactly cheap, rest assured, it is well worth it. The night's market menu included: Amuse - Wasabi marshmallow, cheese puff, and salmon topped lemon gelee. first course - *Japanese Kanpachi* Crispy rice crackers, coriander, soy foam The freshness and quality of the Kanpachi was the keystone to this.  Zero tendon with a tiny bit of skin for richness made this melt in your mouth. second course - *Hokkaido Scallop* Japanese eggplant, ramps, reduction of vadouvan and sauternes The scallop was cooked perfectly.  In fact the word "perfectly" doesn't do this dish justice.  Imagine an angel coming down from heaven and cooking this until God said it was done.  The vadouvan flavors really complimented the richness of the scallop.  [Vadouvan is a combination of onions, shallots and garlic with and Indian spice such as fresh curry leaves in this case]. third course - *Wild Halibut* Smoked paprika, wiser farms potatoes, grilled octopus, over stewed tomatoes, topped with zucchini and dried apricot. Flavors of this dish were big and bold.  A lot going on but everything harmonized well.  Thought the fish was cooked just right. fourth course - *marcho farms veal tenderloin* Sweet peas, bacon, almond, and moral mushrooms In my opinion the success of this dish is in the cooking method of the veal.  The tenderness of the veal is due to it being "sous-vide".  Imagine placing a plastic air tight bag around a slab of lean veal and leaving it in a 140 degree steam room for 2 hours.  The tenderness of the veal is amazing.    In fact the word "amazing" doesn't do this veal justice.  Imagine God coming down from the heavens chewing a piece of veal for 2 hours and then placing this God-mouth-tenderized veal on a plate mixed with the smokiness of bacon, earthiness of morals, crunchiness of almonds, and sweetness of pureed carrots and peas.  It's God birthing good! fifth course - *Yuzu curd, meringue* Blackberry sorbet, jasmine The Yuzu curd is tart and refreshing.  The blackberry sorbet is palate cleansing.  A perfect dessert after a wonderful meal. petifour - *chocolate macaroon, yuzu gelee, ginger barley carmel* Chocolate macaroon was texturally awesome and tasted super good.  Yuzu gelee was okay, and the ginger barley caramel was very good. Providence made a special night ever more special.  Thank you! -Rhett S.

My honey took me here for one of our anniversary dinners.. it was fabulous! I adored the Kampachi course. I love yellowtail to begin with, but this preparation was amazing, I will never forget it. It is the first thing I think about when I remember this restaurant. The 2nd thing I remember is that I had some delicious bourbon cocktail.. I think it was called the Slow Burn? I still dream about it. I have to comment about the "asian pear" cocktail.. "asian pear" is an actual fruit. I was comically disappointed to receive a martini with regular pear and passionfruit in it (but you could only taste the passionfruit). The waiter (and I guess the bartender too?) had no idea what an "asian pear" was. Umm at least put lychee juice in it? I'm not sure why they dubbed it "asian." The waiter looked at us like we were stupid when we inquired about the drink. We had the tasting menu. There were hits & misses: I enjoyed the mojito ice jelly, didn't care for the screwdriver, citrus shrimp was good, carrot foam gross, scallop was delicious, bacon brioche sounded better than it tasted, kampachi amazing amazing amazing, halibut was divine, veal was serious fail, salt & pepper ice cream gross & gross, and the lychee lemongrass jelly was a perfect finale for the palate, ..but why were there CocoPuffs with dessert?? strange. The service was good, but not memorable. The ambience is classy and elegant. Overall I had a wonderful time, Providence really knows how to make dining a memorable experience.

I've been disillusioned by the prospect of fine dining for some time now, it just seemed like every experience I was having was just uninspired, dull or just plain unoriginal. So needless to say I'm quite choosy about where I go to eat "fancy" (making the annoying quotation rabbit ear gesture). Enter Michael Cimarusti and Providence. I've been stalking them for awhile now and have been quite curious if all the accolades were true or if it was just another over-hyped L.A. eatery. I'll keep this simple. Five course tasting with wine pairings plus some additional courses we couldn't resist ordering. We started with bread or as I like to call the "filler" course. I urge my girlfriend to eat as much bread as possible so when she's full I can vulture her other, more desirable courses. The seaweed focaccia and the bacon brioche with a pat of butter and a sprinkle of sea salt are excellent choices. Then came the amuse. What an absolutely novel way to prepare our palates and appetites for the forthcoming meal. The rendition of the classic Gin & Tonic and Greyhound were playful and delightfully delicious. The sea trout with crème fraiche, trout roe, bubu arare and 24k gold leaf topping was bright and wonderfully textured. Everyone was all smiles about this one. Japanese kanpachi with crispy rice crackers, coriander and soy crème fraiche was our first official course. You cannot disguise the freshness of fish. It truly has a splendid textural quality and flavor that is so pleasing. The yellowtail was fantastic on it's own but was truly heightened by the subtle tang of the crème fraiche and the crispness of the rice crackers. The presentation was immaculate. We decided at this point to add an order of the salt roasted Santa Barbara spot prawns. Very simply, the live prawns are roasted whole in heated salt, uncovered table-side on a cart, be-headed, halved and served with olive oil and a squeeze of lemon. This was good conceptually but the prawns were a tad bit overcooked and experienced some drying as a result. Our second official course was the Bobby's Block island sea scallops with japanese eggplant, rhubarb, cashews and a reduction of vadouvan and jurançon. The scallop was seared to perfection and the eggplant and rhubarb provided a tart yet balanced counterpoint to the slight sweetness of the scallop. Me likey. At the next juncture of our wonderous meal, we had sea urchin served in a farm fresh egg with champagne beurre blanc and fine herbes. We took the the liberty of ordering the uni eggs a la carte to be added to our tasting menu. At $18 per egg these weren't cheap but this was easily the most memorable dish that we had and I enjoyed every last unctuous spoonful. Get some. For our official third course, we had the wild day boat pacific halibut from Sitka, Alaska with summer squash, black olive, dried apricot and basil. Nothing special about this one I thought, perhaps because it was overshadowed significantly by the previous sampling of uni and egg yolk. The halibut was superb in presentation but was slightly overcooked and the dryness though minimal, was noticeable. By this point we were all getting a little full, about three hours had lapsed and we were on the verge of becoming comatose. The fourth course was our last savory course. Everyone else had the Marcho Farms veal tenderloin from Franconia, PA cooked sous-vide while I substituted for the wild king salmon which was prepared similarly. My lady companion was down for the count so I had both the veal and the salmon. I am now a fan of cooking sous-vide. The results for both meats was incredible. The tenderness, uniformity in cooking and taste was apparent immediately, quite a feat considering how temperamental both tenderloin and salmon can be. Very well executed. Finally came the dessert, yuzu curd meringue with blackberry sorbet and jasmine. I like yuzu, like a lot. It has such a distinctive citrus note that is refreshing, lively and bright. What a fantastic way to cap an equally fantastic gastronomic experience. With the completion of this course we let out a collective sigh of both relief and satisfaction. The five courses with two supplemental courses were paced beautifully and we were very well pleased. Our evening was punctuated by unforgettable food in all aspects, in preparation, in presentation and in palate. A waitstaff that was professional, knowledgeable and humorous and a distinct attention to detail that was evident from the moment we entered to the moment we left. I can safely say I have a bit of a man-crush on Michael Cimarusti and will be returning to the Chef's Table in the near future. Until then, "best fishes" and thank you for the signed menus, I hope they're worth something on eBay. I just realized how long this damn review is, no one is going to read this. Here's the short version: Go here. Food good and yummy in the tummy.

This is a one star Michelin rated restaurant. My company took a bunch of us to an outing here and boy was it in a class of its own.  I had never wined and dined like this before!  We ate from the 6 course tasting menu.  Let's begin: 1.  Amuse Bouche of tuna tartare paired with a saffron drink.  You have to shoot the saffron drink in order for the flavors to mesh well together. 2.  Japanese Kanpachi - sliced yellowtail sashimi rolled up with ginger creme fraiche, pickled ginger, sea beans, and basil seeds.  All the flavors blended well together... a delightfully light and elegant dish! 3.  Bobby's block island sea scallops - cooked and came with chanterelle mushrooms, pistachios, chayote greens, and aged vinegar.  This was one of my favorites on the tasting menu!!  The sea scallops were so tender and perfect! 4.  Chowda' - smokey bacon, manila clams, topped with a creamy clam broth.  This came out with only the bacon, clams, and chopped veggies in a bowl (no soup yet) so I was confused at first, but then I saw the waiters come around and pour the creamy broth all over it.  Yummyy.. 5.  Prime New York Steak - comes with braised potato, bone marrow crouton, watercress, and texas sweet onions.  I ordered rare but mine came out medium, so although this was still good, I've had better.  The bone marrow is a little mini scallop looking thing that tastes like sweetbread or super rich foie gras.  It literally tastes like oil that melts in your mouth.  It's on top of a very oily piece of bread (aka "crouton").  Very rich indeed. 6.  Cheese Plate - came with 3 different kinds of cheese, a fig, some apple marmalade, an olive tapenade, and some bread.  I love cheese but by this time I was getting super full and could barely finish this. 7.  Chocolate Ganache - very rich, dark chocolate dessert with a side of horchata ice cream.  Stuffed to exhaustion by this point, but the dessert was so good I couldn't NOT eat it. Almost everything was impressive and impeccable.  The dishes that came out reminded me of the dishes they present on Top Chef.  The use of foam reminded me of Marcel, little sea breams, and other small details overlooked by other restaurants really does set this place apart.  I had a wonderful experience here.  The service was attentive and quick, they were always one step ahead of us.  With every dish that came out, the servers would explain what was on the plate and how the flavors work together. Other things that were delish here was the bacon bread and all the cocktails!!  At the end of our meal, the head chef came out and personally thanked us for dining with them.  Great experience from beginning to end.

WOWZERS! What an experience! =D My mouth loved me for (almost) every second there. 5-course meal is def recommended! Well, unless you're sophisticated unlike me, and know what to order a la carte, you can't go wrong with a set menu eh? - Bread - Focaccia, white roll, bacon & brioche roll - all good! - You start off with a Cube jello thing of Mojito, which refreshes your mouth (sprinkle on some lime!) and gets you ready for what heavenly stuff is to come. Then pop in the Vodka bubble--don't be afraid--put the whole thing in your mouth and let it burst! Then finish off with the fish eggs (I forget all the stuff that's in there) but it's crunchy, flavorful, and just good =) - Japanese Kanpachi - Good fish, really enjoyed the soy creme. Put some daikon as well as the cucumber(?) on the fish and swallow and chew.. slowly... - Hokkaido scallop - BEST part of the meal!!!! Scallop could not be any softer, better cooked than this perfection - Wild halibut - Mmmm, it was good, but honestly after that scallop, it actually felt a teensy bit dry - Veal tenderloin - Hmmm.... I guess that's why they're a seafood restaurant? =P I didn't think it was that good. It was cooked nicely, tender, yes. But I dono, it just tasted a little off from the rest of the course. - Dessert: Blackberry sorbet was delish! Yuzu curd.. mmm I guess it went well with the sorbet, as well as the overall jasmine taste & deco. - Wine pairing - I really like Talai berry (Spanish) which was just fruity/sweet/light/dry for me. Just perfect. Others that followed  were okay too. - They will give you Caramel macaroon, and chocolate marshmallow when you get the check. Eat the macaroon! So yum =) Next time I go, I want to try the full course, minus the wine pairing cuz I don't think wine was necessary in bringing out the flavors of food served here. Oh, and the serving size is pretty small, so don't worry about stuffing yourselves. Well at least the 5-course won't do that do ya. Friendly enough staff. We made reservation, and it seemed to be a full house by 7:30pm. Inside decoration is subtle, elegantly lit, but nothing that blows your mind. It exudes 'fine dining' but the chairs.... a miss. If you can find parking on the streets, do, but otherwise it's $5.50 valet. Expect to be there and enjoy for 2-3 hours, or more. It came out to be about $120 per person--again, not bad with the wine pairing.

4 stars for the food.  6 for service.   I took my sis out for her birthday and the people here did everything in their power (and beyond) to make it a memorable experience.   I had spoken with Donato over the phone about changing our reservation time.  He was so pleasant and accommodating, I knew we'd be in for a fantastic evening.  The servers (Joe and someone else whose name I can't remember) were awesome as well.  They were just ON POINT the whole night.  Sommeliers were amazing too (sorry, forgot their names too).  Mr. Cimarusti himself even stopped by to say hello and signed menus for us to take home.   We had the chef's tasting menu and we were there for FIVE AND A HALF HOURS.  The food was fantastic with even more fantastic presentations.  One of the stand outs for me was the kumamoto oyster with a ponzu gelee and lemon foam.  The plays on sweet and savory were interesting although I found a few dishes to be a bit too sweet or a bit too salty.  And although I find foam to be interesting, I thought there was a bit too much of it  - I think there was foam on practically every single one of our dishes.   All in all, my sister and I had a FANTASTIC evening

The chef is known for his inventive seafood creations and outstanding presentation. You can order a la cart, but most patrons recommend one of the tasting menus. There are three tasting menus to choose from: the 5-course, the 9-course and the chef's choice, which includes whatever the chef feels like bringing you. We opted for the 9-course tasting menu. I'll do my best to remember the details, but there were so many great flavors going on that it was hard to keep them straight. Short of taking notes -- and I'm not THAT nuts -- I did the best I could to remember.   We started with three amuse bouches: a gelataneous gin and tonic with a lime that we were instructed to squeeze over the gelatin to get it to foam, a delicate bubble filled with a mojito that we put on our tongue then popped against the roof of our mouth, and lastly a watermelon juice with a touch of wasabi -- not too spicy for me, the spice uass -- and some beans I can't remember the name of. First course was scallops. The dish was light and delicious. Second course was pieces of butter lobster under a thin layer of some gelatin, which was also tasty. The lobster was so tender and delicate and amazing and I would like to be buried in it, thankyouverymuch. Third course was halibut served on a bed of ragu. The halibut was fluffy, which is not easy to do with fish. Amazing! Fourth course was salmon served with baby mushrooms and crispy salmon skin in a tasty foam, which I can't seem to recall the flavor of. Fifth course was a tuna tartare served with a side of toasted brioche. We were told that we could eat the tartare on its own or spread on the toast. I opted for the latter. I'll take any opportunity to have toasted brioche. I'd build my next house with it if I could. This pairing was scrumptious! Sixth course was a very tender veal served over a scoop of super soft mashed potatoes and some sort of reduction. So freakin' good. Seventh course -- are ya still with me? -- was a platter of cheeses that we collectively chose from the cheese cart. We had a combination of delicious hard and soft market cheeses, served with sides of candied walnuts, apple jam, figs and bread. I'd like all my meals to include cheese plates, please. Eighth course was a carrot sorbet on a small bed of wasabi peas. That was the one thing I did not enjoy, but everyone else did. Ninth course was a dessert that included a braised pear, cake, miso ice cream (salty, but surprisingly good), huckleberries and a "huckleberry brush," which is that streak of red along the paint. Not only was it beautiful, it was super tasty! They brought out a post-dessert treat that included chocolate macaroons that reminded me of teeny tiny hamburgers, caramels with anise (or lavender, as my husband claims) and salt, and chocolate truffles. Nine courses sounds like a lot, but really each dish is only a few bites. Plus, it was spread out over FOUR HOURS, so it wasn't as oh-my-god-I'm-going-to-die-because-my-stomach-is-­about-explode as you may think. We also brought our own wine. Corkage fees for the two bottles were $40, I think. The sommelier was quite helpful, the staff was very friendly and the decor was modern and understated.

One of the best restaurants I've been too. Great sea food, amazing service and staff, and great ambiance. My husband and I ordered the 9 course wine paired tasting menu and it was amazing. Uni in a farm fresh egg was to die for and sea bass was so yummy I didn't want it to finish. I would definitely recommend this place.

Providence has been one of my best dining experiences ever. The food is absolutely delicious and the service is incredibly attentive. There is a reason that this place got 2 Michelin Stars. I ordered the Lobster dish and it was cooked to perfection. In fact as we were waiting for our food the waiter informed us the the lobster was not cooked to the chefs liking, so our diner would take a few more minutes. While we waited they brought us a complimentary tray of shots. Each shot was encased in a a bubble. Almost like a giant boba ball with the ball popping in your mouth. It was very interesting. Probably the most interesting shots I've ever had. A few minutes later the lobster arrived. Overall Providence is an excellent dining experience. One of the best places to eat in Los Angeles. Great Service and Awesome Food. The only other place I feel was on par with Providence was The Dining Room at the Langham, which has since changed. Providence is well deserving of hits high rating and Michelin Stars. Often time places are over hyped and once you try it you're disappointed. Providence is not like that. They can back it up, and probably exceed your expectations!

***************** REVIEW 365 ****************** 4.5 STARS!        I took my folks back here for some Truffles love and to celebrate the Holidays. Providence is a staple award-winning resto in LA and an amazing wine list. Although Michelin didn't visit them the last 2 years, but quality of food remains the same by Chef Michael Cimarusti. Well deserved a 2 Michelin Stars!         Fresh Pines & candle light as center pieces for this Holidays, the white Christmas at the bar, high ceiling, but tight tables.           We went with food & wine pairings, and everything was perfectly paired. My dad loves seafood, mom loves meat, so we got best of both worlds for them. AMUSE BOUCHE - 3 bites - Carrot ginger soup, tomato gelée, and another bite. TASTING: - Japanese Kanpachi crispy rice crackers, flowering coriander, soy Crème fraîche - amazing! - Wild alaskan halibut burdock, shiso, lemon - refreshing! - Wild striped bass (Virginia), artichokes, sun-dried tomato, black olive, celery - what a nice surprise. - Hokkaido sea scallop Japan, chanterelles, haricot vert, applewood smoked bacon,Jurançon Sec - I always love the seafood come from Hokkaido!

My experience of Providence occurred back in July before I understood the joys of yelping. It's been haunting me ever since I joined the site so I am compelled to write. Best First Date Ever. Seriously. I'm a pretty much a professional dater, and this one stole the show. I met a guy back in July and we totally bonded over food so he decided to take me to Providence. It was magical from the instant I stepped inside. We chose to go nuts and do the Chef's Tasting Menu with wine pairing, which was so nice of the staff to let us do since we had a 9:30 reservation. The service was impeccable. Our waiter was very friendly and accommodating, with just the right amount of the perfect humor. Each staff member was very knowledgeable of every dish, and when we asked a question he didn't have an answer to, he was quick to return with a response. The time in between courses was brief, just enough for us to chat a bit but we were definitely not rushed. Everything flowed like a dream. The food? Forget about it. I could write out the whole menu for you but it would take the whole day. I can tell you that we both had smiles from ear to ear, and between our oohs and ahhs of our food we beamed at each other lovingly across the table. He had me at the mojito, gin & tonic, greyhound amuse. I fell in love over sweetbreads and uni ravioli, his name etched in plaque down in the deep recesses of my heart. Oh Providence...

This place sure does deserve all the recognition, praise, admiration, approval, and tribute it gets! For those that have rated this place below a 4 star is either crazy or have bad luck! I have been anticipating this place ALL year and what better way to celebrate it than with the best friend for a Christmas dinner. We ordered the 5 course meal with the wine pairing. Knowing that I probably wont be a regular at this place because of the high prices, we decided to go balls to the walls! We started off a small plate of 4 bite size cold appetizer infused with some kind of liquor. The mojito infused jelly was refreshing and mouthwatering. Then there was the melon shooter that was absolutely delightful. I personally enjoyed this dish a lot because of the different ways they presented the fruit, liquor infused dish. The next dish was a sashimi with creme fresh. They sprinkled like a brown crumb life substance to add saltiness and crunchiness to the dish. The fish was very fresh and cut to perfection. The picture I took was the dish already half eaten because I forgot to take a picture of it! I loved it so much I almost forgot to take a picture! The next dish was the diver scallop. WOOOOOOWEEEEEE!!! Tender, juicy, not too salty.. absolutely divine!!! They served it with  an edible flower which added so much to the presentation. Next dish was a halibut entree. The fish was cook perfectly as it flaked off so easily off the plate. This one had so many kinds of flavors bursting from my mouth! Indescribable!!! The next dish was the veal and it was SOOOOO tender and moist. It was cooked medium rare which is how I like it! The wine reduced sauce with mushroom just added to this already perfect savory dish! Dessert time! Light, elegant, and rich! Caramelized banana with vanilla ice cream and bread pudding! WHAAAAA?!?!!?!? Sweet, creamy, decadent, crunchy, a little salty, smooth, and every other adjective you can think of! The wines that were paired with all these dishes were full bodied, not too strong, and had a fruity aftertaste. All the wines were pretty much white since we stayed on the seafood side. To top of the night they gave extra dessert of a chipotle caramel candy, truffle chocolates, and a puff pastry! Service was top notch, the decor was dark and romantic! You would think that with all this food, I would be obese... ok maybe I am... but the portions were small but perfect. Nothing was too overpowering that my pallet wouldn't be able to enjoy the next dish. Great way to end 2010 with the most expensive but the most delicious meal of the year!

Providence is one of those epic meals that you will never forget. A perfect birthday meal. Everything about this place is pure dining ecstasy. Subtle, decorative hints of the ocean put you in the mood for the menu which is primarily of the sea. From tasteful artwork of seascapes, abstract shells bunched in corners along the ceiling, to the candles which look like glowing sea corals, are not over the top, but just enough to engage your ocular senses. An attentive wait staff hops around the room from table to table. The breadlier offers up artisan breads, like fresh baked bacon brioche and olive sourdough mini baguettes. The menu is nothing short of a spectacular display of fresh fish from around the globe. Like Japanese kanpachi, imperial caviar, yellow fin tuna from Hawaii, wild halibut from Alaska, and snapper from Japan. We settle on the Santa Barbara prawns ($33) to start off with. Salt roasted, with hints of rosemary, roasted at 500 degrees for just a few minutes. They bring the prawns out to prepare them at the table. They emerge from their hot salt death beds, cleaned and cut by the server. Then they are drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and served with a slice of lemon.   Next, the lobster risotto, fresh pieces of main lobster stirred with a creamy carnaroli rice, Japanese parsley, lemon, and drizzled with a very light carrot puree. The dish was light and refreshing, perfect to start out with. It's offered in both appetizer size ($26) and entre size ($45) The main courses arrived like fine pieces of art, each one arranged wonderfully. A Wild Alaskan Halibut ($40) in a shallot crust, served with fava beans, baby artichokes, then drizzled with lobster juice and finished with uni butter. Then, the Tai Snapper ($42) with a seared crisp skin, served with roasted sweet peppers, dried chorizo and a potato and black olive salad. The service through the entire meal was top notch. There are tasting menus, 5 courses are $85 or $115 with the wine pairing and the full tasting is $110 or $155 with wine. Mondays are corkage free. From June 15th-21st they are rolling back prices for the five- and nine-course tasting menus to $70 and $90 (more with wines). A very expensive but unbelievable meal, worth every penny.

Last night, we attended the 5x5 Chef's Collaborative at Providence.  Now, I know that I'm a tough rater, but this dinner didn't feel or taste like anything special.  And, it's not like I wasn't in the right state of mind.  I really, really wanted to like this! Let's start from the beginning.  After realizing that I could reschedule my dance class, I called Providence last Wednesday to see if they had a last minute cancellation.  I knew I had a slim to no chance of getting the reservation since it was so late in the process and the receiver of the call informed me that there were 12 parties ahead on the waitlist.  (Wow!) But, as if the heavens parted, I received a call the following evening informing me that there was a last minute cancellation.  Yay!  I was so siked on this dinner. =============== The menu and my reviews of each plate follow: amuse bouche Michael Cimarusti, Providence - This dish was in three parts: ceviche, maki, and flan.  The ceviche was fair.  The squid taste in the sushi wrapped in calamari was too overwhelming that it stayed with you into the flan.  However, the uni in flan was surprisingly delightful.  I liked how the caviar provided the right about of salt and the wasabi gave it just a slight kick. crispy mussels perfumed with nasturtium, vegetables in exotic spice David Kinch, Manresa, Los Gatos, CA - When they say "exotic spice," was that the scent of cumin that I smelled?  I liked the mussels on their own, as they were fresh and delicious, but they didn't need to be crusted.  I wonder what James Beard's nominee for the Best in the Pacific was thinking. uni panna cotta, southern australian rock lobster, udon noodles, dashi-konbu broth Walter Manzke, Bastide - As seafood is always a hit with me, this dish was a nice try but didn't quite hit the spot.  The broth was not hot enough to cook the egg, just thicken it.  However, it was a good broth. turbot with morels, basil scented pea pure, rabbit leg confit and anson mills white corn strewn grits David Lefevre, Water Grill - My turbot must have been sitting under a heat lamp because it was a little tougher than usual.  The rabbit tasted like chicken adobo, but was a fair contrast.  The only redeeming item on this dish were the corn grits. agnolotti di ossobuco, salsa parmigiano Gino Angelini, La Terza, Angelini Osteria - Wonderful!  I could have had this all night.  Well presented, well flavored, perfectly scrumptious. filet of beef "wellington", porcini mushrooms, pommes boulangre, watercress mousseline Josiah Citrin, Melisse - This was good, but not wow.  I took a bite and passed the rest to my boyfriend. harry's berries gaviota strawberries, red bean pure, shiso, black sesame-soy milk ice cream Adrian Vasquez, Providence - Maybe it's just because black sesame is new favorite ice cream, but I thought that this was a great interpretation of East meets West.  The strawberries were savory.  The red bean and cake was reminiscent of a hopia.  And, shiso is always a fine palette cleanser.  A good finish to a mediocre meal.  Thank you, Adrian. Price tag: $215 with pairing.

Providence was my friend's birthday restaurant of choice -- and we celebrated in style.  It was also an auspicious day to pay tribute to my favorite of the deadly sins -- Gluttony.  ;-)   We decided to order a la carte instead of going with the Chef's Tasting Menu, complete with wine pairings.   Our favorite dish, hands-down, was the foie gras ravioli.  It was so good that we ordered a total of 4 (or was it 5? I totally lost count) dishes of the foie gras ravioli between the two of us.  The ravioli skin had a nice texture, smooth, with just the right amount of chewiness -- so thin that it reminded me of a won ton wrapper.  The small piece of foie gras enveloped in the wrapper was perfectly silky, rich, and satisfying.  The shaved Australian black summer truffle gave it that extra earthy flavor that was so so perfect.   Another favorite of mine was the risotto with shaved black truffle.  It was so rich and creamy.  I wished the flavor and aroma of the truffle a little bit stronger though. The scallops were great -- sweet, tender, and tasting of the sea.   I also enjoyed the bacon foccacia bread and must have at least 4 pieces. The amuse bouche which was some sort of smoked herring mousse -- was both interesting and delicious!   There was another amouse bouche compliments of the Chef -- 2 shots of some sort of liqueur...but I didn't really enjoy it that much.   Chef Michael Cimarusti came out and spoke to us!  We really enjoyed learning about the fabulous dishes we tried that evening.  He was so kind to us and it was such a pleasure meeting him!

My family took me here for my bday and the food was delcious.  The combination of ingredients was something I haven't tried before.  We were served this shot of something (not quite sure what it was), but it was very flavorful.  Not particularly my favorite, but it was an interesting palette opener.  We also tried the oyster and tuna tartar.  With the oyster appetizer, they serve 2 different sauces - both good.  The tuna tartar was served with grated wasabi, caviar, nori crackers and quail eggs.  It's an interesting take on the tartar and was surprisingly good. For the entree portion of the meal, I tried the striped bass, John dory, NY steak and black bass. The service is good.  With barnacle decor, the restaurant takes seafood to a whole different level.  I think the decor could be switched up a little more. Otherwise, everyone there is very helpful. I would definitely come back here again.

Not sure if they were nice b/c I'm Opentable VIP, taking pix or maybe we were just rockin' the 'tude.   Night started out rocky: took us over 30 minutes to get down 2 miles on Melrose.   We were ONE hour late, but the maitre'd was ever so gracious on the phone, and told us to 'please drive safe'.  WOW.  Who the heck says THAT?!?!  Someone that cares.  AWW.  Seriously, a warm and fuzzy feeling.   Once we got there, we were seated within a minute and we were met by our server immediately.  I asked if they had a vegetarian version of their tasting menu, the server said the chef needs to be informed prior to the arrival, but he would ask.   Basically, on the fly, there is NO veggie menu.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I just wanted a VARIETY.  Heh heh, my sneakiness backfired, b/c the server came back and asked if I ate fish.  I said YES.  He said that the menu is mainly veg & fish, they can switch out the red meat for something else.  At that point, I had to come clean and let him know that I was not a vegetarian.  Server was a bit miffed that I misled him about my 'dietary needs', but took it in stride and the rest of the meal was harmonious between us.   Since we were on a time constraint, we only had two options, ala carte or the five course, but that was cutting it close.  We enjoyed our meal and made our show, barely missing a beat.   It was a wonderful experience and quite a bargain at $85/pp for 5 courses.  Glasses of wine are fairly pricey, we spent 1/3 of our bill just on three glasses of vino. The standouts were the amuse bouche, a trio of gelatinous goodies, it was a fun twist on cocktails, margarita and gin n tonic.  The halibut was the most moist and tender piece of the usually firm fish I've ever had.  Fantastic.  Must try the chef's veal, cooked medium rare to perfection, lean, tender and the truffle sauce was a bonus.  I ABHOR olives, the pastry at the end included an olive paste, and it was completely delicious.   Thank you Providence for showing me great cooking techniques, excellent service, a beautiful venue and changing my jaded view of olives.

2nd time of being here was even better! I thought I knew this place already, but there were more.  I ordered the dishes I didn't have last time, and everything we had were so tasty and full of flavor. I had an Matsutake chawanmushi, oysters, grilled scallop, and my friends had some fish dishes and they ALL delicious! Having dessert is my favorite moment! An artistic beautiful dessert plate brought me to heaven! Thanks to my friends for taking me here! You can't go wrong with this place.

One of the best places I've ever eaten.  The funny thing is, when I first left I was going to give it a 4, but after letting the memories percolate in my mind, it's nigh impossible to not give it a 5. After a long week of training and work down in Santa Monica, my friend from LA and I went to Providence, an eagerly-awaited foray into one of the top 50 restaurants in the country.  We had a 7:30p reservation, but arrived about 20 minutes early.  They were happy to seat us as the place was only about 1/4 full.  By 8:30p the place was packed.  We got seated next to a column, which my friend didn't like, so we asked to be moved and without hesitation they moved us.  The place is dimly lit, but there are lights right above each table.  The decor is modest but tasteful, and the service was impeccable. We each got the full 9-course tasting menu, one with wine pairing and one without.  Given how much wine came with each course, that was a wise decision.  Nearly a half glass per pairing, 7 pairings.  Yeah, that's perfect for two people.  I'm not a wine expert, but I know what I like.  Now to the food, and don't forget to view the pictures!!! Bread.  Fresh non-sourdough bread with medallions of butter and sea salt.  I only had a few bites of this to start me off. Course 0.  Amuse Bouche.  Seafood salad accompanied with a fennel soup and saffron foam.  The soup and foam were not my favorite, but I drank it all.  The soup tasted better immediately after a nibble at the seafood salad, which was fantastic.  I wish this was not an amuse bouche and I had more than a spoonful. Course 1. Japanese Kanpachi.  Accompanied with soy, matsutake mushrooms, and wasabi sorbet.  The fish was lightly seasoned, fresh, and delicious.  The wine pairing was a vinho verde, neblina 2005.  Excellent pairing. Course 2. Santa Barbara Sea Urchin Sabayon.  My third-favorite course.  Served in an eggshell, topped with truffled julienne with brioche croutons on the side.  I loved this, and I usually don't like uni.  It was warm, creamy, and delicious.  You have to be careful dipping the croutons in the shell, as the sabayon may spill out.  The wine pairing was hakkaisan, junmai ginjyo.  Good pairing. Course 3.  Parsnip Puree.  With sweetbreads and truffles julienne.  I'm not usually a fan of sweetbreads, but they tasted fantastic in the warm puree.  I wanted to lick the bowl, but that would have been gauche.  The wine pairing was muscat sec, mas las cabes 2005.  I'm not a big fan of muscat--too sweet--so I didn't particuarly like it. Course 4.  New England Bay Scallops.  My favorite course.  Paired with sauteed beets over a beet reduction.  The scallops were lightly sweet and seared  perfectly.  The sear gave a hint of bitterness which paired well with the sweetness of the beets.  The wine pairing was venaccia di san gimignano, mormoraia 2005.  Excellent pairing. Course 5.  John Dory.  This piece of fish was paired with artichoke over chorizo sausage.  Chorizo powder was on the side to add flavor.  I didn't find the John Dory particularly flavorful, so the powder helped.  There were no bad courses, but this was my least favorite.  Wine pairing was ... hmm, maybe too drunk to remember that one.  :) Course 6.  Quinault River Wild King Salmon.  This was almost my favorite course.  The salmon was lightly cooked and set with a crispy salmon skin on a bed of chanterelle mushrooms and celery root foam.  The salmon was incredible.  It was succulent and tender, maybe one of the best pieces of salmon I've ever had.  Wine pairing was lagrein 2005.  Great pairing. Course 7.  Market Cheeses.  Admittedly, I don't remember what cheese there were, but one of them was really really stinky.  That's right, stinky.  It wasn't gorgonzola but it was pretty rancid.  Wine pairing was malbec, el felino 2004.  OK wine pairing. Course 8.  Grapefruit Sorbet.  This was over a bed of campari with a small sprig of tarragon.  It was a perfect sorbet; light, sweet, tart, and refreshing. Course 9.  Pumpkin Bread.  A two-layer stack of bread was serviced with carrot-coconut ice cream over a savory mole.  My friend and I both loved this dish.  She loved it so much she eventually asked for the recipe from the pastry chef, who was more than happy to share, much to her delight.  She's already made it several times in the last two weeks and it's been a hit! The last offering was a plate of sweets.  I was too stuffed to have any but my friend snagged them for later. Overall the meal was fantastic.  One of the best in the last few years.  Like I said, I was on the fence about giving it a 4 or 5, but the positive response from the pastry chef, the impeccable service and the overall fantastic experience swayed by to give it a 5.  And I don't give a lot of 5s.  I'm a bell curve kinda guy.  The price for two was an even $300, but I think it was well worth it and I look forward to going again to order specific dishes like the porkbelly and lobster.

We took advantage of being in Southern California over Valentine's Day weekend to secure a table at Providence for dinner that evening.  Of note was the fact that they wanted me to fax in my confirmation after signing an agreement that stated if I canceled less than 72 hours prior to the big day, there would be a $100 charge for each person.   We had high expectations, and except for a slight miscalculation with the bill at the end of the evening, dinner was perfect.  We arrived for the early seating, and were seated immediately, though we were a few minutes early, under some light, as we had requested.  The kitchen staff were still meeting, and we could overhear the very meticulous instructions ... "table 4 has been here twice, and there is one vegetarian in the party..." On Valentine's Day there is only 1 option - the Chef's tasting menu with 7 set courses. There werre also several market specials for the day, oysters and caviar among them.  For course #4 I decided to go with the Wagyu strip loin ($70 supplement); the husband opted for the Artic char.  We also decided to share a market special "appetizer" of Santa Barbara spotted prawn to our meal. 1) Breads: I *loved* their breads -- Foccacia with nori and Brioche with very smokey bacon bits.  I tried my hardest not to eat more of these -- I wanted to save myself for the meal. 2) Amuse: a bit of house-cured trout with a bit of pickled shimeiji mushroom and crispy rice puffs accompanied with parsnip soup + coffee syrup; and a tiny brioche bun stuffed with lobster salad.  All delicious bites -- Danny felt that the syrup a bit too sweet, but I (surprsingly enough) thought it just fine. 3) 1st course: Tartare of big eye tuna: crispy buckwheat, cauliflower parfait, american caviar.  Pairing: sparkling Pinot Nero, Fantinel MV.  I thought that the cauliflower "parfait" concept was a bit too much like the cauliflower panna cotta at French Laundry but Providence's version was very delicious nontheless -- perhaps even better than FL... the tartare was definitely helped by the pairing since it needed a bit more acid.  This was one of the dishes that the wine truly enhanced. 4) 2nd course: Santa Barbara spotted prawn supplement.  Roasted whole in salt and served tableside, heads and all, with a bit of french olive oil -- this was a marvelous, simple and astonishing dish.  The prawn tasted almost like lobster.  And yes, it was fun eating all the tasty bits of prawn head. 5) 3rd course: Lobster cooked sous-vide with braised endive, blood orange beurre blanc and basil.  The lobster was utterly tender and sweet; I thought the beurre could have been more buttery; but its tang did help tame the richness of the dish. 6) 4th course: Cod with tahitian squash, black truffle, pureed leeks.  This was my least favourite dish of the evening.  The fish was cooked well enough, but the truffle was not as pungent as I had hoped -- smelled almost like the himalayan truffle we bought a few months ago -- less aromatic and a little more like old socks...  Danny thought they should have served more pureed leeks. 7) Intermezzo: another very cool concept of a trio of "cocktails:"  gin & tonic sphere, frozen mojito cube, greyhound sphere.  Put the sphere in your mouth and its thin skin bursts, spilling out flavours. 8) 5th course: my favourite dish of the evening, (which may or may not be a little ironic since Providence is known for their seafood,) was the 4 oz. Wagyu strip loin in all its fatty, tasty glory, topped with a knob of marrow and served with sweet Nantes carrots and teeny tiny shimeiji mushrooms.  My mouth waters recalling it. 9) 6th course: finally - we're at desserts, and I could have had this Litchi, Rose and Raspberry offering and would have been fine ending there.  It was refreshing and very playful -- the white sorbet was rose flavoured; the pink macaron litchi.   10) 7th course: Milk Chocolate strands, passion-fruit puree, banana, chile-spiced peanut butter, candied peanuts.  I'm not a banana fan, but this dessert did elevate that humble fruit to something sublime. 11) Mignardises: salted caramels a bit too salty; chocolate truffle with chile were amazing; Manresa has better pate de fruits... We received a box of chocolates afterwards as well -- definitely some of the most amazing chocolates I'd ever tasted (some flavours: white chocolate calamansi mint; dark chocolate orange rosemary caramel...) And yes, though they made some crazy mistakes with the bill, overcharging by over $200, they apologized profusely, and  we'd definitely go back if we were in the area again...

My boyfriend decided to surprise me when I casually mentioned that I was in the mood for some steak by taking me to this place...Providence.  It's hardly the steakhouse I was expecting but the food was creative and exceptional.   We were VERY early for dinner so we were the only customers in the restaurant for a little while, and I was in jeans and a t-shirt with my hair in a bun.  However, the staff treated us really well and there were no uppity attitudes to deal with, which is nice from a Michelin star caliber restaurant, (even though the 2 stars were given in 2009.)   Overall, the food was yummy, the service was very nice, and the atmosphere was light and airy.  The lobster ravioli was very good and the amuse bouche we were provided (crab pastry) was excellent.  The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because I thought that the chef was a little bit "foam happy."  There was parmesan foam on ALL the dishes!  Not the greatest to look at and not a wonderful texture I want in my mouth. Overall, it's a good place to try out if you're used to going to expensive restaurants and want to see what this one's all about.  The food IS really good.  But if you're trying to do something special, the food just wasn't spectacular enough to hook you to $200 meals for the rest of your life.

Gather the best LA chefs, give them Bocuse's famous recipes, tell them to run with it, and you have the blissful Bocuse d'Or benefit dinner. This six course meal with optional wine pairing started off  with the creation of Josiah Citrin's (chef of the Michelin 2 star award winning Melisse!) duck stuffed with foie gras, truffle and pistachio. They had me at foie gras.. then again at truffle.  The pate was delicious!!!  Good start... Second course was lobster fricasse with tomato and brandy by the one and only Walter Manzke of Church and State. (One of my favorite restaurants!)  I love the gold flakes and the creamy sauce.  We can't really go wrong with lobster, can we? Third course was the dish I was very much looking forward to ~ the foie gras and black truffle puff pastry.  (I don't blame the protesters for picketing outside..  the chefs were quite generous with their servings of foie gras in these courses!) This was Alain Giraud's (ex Church and State chef, currently at Anisette) interpretation of one of Bocuse's most famous dishes. Unfortunately, perhaps my expectations were way too high, I was a little disappointed by how brothy the soup was.  The presentation was awesome though.  Note to self: learn the art of creating puff pastry. Fourth course was my absolute favorite dish of the night:  wild french rouget sauteed in potato scales.  This was so creative ~ the potatoes were cut into delicate shapes of scales and sauteed to create the texture and taste of fish skin.  Brilliant!  This was made by Providence's very own Michael Cimarusti.  "You like Mikey's dish?" asked our waiter .  "Hell. Yes." we replied. Time for the palate cleanser:  beaujolais sorbet.  yum! We proceeded onto the fifth course:  loin of venison, created by Tony Esnault of Patina.   I'm not a big fan of deer but this one was quite tender and juicy.  A bit on the salty side though as I could see reminisce of sea salt melting on the meat.  By this time, I was pretty full... and I was struggling to leave room for dessert. Dessert was a trio of orange crepe, tarte tatin, and creme brulee created by Providence's pastry chef, Adrian Vasquez.   The creme brulee was amazing.  I'll have to remember to order this again the next time I'm here. All in all it was a wonderful experience.  I've always loved Providence and even more so now.  The chefs were super friendly, making rounds to greet each table.  I even got to snatch a photo with them.  It was a very memorable experience.   If you've never experience Providence, do try their tasting menu. You won't regret it.   Great service, amazing food, beautiful ambiance.  Recommended!

First and foremost, this is not my first (nor my last) fine dining experience. It was, however, my first dining experience at Providence. I absolutely couldn't be more thrilled than I am right now. Last night, a group of friends and I descended upon Providence like hungry vultures. We had  all agreed to do a tasting menu and went with the specials, as well as a wine pairing. Prepare yourself for a very, very, long review... Bread: Nori Focaccia, Bacon Brioche, & French Roll Nori tasted interesting and was very delicious but the Bacon Brioche stole my heart. In fact, we loved them so much, we placed an order to go! Amuse: We were presented with several different Amuse Bouches for the evening. First, we were given 2 cocktails in 2 ways - Screwdriver (spherified) & a Mojito (almost like a shaved ice cube of awesome). I loved both and would love to have all of my cocktails in a creative way like this! Second up, a flurry of various items. Trout pastry garnished  with caviar, scrambled egg pastry garnished with more caviar, tomato and mozzarella cheese with more pastry, crispy wheat cracker, crispy salmon skin, and finally - a cold tomato water soup with some fennel foam. Out of the batch, I absolutely adored the soup and the salmon skin. Finally, there was a round of miso marinated  grilled abalone and fried squid and chorizo. Out of all  the Amuse Bouches, the most memorable and palate pleasing were probably the tomato water soup with fennel foam and cocktails. I am incredibly satisfied with everything else too, but the aforementioned were absolutely wonderful. First Course: Everyone else got the Tuna Tartar, but because I really am not a fan of Tuna, the waiter and chef both were great about letting me swap out my Tuna for Crab instead. While everyone else had their Tuna Tartar and raved about it, I was very happy with my crab in melon soup. It was light and fresh and a very nice way to start off my meal. Second Course: Grilled Spot Prawn with smoked prawn butter. While I am not a huge fan of having to peel the shrimp on my own, it was so yummy that I didn't mind at all in this case! The prawn was perfectly cooked, the prawn butter was a depth of flavor and had both the prawn flavor and the smokiness perfectly balanced. The prawn also came with a side of salt and a slice of lemon. I squeezed my lemon over my freshly peeled prawn before dipper into the prawn butter and everything was perfectly balanced - great acidity, great depth, lots of flavor. Just perfect. Third Course: Our third course was supposed to be Octopus, but we ended up asking to swap that out for a delicious Fois Gras Ravioli with a slice of black truffle on top. Holy shit, this is the best thing I have ever had in my life... EVER. It was so rich and delicious and I am positive that next time I go back to Providence, I will be eating plate after plate of JUST this. I cannot strongly recommend that you try this on your visit to Providence. I mean it, you wont regret this at all. I am drooling a little just thinking about it. Fourth Course: After having our third course, I don't think any of us really thought food could compare, but we were pleasantly surprised. We had a truffle risotto with  freshly shaved black truffle on top. Essentially, the server brought out a box o' truffles and shaved a generous portion on each of our plates. It was superb and actually was a great way to bring us down from the super rich third course we had just consumed. Fifth Course: Waygu Beef, ribeye cut. Bone marrow gastric = delicious. I was *almost* too full to finish this. I made myself eat every last bite and I am so glad I did. There were not a ton of components on this dish and I was happy about it - simple and perfectly cooked ribeye. Sixth (Dessert) Course: Chocolate Ganach. I am totally not a huge fan of chocolate and this dessert was way too rich for me, but everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy it a great deal. They served it with graham cracker ice cream and plated with dollops of toasted marshmallow. It was like a sophisticated play on a smore and that made me smile. My waiter noticed that I was not a huge fan of the chocolate and then brought me out a plate full of vanilla macaroons to munch on by my lonesome. Wines: Honestly, I cannot remember ANY of the names, but they were all great pairings. I loved some more than others, but their wines were of a great selection. Service: Again, holy shit, most amazing service. I cannot, for the life of me, understand how people can review this place and claim they were not accommodating. Every person on staff  catered to our every need and changed the set menus just because I am a picky eater. Our server rocked and was super attentive. We literally had 4-5 people making sure we were all well taken care of. If you're thinking about dining here, DO IT. It is amazing and I cannot stress how awesome of an experience we had.

Here comes a bold statement:  Providence was the best dining experience I've ever had.  After watching Cimarusti on Top Chef Masters last week, my friends and I were excited to come out and try his menu. Unfortunately, it wasn't until after we made our 9pm reservations that we realized that the tasting menu was only offered until 8:30.   So we were surprised when our waiter graciously asked us if we'd be having the tasting menu that night.  Score!  We were concerned, though, because one of my friends is allergic to shellfish, dairy, and eggs (yes, that's right - I don't want to imagine what such an existence would be like either!), but the waiter immediately said that the chef could prepare a separate tasting menu to accommodate my friend.   Everyone at the table agreed that our meals were wonderful.  Perfectly executed and amazing flavor combinations, Cimarusti truly is a master with seafood.  The drinks, too, were meticulously made and perfectly poured, down to the freshly cut garnish.  Service, of course, was impeccable.  Everyone from the host to the bartender to the waiters were amazingly good at making sure every detail of the evening would be perfect.  Providence is my favorite Michelin dining experience yet, and I'm definitely going to be looking for excuses to go back!

There's nothing I love more than spoiling a boyfriend by taking them out for a nice meal for their birthday.  It works out for me too since I have an excuse to splurge on a place that I've always wanted to try.  Luckily for me too I only go for foodies that can appreciate fine dining.  I was very excited to try Providence when I found out they had been upgraded to two Michelin stars in 2009.  And they definitely deserved it.  From the moment I entered, the service was phenomenal and truly stood out as noteworthy.  Their martinis are extremely well made...I tried the asian pear martini and the fresca martini...both delicious. We decided on the full 9 course tasting ($110/person) and shared the wine pairing (extra $55).   Amuse Bouche...trio of gin & tonic cube, Margarita sphere, and salmon with some other stuff - I really liked how the margarita sphere exploded in your mouth to release liquid goodness...very unique texture. Japanese Kanpachi (crispy rice crackers, coriandor, soy) - again the texture was nice with the crispy crackers and the sushi.  I liked how the flavors were very complex yet really balanced each other.  The dry muscat 'gessimi' granoma 2008 was very light and refreshing and paired really well with the dish. Santa Barbara Sea Urchin (served in a farm fresh egg, champagne berre blanc, fines herbs) - the poached egg really blended in with the sea urchin so that there was no hint of fishiness at all.  The white burgogne blanc was again also very light and crisp. Nancys Diver Scallops (chanterelles, english peas, sweet pea purrieslieng) - cooked perfectly.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.  I think they paired this with a riesling that was very sweet but still very good. Halibut (smoked paprika, potatoes, squid) - the fish was so moist and just seemed to melt in your mouth.  At this point the wine tastings start to get blurry, hehe. Seared Salmon - by this point in the meal, my memory starts getting even fuzzier...they are very generous with the wine pairings, lolz.  This dish was good but not as remarkable as the others.  I think this is when they gave us this white wine but it tasted like a red one because it was so full bodied...very unique. Veal Tenderloin (white asparagus, macaroni gratin, shallot confit) - this was hands down the highlight of the night.  The veal was super tender...considering they had cooked it for 2 hours but so slowly that it wasn't overcooked at all but still medium rare.  This was paired with a rose I think. Market Cheeses - By this point in the meal, I was starting to get stuffed.  The servings looked small at first so I had 2 pieces of bread and I think that was my undoing.  I was so full already and there were still 2 more courses to go, ahh!  I really liked the stronger more pungent cheeses.  It also came with walnuts, figs, apple and mango spread, and bread.  This red wine was very acidic at first but when paired with the strong cheeses it brought out a sweetness in the wine that was a very nice contrast. Tangerine Sorbet and cream - so even though I was stuffed I still finished this whole dish cuz it was soo good.  The sorbet was tart and slightly bitter but it balanced out the slightly sweet cream.  It was definitely a revelation of opposites mellowing each other out and complimenting each other. Yuzu Curd and meringe (raspberry sorbet, blackberries, white whoppers) - this was such a strange combination of tastes but somehow it still all came together very well.  I think what makes this dish so unique is when you first taste it you're not sure if you really like it but when you start combining all the flavors you realize that as a whole it's so much better than the individual ingredients.  The wine pairing with this was the only thing about the whole tasting menu I didn't really like.  It was a very rich muscat which might've been great as a dessert wine on it's own but after the end of such a full tasting felt like it was just overkill.  Too sweet and rich. And finally to end they had one more plate with a trio of yuzu sugared cubes which had a hint of tartness and bitterness, a caramel stick that was super sweet and yet salty at the same time, and a chocolate mint that was refreshing if a little overly sweet. By this time, I was ready to be rolled out of the restaurant I was so full.  I definitely feel like I got my money's worth.  So happy to have finally crossed this one off my list of places to try.  It was definitely the best meal I've had in a very long time.

No other place better than Providence for me to do my 1st review on... Not just on the amazing meal, ambiance & service, however on it being the most expensive meal I have had to pay for thus far..I decided that for this moment alone it deserve to be paid homage to.. Hence Providence for de-virginizing me in terms of reviews...=) Went on a Sunday for the Significant Other's bday.. Decided upon the full tasting menu w/ wine pairing, 2 bottled water and adding in the foi gras a la planca for a unforgettable foodie experience. Everything from the bread to the butter, apps to the main course, cheese cart to the dessert was excellent. The night ended w/ some coffee and me finally figuring out that it was Soleil Moon-Frye (remember Punky Brewster) dining w/ her better half right next to me.  Total damage for dinner for 2 including tip roughly $400 (give or take a little). Worth every penny and I'd do again. Now just waiting for another excuse..but damn the SO's bday is only 1x a year....Now I wait.. The restaurant ambiance was beautifully set. The service was great and attentive. FOB-out moment of the night was when I stepped away for the little girl's room and came back with a newly folded napkin.  Yea..just imagine my look of amazement as I tried to relish in the fact that I was being serviced so greatly.. Felt as if I've been living under a rock.. No complaint other than that I didn't order the Santa Barbara spot prawns as Punky  did... cuz damn those things looked good as it was being cooked via her table side...Mistake of the night but that just gives me yet another excuse to go back...

So after years of reading yelp reviews, I have decided to finally jump on the boat.  and does Providence make an AMAZING first review.   I have to say, I'm a little cynical when it comes to pricey, so-called "critically acclaimed" restaurants. Despite all my best efforts to love these types of places, i usually just end up disappointed. And poor.  But no disappointment here! Providence was EXCEPTIONAL in every sense of the word. My friends and I did the 9-course tasting menu (plus we added on an extra truffle course) and every single moment of the experience was, for lack of a better word, perfection. Though all the dishes were impeccably prepared, the sea urchin in the egg shell was my hands-down favorite.  It's been said in other reviews, but OHHH! the rich creamy lusciousness and explosion of flavor!!! i can still taste it now. Another standout: the truffles with scrambled eggs. Now, its not on the tasting menu, but it sure is good!! I was a little perplexed by the thought of decadent, earthy summer truffles  scattered on top of plebeian scrambled eggs, but the combination is truly HEAVENLY.  yummmm.  i could write all day about the food, but GO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!! The presentation of the dishes was beautiful.  The attention to detail and respect that each ingredient is given on the plate is remarkable.  I normally think its tacky, but i wish i took a picture of all the dishes we ate! My only slight criticism with Providence would have been our waiter.  Now, he really wasn't that bad, but I would have appreciated a little more formality and a feeling of excitement towards the food.  When he handed us the menu, he told us, "the set stuff is on the left, and then on the right you have the hot apps, and the cold apps".  is it really that much more effort to say APPETIZERS? And  you don't have to do much to make the dishes sound amazing--they really speak for themselves--but he described them quickly and robotically.  I mean, come on, we're paying top buck here! Play the food up a little! But really though, Providence is without question one of the best, if not THE BEST, restaurants in Los Angeles.  If you're looking to treat yourself, this is the place to go.

Girlfriend of  previous reviewer agrees! Generous wine pours (I was totally tipsy at the end of our meal) and exciting tasting menu = 5 stars and my heart. Reading the tasting menu got me so excited for my meal and it totally delivered. Their kampachi dish was the most beautiful and tasty kampachi dish I've had at a non-sushi restaurant. And the crispy salmon skin chip they served up with the salmon dish made me drunkly exclaim "They should make these into chips and bag them so I can eat them all the time!" I will say though, the only thing that weirded me out about the restaurant was all the BEIGE. Top to bottom beige decor and the waiters walked around in beige uniforms that made them look like massage therapists. If you like that subdued sort of eating environment you will REALLY love this place. But if you just love seafood, like me, you will get over the plain decor and immerse yourself in the fantastic food.

I had heard and read about Providence many times over the past couple of years. So when a friend of mine invited me to be a +1 to a birthday dinner, it only took a few minutes to call her back and say YES. Nevermind that I would not know anyone at this gathering. This was my spot at only LA restaurant in Los Angeles with a Michelin star rating. I was excited about going for days before the actual dinner. I read and re-read yelp reviews in anticipation. I already gave it a 5 star before I even visited. I'm not normally a super perky person, but I do appreciate a smile and warm greeting when I receive one. The reception I received from the hosts felt as icy as a scene from Six Feet Under. Pardon me for picking your fine establishment. Our dinner party hadn't arrived yet, so my friend and I ventured to the bar area for a cocktail. Its always great to watch a good bartender craft a good cocktail. A wonderful show to watch him mix and put those little touches on the final drink. Thumbs up to the bar area. Apparently the dinner party was a very large group -- I believe up to 16 people? Providence couldn't handle that big a group so they divided us into separate rooms at separate tables, which was odd in itself. That completely the dynamic of the whole event. but thats a separate story and not mine to tell. I was only there for the food. I would not bring a large group to this restaurant. At the most I would have a group of 4. In saying that, I would recommend the small group ALL order a tasting menu, whether its 5 or 9 courses. Even the staff suggested that the whole group do a tasting menu rather than some of us. That is good advice to heed. I chose the 9 course wine tasting menu (rather, I shared the wine) with my dinner partner. Sadly, the rest of our group did not, so they watched us for the a good part of meal. (HA!) The tasting menu was a huge adventure. A 3 hour adventure that left me drunk with food and dizzy with coma. I was stuffed to the gills. A fantastic food experience. However my rating may not match my praises or memory. I had to stew on my experience for a long time before I posted anything. I wanted to make sure my thoughts or recollections reflected how I felt. Much of the hard rating reflects the high expectations I have of a highly rated restaurant. I've shared with friends that the food was very good. In fact each dish separately were very good as a separate dish. But after having the full tasting, I found it disjointed from amuse bouche to the dessert courses. I had expected a clear distinct travel in my 9 course, but instead I left heavy and slightly confused at the experience. The dishes felt heavier and heavier as it progressed. The dishes just blew my palate out by the time I ended the meal. I couldn't see how the heavy chocolates and macarons related to the delicate dishes I had to start. I omit the dish by dish critique of Providence. Enough people have done that already. A few highlights that stand out are the cocktail gelees (very creative), the lamb course (one of the most tender pieces of animal I have ever tasted), blood orange sorbet (beautiful to look at and eat), and clearly my favorite course that still brings back vivid memories is the uni egg with rice crisps (amazing). As I said shared earlier, I enjoyed each dish separately. In saying so, the wine pairing for each dish were superb. Each wine did compliment and highlight the flavors of each dish that was presented. I applaud Providence for this. Also, the service I received seemed a little disjointed as the dishes. I enjoed each person separately but as a team it seemed I didn't know what or who was helping. They seemed to come at me at every end to the point of confusion for me. My lead waiter was very professional and I wished he was the only staff that tended to me. I appreciated his efforts throughout the night. I actually made a huge faux pas and returned later in the evening to correct it when I could have easily just passed it off another day. I am being harsh with Providence because it IS a very good restaurant. Likely my experience is because we had a large group, I give you that. I'd probably come for a smaller tasting menu to try another experience. I'd recommend Providence to others with some asterisks.

On the way to Melrose from the 101 freeway, I would always see this modern looking restaurant in an obscure area and wanted to stop by but never did.   From reading many good yelp reviews about Providence I decided to try it out.  To my surprise, it is the same restaurant that I always pass. Last Friday, I decided to change up my usual Friday sushi meal by trying seafood.  I know not a big leap but a person needs to crawl before walking.   The inside has a modern feel to it without feeling cold and faintly exuded seafood restaurant with its plain white faux sea shells displayed on the corner walls.  The candles and the coffee creamer were cool and actually could be bought (I know random but the server let us know after we commented on them). They provided complimentary sashimi tartar with some sort of sweet and creamy shot that really went well with the sashimi.  We proceeded with the foie gras a la plancha, which was good and more than enough for two.  I had the wild striped bass which was fantastic.  The fish was moist yet the skin was lightly fried and it came along with bits of calamari and a fantastic sauce.  For dessert, we had the miso pineapple with mango sorbet.  It sounds like an odd combination but everything works together.  I apologize to Providence because my descriptions don't do it justice.   The only turn off:  I understand this is a fancy restaurant but please throw me a bone and have some free refills on diet soda.  Its not like I didn't order wine and coffee.

So far, the restaurant crown gem of my collection, ha ha.  Seriously though, Providence was all I expected and more.  Despite a few serving mistakes, I can't give this place anything less than 5-full stars-IT IS THAT GOOD!  M & I shared the 5-course tasting menu sans wine pairings since I had to drive, although I did indulge in Japanese White Ale that complemented the seafood courses spectacularly (I can't wait for my local Whole Foods to begin carrying it!) I will hit the misses before starting the food review; there were only 2 glaring omissions I noted.  First, I was not presented the wine/alcohol list when seated, but probably because I called the restaurant and told them that M doesn't drink alcohol even though I never mentioned that I wouldn't mind the list.  This could be a small oversight or just general consideration on their part.  The second was our server not offering any coffee until AFTER we finished our dessert course.  While annoying, I am glad because I probably would have said yes and it wouldn't have paired well with the night's dessert that I will describe later.  On to the food... Bread:  After ordering the tasting menu with our spot-on server the bread man came by and offered a selection of 3 breads:  Whole Wheat, Nori focaccia, and the Holy Grail that redefined bread for me BACON BRIOCHE!  Never again will I want anything besides that savory brioche filled with finely diced bacon pieces throughout, it was heaven.  I liked the Nori bread next and then the whole wheat, but the other 2 were way better than standard restaurant bread in their own right, especially the Nori focaccia. Amuse:  Gruyere-filled Gougere, Wassabi encrusted tofu marshmallow, and a "shot" of lemon gel topped with trout sashimi, trout roe, foam, and edible gold leaf. We started with the gougere; imagine an explosion of warm cheese in your mouth with butter pastry, sinful. The tofu mallow went next and it had a creamy texture with just the hint of horseradish, a perfect segue into the "shot."  The shot reminded me of a deviled egg taste at first when all the components were in a single bite.  It was awesome as well and prepared me for the first course. #1: Japanese Kanpachi-crispy rice crackers, coriander, soy crème fraiche.  This course was a very light and delicious way to start the evening.  The Kanpachi alone was delicious and combining all of the components together was a flavorful culinary punch. #2: Nancy's Diver Scallops-chanterelles, snap peas, applewood smoked bacon, jurancon sec.  Hot damn!  Second best dish of the evening; a perfectly cooked scallop is a treat and these were still rare on the inside.  The scallops were tender, buttery; the small lardons of bacon provided a nice smoky undertone while the mushrooms lent earthiness and the carrots/peas some lightness and crunch. #3: Wild Black Bass-burdock, shiso, lemon.  I love when a chef renders the skin on a piece of fish and serves it with it still intact.  The fish itself was cooked perfectly medium to medium-rare, staying tender while the sauces were neither over nor underwhelming but gave the dish some body.  A good dish but probably my least favorite of the night. #4: Roasted Tenderloin of Veal-crushed butterball potatoes, sierra sweet onions, hazelnuts, garlic confit.  Easily my favorite course of the night and it was my first time having meat cooked via sous-vide.  The meat was extremely rare and that is the way I likes it!  The technique left it super tender and kept the flavor intact.  Every component alone tasted good but combing bites with the veal and potatoes made the dish a home run.  OI loved the crunch of the hazelnuts, the garlic confit = divinity because I LOVE garlic cloves, and the two onion components added great depth. #5: Yuzu curd, meringue, vanilla-white chocolate sorbet, pineapple, and mint.  Imagine a lemon meringue pie deconstructed with white chocolate sorbet and you have this dish, a nice, light way to end the evening. I never knew white chocolate and lemon were a great combination. The curd was so full of lemon I thought I was eating an actual lemon and the sorbet paired well with it. It was fun to assemble each bite but sad at the end when I realized the night was almost over! Mignardises:  "Vanilla cubes," rosemary scented caramels, & dark chocolate-espresso truffles:  All were great; I loved the caramel with the light, airy essences of rosemary that went with the buttery taste. What made the food and experience great was that you could tell the chefs and Mr. Cimarusti take pride and care in what they send out of their kitchen, My main peeve when eating out is food that is slopped on the plate and you can tell you are a number only.  Each individual presentation was memorable and you could tell pride went into it. The experience was memorable and it is the best-presented, quality meal I have ever had the experience to enjoy.  Plus, Laurence Fishburne was sitting 2 feet away so I got my celebrity sighting in.

Came here for my birthday and got the set "chef's" menu.  Everything was exquisite and well prepared, but if I came again I would just go with some truffles main course dish and skip all the samplers.  I dunno, I know girls go for that kind of stuff, but to me it just feels like I'm eating appetizers all night.   The cheese plate at the end of the meal was very good.  Love the presentation of the cart and the wide variety.. too much food! We had to take a doggie bag-o. ambience is nothing very special at all.  both inside the restaurant and the surrounding melrose ghetto.  just hard ass concrete.. overall, great place to eat though.

I'm sure the 2 Michelin Stars oughta have reeled you in. So I'll skip right to it.. The 5 course is already very filling! It's about a $30 diff if you get it with the wine pairing..which I did... great convos. ;) If you don't eat that much.. this is WAY more than enough! =) It has a fabulous spread of all that Providence has to offer! But if you're so inclined... get the 9 course... which is ridiculously yummy as well. You get a cheese platter which is quite nice. =) There's also a 15 course.. but you're just asking for trouble, buddy. ;) You can order the 15 course, only if everyone in your party does too. You can order the 9 course with a 5 course. You can order a 5 course with a 5 course or entree... Yes, it was kinda confusing, but oh well. Plus they come around with fabulous yummy bread...see my pictures! =) Ambiance and service are top notch. Be sure to make reservations!!! Park on the side streets and avoid the $5.50 fee. Oh .. and be prepared to put a dent in your wallet, because you will...oh you will..... ;)

3.5 stars for the food and 4.5 stars for the impeccable service and decor.  I expected to be blown away by the food as this is a 2 Michelin star restaurant, but I left wondering if it was all hype.  Don't get me wrong -- the dishes were delicious, beautiful and innovative, but some were slightly flavorless.   We started off with an amuse bouche of cauliflower pureed soup, a mojito gelee, a cheese puff, and vodka with grapefruit juice which looked like an egg yolk.   I enjoyed the cheese puff the most.  Soft and airy and tasted like it was cooked in bacon. - Bread: Seaweed focaccia, a white roll and bacon brioche.  Obviously, the bacon brioche was my fave - Prime New York Steak with duck fat potatoes and porcini mushrooms: Thoroughly enjoyed it - Big Eye Tuna (Ecuador): Delicious and melts in your mouth - Striped Bass: I really wanted Halibut, but they didn't have it that night.  WTH!  The striped bass was very flaky and moist.  A pinch of salt would have brought out the flavor. - Kanpachi sashimi: The kanpachi was served with a mayo-based sauce with an endive leaf and rice crackers. The cut on the kanpachi was a bit thick, but the endive and crackers were a nice contrast to the fish - Veal tenderloin, hazelnuts, roasted garlic, King Edwards potatoes, onion, veal jus: Perfectly cooked. It was very tender but needed a little more seasoning - Banana bread pudding w/ barley ice cream: Tasty but not memorable - Chocolate bar: Same as above - Macaroon, yuzu pepper salted caramel and chocolate truffle: The macaroon was bland but the salted caramel and truffle were delightful - 5-6 glasses of wine.  *grin*

Had high expectations for this place and tried the 5 course fix meal. *5 courses are now $95 w/o wine pairing *Valet = $5.50 *Seating was just too close together *minus rude tables on both sides of us* *We both left hungry after the meal. *Entrees came out in 30 min increments, our reservation was at 7:30pm and main course didn't come till 9pm. *Servers were professional but not overly friendly; it was difficult to understand what they were saying also.

I dined here twice with my foodie group during Providence's 6th Anniversary Special (which was their regular 5-course tasting menu that was discounted by $25.00) back in late June and July 31st, and we all had a wonderful time there.  The service was spot on during each visit, and their 5-Course Tasting Menu was very satisfying.   In addition, we were served a few amuse bouche at the beginning to stimulate our taste buds, and the first dish was a wonderful sample of molecular gastronomy, as we were served a dish with a mojito cube that just melted in your mouth, and a screwdriver ball that just pops in your mouth and fills it with a nice shot, much like biting into an egg yolk on a sunny side up egg. The 5-course tasting menu that we had both times feature 3 courses of seafood: a hamachi, a seared scallop, and a fish; with the 4th course being a veal tenderloin.  The 5th course, obviously, was dessert.  Everything was cooked perfectly, but I particularly enjoyed the veal tenderloin course as the meat was prepared "sous vide" (but was very tender and full of flavor). What I particularly liked about Providence was how accommodating they try to be for their customers.  They were willing to substitute the veal tenderloin for another fish course for those in my party who either are pescatarians or do not eat veal.  They were also willing to substitute the desserts for a modified (smaller) cheese plate for those who are watching their sugar intake.  This was something you didn't really expect from a 5-Star restaurant.  It made for a most wonderful dining experience to receive such attentive and accommodating service, without the attitude you may find at other such high end restaurants. We had such a wonderful dining experience, that we are planning to come back to Providence in the near future for their Chef's Tasting Menu.

5 stars Accolades received by the restaurant: 2008 Michelin Star recipient (1 star) 2007 Gayot Top 40 Restaurants 2007 LA Weekly 99 Essential Restaurants 2007 Travel And Leisure Best New Restaurants 2006 LA Weekly Essential Restaurant 2006 Gourmet Magazine Top 50 Restaurants in the United States 2005 James Beard Foundation Best New Restaurant nominee I recently went to this famed restaurant. What was all this buzz about? My two dinner companions and I actually did not have the notorious tasting/chef's menu just because we were planning on overloading our livers with hard liquor afterwards at our next venue and we didn't want to mix and match spirits. Here's my reason why - SINCE 9 Course Meal = Included Wine Pairing; AND Wine + Hard Liquor = Seeing The Food You Ate Later During the Night; END RESULT = Pass on Tasting Menu This Time. Back to my experience at Providence, my friends and I arrived about fifteen minutes after our reservation on a Saturday night (around 7:15 pm) and there were no problems whatsoever. The lighting of the restaurant was perfect ( Dim but not I-can't-read-the-menu dim) and the overall decor was simple yet intimate. For drinks, there can make anything you want and they also have house specialty cocktails. I don't remember the exact names of the cocktail drinks we consumed but we had a few each and all were fairly good. There are two menus- One is the A La Carte menu on the right side of the menu and the other is the Tasting Menu or Providence Market Menu found on the left side of the menu. You're able to order items from both sides of the menu so it doesn't mean you're out of luck just because you didn't agree to the nine course meal. For appetizers we shared the Japanese Campachi (same family of fish as Hamachi), Bobby Block Island Sea Scallops, and the Smoked Salmon Risotto. The Campachi and the Scallops were good but the Smoked Salmon Risotto was the appetizer that did it for me. I'm not even a huge fan of risotto too! For entrees, I ordered the Wild Day Boat Halibut and my two companions ordered the Wild New Zealand John Dory and the Japanese Tai Snapper. All three dishes were excellent. We finished off our meals with a dessert that was terrific. I can't remember the name but it was recommended by the waiter and the taste was unique (good unique that is). Service-wise, unbelievable. The waiters actually work here! They were extremely attentive. Whenever one of us got up to leave the table, our waiter would come up to the empty seat and refold the cloth napkin. Little attention to details like that goes a long way in my book. We also asked our waiter more questions than a 5 year old child asks his parents and our waiter was extremely patient and helpful. He gave us solid recommendations. In summary, I don't give 5 stars too often but Providence had a great vibe (it was friendly versus snooty), the service was phenomenal, the food was consistent and original, and the presentation of the food was creative and tasteful. Sure it's a little pricey but it was definitely worth the trip. I'm going back for the tasting menu!!! ( HAI )

I ate here a year ago so I can't really tell you what I had...then again I couldn't really tell you what I had 364 days ago either because, well, nothing was that memorable to me. My girlfriend and I had the 18 course extravaganza (chef's tasting menu) with wine pairing as well as a dozen oysters and some drinks before the wine arrived. Bill was about $800 with tax and tip. So why the four stars...? Because we had a GREAT time there. Maybe it was the atmosphere, maybe it was the energy we brought to the meal - but we had loads of fun. It was fun to have 18 courses - all of which tasted great, and were interesting - if not very memorable. The wine was delicious, the place had a cool vibe, the host was exceptional (though the waiter was new and average). At first they sat us at the Chef's table (which is in a room away from the restaurant with a glass wall looking into the kitchen), but we chose to move because there was no energy there - it might be better for a large party, but for a romantic dinner for 2 I just wasn't feeling it. I would recommend Providence - don't let my four stars or my comments about the food deter you. It is a great experience and is really enjoyable.

This was the best dining experience I have ever encountered. I was taken here on a date (MEN: if you want to impress your darling girl, this is at the top of the list). The atmosphere is very formal, yet comfortable. The staff is welcoming, sophisticated, and very human. My date suggested we do the 9 course pairing, and enjoy a nice bottle of wine. So then we entered heaven. I don't eat meat, which was highlighted for a few courses, so the chef prepared special substitutions for me. Each course was an adventure for my taste buds. There was nothing alike, and the tastes were all very balanced. I found myself savoring each bite. By the end of the meal, it was time for coffee. I Was quite impressed with coffee variety. There were roasts from all over the world, and the descriptions were so appealing. A simple coffee turned into one of the most memorable tastes I've ever had. I recommend Providence to anyone.

Providence has now done me the great service of giving my parents the best dining experience they've ever had.  Those are their words, repeated often during our night of sheer gustatory bliss. My parents have done a lot for me, and have helped my husband and I get started.  They raised me well, scrimping and saving so I would not have to pay my way through college.  They made sure I got a great education and knew how to behave like a human being.  They paid for a few expensive dog surgeries and x rays and more.  They welcomed my boyfriend, now husband with open arms, and helped us pay for our wedding and the down payment on our first home. We can never pay them back, but we wanted to try and somehow show how much we appreciated them.  For Christmas this year, we set aside some money and bought a gift certificate to Providence.   We planned to go this past weekend due to the long holiday.  I made reservations for the 12th about a month and a half out.  John promised me something special.  He said Chef Cimarusti was going to do a tasting menu, despite the fact that they had a pre fixe Valentine's meal filling the kitchen.  Chef Cimarusti is such a fabulously selfless guy to do that! Because of the holiday and V day, I figured we would be at a regular 4-top.  I had told my parents about the Chef;s table, but assumed someone had already snagged it.  I certainly never mentioned it to Donato, John  or Chef. Lo and behold, we arrive and are taken right to the table.  From then on, my parents were treated like the VIPs they are to me.  Drew had special bottles picked out.  Everyone chatted warmly with us as if we were family.  My parents watched the kitchen with awe, and tasted each dish filled with joy.  And it just kept coming. Standouts for me include the house-smoked trout dish, diver scallop dish, parsnip shooter and the lobster, but everything, from the "cocktail" amuse buche right down to my caramel salted popcorn dessert (they had chocolate mousse with nuts, a no-no for me) was completely divine. And yes, I put away my fair share of bacon brioche and foccacia. I figured after all the many courses (13?  14?  I lost count!) and wine the bill would be double my gift certificate, or nearly that.  The food was exquisite.  I slipped out to pay, and was shocked when Donato told me the meal was right on budget!  You've got to be kidding me!  I felt I was ripping them off, so I left a whopping huge tip to make up for it.  They deserve more, if I could pay it. My mother has told me that there is true pleasure in seeing the joy of  one's child discovering a wonderful thing for the first time.  Last night, I got to see that joy on my parent's faces. Thank you, thank you, thank you!  You made my hard-working parents so very happy!

We had the 8 course tasting menu and it was great.  The service is attentive, maybe at times there were too many suited men swirling around, but I fell in love with Steve.  The food is super creative as are the drinks and the wine pairings were OK (maybe over priced for the quality but good none the less). The cheese tray was beautiful and the three options we selected were not disappointing. The decor is smart and a great way to spend the evening. I wanted to give a 5 but just too many little things that should not have occurred. Suggestions - the cheese tray server we had needed to be better informed (the other tables had an articulate and well informed person but we had a lovely young woman who tried but was not really where most of the service is at this restaurant. My dining partner had a view out a window with trash swirling around within view and that should not be. Also the ladies room could have been maintained better. Don't get me wrong this is a great place.  Just not perfect and for the price it should really try to be perfect. Will try again and I hope this can be moved up to a 5.

I've been dreaming about eating at Providence and I finally got the chance to live that dream!  I came here on a Friday night with the babe and some friends.  We were able to score the chef's table which is only one table in a separate room that is next to the kitchen.  You are separated from the kitchen only by a glass wall.  It's available if you just ask for it and you need a party of 4-6 people. We all ordered the chef's tasting menu ($160) which was 14 courses of heaven.  I won't describe all of them but some of the most memorable dishes were... 1) Starter of grapefruit, gin and tonic, and mojito jellies with a center of alcohol goodness. :) 2) Japanese kanpachi with crispy rice crackers, and soy crème fraiche. 3) Salted fresh sea prawns....amazing and one of their signature dishes! 4) Lobster with morel mushrooms - my favorite dish of the night! 5) Pork belly....need I say more? 6) Lamb tenderloins....just mouth watering! 7) We also had a pre-dessert which was a shiso sorbet on tapioca pudding...a dessert in itself! 8) A frozen orange cylinder filled with yummy alcohol creme inside and all plated on top of leeks surrounded by carmelized ground black olives....interesting combo. 9) Basil ice cream with strawberries, marshmallows, and candied pecans...so delicious! It was amazing to watch the interplay of chefs in the kitchen and see the master executive head chef Michael Cimarusti at work! The highlight of the evening was Chef Cimarusti  paid a visit to our table!   Service was impeccable and the sommelier was very knowledgeable. Overall, a tremendous experience that left me in awe!  I will definitely have to partake in this again!

Let me say that after eating at Providence, I think I should go back and take away 1 or even 2 stars from all of my restaurant ratings. Providence is truly five stars. To compare it to some of the other 5 star ratings I've given to restaurants would be doing Providence an injustice. This is the finest dining experience I've EVER had and my first at Michelin star rated restaurant. There are only 3 restaurants in Los Angeles with TWO Michelin stars and Providence was the most appealing to me because of Chef Cimarusti's specialty in seafood. My boyfriend and I had dinner here for our 3 year anniversary and it was..indescribable. The drinks are great too! I ordered The Sicilian off of their cocktail list and it was the most crisp and refreshing cocktail I'd ever had that didn't have a disgusting rubbing alcohol aftertaste. It truly tasted like a high quality and well-mixed drink. I am embarassed to drink gin and tonics at local dive bars now. Providence also has a list of "classic" cocktails that are recipes from the past couple centuries or so; intriguing but I had no room for cocktails, I saved myself for food! We ordered the Full Tasting which is a 9 course meal. There are 3 appetizers, 4 entrees, a pre-dessert, and then dessert. I'll save all of you Yelpers a full detailed description of each and just note the highlights: 1. The molecular gastronomy plate, the first course. That little bubble really did taste like a mojito! I love the gelees and they are a great way to start off a meal. It also really set the tone of the meal; my boyfriend and I anticipated something creative and new in the upcoming nine courses. 2. Of all the entress, I TRULY LOVED THE JOHN DORY. The John Dory dish is indescribably good. It is a white fish dish that Cimarusti cooked to win his Iron Chef showdown with Chef Morimoto! Impeccably cooked and so flavorful; I've never had a fish so tender. It melted like butter in my mouth. I want to go back for the full entree size of the John Dory. God, my stomach just rumbled thinking about it. *Also, the veal is interestingly cooked. It is seared and then steamed. Although it was delicious, the John Dory was clearly my favorite, but I thought this was a great way to cook the veal. So delicious and soft...mmmm. 3. The last dessert, the Miso Cheesecake. It had an amazing little crust and I don't even know what it was made of. It also came with some sort of raspberry liqueur gelato that complemented the cheesecake beautifully. My boyfriend and I were so full at this point but the cheesecake was too delicious to put down. I can still remember it well and I plan on going back for a full dessert tasting. Hands down to Adrian Vasquez for an incredible dessert. I can't wait to see what else he has in store. 4. Oh, and duh, the BACON BRIOCHE. I can't believe it. So good. Don't eat too many of these or you'll get too full. 5. The Cheese Cart! Apparently, the boyfriend and I had the "World's Best" Bleu Cheese according to a London cheese competition. We had 3 other cheeses and I can't even remember their names, but I think anything on that cart is 5 stars.  And let me tell you, I wish that cheese cart followed me around all day and lived with me at home because it kicked all of my Trader Joe's cheeses' butts! I can't even try the cheese at the grocery store because I know it can't compare to what I had at Providence. I heart the cheese cart! There are also cute little candies that are handed out with the bill; also delicious! Like a toffee covered black cherry. Wow. The 9 course Full Tasting will definitely fill you up so come prepared with a trained stomach. And yes, the decor is interesting but don't let that take away from the incredible meal you will have. The restaurant is also EXCELLENT for groups, and I wished I'd tried a wine pairing. Drew, the sommelier, was so informative and an excellent host. Overall, I was highly impressed with Providence's service, hosting, bar staff, and especially cuisine. I plan on going back; it's all my boyfriend and I talk about and we dream of it nightly after cooking our own 3-star meals at home. Chef Cimarusti served the most delicious food (especially seafood!!!) I'd ever had and I will never, ever forget it!

All I can say is AWSOME!  Now my favorite LA restaurant by far.  We ate late, so we only had the 5 course tasting with wine, but it was by far my best meal to date.   The only things that I didn't like:  olive oil gelee. . .that's just weird.  I like olive oil, but I don't drink it so I probably don't freeze it and make jello.  Scallops were too salty, that's it.   Service was great, everyone was friendly and unpretentious, which in this town is a big plus.  The wine pours were generous.  The food was amazing.  I won't go into details, just b/c everyone does but we started with the oysters and were really happy with pretty much everything.  I am already planning a trip, earlier in the evening for the 9 course menu.   Run to this place, as soon as you save up the cash!!!  Sublime!

This was by far the best dining experience I've ever had. My boyfriend took us here to celebrate our first anniversary and everything was just perfect. The ambiance was perfect. The food was delicious and perfectly cooked. The plating was beautiful and the wait staff was lovely and very attentive! We are extremely satisfied despite the hefty $400 bill. I love love love seafood and this place nailed every single dish. We ordered the market special sampler and a mix of the oysters. I would come back every night if I could :)

Whenever someone asked me what was the next restaurant I wanted to try, I always answered, "Providence." Last month, Ally and I made reservations and showed up promptly for them. It was to our dismay we were asked to wait at the bar because our table wasn't ready. That wasn't really a problem but it was starting to get obvious they just wanted us to order cocktails when we were finally showed to our table and only given the cocktail menu. They wouldn't give us the actual menus until we ordered cocktails and were nearly done with them. Providence was doing an anniversary special last month. I have heard they extended it to this month but you may want to double-check it you're going. Normally their 5-course tasting is $85 but they were rolling back the price to $65 as it was 5 years ago. We were given a hybrid amuse and first course only to be given our real first course. Another communication misunderstanding, perhaps. Still, throw us more of that tuna because it's wonderful. Our next course was the best scallop I've ever had in my life. Just when I was relaxed and wasn't thinking too much about our strange server and his put-on Count Dracula accent or the overwrought woman bringing Ally's wine, they brought us the halibut. It was...odd. It was cooked fine but the flavors competed with each other and honestly I would never order this halibut again. I was since I think Providence is known more for their seafood (as evidenced by the "barnacle" studded sea/ocean themed dining room). Luckily dinner was saved with the next course, the veal breast. Ah, yummy delicious baby animals. So tender. Finally, dessert. But we decided to order an additional dessert to go with the one that comes with our tasting menu. The tasting menu included a yuzu cake that was quite good but the chocolate cake we ordered was fantastic. They also gave us mignardises (macarons, nougat and chocolates). As mentioned, I wasn't too keen on the service. I had to ask where the restroom was which made the entire male staff point the way and then when I came back to the table, my napkin wasn't refolded. The little things always saved a restaurant and this wasn't one of those times. Ally's chair kept being bumped by the bumbling odd cheese woman who also made a bit of a mess describing Ally's wine. Every wine was "great and fruity" or whatever she was rambling. Fortunately, Ally seemed to like most of the wines. Oh, and those cocktails we were somehow expected to order? Fantastic. But still, I don't like having my arm twisted. So, I will go back but it'll be a while until I do.

The decor scared me, the Maine lobster salad was one of the worst things I've ever eaten in my life, but the chowda was fairly awesome, and everything I stole off of my dining companions' plates was fairly good. Still, the ubiquitous appearance of gels and mousses was rather off-putting to my delicate sensibilities. Great service, though.

This restaurant is extremely good and the service was superior. However, I give this restaurant a 4. My friend is moving to New York so we decided to celebrate together here. My friend and I arrived earlier than our other friend. We told the host we would like to get seated so we can order right away. I guess the host did not understand or it maybe she was too busy playing with her hair. After waiting for a while, we went up and asked the host again if we could get seated. The host finally realized we wanted to get seated asap so lead the way to our table. For a party of three, we ordered a lot. We were starving since we didn't get seated till 9. They gave us complimentary home-baked breads that was good. I was tempted to have more than a bite but I really wanted to save my appetite for the "good stuff". For appetizer, we ordered: --Dungeness crab (pink grapefruit, pine nuts, and cilantro) I love the pine nuts in this dish. It gave the dish an extra crunch. Absolutely amazing! I love the citrus and the seafood. The crab meat itself was tender and delicious. Loved loved this dish. --Oysters (which came with 6) Luckily there was 3 of us so each of us had two. We tried two different oysters (not sure which ones) but they were both very fresh and good. There were two different sauces you can use. One had minced garlic and the other one was plain. Definitely use the plain one if you're on a date. --Chowda' (smoky bacon, manila clams, creamy clam broth) Like I said, everything tastes good with bacon For first course, we shared: --Foie gras ravioli (black winter truffles, aromatics, Parmesan) This dish was very heavy. I personally felt like there want enough foie gras Main course, we ordered: --10oz of the Australian wagyu style beef (weiser farms potatoes, delta asparagus, morels, bordelaise) I am biased! The Cut really ruined my taste buds! I realized that steaks that use to taste good to me are not as good as it use to be. To me this steak was a little hard. It was charred on the outside. However, I wish it was juicer. The presentation was great though. I loved how they cut the steak on a side cart. --Wild Maine lobster (carrot, vadouvan, Tokyo turnip, Greek yogurt, dates) This dish was very light. The lobster was not "fishy". The texture was also very nice. There was a lot of veggies on this dish. --Wild striped bass Maryland (fennel puree, capers, spring radishes, mint) This dish was very vinegary and sour. If you do not like capers, you won't like this dish. I loved this dish. On the other hand, my friend did not really enjoy this dish. Dessert: --Coffee Dom The coffee dom itself was very rich and heavy. The coffee ice-cream was to die for. The foam on top of the ice-cream was packed with flavor --Strawberry and Cream sorbet Very fruity and the flavors were very clean. There was some stuff on this dish that I was not familiar with. However, I thought this was just okay for me. They also gave us each a vanilla bean macaron, some kind of berry jelly, and a piece of chocolate brownie. I loved the presentation and the waiters are extremely nice. The manager was very charming and hilarious. Best of all, they had great music. They were playing Adele's new album ^_^. Minus the host, I think this restaurant would've been a solid 5.

Get the set menu. Let the chef take you through his expertise. I also added the wine pairing. Its worth the $160. Each dish that came out was perfect. The tzar egg with tuffles and caviar was my favortite, the risotto was out of control delicous. I must have imbibed myself with 9 glasses of wine. Each different and paired to my dish.  Being able to sample so many different wines really sharpens your tastebuds to wine tasting. Beautiful decor, excellent service. Advisory: Be prepared for ALOT of really good food and if you get the wine pairing I hope you are not driving. I'll be there again soon.

The 5 course menu blew me away.  Every dish, including the amuse bouche, was exquisitely done.  The sommelier offered an excellent pairing for the 5 course (since my tolerance is about as much as that one glass).  As for the food, expect complexity.  Every dish, including the amuse bouche, is a rocket science, a Shakespearean play, and an economy-bombing credit default swap. I'll keep the description of the food brief--all of the 5 course was well executed, along with our bread accompaniments.  The highlight of my night was the veal tenderloin (sweet peas, bacon, almond, maitake mushrooms), followed by the scallop (vadouvan--a french curry), then the blackberry sorbet (on a tart custard).  The bacon brioche was sinful and worth it.  The dungeness crab portion of the 3-part amuse bouche...has left me wordless for the last five minutes.  It's good. There are some complaints about the decor and ambiance.  While I agree there is hardly a view here, it's also clear that's not what Providence is about.  It's not on a beach; it's not at the top of a skyscraper.  What you get here is a cozy dining room with professional wait staff who puts the spotlight on center stage: the food.  This is not the somewhat popular pub down your street where you have long philosophical conversations with your friend--you can't just swing by here and expect a seat.  You make a reservation if you want to dine here.  Waiters politely swap out your silverware between courses and announce each dish.  Make no mistake, you are here for the food.  Come here for that, judge them on that.

I wanted some great seafood, but was getting a bit bored of my usual Sushi routine.  So, Providence, it was!  I had heard about this place for a few years, and everyone seemed to enjoy it very much, but it's Michelin stars were the big turn-off for me.  The last LA 2 Michelin place I visited (Melisse) turned out to be a big disappointment (actually, I went to Melisse THREE times and was disappointed THREE times) so I had made it a rule to myself not to trust the Michelin guide. And now I'm kicking myself cuz this place was awesome!  All these years, I was totally missing out. I had the Full Tasting Menu ($125/9 courses), and added on the Roasted Foie Gras entree. Every dish I had was seasoned well, and there were absolutely no disappointing dishes.  The first course (scallops) was exceptional, and the best dish of the night turned out to be the roasted foie gras, though not a seafood dish.   I paired the last dish of the course (veal tenderloin) with a nice German Pinot Noir that the sommelier recommended.  Meyer-Nakel 2008 Blauschiefer Spatburgunder on the wine list.  A great recommendation and a wonderful combination!

Pretentious.   [pri-ten-shuhs] full of pretense or pretension. Not sure how else to say it.  Providence is pretentious.   "characterized by assumption of dignity or importance.  making an exaggerated outward show; ostentatious."  I went there with my partner, bro- and sister-in-law.  Thank goodness we will enjoy ourselves no matter how poor the food.  This place is embarrassing.  Quintessential example of smoke and mirrors lacking substance. Lukewarm, pissy soup with frothy foam:  unsatisfying. Gelatinous cubes reminiscent of Cliff Blocks--which are excellent when you're running distance and need the calories and electrolytes, not so welcome when you're looking for a fine dining experience. Okay, the wine list is good.  But that's it. Don't believe the hype.

The food was good, but I'd have to rethink if I'd want to go again (super pricey) My friends and I all chose the 5 course menu- I thought food presentation was great like the jellys, taste and ambiance was great, but to pay $130.  I'd rather eat a yummy steak for $130 rather than a five course tasting menu.   To me...the place was just a meal ..nothing memorable to my tastebuds.

In fine dining, the whole should be greater than the sum of its parts. That is, no single element should outshine the others. The food, presentation, service, wine, and ambiance should all work together seamlessly to create a memorable experience. The team at Providence clearly understands how to make guests feel special; my wife and I celebrated our first anniversary here and I couldn't have been happier with the experience. We tried the 9-course tasting menu with pairings. Incredibly fresh seafood anchors the menu. The flavors, like the overall aesthetic, skew towards the clean and restrained. Cimarusti knows where and when to apply whimsical touches (amuse, dessert) that seem to just border on cute, but never cross the line. The experience does come with a price tag, but dollar-for-dollar I'd say that Providence is one of the best meals I've had in years. Sometimes in fine dining, you actually get what you pay for.

I can only give this restaurant four stars because I only went in for dessert. However, I will definitely go back next time i'm in the area to try some of their savory offerings. I ordered the 8 course dessert tasting, and my partner ordered the 3 course. (Although, they were generous enough to send her 5 courses as well as make sure a share plate was set down in front of her at all times). 1) Mojito in the form of a spherical raviolo.  In our case, the "amuse" but I guess in most cases served as an intermezzo. 2) Kalamansi gelee & shiso-lychee sorbet served over a white chocolate-coconut-soy milk tapioca soup. Garnished with freshly shaved young coconut, micro shiso, and rice cereal coated with white choc. *This was our second favorite dessert of the night* 3) Sous-vide Jonalicioius apples, dried North Star cherries, barley ice cream, pine-nut puree, and a toffee brittle. 4) Walnut torte, orange marmalade, creme fraiche ice cream, and a chocolate tuille.  *Pretty on the plate, but our least favorite of the night* 5) "Pumpkin pie" - This was a deconstructed pumpkin pie. There was pumpkin pie "filling" alongside curry ice cream and pecan streusel.  *This was my favorite dish of the night* The curry ice cream tasted more like just straight cardamom and less of the yellow madras curry flavor that most ppl associate with the word "curry".  It was delicious and the way it was plated really caught your eye. 6) Milk chocolate-whiskey panna cotta, bailey's ice cream, dark choc streusel, and a coconut raviolo.  *This was my partner's favorite dish of the night* It was a really well balanced and simply presented panna cotta. 7) Burnt caramel ice cream with gingerbread crumbs, chocolate cake, poached pears, and pear foam.  I would've been completely satisfied with just the ice cream and gingerbread crumbs; together they are delicious. 8) White chocolate lollipop filled with raspberry consomme and garnished with candied lemon zest. A perfect ending to the meal.  The lollipop bursts in your mouth (if eaten correctly), and the way it was presented was really cute. Petit Fours- Truffles, Caramels, Olive Oil pate de fruits. Along with the desserts being outstanding, the service was also great. Our server was very attentive and everyone who dropped off our plates were knowledgable about what was on them.  We were informed during our meal that Adrian Vasquez  had just been named one of the top 5 pastry chefs in the country.  Our server also offered to show me the kitchen of the restaurant, where I was able to meet the chef de cuisine Michael Cimarusti. All in all, we had a nice time at Providence and will definitely be back. (I also need to add that which ever pastry assistant was working on Friday night - the night after thanksgiving - did an excellent job. Every quenelle was perfect and everything was plated beautifully.)

Michael Cimarusti is a chef's chef. The man can cook. I first met him at Piero Selvaggio's Valentino restaurant. We were participants in cooking a special lunch menu for a white truffle auction. D.B. Sweeney, of The Cutting Edge fame, was there sporting a very Yuppy-ish outfit. Who would have thought? He always plays blue collar tough guy roles, but I digress. Providence occupies the original Patina space. It has a very minimalist decor. Michael is one of the most talented chefs in California. If he had marketed himself more, then he would be a celebrity chef by now. That's not his style. He is very humble. He wants to be back in the kitchen cooking for you and I. How awesome is that? A chef that actually wants to cook? That's novel. Providence specializes in seafood. The chef earned his reputation at The Water Grill downtown. So this is a place for seafood lovers. The menu changes regularly, but there are staples like his clam "chowda". His pork belly is to die for. I dislike tasting menus because they often disappoint (read my Bradley Ogden review). Providence is one of the few places where I will order the tasting menu. Michael's food is very meticulously executed, but it tastes good too. Many chefs sacrifice flavor for presentation. It's the classic style over substance. Michael gets excited about cooking for diners that appreciate good food. So all you foodies out there, make a point to tell the reservationist and the server that you have been looking forward to your dining experience at Providence. The kitchen may reward your enthusiasm and send your table out an extra course. Providence is on my list as the best seafood restaurant in Los Angeles.

Dined at Providence recently to celebrate a friend's Birthday -- I'd heard lots about this restaurant, and thankfully had the chance to try it.  I loved my experience there! Unlike most diners at Providence, I'm not big on seafood -- especially if raw or slightly cooked.  (One quirk that makes me less Asian than others ;))  Thankfully, a quick glance at the menu that night revealed cooked seafood and non-seafood options!  *whew*   My dinner order: - Dungeness Crab appetizer to start - New York Steak for the entree   Breads were served after orders were placed -- the Bacon Brioche was my fave among the selections.  The amuse bouche of the night -- Tomato consommé, Curry rice paper, Mozzarella and tomato puff, Cream and cured sea trout puff, and crispy salmon skin -- was served, and even a not-so-big-on-seafood person such as myself enjoyed this course. :) I loved the Dungeness Crab appetizer!  The hearty chunks of crab meat, combined with the kiwi, melon, and mint flavors -- made for a unique and refreshing appetizer. I also loved the New York Steak entree -- the cipollini onions and confit potatoes were great complements, and the bone marrow béarnaise sauce made the steak even more mouth-watering and flavorful. For dessert, I really wanted to try the Burrata Cheese Ice Cream that is usually part of the tasting menu.  I didn't see it offered on the dessert menu, but mentioned it to the waiter and he was more than happy to include it in my dessert order -- a trio of ice creams:  Burrata Cheese, Lemon Verbena, and Graham Cracker.  All three flavors were yummy! Additional mini desserts were served in honor of my friend's birthday -- jellies, macaroons, and chocolate marshmallows.  The macarons were my fave! At the end of the night, Chef Michael Cimarusti came by our table to greet us -- and even remembered that we had ordered a la carte items!  (I guess most dinner guests order off the tasting menu.)  I was a little starstruck -- so much so, that I forgot to ask him to take a photograph with our group!  LOL. I really loved the food at Providence, and the service was excellent -- everything I have come to expect from an upscale restaurant ... a Michelin restaurant, at that!  I plan to come again at least twice a year, to try more of Chef Cimarusti's amazing culinary creations.  :-)

A group of us had dinner here per my suggestion since it's so popular with my fellow Yelpers. We all gathered at the bar while waiting for everyone to show up. Ordered a bottle of champagne and the bartender said the sommelier was getting from the back so it's "extra" cold. Now, we're the only people at the bar, so it's not busy or anything. We wait, and wait, and wait...I'm thinking did she forget? So about 10-15 min goes by, and the bartender finally gets the bottle of champagne and let's us know that the sommelier was just really busy getting wines for the people in the dining room. I personally think if the bar isn't busy, and 5 minutes goes by, you should've just gotten the bottle yourself. Cause basically you look stupid standing there staring at us. I mean, besides that little blip, she was very nice. So everyone has finally arrived and we go into the main dining room to be sat. Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly. I'm going to give these people some slack, because we were all conversing like maniacs so it was definitely hard for them to interrupt us to get a word in about the menu, etc. But when they did, they did it gracefully. The server puts down this molecular gastronomy plate in front of us, compliments of the chef. It's a mojito in a bubble, a spongy gel gin and tonic and a hurricane in a bubble. Basically place it in your mouth and let it burst! Wow, the mojito was fabulous! the gin and tonic was just okay, because I didn't really like the texture. I didn't make it to the hurricane. Needed food in my stomach at that point. Next comes the amuse bouche- a thin slice of smoked salmon with some crunchy balls and a creme fraiche and a tiny beer mug with carrot soup with a touch of Indian spice. I loved the salmon, but the soup was kind of too sweet. For my appetizer, I order a sauteed foie gras and the entree a cod with mussels in a red curry sauce. The foie gras was good, not the best I've had. The fish was flaky and the sauce was good, but it didn't make me want to keep eating until there was nothing left on my plate. Maybe I wasn't in the mood for the red curry sauce anymore-who knows. But my best friend ordered the black truffle with scrambled eggs-WOW! That was amazing!! I kept eating her dish! Oh, and the lobster ravioli appetizer was awesome too! We also ordered 3 desserts. I only remember one, my favorite, the panna cotta. It was a chocolate panna cotta with small crunchy chocolate balls on top. SO delicious! The other two were just okay. Oh and when we got our check they also sent out a plate of homemade chocolates and caramels compliments of the chef. I only tried the barley caramel, and it was very oily for some reason. So all in all, the company was fantastic, the service was great, but the food was just okay for how much it costs.

Went to Providence for a friend's bday dinner.  The experience was wonderful, food was good, service was attentive, ambiance was even better.  None of us (4girls) ordered the tasting menu, we each had our own individual entrée, wild black sea bass - tasty/no fishy taste^^, prime new york steak - tender/good portion, and japanese wagyu beef - extraordinary tender/a bit on the fatty side.  Although food was all in petite portions, but we were all stuffed by the end of the night and they even gave us complimentary appetizers and candies/chocolates towards the end. PS. definitely have to try their prawns, super fresh/tasty, and the chef will prepare it at your table! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

Came here on a nice Saturday night.  The decor is interesting to say the least.  I'm still not sure what to make of the white barnacles that appear to be growing all around the restaurant.  Mind you this is the decor which I'm not sure matched the concrete walls.  We chose the 5 course tasting and frankly that was more than enough to satiate our appetites.  A bread basket was carried around the room searching for partrons looking to wet their appetites on freshly baked breads. Here's what I ate: Bacon brioche, and Nori Focaccia ( My my I must say the bacon brioche was slappy happy good.  The focaccia was good but in a passing whisper type of way.  The third option was the plain roll, which we figured was more for the less savage types.) Amuse Bouche: Gin & tonic cube, Margarita sphere, and yellowtail with cream fraiche, and a 24 k edible gold leaf.  (All fantastic, some surprising textures and captured the bite.) Japanese kanpachi crispy rice crackers, coriander, soy crème fraîche (Good) hokkaido scallop japanese eggplant, ramps, reduction of vadouvan and sauternes (Ok not my favorite) wild halibut (alaska )smoked paprika, weiser farms potatoes, grilled octopus (Tasty and enjoyable) marcho farms veal tenderloin (franconia, pa.) sweet peas, bacon, almond, and morel mushrooms (Very good flavorful, went down nicely) yuzu curd, meringue blackberry sorbet, jasmine (Light and clean) white chocolate macaroons, homemade marshmallow dusted with coco powder,fresh torrone (This was the added cherry on top of the sundae of a meal)  In summary the meal was fantastic, the service was great and the experience was wow.   Decor:4 Food:5 Service:5 Would I go back?  You bet your pastrami I would!

Providence... I love you! Had the 9 course. I seriously can't get over how fantastic this place is. Greatest fine dining experience. Servers had proper etiquette.  It was fascinating. Right when I set down my fork on my empty platea server comes by and picks it up.  Soon after, another server comes and places down clean silverware for my next course.  I have no complaints.   The food is... just go! The flavors of every dish were highly pleasing. The chef is a genius. My taste buds had a blast. Yours will too. Do them a favor and just go asap! You can ask to see the kitchen... I think.. I was able to go in..but it was when they were closing. I can't wait to go back This place is flawless.

An amazing meal. My wife and I did the 15 course tasting menu. Contrary to expectations, we were not uncomfortably full, though we were very satisfied. The only gripe I had was about the cheese course -- the cheese was good, but when you put it in the context of the other fresh, imaginative dishes and complex flavors, it was a bit of a let down; though it wasn't enough to leave a negative impression. Great staff too. Fell comfortable heading here for a special occasion: you will not be disappointed. Well worth the price.

We went for their sixth anniversary special, $70 for 5 courses. It is an amazing experience, from the person who called me to confirm our reservation to our server, everyone was so nice and professional. Unfortunately we weren't able to get the 6 o'clock reservation, we only got a table at 9:30 on a Saturday night. I loved every course, and we actually got 8 different plates for a 5 course meal. The only drawback is the bread weren't incredibly impressive as I had hoped for. But the salt and pepper ice cream is so wonderful I wish more restaurants have savory ice cream. If $$ permits, I will definitely come back and try the full 16 courses!

AMAZING RESTAURANT!!! There is not a single thing about this restaurant that I could complain about. I went there last night and everything was perfect. It is very expensive, so I would save going here for a very special occasion but if you can afford it it's worth every penny. There are a wide variety of appertif (sp?) cocktails offered, including the providence signature cocktails on one side of the cocktail menu and classic cocktails on the other. On the classic cocktail side a description of each cocktail is given with the place and year of origin, so cool! ALL of the drinks have fresh squeezed fruit juices. I had the "Ruby Slipper". It was LITERALLY the most refreshing drink I have ever tasted. I also suggest the "Ward Eight". I ate: foie gras ravioli with truffles (YUMMMMM) John Dory with chorizo (so pretty that I just stared at it for a few minutes) and for desert a selection of cheeses from the cheese tray which was brought to the table, more like a table on wheels All of  the staff were knowledgable and attentive, but not in a really annoying or pretentious way....the decor is modern with a sort of a beachy, cool feel. You can actually hear everything that everyone in your party is saying, but if you are quiet you can hear music such as Radiohead and Bjork playing in the background. Very pleasing, and unoffensive to the older crowd-my parents (early sixties) were so impressed that they are bringing their friends back next year to celebrate their anniversaries...and they are extremely hard to please!

Clam Fritters are excellent! Providence took over Patina's old spot and I for one am pleasantly surprised. Here's what we had and thought... Josephine's Clam Cakes - Very light, tasty sauce, by far the favorite appetizer. Foie Gras Parfait - Too sweet...more like a dessert. Dungeness Crab - Very good. Lobster Pasta with Sea Urchin Sauce - Rich and Light at the same time. The decor is more "spa" than restaurant.  Ceramic sculptures rise up walls onto the ceiling - like Chihuly in monochrome.  It is taupe on tan on brown.  Now, I like neutrals...a Syrie Maugham devotee myself, but if you like color, you won't be too impressed. The bathroom is spare, but executed in natural materials, which keep it from being austere.  The full-length mirror facing the commode presents an odd visual at a perhaps less than opportune moment. The thing that makes the overall experience better than average is the wait-staff.  Our waiter was warm, friendly and very helpful.  My dear friend/fellow-foodie and I were accompanied by my "Siamese twin" (7 month-old son).  When my littlest companion "goosed" the waiter, he was surprised to see the giggling, toothless offender grinning in his high chair.  The waiter's response was to give the little man a tour of the kitchen as a reward.  The other diners were delighted and we were relieved to not have to deny that either of us were busy grabbing at the posteriors of the wait-staff. I definitely enjoyed our meal and would consider a return visit.

After struggling to make a decision on where to take my girlfriend to dinner for her bday (Melisse, Patina, Ortolan, Sona etc.) I decided on Providence.   The food and service was amazing for the most part.  We started our night with drinks from a guest mixologist and they were SO GOOD!   We decided on the 9 course tasting menu since the Chefs menu averaged 16 courses and just seemed like too much.  We also added a half-dozen Kumamoto oysters that were phenomenal with the sauces they make.  I'd say 6 of the 9 courses were amazing, but like others mentioned - it began to lose point towards the end. After the Amuse Bouche (spelling?) the 9 courses began...   We started with Hamachi. -REALLY good.  The sauce was a little bland but the rest of the dish made up for it..   Uni in an eggshell -Seriously incredible. The texture, the flavors, the presentation!  All were fantastic.  My favorite of the night. King Salmon -A+.  I'm not a big fan of salmon but this was delicious. Scallop -Very good.  I think it was served as it was intended but I might have enjoyed it more if the bottom of the scallop was as golden as the top.  It was a bit undercooked for me. Still the bomb though! Veal -the veal was outstanding even though it was really salty. However the 2 pieces were a bit much. We felt bloated after this course and still had 3 to go! 3 Cheeses -This course consisted of 3 cheeses of your choice. They roll out a table with about 20 cheeses on it (stinky!).   We got a water buffalo cheese, goat, and sheep. I just forget what they were called. *this course totally caught me off guard. It just seemed a little out of place. I might have enjoyed it more at the begining or end of the tasting. Cucumber sorbet -sooooooo good! Chocolate cake with ice cream. -strange flavor to the chocolate but I dug it. My girlfriend didn't care for it. The begining to the middle of the tasting was phenomenal. It just seemed to lose it's flow toward the end. All in all this place was really damn good. I'd go here again but not until after I visit all the other fine restaurants this great city has to offer. My only complaint (apart from the miniscule picky shit I mentioned above):  when I was on my way to the restroom I told our Captain that it was my girlfriends birthday. Before I could ask him to do anything special he was like "Oh thanks for telling me!!". It sounded like they had something really cool to offer so I left it in their hands. Once our final course came out (the chocolate/ice cream dessert) my girlfriend's dish was accompanied by a HUGE surprise!!!!  ONE FUCKING CANDLE!!!!   No happy birthday writtin in chicolate on her plate, no special desert, nothing but a single damn candle on the side of the dish.  Are you shitting me? Anyway...Great place. :]

Friend owed me a big favor plus losing a small bet to me so I decided to call it even with a full chef's tasting menu at Providence. Heard lots of good things about it and being a seafood lover, it was definitely on my top list of places to eat. 15 courses + a nice bottle of white wine...I think the damage came out to be close to 600.00. The entire meal lasted 4 hours and I gotta say, it was one of the most creative tasting menu I ever had. Everything was delicious and trust me, you definitely get full. I barely had room for the last few sweet courses. The waitors are all very attentive which is not surprising when you are paying that kind of money. If you are a foodie, Providence has to be on your list of top restaurants in LA. I saw a couple of Asian guys with their dates there..all I gotta say is...damn baller, if you take your chick to this place, you are setting the bar way too high, what she gonna expect in the future. I say stick with mid price range joint for a while, dont show all your cards so quick, you will have nothing left to impress the chick.

went a while ago, this is one of those "iron chef" very small portions but elegant, tasteful, and fantastic service.  it is a fine dining experience, dress accordingly and enjoy the ambiance, service, and of course, the food and well matched wines with each course. it's about 400 for a five course dinner for 2.  great experience, recommend it.  it's in a very unassuming place on melrose.

So Overrated! Too avant-guard for my taste. I've frequented this Venue when it was the Patina, which has been one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles. I heard so many glowing reviews for Providence so I had to check things out for myself. Like most higher end restaurants the portions were very small... Everything was prepared quite well... the problem was that they added things to the dish that didn't go well or distracted from the main flavor. I did love the way they remove  the shells of the prawns at the table in front of you!Though they were so renowned it felt like they were trying a little too heard to be innovated. The service like all high end restaurants was excellent they venue was nicely decorated, except for the shells on the wall that was put there to look like we were under water... that made me was to get a spatula and scrape them off! *laugh* If you like avant-guard dishes that you should check it out... I would recommend the tasting courses so that you get to see what they have to offer. MY YUMMY LIST: Prawns Caviar Caraquet Oysters Lobster ravioli Maine Lobster Black Bass Baked scallops Chocolate Souffle w/o the fruit sauce NEGATIVES: Too avant-guard A bit Pricey, expect to pay $100+ per person

If money were no object and I could eat here whenever the mood hits me, which would be all the time, would it be a 5 star experience every time?  Why, I think the answer is Yes. Did a last-minute dinner here specifically for the white truffles bc the brilliant Michael Cimarusti said the early season is very good this year.  And if he says so, then I must go and partake. I never understood truffles, white or black.  Clearly this is because I have not had excellent ones.  Now I see the light.   We each opted for the raviolo - one big ravioli, filled with egg that has been infused overnight with the scent of white truffle.  They brought out the whole truffles under a glass dome, and lifted the dome to let us sniff.  Mmmmmmm.  Then they shaved that earthy gold on the ravioli.  It was really delicious, the scent was incredible. A scary expensive habit to get into. Santa Barbara spot prawns baked in salt.  I finally tried this. It's drizzled with olive oil from Provence.  It was really good, especially the heads.  The whole presentation at the table is grand. Desserts:  pineapple upside down cake, and banana cream pie.  So traditional--not.  They were very good, and beautiful creations. Mignardises: yippee!  I love love that caramel. To drink:  cocktail made with bourbon and blackberries.  Excellent.  A minerally white wine suggested by the sommelier, it was perfect.  I had no idea how much it was going to cost me, but it turned out that he suggested the perfect wine pairing at an affordable price. I love Providence.

I can finally cross Providence off my bucket list and say that it definitely lived up to the hype! A fellow foodie friend pleasantly surprised me on a Sunday evening with dinner at Providence. The ambiance was a muted modern undersea theme. I was NOT digging the clustered shells because I have trypophobia, so I was relieved to be seated in a smaller room further in from the main dining area.   The service was impeccable from start to finish. I ordered the 5 course tasting menu along with the Santa Barbara sea urchin & the foie gras ravioli. I knew there was no way my skirt would survive 9 courses. Wasn't able to order the salted SB prawns because Saturday evening diners had cleaned out the inventory. Pigs!  :( The amuse of cocktail gelees was tantalizing~ Gin and tonic, grapefruit margarita, and the best for last, a shot of trout topped with creme fraiche, caviar, and a bit of gold. The texture of the first two shots was like ikura! I loved how the gelees popped and oozed flavor. The kanpachi was fresh but boring. I felt that it was missing something~ The SB sea urchin was creatively presented in a brown eggshell on a nest. I was disappointed by the taste, or lack thereof. I could hardly discern the sea urchin in the mix. There was also a complimentary sea urchin custard (perhaps a SB sea urchin gone wrong?) that was more to my liking.   The halibut was good.   The foie gras ravioli was definitely the highlight of my meal. So freaking savory and rich, mMmmm.   The veal was perfect, but I was too stuffed to finish it.   The yuzu meringue topped with berry sorbet was refreshing, but I'm not a dessert fan.   All in all, it was a decadent meal that I will cherish~

Came here for a (belated) birthday dinner/"anniversary" date with the boytoy. I did my homework and read all the stellar reviews, yet Providence surpassed my expectations. We did the 5 course tasting which is currently $70 without wine paring. Every bite was amazing and at that price it was a steal. We also added the Santa Barbara prawns as an appetizer. Some highlights: The trout belly creme fraiche puff pastry was a little creamy bite of heaven. The shot of carrot soup topped with passion fruit foam shocked my taste buds in the best way. The kanpachi was sooo good.. I'm not a sushi lover, but if all raw fish was prepared like this I probably would be. Then the Santa Barbara prawns. I was surprised I could smell the rosemary from at least three feet away. It was so fragrant and tasted even better. Probably the best prawns I've ever had. Between the scallops, halibut and veal courses my favorite was the halibut. It came with a sunchoke purée and grilled asparagus served atop a creamy white sauce sprinkled with chives, tiny blossoms and meyer lemon zest. All the flavors and textures worked so well together. The thought of it alone makes me want to come back! The veal took a while to come out and our server apologized for the delay but we didn't mind since we were chatting away and eating the bacon bread and nori focaccia. Dessert was interesting. The salt and pepper ice cream made me nervous but I'll try almost anything. It definitely had a unique kick to it, but paired well with the various chocolates and cherry preparations on the plate. I wasn't expecting petit fours. It consisted of rasberry macarons, chocolate marshmallows and some kind of beer jelly? I was ecstatic for macarons. The boytoy liked the beer jellies best. Service was exceptional. Everyone was polite and attentive and the servers introduced each dish and answered all my questions. There was a line for the bathroom and one of the busboys saw me standing in my heels and got me a chair without me saying a word! They even gave us a complimentary box of chocolates to take home. They are the most exotic flavors and I can't wait to try them. They're really a work of art. I would love to come back again and again and again... This is definitely the perfect restaurant for any special occasion. Thank you, Providence!

I really thought that all the 5 star reviews were a bit over the top...I was wrong!!!  This place is amazing! The food was awesome; the presentation was incredible and the service was top notch.  We ordered the 5 course tasting which ended up being 8 courses that included extras from the chief.  They really pay extra attention to details.  All in all this place is a must go!!!   The dinners do take a few hours, so if you're looking for a quick bite, order light.  We were there for 2 1/2 hours but it only seemed like and hour.  As they say on iron chief....the flavors are dancing in my mouth,  :)

The ambiance is definitely the best part of Providence.  With muted, earthy colors and soft candlelight along with the impeccable service, Providence is the place to be. From the moment we walked in the door, we were greeted and told it would be a moment before our table was ready.  So off to the bar we go for an ice cold martini.  I had the asian pear martini with Stoli vanilla vodka and some other magical ingredients.  Not really my style, it packed a little too much punch for me with the "freshness" of the flavors, but nonetheless, down my throat it went.   Providence is definitely a fine dining restaurant with creativity behind every dish.  I would like to think I know more about food than the general public, but reading the menu was like being in the first grade again when you didn't know what half of the words you were reading meant.  I just trust and go with it because it has to taste good, and taste good it did. Providence features a chef's tasting menu that can be accompanied by wine pairings with each course, but my eating companion Eric and I decided to order a la carte.  The only change I would make to the menu is that they don't feature any salads on the menu, which I would have greatly appreciated after severely stuffing myself all week to celebrate the big birthday.   They start you off with an amuse bouche which was a piece of shrimp with fresh herbs and a citrus shooter of some sort.  We decided to start off with the dungeness crab with grapefruit, meyer lemon, pine nuts and cilantro which sounds awfully weird but really good.  The grapefruit was more in a thin slice of grapefruit jelly form with chunks of crab meat on top.  Refreshing and light.  Then we had scallops which were like a party in my mouth...seriously.  I didn't want to swallow because they were that good.  They were seared to perfection and every time I took a bite, my reaction was, "Mmmmm."  I was that weird girl making noises as she ate. For my main I ordered the onaga with morel mushrooms, baby bok choy, and sweet peppers with some type of foam on top and Eric ordered their liberty farm duck breast with baby carrots.  My only complaint was when I asked the server how the fish was prepared he said medium rare to medium and I always order it medium rare and when I asked him if they could do that, he looked at me like I was crazy.  Needless to say, it came out a little overcooked, but I was enjoying the company so I ate every last bite. haha The sommelier was friendly, although very unique.  He literally made an about-face turn after speaking to us, but he was very informative and accommodating. Everything overall was great and it is definitely a special occasion restaurant.  One day I will be able to come here more frequently, one day.

Providence was truly a delightful treat, but I was definitely disappointed at some parts of the restaurant. Upon walking towards the hostess podium, I noticed a beautiful dining room to the left, however, our party of three was immediately taken to a smaller room with very minimal decoration. The walls were brownish tan, and it was just kind of a dull room. The room had 5 tables: two for up to parties of 4 and three for parties of 2. I just didn't like how small and close our tables were; we were definitely able to overhear other people's conversations and vice versa. It was just kind of an awkward setting. Secondly, the air conditioning was located along the edge of the ceiling on one side of the room, and there were three couples that sat down at the tables along that edge and asked to be taken to another table because it was so cold under the AC. It was definitely distracting to see people sit down and get up and leave after five minutes for three times. Next time, I'm definitely asking to sit in the main dining room. There is also only one unisex restroom in the entire restaurant. Don't get me wrong; the restroom was beautiful and clean, but because there was only one room, I was waiting outside the door for five minutes in a tiny hallway. During my five minute wait, I had to move into this small nook twice because servers were moving tables and chairs along the hallway. The second time I had to move, I overheard my specific server telling the movers, "Wait you guys! We have a guest in the hallway! We have a guest!" To be honest, I'm usually completely fine moving around or waiting for the bathroom, but at a two Michelin star restaurant, I really expected a nicer restaurant environment. Now, onto the service. Service was amazing. From the beginning, our server was very knowledgeable of everything on the menu. He also recommended the pear cocktail, which I really loved. The sommelier also came to our table to recommend a wine since we couldn't make up our minds. Over the course of our full tasting menu (9 courses, $125/person), three different staff members, including our waiter, came to deliver our courses with an explanation of each. I actually find it awkward when the servers explain the food because I don't know whether to look at them or the food. The food at Providence was truly a treat for my tastebuds. Out of the nine course meal (which includes two complimentary amuse bouche and one extra dessert plate), six were seafood and one was veal. I understand Providence is known for their seafood, but two of the people in my party don't eat beef, so we had to get a substitution for them. They were hoping it would be pork, or something of a break from the fish, but striped seabass was what they got. Anyhow, the most amazing course for me was the salmon wrapped in pork belly. It came with fried salmon skin, grilled baby corn, mushroom, and some greens. The salmon was very slightly seared only on the edges, and the texture was so perfect that it melted in my mouth. Along with the crisp of the pork belly, the flavor was perfectly savory. Another surprising but very delicious course was the sea urchin covered with slightly scrambled egg. It came presented in an egg shell, and I was immediately excited. The serving size of the sea urchin was generous, and the saltiness of the sea urchin was nicely balanced with the flavor of the egg. Next, the sea scallops over a beet sauce was exquisite. Scallops were perfectly cooked, and the beets were sweet enough to balance the acidity of the scallops. The halibut was my least favorite fish dish, but I have to admit, the texture was amazing. I've never had halibut that tasted like lobster, but the texture was exactly that. When I cut into it, the layers of the fish came off one by one, and it definitely was buttery and tender. The only problem was I can't even tell you what kind of seasoning it was because I don't remember it. The flavor was forgettable, but the texture was amazing. Now, the most disappointing part of the whole experience was definitely the dessert. The lemon sorbet was very ordinary, nothing special at all. The chocolate carmeaux (definitely spelled wrong) was terrible. It was slightly bitter and texture was like fudge but not as smooth. It came with salt and pepper ice cream, which is by far the worst ice cream flavor I have ever tasted. Salt and pepper ice cream. Really? Now, I hardly consider myself a connoisseur, but even if I tried my hardest to reach deep within myself, the "foodie" inside me couldn't even justify salt and pepper ice cream. I just don't see how that could ever be something anyone could enjoy. Feel free to enlighten me. Aside from the underwhelming dessert, my dinner experience was still spectacular. Seafood is incredible here, definitely the highest quality you can get. I will definitely return as long as salt and pepper ice cream is not served.

I'm not going to gush on about each course of the nine course tasting menu, mostly because I couldn't tell you what was in each but this was overall the best high end dining experience I've had since the world famous Tetsuya's in Sydney.  It was on par with Tetsuya's in fact in ways it was better.   I was so into what we were eating, I didn't even notice the va-jay-jays on the wall that Stewie is obsessing over in his review. There were a few dishes that were highlights but everything was sublime.  The scallops and crab risotto were our favorites. The service was perfect, it wasn't too formal and the wait people were very friendly and helpful.  We couldn't believe we had been there for four hours because we were having so much fun. This place is super expensive so don't go there if you or whomever you are with aren't: a) adventurous & b) don't like fish.  Duh

If there is a better restaurant in LA, I defy you to name it. The veal sous vide is easily the greatest veal ever cooked in the history of veal.  At Providence, it seems that every element on your plate has been placed there with a divine hand -- with an almost otherworldly skill. Every morsel, from a roasted clove of garlic to the toasted hazelnut is essential. Tonight we had the 5 course tasting and each was perfection.  Not just good or excellent, but perfect! The halibut with burdock shiso lemon is the dish Michael Cimarusti beat Morimoto with on Iron Chef and it was prepared identically. The chocolate bread pudding (in an avocado and banana cream) with corn tortilla ice cream and corn tortilla streusal was so creative and interesting.  I probably wouldn't order it again if given a choice but so different and intriguing, I was happy to try it. Keep innovating. The service is impeccable.  Knowledgeable, attentive and good-humored.  They took special care with the preparation of the food for my pregnant wife (revising the amuse bouche -- which contained alcohol -- and the kanpachi dish) and their selections were stellar. We tacked on a cheese course and our server took special care to pick out the pasteurized cheeses for us.  Just excellent service. The pacing was excellent.  Also, I should note that Providence plays the best music.  Tonight I heard: Cornelius, Beirut, Flaming Lips, Sufjan Stevens and Bjork.  The sort of music I wish every restaurant would play.  What an amazing selection.   Providence, you are so consistently amazing, reliable and just plain cool.  This restaurant is at the top of its game.

Returned for the 9 course tasting menu with wine pairings 3/22/2010 Verdict, not bad, but not great---just like last time we went for lunch on 2/22/2008. Judging by this time span, one could say they are consistent. We were in the unique position to directly compare the experience to Sona, as we have had the 9 course pre-fixe with wine pairings there, also on a Friday night. Bottom line: Sona was better in every regard except the dessert and cheese courses, although it did cost about twice the price. Oh, and I happen to like the general layout of Providence better, with their sliding doors to section off rooms and interesting décor. Sona comparatively has a bland location (and décor). Anyway, the food at Providence is just not great. I really wanted it to be. At best, they create fish courses which are perfectly cooked, with accompaniments that tend to be too subtle. In such cases, all ingredients present themselves equally on the palate so not one dominates too much. An excellent and classic principle really, but not very interesting in the way it is executed here. Such a style is perfectly shown in their Wild Pacific Halibut with smoked paprika, potatoes and grilled squid. Sounds wildly flavorful right? I saw the squid, it was sitting there...the paprika color was there...but the flavor was not. Do they parboil the flavor out of it beforehand? The flavors in many of their courses come out muddled to me. At worst, their food reminds me of something canned. Such is the case with their amusing tongue teaser assortment...featuring chic molecular gastronomic twists on old favorites like alginate blob mojitos and gin and tonic cubes. Fun stuff. Well, there is this nauseating citrusy substance they put in the salmon ceviche cup on there which tastes like canned OJ syrup. Same with the dessert I had...some bits of pineapple which tasted canned. I don't care if it is sous-vide, or simmered in Chateau d'Yquem...it still tasted muddled and canned. Don't use it. High note of the meal was indeed the cheese course. I did not have this at lunch when I went last. The waiter brought out a cart featuring about 22 kinds of cheeses from around the world, and it was spectacular to choose (4) from. Nice apricot chutney accompaniments, candied walnuts, but sadly paired with this horrific wine (Bourgogne gamay noir, "en bollery" domaine de la vougeraie 2007). Sona did not have a cheese cart, which is a classic charming touch...but their cheeses were of a great selection as well, and each had their own individual accompaniments! So on the plate itself, Sona won there. The cart however, was a nice old-world touch. As far as the sommelier goes, Drew did a pretty good job with the pairings. She was very informative, and showed up at exactly the right times. She is also quite beautiful, I just had to add that. I still felt the pairings and quality of wines at Sona were better however. The dessert menu was still just as beautifully creative as the last time I went. Not sure if it was as good (sampled 2 different ones), but the creativity was there...and the pairings. I was just too full at the end unfortunately. If I were to return, I would have cheese, and the dessert flight with wine pairings. I would have room left---because Sona's portions are too damn miniscule. That is another way Providence wins over Sona; the courses are perfectly sized for nine courses. I left not feeling stuffed to the gills, but had no interest in eating anything else. At Sona, I found myself ravenously pillaging through the complimentary Madelines at the end. Total came to $445 here. Dinner lasted a total duration of 4 hours. --Anthony

Guys, have you done something really REALLY wrong lately and need the lady of the house to forgive you? Did you accidentally let it slip that you want to kill your mother-in-law? Did you accidentally answer "yes" when said asked you if she looks fat? Or did you accidentally called her your ex's name in the heat of passion? Well, if you did one or all of those things within the past 48-hours and want to get out of the dog house, make reservations for Providence and all will be okay. And just for the record, I didn't do any of those things I mentioned above so that was not my purpose for enjoying this experience. A few weeks back, I came here with a very small group of friends to celebrate one of our friend's birthday. We only had 4 people so we were able to request the Chef's Table (private room with a view of the kitchen). They mentioned that max for that table was 6 but I think 4's the perfect number. Service is impeccable here. They made us feel welcome and relaxed. Also, I liked that they weren't totally the snotty type because with establishments like this, you tend to have that chance of getting those kinds of service, but not here. Now, onto the more important things... food!!! We were in the mood for a marathon so we picked the 14-course tasting menu. Oh and just as a side-note, it's about a 3 and half hour experience so plan accordingly. I'm not going to go through every single dish but just the very noteworthy ones (which is a majority of the dishes though): Prawns - carved table side and served hot. Very flavorful with a nice smokiness to it from the way it's cooked. Squid and Chrizo skewer - this was probably one of the most juicy and flavorful combination. Eel - wow, this thing was good. Was in a foam but the flavor was light and wonderfully balanced. Foie Gras - one of the better dishes there and the glazed it was served with was perfect. Pork Belly - served with a crispy piece of pork skin, this was one of my favor dishes. Can't really describe it but it was awesome. We also had this Japanese steam egg tart like dish (forgot the name) served with uni and caviar and this is a must have dish. I hope they always have this one their tasting menu because when I go back (noticed I said when and not if I go back) but when I go back, I'll feel really really sad if I don't get to have this dish again. I will say that the lamb dish towards the end of dinner was just okay and with the abundance of food and flavor, by the time we reached that dish, it was just okay to us. The palate cleanser was very refreshing and better than the actual dessert dish. And even though I'm lactose intolerant, they do have a cheese sampling for you to enjoy as part of your meal. We picked 5 different kinds and it ranged from amazing cheese to yeah, not so good but hey, we weren't cheese experts so we didn't really know what to pick. We also had a bottle of white wine to go with the dinner as well as cocktails. The cocktails were all very inventive and a must-have when you go there. The wine was paired based on their recommendation. Overall, the bill came out to about $300/person which included drinks, tax and tip. When I go back, I'm going to try the tasting menu with the wine pairing. Can't wait!!!

This is one of my most favorite restaurants in Los Angeles when I have the funds to afford it.   So worth saving your money to have that special night at. I love the staff.  We've been going there ever since it opened.  They have a great menu but you probably would have to have to be more of a "foodie" type of person to really embrace the food and appreciate the love and care that goes into their dishes.  Otherwise, you'll be sitting there wondering "WTF?"   Drew, the sommelier, is very clever with the wine list and always very friendly to chat with unless it's on a busy night.  Be sure to ask for Table 7 when you make reservations because it's the table that past patrons have claimed have a draft so they give a 10 percent discount off your meal which sounds like nothing but if your bill is $500, it can help quite a bit.

Yum! Had the pleasure of dining here last night and my fabulouso friend brought an 05 bottle of Opus One....what a way to start! Had the house pear martini based off the bartender's recommendation and it was delicious! Great guava nuances and I normally don't like cocktails but this one was great. Sooooo.....down to the nitty gritty.  I wanted to get the tasting menu but my friends wanted stuff off the a la carte menu.  Luckily, our waiter informed me that I could still get stuff off the tasting menu a la carte-style.   I went with the uni in the egg to start, which was off the tasting menu.  Foie gras and the special prawns baked in salt from Santa Barbara rounded out my order.  My friends ordered the kampachi appetizer and NY steak for entree and the foie gras ravioli, some type of seafood appetizer, and the halibut in curry. After ordering, I was presented with a basket of heaven.  No, seriously.  Anyone who knows me KNOWS I heart bread.  And bacon.  And there, lying in my breadboy's arms, were brioches with bacon.  Yes, there was focaccia and some other multi-grained thingie (I think, my brain was already confuddled with the thought of bacon plus bread in one food product) and I went straight for the BB.  Yes, the bacon bread will henceforth be called "BB." I looooooved the BB.  It was brought out with butter and a little scoop for the fleur de sel and once I slathered on the butter and experienced the little morsel in my mouth, I think some patrons at the next table (an elderly woman, actually), told the waiter "I'll have what she's having" in When Harry Met Sally-style.   By the time I had polished off 2 BBs, we had an amouse bouche quad consisting of smoked salmon on creme fraiche, something else I forgot, a yummy patichoux type of thing w/cheese inside, and carrot and ginger soup in the cutest little mug I was going to steal for my Foodie Barbie.  They were all delicious, with my faves being the salmon and patichoux.   Yum. On to the next course.  My uni came out and was in an egg with a warm yolk.  The flavors melded seamlessly.  I tried my gf's seafood something appetizer and it was really good but mine was better.  Didn't try the kanpachi but my friend said it was really tasty.  Then the foie gras came out.....Yummy, crispy on the outside and creamy fattening goodness on the inside.  It was paired with apple puree.  It was delicious.  I tried my gf's fois gras ravioli and it was the bizzy bizomb.  I would order the ravioli next time.   Entree time: my prawns came out on a cart and the presentation was excellent.  The salt was cleaned off them, they were halved, and the heads were halved as well.  They were arranged in an artful presentation on my plate, with an extra virgin olive oil drizzle and lemon wedges.  OMG, these were the bestest prawns I've ever had.  They were sweet like candy, almost.  And the heads! Omg, so yummy! I loved the heads! I tried my gf's halibut and it was the best......very soft, sweet, very fresh.  Didn't try my friend's steak as I gave up red meat for Lent.  Bah.  But it looked delicious.   Ok, here's the really good part! I have awesome friends who know what a huge food fiend I am.  I saw the cheese cart on the way our table and there was no way in tarnation I was leaving without getting me some.  But then I saw the dessert menu.  What the cornholio, a TASTING menu for dessert?! Who is the proprietor at this restaurant and is he single and straight? Humala-humala.  A man after my own heart (and stomach). I had 5 (yes, 5!!!) cheeses that were so yummy and scrumptious! I asked our cheese monger if he was "he who cuts the cheese" and he said yes.  Also, he said nobody had ever asked him that before.  I guess people who dine here aren't very funny. Anyhoo, it came with some walnuts, a great apricot and pepper preserve, some type of jelly, fresh figs (my fave!) and some bread.  The cheese standouts were the Berkswell sheep's milk cheddar by Neal's Yard, and the Sofia by Capriole farm's goat cheese.   I would review the desserts but I wrote way too much....but they are yummy, my fave is the panna cotta (a la carte).   Providence is a great restaurant, has awesome ambience, the food is fresh and presented in refreshing new ways.  Definite must go!

Very Good but I would do it differently next time... and we got lots of waiter ass in the face. I took Jenny there for her B-day dinner and we went ala-cart and I think we should have gone with one of the tasting/prefix menus instead. While we both enjoyed our dishes, our neighbors tasting meals looked much more fun. Also, due to the shear number of their courses being brought out, and our tables so close together, we got muchos waiters asses in our faces. For starters, we each had a delicious cocktail- Jenny had an "Asian Pear Martini" and I had the best drink ever developed: "The Dark and Stormy." (Ginger beer and dark rum and lime.) Apps-  we split the Clam Chowdah and the "wild-big eye tuna." The tuna dish was outstanding as the plate was dotted across with fish, tomatoes, avocado, edible flowers and sauce. Eating a few items in a bite each time was sort of like eating a path across your dish-  just outstanding! For main courses Jenny had the Sea Bass and I had the Striped Bass. Jenny's was a bit more hearty as it was served on a bed of potatoes and mushrooms. She thought it just ok and wouldn't recommend.  My striped bass had a tasty, foamy miso-sweet corn-eggplant sauce on a bed of spinach. I would recommend but just in a tasting menu with a smaller portion. For dessert we split a unique one: The Corn Pudding. On first bite, I was like: uh-oh, this will not be good. After a few bites though, the combo of ice cream, a weird corn frittata block, masumoto peaches, caramel popcorn, and grape jam plate smear... was just AWESOME.   Bottom Line:  I want to go back and try the prefix menus. We had a crappy table location where waiter asses invaded our personal bubbles so I'll give a pass on this visit. Great service. Very good food but expected to be blown away and was not, yet...

**4.5 Stars** After much hype, I was not let down.  Providence is truly fantastic and a bag of chips.  So far, the best restaurant of its kind in LA that I've tried.  The menu consists of a five course tasting menu 85/120, nine course full tasting 110/165, and fifteen course chef's menu at 160/245.  You can also order other things should you not want a tasting menu. So why the 4.5 stars?  I'm glad you asked.  My wife and I both agreed, the menu overall lacked acidity.  The balance and texture were spot on, but some dishes need to have that acidity.  Also to be very critical, desserts do not appear to be Chef Cimarusti strong point. Regardless, I do recommend and will dine with Providence again.

I don't know if this is smart or pathetic, but my gal pal and I predicted that we were going to be single on Valentine's Day, so decided that we might as well go on a date with each other and have absolutely luscious food if there are no good men in our lives. So reservations were made months before.  Of course, we couldn't get an actual reservation on V-day, so we opted for the night before and decided to spend actual V-day watching True Blood, Love Actually, and Shah Rukh Khan videos. Such is the nature of planning. So, months pass and my friend and I are sitting around on my bed.  By that time, my bedsheets were two guys old, and obviously none of them worked out (the guys - the sheets are awesome), so we proceeded with our plan to dress up and have a three-to-four-hour dinner at Providence. And I'm so glad we did.  We went with the full tasting menu with wine pairing and it was absolutely delectable.  The kampachi was subtle and sublime, the seafood is fresh, the foie gras is out of this world.  Service is outstanding and the setting is intimate yet comfortable.  The waiter was so cute in earnestly asking if we were celebrating an anniversary, and while my usual response would be to go along with it and add something snarky like, "Yeah, that's my beard," this place is too nice so I kindly informed him that we were just two friends indulging our hedonist natures.  (He seemed a little disappointed.) The best part about the length of the dinner is that it allows you to enjoy each morsel of food (I'm a slow eater) while getting progressively affected by the wine, and if you're with someone you like, the combination is wonderful - one of those fleeting amalgamation of moments in life where everything is wonderful, you're young, indulgent, a bit drunk, dressed to the nines, very happy. I say, go here with someone you love and feel comfortable with - a lover, a friend, your mama - and indulge and be happy.  Save the awkward dates and friends-of-friends and "networking" dinners for all the other places in LA made for all that glippity-glup.

I'm having a really hard time with my experience at Providence.  With two Michelin stars and a nod from the James Beard Foundation, my expectations were high. Upon sitting down at a table in a very awkward configuration, I quickly became uncomfortable as the back of the bench seating pushed me forward.  This became more of a problem over the course of the meal as the seat portion of the bench became very uncomfortable. The first sign of trouble came when a back waiter removed the fork from one of our plates, and placed it on the table.  This is completely inexcusable for any restaurant, be it a taco joint or a Michelin rated restaurant. The next problem came when our food was served.  Plates were served with no regard for timing or the diner.  Waiters constantly intruded on our space, reaching across our faces while clumsily attempting to deliver our plates.  I watched this happen at every other table throughout the meal and it become obvious that there was little training and polish instilled in the dining room. Aside from the fork incident, one of the biggest problems came when a course was served while one of its diners was absent.  This happened twice during our meal and is again inexcusable. While each of us got up, our napkins were retrieved by a back water and clumsily folded and placed back on the table.  While I can't really fault the dining room for not replacing napkins, it doesn't take much effort.  Los Angeles really didn't strike me as having a culture of conservation, so I wouldn't buy water conservation as an argument.  Either way, there was no method to how those napkins were folded.  How a napkin is folded does little to enhance the dining experience, but it speaks volumes about the consistency, training and polish of the dining room. One final head shaking moment came when a back waiter approached our table while cracking his knuckles.  All I could do is chuckle at this point and recognize that this dining room was winging it. Apart from the many blunders of the back waiters, the captains were competent, but lacked the ability to capture the intimacy of a fine dining experience.  They were very robotic in their conversation and descriptions and failed to establish rapport with their guests.  Eye contact was a huge problem with our captain, and a smile was a rare occurrence. While, in my opinion, the dining room is a disaster, the food was a different experience.  We chose the 12 course chef's menu.  The first 5 courses were fantastic.  Unfortunately, the remaining courses were completely forgettable.  Nothing was bad but, as the meal fell apart during the last half of the experience, I was left wondering how Providence could possible have earned two Michelin stars. I think Providence probably stands out in the lackluster dining environment of L.A., but it falls far short of basic standards in many areas. No there is no doubt that Michael Cimarusti is a Michelin worthy chef.  Whether or not he is a two star chef could possibly be debated, but there is no question in my mind that his dining room belongs in a much difference restaurant.

Came here for my birthday :) Love this fancy schmancy place you get seated right away and make you feel special whatever occasion it is your celebrating. it boasts such a great ambiance Waiters and staff were great :)) they answered all our questions about the different types of cheese selections we could pick. Such good service :) Had the 5 course tasting menu with the cheeses on the side and everything was lovely. Most memorable part of the meal would have been the amazing scallops.

I too went to Providence for their 5 course tasting menu.  oh...em...gee.  It was FABULOUS. It's weird to see a 5-star restaurant in that neighborhood...it kind of catches you off guard.  As soon as you enter, you know you're in a fancy restaurant.  My party and I were greeted with warm smiles from the host, manager and servers lined up at the entrance to the dining room.  We went to the bar to grab a quick drink as they got our table ready.   It really was a very pleasant experience from beginning to end. The food was amazing.  Although I enjoyed my entire meal (even the veal, which I was hesitant in eating), the second amuse bouche we received will forever stay in my memory...and in my heart.  I'm not even sure what it was...all I know is that there was sea trout in it.  Everything was cooked perfectly and presented beautifully.  My water glass was never empty and neither was my stomach.  The staff was very attentive and nice.  A+++ Fifi L. reviewed what we ordered, so for food suggestions, you can read hers. I will definitely go here again....... Pros: - Food was AMAZING - Great service (cute Hostess) - I didn't care too much for the decor, but it wasn't bad.   Just didn't like the seashells....eh, but who was really paying attention to that? Tips: - Valet parking only $5!  That's pretty good for a 5 star restaurant.  If you don't want to, then you can street park down the street. - Free corkage on Mondays - They prefer no flash photography.

Providence restaurant is greatly praised, widely reviewed, and highly regarded. . .so why didn't I fall in love like everyone else?  BH took me here for a special occasion and we ordered the small tasting menu plus the foie gras appetizer, and I wasn't impressed with any of the dishes - only the veal was worth remembering.  The meat was ultra tender, really moist, and just melted in your mouth.  I would definitely come back here again for the veal.  The foie gras fell short of the big, steak-like slab we got at Alexander's. THEIR foie gras was just bursting with fragrant, oily fat  while THIS foie gras just tasted oily and was a little gamey tasting and not very special. Even Chapeau's foie gras was much better. . . sigh . .will every restaurant from now on be compared to A's??? As the reader can tell by now, I think we spoiled our palates from our extravagant trip to Alexander's steak house in the spring - I even felt the service was warmer and more inviting at Alexander's while the waiters here were stiff.  The only things that Providence has that Alexander's lacks are the two Michelin stars (which I really and wholeheartedly believe that Alexander's too deserves) and the tasty breads that are served one at a time.  Other than that, I'd save my money and drive 5.5 hours to Cupertino. . .believe me, it's worth it.

4 Excellent meal.   A friend of mine warned me ahead of time it wasn't that great, which was surprising because I had heard it was THE best meal in LA!  After reading all the hundreds of 5 star reviews on yelp I was wondering who would be right?!  Well it was somewhere in between.  I'm not going to write a long review since this place has a billion reviews already. But it was really, really good.  Just not 5 star worthy imo.  Two of the five courses were 5 stars, 2 were 4, and one was 3.  :) A great place for a special occasion!

I will try to keep this short because you can get into the specifics from the other reviews. The food was wonderful and they had everything down to a tee, execution wise. I tried the chef's menu and it was a 15 course meal including the 3 amuse bouches that we got: mojito/screwdriver, grilled abalini, and squid/chorizo. Because of that fact alone, I believe it is not really worth it to get the chef's menu unless you absolutely prefer foie gras and sweetbread over seared fish, seared scallop, and baked spot prawn. If you opt for the 5 course meal, or the 9 course meal, the amuse bouches do not count as part of the courses, so a 5 course meal would actually be 6/7 courses and a 9 course meal would actually be 10/11 courses. Kinda got jipped huh, but I guess people who spend on the chef's menu don't actually care that they get less for more...

When I think 5 stars, I think Providence.  I can't even begin to tell you how much I admire Chef Michael Cimarusti.  I actually interned for a brief while in his kitchen at Water Grill, though I was on the pastry side.  Even from there I was able to observe his attention to detail, his insistence on quality ingredients and the commanding respect he has in the kitchen.  Oh, and he also kicked some ass against Iron Chef Morimoto (the most talented one on the show) just this year. This was my second time at Providence.  My fabulously thoughtful husband took me here for my birthday 2 years ago, and I've been dreaming about going back ever since.  This time, it was to celebrate our 4th anniversary. The service, start to finish, was impeccable.  It's true that there are many people involved in serving you, but each person we came in contact with was considerate, kind and helpful.  There is one person who brings your plates, and another who follows to describe each dish.  This is my favorite part because I want to know what each element is and be able to ask questions.  We did the 5 course tasting menu, which was more than enough food.  I asked to take home the menu and of course they gave it to me, folded in their stationary envelope and sealed with a sticker.  True class.  Here's what we feasted upon that evening: The amuse was a taste of three cocktails in various forms: a "vodka tonic" which was a sort of frozen gelee with a lime to squeeze on the side, a "mojito" which was an amazing grape-sized burst-in-your-mouth bubble of flavor, and a small glass with a warm saffron infusion topped with chilled fennel foam.  All were a refreshing, cleansing start to the meal. Then we had a Japanese kanpachi (which was a sashimi that reminded me of yellowtail), with red shiso granita (a slightly sweet shaved ice), compressed cucumber, lemon and some kind of plum sauce.  The entire thing was very fresh - any seafood is done exceptionally well here. A sea scallop with baby arugula, truffle vinaigrette, a roasted cherry tomato and baby artichoke heart.  The delicateness of the dish was offset perfectly by the acidity of the tomato. My favorite:  the halibut, perfectly cooked to a buttery, flaky state that I have never before tasted.  It came with a white wine buerre blanc, sake foam and shiso leaves. Tenderloin of veal, served with earthy chanterelle mushrooms, a sweet roasted onion and creamy celery root puree that made me feel like autumn is definitely here. Kalamansi gelee, which has a super-tart citrus flavor, on top of a white chocolate coconut milk soup with tapioca and litchi-shiso sorbet.  It brought the meal full circle, ending with a light, clean note.  They even brought us each a candle on our plate for the occasion. Finally, we had to get the check (yikes!) and it came with some delicious mignardise - an olive oil gelee, a green tea coconut truffle and a spiced citrus caramel that was to die for.   This was, as you can obviously tell, a big deal for me.  If I could give it 6 stars I would.  To me, ordering a tasting menu is the greatest compliment to a chef.  We said, "I don't really understand everything on the menu, and I can't imagine what each flavor combination will taste like, but I trust you.  Give me a meal I'll never forget" ...and they most certainly did.

Two Michelin Stars -- well deserved ! Ever want to truly wine and dine a girl? TAKE HER HERE!  This restaurant is beyond elegant -- it is real!  Providence provided my date and I with a  luxurious and memorable dining experience, as well as noteworthy cuisine and excellent service.  The decor is beautiful, the walls are covered in fabric that have a wet sand-like look and is encrusted with white little clusters of flowers.  Each dish on the market menu arrives beautifully plated -- i think the theme of the menu is seafood? My date and I had: 1. Maine lobster 2. Foie gras ravioli 3. Wild king salmon 4. Prime New York steak 5. Red wine- forgot the name. Everything tasted spectacular and the service was top-notch!  Ever so often, a worker would come by and clean the little crumbs from our table. ( I felt like i was making a mess! hehe)   I tried the foie gras ravioli, not knowing what  foie gras was and it tasted succulent and savory! For those of you who don't know what foie gras is, it is a product made of the liver of a duck or goose that has been specially fattened -- delicious! Towards the end of the meal, we were served little sweets -- what a treat!  There were homemade marshmallows, dark, fragrant chocolate truffles made from cacao beans the pastry, and baby madeleines. Overall, a incredible food experience and gracious service.  It full filled my super-high expectations of this place.  Great for dates or special occasions!  No restaurant I have been to since, has topped the exquisite food and service at Providence. =) 1 to 5. 5 being the highest. Food- 4.5 Ambiance- 5 Service- 5 Note* Corkage fee is $30 and valet is $6

Mindblowingly delicious! I love the fresh, natural ingredients that Providence uses. Each bite of food was like a burst of happiness in my mouth. One of my favorite amuse bouche was this vodka filled orange (?)flavored dish. They are very accommodating to food restrictions with the tasting menu. The servers were also on top of things and watching over your every move, ready to serve pronto! I had a great experience here, it's great for nice, small intimate dining. Not your everyday dining restaurant however, come prepared to blow your whole paycheck.

Maybe it was an off-night?   For many years, Downtown L.A.'s Watergrill was my favorite restaurant.  When its chef, Michael Cimarusti, left and opened Providence, I fondly remembered Watergrill's amazing clam chowder and looked forward to Providence with great anticipation. My, the restaurant is gorgeous.  The decor is sleek and sophisticated.  The host warmly greeted us and we were promptly seated.   My friend and I decided to try the five course tasting menu.  I had heard wonderful things about the tasting menu and our server stated that Chef Cimarusti was cooking tonight.  Great!, I thought.   Our meal started with three amuse bouches.  The first one was a gin and tonic that was gelatanized.  It came on a spoon and we were told to squeeze the juice from the accompanying wedge of lime onto the jelly, allow it to foam up, and eat it.  Well, we both squeezed the lime onto the jelly and nothing happened.  We ate it anyway.  It was okay.  But to be fair, I don't drink.  My friend, who does drink, was unimpressed. The second amuse bouche was a mojito ravioli.  The outer encasing reminded me more of tapioca and the mojito bursted into my mouth when I bit into it.  Again, I didn't think anything of it.   My friend thought it was good. The third amuse bouche was a watermelon shot with two small pieces of fruit and a piece of olive on a toothpick.  By this time, I thought it was kind of strange to have so many beverage oriented amuse bouches.  But okay, I'm game and I thought they were imaginative, if nothing else.  The watermelon shot also did not strike me as anything special. Our first course was tuna tartar.  Around the tuna was a thin layer of heart of palm.  Next to it was pickled red radish and a bit of wasabi creme fraiche.  The tartar was served with what our server called brioche, which really resembled white toast.  I've had a lot of tuna tartar and that dish has been interpreted in a million ways.  This interpretation is not among my favorites.  I thought the tuna was a bit too salty.  The serving size was small... about the size of a silver dollar and only a 1/3 of an inch high.   The second course was sea scallops.  This was by far the best dish of the evening.  The scallops were perfectly seared.  They were accompanied by a mushroom and some pureed butternut squash. The third course was pink grouper.  Oh my, this was NOT good.  The fish was undercooked or something because the texture was chewy.  I thought it was just mine but my friend's fish was the same.   The fourth course was roasted wild king salmon.  The salmon was topped with a piece of fried skin, like a chip.  The dish was good but not fabulous.  The salmon skin was too salty.   The last course was dessert.  It was a poached pear on top of an almond cake, with miso flavored ice cream and huckleberries.  I am not a cooked fruit fan but I thought this dessert worked.  The flavors really melded well together. As for the service, it was surprisingly not as refined as I thought it would be for a restaurant of this caliber.  Our server was pleasant enough but seemed disinterested.  When my friend tried to joke about something to her as we were ordering, she weakly smiled and didn't respond.  There was a long wait between our first and second course that went unexplained.  Our server asked us if we wanted coffee after we were already finished with our dessert.   Sadly, an underwhelming experience.  I wanted to love this restaurant.  Sona supplanted Watergrill as my favorite place a few years ago.  Since I was such a big fan of Watergrill and had heard rave reviews of Providence, I went into this evening thinking that my loyalty to Sona would soon be divided.  But alas, tonight was not the night.  Maybe another time.

Dined here this past weekend to celebrate my mother's 50th birthday. I heard and read many great things about this place, so you can only imagine how giddy I was coming here. The location is a bit off, its easy to miss the restaurant. I have to honestly say I was not very impressed with decor. I expected it to be very dark and more romantic. The restaurant had a very earthy, contemporary feel. There were these decorations that ran up the wall that I thought was very interesting. I will not go into much detail about the food, because they already have 200+ reviews about the food. My family and I had the 9-course meal and got a bottle of Pinot Noir from the Canihan Family Cellars 2004. It was a great choice. Highlights of the meal was definitely the Bacon Brioche (I got a refill 3 times), the mojito that comes in the amushe bouche, the scallop, the halibut, blood orange sorbet, and the celery sorbet. Everything was to die for. The only item I did not care for was the salmon. I felt that it was too fishy. I love their mini presentations and their china. Its absolutely beautiful! The food was clean, crisp, and very visually appealing to the eye. If ever you have 3-4 hours to spare for dinner, definitely come here and come here with a fat wallet. P.S. we had a "sommelier" that "helped" us with our wine selection... Yeah, not so much. She was a bit snooty and did not try to carry a conversation. I thought this was disappointing coming from a high caliber restaurant.

Yup -- it IS, that good. Diego G.'s review shortly before mine, pretty much said everything I wanted to say, but I still can't help to second what he touched up on. The GF and I went here as part of our 7th anniversary trip to Los Angeles. The only thing wrong with Providence and our approach, was going here for the FIRST of our four nights, meaning it set the bar too high; the restaurants that followed on our trip couldn't help but be below the bar set at Providence on that first night. This restaurant is truly an 'experience.' It sounds cliche when people say that, but once you come here -- you 'get it' -- period. The food is prepared with such an IMMACULATE level of skill, detail, and complexity that you can't help but taste this in every dish. The flavors are bursting with taste combinations that you've simply never tried before. In brief -- it's the best restaurant we've ever dined at -- ever. We each ordered the 9-course tasting menu, substituting the cheese course for wagyu beef (I love cheese, but can't really get into it as an actual 'course' i don't think, c'mon right?). I'm not about to go down the list of the entire nine courses as other people have adequately done before me, but will just loosely comment at the highlights (although EVERY dish was its own highlight). The ONLY thing the GF and I didn't really care for, was the 'carrot / curry' shot of the amuse bouche. Not that it was bad by any means, but we just particularly weren't feelin' it. I also have to mention that the reason we came to this restaurant, was because we were impressed with seeing chef / owner Michael Cimarusti on Top Chef Masters and also on seeing his restaurant featured on season 2 of 'After Hours with Daniel.' Plus, this guys restaurant has a 2 star Michelin rating for Christ's sake, it was a no-brainer. Michael Cimarusti is clearly a young talent that should one day leave his mark on the industry. When watching and witnessing this talent, it is so evident how passionate and knowledgeable he is on food, particularly seafood -- his trademark and specialty. And i do have to agree and confirm this -- the seafood dishes at this restaurant were the most skillfully cooked and prepared i have ever experienced, flat out. The halibut and salmon courses for example, I honestly didn't know fish could be cooked so masterfully and just SO well. When i hear salmon, i usually don't get excited since 'salmon tastes like salmon,' but Providence prepares it in such a way where you will hardly recognize the fish. In addition to the seafood, the meats as well were the best I've ever tasted. I'm admittedly not much of a veal person, but the veal dish that came out easily made me a fan, well, at least the way Cimarusti prepares it -- excellent and remarkable. Also, the wagyu beef that came out was not only expensive, but worth every fucking penny; the BEST piece of meat I've ever placed into my mouth -- period. The marbling of the fat in this beef is what makes it incredibly scrumptious, literally melting to the slight heat of your tongue upon contact. It even just FEELS good inside your mouth as you savor every bite. Side note: Enamored by the wagyu here, I also ordered it at the infamous Spago, days later in our trip. As beyond belief in flavor as the wagyu was at Spago's however, it easily still came in 2nd to Providence's. Had I ate the wagyu at Spago's BEFORE Providence -- I would of prematurely deemed it "the best I've ever had." However, Providence's version was just THAT good. I should highlight other aspects of this restaurant as well, such as the service: best I've ever experienced! It made the service at the rest of our other restaurants we dined at look like Denny's, no exaggeration. Service here is an overall experience (at least for the tasting menu). It is also by no way intimidating, 'snobby,' or 'stuffy' at all. They really go out of their way to be strictly knowledgeable and professional. Providence seems very self-aware in the fact that it knows you are spending TOP dollar at the restaurant, treating you accordingly. What was really amazing, was that for each course that came out, they had a separate waiter explaining exactly what you were eating. I hate restaurants that don't explain once more what you are eating, as it is very easy for us patrons to simply forget the details of what we ordered between the moment your eyes are off the menu to the time the dishes are served. So, Providence's attention to this detail was well applauded. Just professional in every way. When you dine at a top tier restaurant like this, or any restaurant for that reason -- I feel it is not presumptuous of me to expect to feel like the only table in a restaurant -- busy or slow. Providence seems to go out of there way making you feel like the only one dining. If you are a true foodie, Providence is an OBVIOUS destination. And as Diego G. so amply put it: "if you don't like it - you just don't get it." I couldn't agree more.

Finally, I crossed off Providence of my list. After several recommendations and hearing some mixed reviews about Michael Cimarusti's restaurant, we decided to give it a try during Thanksgiving weekend. My first impression, bad bad interior. I expect luxurious decor with cozy ambiance. For a two stars Michelin guide restaurant, and it was plain ugly looking decoration and atmospere. Lingering on the menu for a good 15 minutes, we decided to go all out on the chef's tasting menu. After 4 hours long of 16 hit and miss courses, I feel like Providence is not just a dinner, it's an impeccable dining experience. The savory courses made by Cimarusti's magical hands were spectacularly genius. Complex ingredients that I never thought of were put together and works well together. Food plating and presentation were flawless and rally my visual senses. Ready for the lowdown? Here we go! 1. greyhound, mojito, gin and tonic gelee - hit 2. cured sea trout, gougeres, white soy/ wasabi marshmallow, carrot soup/vadouvan - so-so 3. hokkaido scallop. nasturtium blossoms, fresh grated wasabi, crispy rice cracker - hit 4. dungeness crab, mandarin, avocado crepe - hit 5.santa barbara sea urchin. cauliflower parfait - hit 6. soft scrambled eggs with italian black truffles. served with toasted brioche - miss 7. unagi risotto with italian black summer truffles - hit 8.  niman ranch pork belly. carrot-orange puree, pickled ramps, mizuna, carrot-ginger butter - miss 9. wild new zealand john dory. matsutake, rosemary - my favorite! 10. loin of colorado lamb. cauliflower brussels sprouts - hit, cauliflower never taste that good! 11. cheese platter 12. kalamansi gelèe. white chocolate coconut soy milk soup, litchi-shisho sorbet - hit 13. tangerine. ginger granita, vanilla ice cream, basil - so-so 14. apples in butterscotch, cashews, north star cherries, miso ice cream - hit 15. milk chocolate-whiskey panna cotta, bailey's ice cream, coconut ravioto - hit 16. petit fours The service was stellar, no doubt, when you pay so much, you'll expect professional and knowledgeable service. Desserts are exceptionally mind-blowing! Exquisite creativity and combination of ingredients melts on my mouth. Fabulous endings!   Providence delivers an extraordinary meals of my life, however how much are you willing to pay for good food? I'm not rushing back to Providence any time soon. $400 (for two) a pop, that's why. But if money were no object, I'll be delighted to eat here on any given day. pics - http://www.yummycrave.co…

This place is for anyone with a seriously refined palate.  So far the best meal in LA!!! Favorite dish was foie gras ravioli with shaved truffles and australian wagyu-style beef. This is a high end restaurant with an exeptional service and attmosphere. Something you mostly get in NYC and not in LA. Highly recommend it.

Hrm...came here for my 21st bday cuz i like to think i'm baller haha.  Anyways, while I did have really high expectations for this place given the Michelin stars and the reviews, I was also a little worried for a few reasons.  1-the last 2 star restaurant I went to was Manresa...and that was a HUGE disappointment.  1-I've never gone with just someone else my age and I was worried about service. First off, I'm happy and more than a little relieved to say that the first concern was pretty unwarranted. The food here is pretty phenomenal.  These were the most refined thoughtful dishes I had (chef's tasting so I won't bore you with the individual details) though I must say Manresa's bacon brioche still has not been topped.  There were a few things that I thought wasn't great, including the nori bread, the uni chawanmushi  (cold and slimy...so sad cuz i love uni...), the desserts (EXCEPT for the tropical one with the baby coconut, which was absolutely orgasmic), and the boring and scarce petit fours.  Overall however, I felt the menu was excellent. HOWEVER, and this is a big deal to me, and I imagine everyone who ends up shelling out $500 for dinner, the service was NONEXISTENT.  The servers were nice and we ended up having a nice conversation with one who actually used to attend UCLA but our captain was literally absent the ENTIRE meal, with the exception of ONE occurrence to fill our waters.  I actually watched him during out 3.5 hour meal and he definitely went around to other tables to check in a lot more but i guess since we were young and didn't order wine, he didn't even bother.  He was really really cold and kind of snooty...hello! I understand if you're busy but this was just ridiculous.  Put a damper on the whole thing.  Dave and Vlad at Gary Danko are SO much better...as well as the captain at the Dining Room....COME ON!! Chef Cimarusti, please have your staff treat the young ones better, we will be the ones who patronize or blacklist your restaurant for decades to come.

Absolutely amazing! Had the 5 course tasting menu and added a couple more dishes we wanted to try. The food is pure genius. Great balance, taste and beautiful presentation. My stomach is rumbling just thinking about it. If you're comfortable shelling out at least $300 for this place, you MUST go.

On one of my possibly last trips down to the greater Los Angeles area before heading out to the great desert of Iraq, my friends and I thought to make a special occasion by going to as many nice restaurants as possible on this short trip.  We did originally have reservations to Gordon Ramsey's At the London.  While not a fan of the show, I was hoping for some traditional fairs and my friend got reservations quickly.  A couple of days later another friend of mine suggested Providence.  With its 2 Michelin stars and beautiful website, we decided to change venues for our Saturday evening. The evening started off well with a great pear martini from their bar.  the only problem was that my friends glass was chipped and it took 15 minutes to get a replacement drink.  Our head waiter was very good and did very well to check up on us for drinks and water, however when it came to some of the dishes he seemed to not know the answer one too many times.  I am not talking about specific ingredients or wine pairings, but simple questions like where the butter came from or how many counts in the espresso. We all got the chef's tasting menu and i also got the wine pairing.  I will have to admit that their sommelier was quite proficient at her job and the pairings were done quite well. Now onto the major disappointment.  The majority of the meal seemed to be based of asian fusion.  While i cannot remember every single thing that came out, I do remember it started with campachi, totally Japanese style.  They also went onto serve seared ahi, with soy sauce and wasabi, pork belly, uni, and halibut in a Chinese sauce.  I could have gotten any one of these things to eat done way better and a lot cheaper at a number of restaurants in the area.  If i were not telling the truth, why were two of my dished paired with a sake?  I definitely did not see the East Coast tradition mixed in with West coast eccentricity touted on their website.  To me, it was just a bunch of wannabe asian fusion, what seemed to be put together last minute.  There was only one dish, the lamb, that could even be considered part of a traditional meal. In the end, the wine and cheese plate were the only things that I could consider agreeing with Michelin on.  Since, I've been to the other 2 star restaurants in the area, I don't know what Michelin see's in this place with 2 stars.  Maybe they burned a little to bright, too early and have since lost their roots?

I was lucky enough to get treated to the 10 course chef's menu here. Even luckier still because we sat at the chef's table in the kitchen and got the premium wine pairings. The food was good, lots of molecular gastronomy. Very intresting amuse bouche, besides two courses the best dishes by far were the amuse. Was it blow me away amazing as expected? Sadly, no. Two of the ten dishes blew me out of the water. The scrambled truffled eggs with brioche and the pork belly. I also though the hamachi course was amazing but the 3 other diners with me thought it was okay. The wines were pretty damn good. Expensive but delicious and different. The sommelier I found charming, but my table didn't really agree and instead found him semi-goofy and flustered. The two desserts were uninspired and one was, frankly, not so good. It was chocolate ice cream rolled in crumbs and it ended up tasting like it had been rolled in Nestle Quik and it was like when you inhale confectionary sugar. It nearly choked everyone at the table. The bill ended up being around 2k for the 4 of us. We were there for 5 hours. Not one chef came out to greet us or talk to us. Not even a sous chef. The host, besides seating us did not come back to ask us about our meal. The manager never stopped in. At this price point, that's unexceptable. Did I mention the host of this dinner was a coowner of one of the most famous bars in LA and brought 100 free drink tickets for the staff so they could enjoy her bar with no cost? Was there any thank you or follow up - no. Again, the food didn't blow me away for the price point or the 2 Michellin stars - and the lack of attention or customer service for such an exclusive meal and elaborate cost is reprimandable - especially because it was a Wednesday and they weren't slammed. Tsk, Tsk.

My husband took me here for a nice dinner (granted I chose the place!) and it was lovely.  I had higher expectations than what turned out to be, but I still was pleasantly pleased.   We opted for valet and since we did not happen to have any cash on hand, they allowed for us to pay and tip on our bill.  That was really great so that my husband didn't have to walk to the nearest liquor store for an ATM. We had reservations, but considering how popular this place gets, we had to wait at the bar area.  Fortunately there was an open sofa for us to sit.  Since I am pregnant, I couldn't tell you about the wine or spirits offered here.  The hubby had the usual: crown and diet coke.  The bartender was excellent though watching his interaction with other customers. The service was attentive at dinner.  I did expect a bit more, having optimal service at Gordon Ramsay prior to here, but it was good. The hubby and I decided to do the 5 course taste meal.  He was suckered in to it as both parties have to participate.  The food was good; not wow, but good.  Presentation and explanation of the courses was top notch.  And I love the mini candies given with the bill.  They were unique and colorful, such as the calamansi caramel.

My fiance took me here for my birthday recently.  The food was good, the service was top notch, the ONLY complaint that I had about the restaurant was where they sat us.   Now don't get me wrong, I am not the type to complain because we weren't sat in the main dining room, or we weren't seated at the "best" table in the house, but to seat us at a table where all we could see were the wait staff getting to reset tables or to grab extra cutlery kind of ruined the whole experience.   We got there early in the night, around 7 because we had another engagement at 10.  The main dining room was about half filled, and the little extension was almost empty.  They sat us at the table in the "connection" if you will, between the main dining room and the canopied extension.   It was still beautiful, but they sat us so we were staring at the table where they kept all the extra water, the extra silverware, the empty plates, etc.  So throughout our entire dinner, our conversation was interrupted by the clinking of silverware, the wait staff standing not 3 feet from us setting up to serve other diners, watching the bus boys clear out empty plates and glasses, etc.   At first I had thought that it was because other people had reserved the tables, therefore they had to sit us there, but I counted half a dozen tables that remained empty the entire night.  My finance had reserved more than a month before, so I did not understand the reasoning behind it.   Maybe it was because we were the minority, or maybe it was our age, but I was a little annoyed with the experience as we could not have a private conversation at all.  And it was not the wait staff's fault, but no matter how quiet you try to be, the stacking of plates and grabbing extra cutlery is going to be very loud in a quiet restaurant.   Again, the food was good, the wait staff was great, but both my fiance and I were very disappointed with the experience, especially since we spent over $300 not including drinks.

Overall: 4.5 stars I've been wanting to try Providence since last May and it was everything I expected.  An ideal evening with great company and remarkably prepared food. It's a restaurant focused on meeting the high demands of seafood lovers, but they do provide meat options.  We decided to try the 5 course tasting menu and some of us had the wine pairing.  Now be prepared to enjoy the 2.5 hr experience.  I can't imagine how long it would take if we had the 9 course tasting menu or the chef's menu.  Regrettably, the only limiting factor to the perfect dinner was the wine pairing.  Honestly, I am not a wine connoisseur, but I do believe that everyone has their own preference.  There was 1 interestingly tasting wine, but unfortunately, I didn't write it down.

For some reason, I was very underwhelmed by Providence.  I'm very sensitive (i.e. picky) about my fish, and my entree was definitely a tad bit overdone.  At many other restaurants it would have been acceptable, but I had lofty hopes for the supposed best seafood spot in a very food-conscious city.  Also, service was overly snooty; we actually had to ask for the chocolate lollipops that are usually standard, and we didn't get any petit fours. Disclaimer: I did not try the tasting menu, which I hear is the only way to go.

YUM.  Every time I come here, I have a really stellar meal. The last visit we were fortunate enough to sit in the private room overlooking the kitchen.  There's a wall of glass so you're not disturbed by the noises of the kitchen, but it's really a fascinating experience watching all the meticulous work that goes into every single little dish.  It really makes you appreciate every detail all the more! I can't add much to all the gushing reviews here, except to say have a light lunch and get the full tasting menu.  Every course is delicious with each intricate flavor component carefully thought out and flawlessly executed.  The standout for me is the sea urchin served in a farm fresh egg- tiny, rich as all get out and packed full of flavor.  I could have eaten a dozen of these and died happily of a coronary.  Even the uni-shy people in my party absolutely raved about it.  Delicate yet huge salt encrusted spot prawns were also amazing, finished table side with much flourish. It's not exactly cheap, but I've had less impressive meals for much more.  Providence is totally worth the cost and a trip back whenever you can afford it!

I can't believe I actually ate here. I can't believe how much I spent. I can't believe that I couldn't get through the 16 courses (they tell you its 14--- don't believe them!) plus wine pairings. And now here's what I had, with out much description because it was truly a blur. A delicious, delicious blur... 1. Margarita and Greyhound Cocktails in a little Gelatin ball: sorry if that makes absolutely no sense to you. They were good! 2. Focaccia and Brioche: they offer you so much bread-- I beg you not to eat it (although it was delicious) because it takes up valuable space in your tummy!! This was the beginning of my ultimate defeat. DON'T TAKE THE BREAD! 3. Chorizo and Squid Skewer: Simple, grilled squid with a chunk of chorizo served on a stick. A perfect, bite-size treat. 4. Oyster, Cucumber Sorbet, and Golden Tomatoes: Very light and good. 5. Seared Blue Fin Tuna, Basil Seeds, Ginger Confit: One of our favorites of the night for sure. The basil seeds were bizarre, almost like slippery green pomegranate seeds. The tuna was possibly the highest quality. 6. Santa Barbara Sea Urchin, Champagne Beurre Blanc, Fine Herbes, Caviar, served inside of an Egg: Another favorite. I don't normally like sea urchin but of course quality is what counts and Providence doesn't cheap out on you (of course, you are paying a billion dollars for this quality so it's to be expected!). 7. Prawn and Salt-Crusted White Asparagus: Wow... the prawn was basically a lobster. Gigantic, and sooo flavorful. The asparagus was as good as any asparagus could be. 8. Freshwater Eel, Daikon, Abalone, Dashi Butter Foam, Spring Onion: The abalone was so tender, the eel so flavorful, possibly all thanks to the ridiculously good dashi butter that I now want on everything I eat. 9. Seared Foie Gras, Cherries, Mizuna, Fennel, Foie Gras Powder: Don't know what came first-- Michael Cimarusti's foie gras powder or Ludo Lefebvre's foie gras powder. (I should tell you now, with great embarrassment, that after 9 courses I was about to become the first person to throw up at a Michelin star restaurant. Thankfully, I didn't.) 10. Pork Belly, Porcini, Polenta, Summer Truffles, Fried Quail Egg, Miner's Lettuce: Wow. Long story short-- everything in this world should be served with a fried quail egg and truffles. Obviously. 11. Salmon Belly, Hazelnuts, Moreals, Roasted Baby Carrot Puree, Pea Tendrils: I could barely take a bite of this at this point, but I will say that Salmon Belly for breakfast the following day was one of the best (and tiniest) breakfasts I've ever had! 12. Basil-Crusted Lamb Saddle, Tomato Compote, Chorizo, Cauliflower: Another dish I got to go. Yes, you can get your unfinished courses to go, they even box them separately. How sweet. This was very very rich so naturally I was FORCED to eat this for breakfast the following morning but wow, that basil crust was incredible. The crust has to be what kept the lamb so moist and tender inside. 13. Cheese Plate: We had a cow, sheep, and goat cheese. Your plate comes with a ton of stuff, and I was completely overwhelmed, tried a few things, and practically sat this one course out. 14. Coconut Milk-Pandan Soup, Thai Flavored Granita, Mango Jelly, Fried Banana: They called this "Tricks" as in the cereal. And yes, it tasted EXACTLY like tricks. Like a very very expensive/overpriced Tricks. It was fun though and kinda showed a humorous side to the chef, I would say. 15. Dulce De Leche-Miso Panna Cotta, Blueberries, Passion Fruit, Rice Crisp, Buckwheat: Strange and very sweet. Too sweet for me and my dad actually. 16. Milk Chocolate Mousse, Raspberry-Ginger, Hazelnut Marshmallow: This was great, very rich though. One half bite was enough for us. The marshmallow was unique and I wish I could make smores out of it at home! Oh wait--- did I say 16 courses? I guess bread doesn't technically count but they offered it to us so many times... anyway-- 17. Petit Fours: These went straight into a to-go box, didn't even see them til the next day. But these were my favorite desserts of the night for sure. Mini macaroons, and some assorted chocolates and gummy treats. Loved it all and I'm not a huge sweets person. --- Ok, so other than almost throwing up $200+ worth of food, it really was an experience. I will never EVER do the 14/16/17 course menu again. 9 would be PERFECT. I left off all of the wines in the pairing because after a few glasses I clearly lost track. I will say the first few were our favorites, especially the sake called Junmai Dai Ginjyo, Kanchiku.

A group of us went to Providence for the last supper for two of our friends leaving the country. I knew this place was fancy and was expecting to drop an arm and a leg. And maybe my first child. There were about 9 of us and if one person wanted to 5 course meal, we all had to get it. So we did. Luckily, not all of us had to get it with wine pairings and if one person had specific dietary needs, they were able to accommodate. Service: Excellent! We had several servers throughout the night and each time a course came out, they would explain everything about the entree. We would occasionally have the manager come out and check to see if we were doing okay. Our water glasses were always full. Food: Very unique and all very delicious. Each course was prepared just right and was set very decoratively on the plates. Drinks: Alcohol was yummy! I had an Asian Pear Martini which was pretty darn good. The wine pairings with the food matched very well. Ambience: Dim lighting and scattered seashells across the wall and ceiling. It's definitely romantic and if you're lucky, you'll have a star sighting! We saw Hiro from Heroes at a corner table. I would recommend this place if you've got money to drop or for an EXTREMELY fancy occasion. :-)

Not that it needs much repeating on here, but my boyfriend and I splurged on the 9-course tasting menu here about a month ago.  We loved every minute! It was a last-minute walk-in right before the last seating at Providence, so we sat at the bar and decided to eat there.  The bartender let us have our privacy, while still hooking us up with some stellar cocktails (their list is very interesting and they have a full fruit stand behind the bar for muddling and blending).   The standout dishes of the meal were the cheese plate (always), the blood-orange sorbet with black olive crunchy bits (a novelty, but quite tasty), and the chocolate & mushroom dessert...I ate and enjoyed every bite of the other dishes, but these are the ones I remember best. The staff was informative and prompt, we didn't feel underserviced just because we were at the bar.  Oh--and we found street parking easily, because Cole happens to have diagonal spaces...woo-hoo!

2 Michelin Stars; Best Chef "Pacific" nominee, James Beard Foundation; Top 40 Restaurants in the US by Gayot; Michael Cimarusti, the Chef/Owner was on Top Chef Masters Season 1, etc... who doesn't want to eat at a highly regarded restaurant? So this was the spot for my second birthday dinner. On to what I drank and ate: ASIAN PEAR MARTINI ($14) -- 5 stars stolichnaya vanilaa vodka, sake, passion fruit, monin vanilla syrup, organic pear juice Fruity, sweet and easy to drink. This drink was tasty and dangerous cuz you can drink a lot and get happy. The bartender says it's one of the most popular drinks on the cocktail list. BACON BRIOCHE (comp) -- 3.5 stars The server came around with a bread basket and let us choose. I got the bacon biscuit. The bread was warm, but not piping hot. Flaky, buttery and bits of bacon made it tasty. It was served with pats of butter and sea salt.   AMUSE BOUCHE (comp) a - "Gin and Tonic" in gelée form -- 3 stars It's white and rectangular, served on a white spoon. Squeeze a bit of lime on top and eat it in one bite. Taste-wise, it is a gin and tonic jello shot with a slight taste of fizz. It was interesting. b - "Greyhound" sphere cocktail - vodka- or gin-based with grapefruit -- 3 stars A pink sphere on a short metal spoon. It bursts like a bubble in your mouth, then you get the tart taste of grapefruit and kick of alcohol.   c - Gold flake garnish, trout sashimi, tiny rice balls on a gelée. -- 5 stars, my fav dish of the night OMG! This was my favorite part of the amuse bouche. I could eat a lot of this. Everything tasted very good together... flavor explosion.   Appetizer: KUMAMOTO OYSTERS (WA) -- 4 stars traditional mignonette, cocktail sauce consomme Our server forgot to bring it out in the beginning. We got this appetizer before the 5th course. The oysters were small and sweet. And the sauces complement them nicely. The 5-course tasting: 1. JAPANESE KANPACHI crispy rice crackers, coriander, soy creme fraiche -- 2.5 stars There was 3 slices of kanpachi. My first bite tasted okay, it tasted fishy. Normally, kanpachi is mild and sweet. 2. MAINE SEA SCALLOPS japanese eggplant, rhubarb, cashews, reduction of vadouvan and jurancon -- 4 stars, a fav 3. WILD DAY BOAT PACIFIC HALIBUT (SITKA, ALASKA) summer squash, black olive, dried apricot, basil -- 3 stars Half of the table's fish was too salty and the other half's were fine. Other than that, the fish was cooked perfectly, crispy outside and super flaky inside. 4. MARCHO FARMS VEAL TENDERLOIN (FRANCHONIA, PA) sweat peas, bacon, almond, morel mushrooms -- 4 stars The veal was cooked perfectly and the flavors were good. 5. YUZU CURD, MERGINGUE blackberry sorbet, jasmine -- 4 stars PETITE FOURS (comp) a. Chocolate marshmallow -- 3 stars b. Dark chocolate macaroon --2 stars c. Pistachio in white chocolate nugget -- 3 stars I've heard so many great things about this restaurant, but overall I didn't go ga ga or say "Ooo... I love this place!" The food was good, but I wasn't wowed. For a restaurant of this caliber and category, I'm rating it as 3 stars. A week after, I talked to fellow foodie and he says unfortunately I might have gone on an off day. I think I'll may have to come back and try the food again.

Again...with these places that have several hundred reviews, I always feel like I'm arriving 2 hours late to a party and dressed in socks.  So what's to be said that hasn't been said before? G and I went there for her 4th b-day dinner and had the full tasting menu, with David for our server.    Listen...this is a place that exemplifies the saying...you get what you pay for! Columbia River king salmon with dashi butter and white asparagus, Santa Barbara uni served with egg, kampachi, Hokkaido scallops with a curry reduction and ramps, halibut with octopus and a tomato compote with lemon pickle, pork tenderloin with a morrel reduction and sweet pea leaves, and on and on and on.  The food parade lasted  5 hours.  Thank God for comfortable chairs and a fun couple next to us!   You might want to take out a loan before making reservations, but if awesome had a name, it would be Providence.

This place is for serious eaters only!!!  I had the tasting menu with wine pairing and it was fabulous. Fresh, tasty, and  Beautifully presented. Expect to spend a few hundred for 2 people. Tasting for 2 was $500 and for 4, I don't even wanna know how much it was...but this place is incredibly good. Not for people on a budget.

My wife and I celebrated our 11th anniversary here last night. We both had the 15 course Chef's menu with wine pairings. The most expensive meal of my life and probably worth twice what we paid. The food was nothing short of exceptional, I'm not sure my taste buds will ever be the same. The wine pairings were all spot on and complimented / enhanced the dishes the way only a perfect wine can. The only thing better than the food and the wine was the service. From bottom to top, the staff did an excellent job and made us feel right at home throughout our 4.5 hour meal. Epic!

Went here last night for the special 5 course tasting menu for $65.  Can't beat that!  We brought our own bottle of wine since Mondays have "no corkage fee".  All the food was SO delicious and presented SO beautifully!  So, here's the breakdown on the gloriousness we enjoyed. *Alcohol Amuse Bouche - wow...those encapsulated things were amazing....how they get alcohol into a thin gelcap that bursts in your mouth...amazing. *Another Amuse Bouche - wasabi marshmallow, a cheese puff and a sea trout ceviche-like with salmon roe, lime gel and sesame cracker balls....AMAZING!  This was my favorite thing! *Japanese Kanpachi - was very good, and the texture combination of the rice cracker and the kanpachi was very nice. *Salt Roasted Santa Barbara Spot Prawns - butterflied tableside....wow....never thought prawns could taste this fresh and this smooth...and the flavor from the salt roast...super nice! *Scallops - wow, perfectly cooked...my 3rd fave dish of the night.  I practically inhaled this one...SO good! *Wild Halibut - also wow...so perfectly cooked and combined with everything on the plate, it's the perfect bite. *Turbot - also wonderful....the carrots 4 ways were great, especially the carrot puree...and the morels mushrooms underneath were a very nice surprise. *Veal Medallions (sous-vide) - what can I say....perfect...sweet peas, almond slivers...Mmmm....my 2nd favorite dish. *Cucumber sorbet & yogurt - what a surprise!  So refreshing and palette cleansing.  There were little bits of cucumber in the sorbet too!! *Un Cafe a Bordeaux - mmmm...you can't go wrong w/ coffee, caramel & hazelnuts *Yuzu Curd w/ Blackberry sorbet - I loved the blackberry sorbet in this....and the meringue kisses were very nice too! *Ginger Gelee, Chocolate Marshmallow and Chocolate French Macaroons...oh....the macaroons....SO good! *Artisanal Chocolate Box - it's so delicious...and so beautiful...I almost didn't want to eat it....but couldn't help myself.  :D The service was excellent - attentive, informative, and witty.  I truly enjoyed all the little things - changing the silverware & plates after every course, fingertip washing bowls before the main course, describing each menu item when it's served, the 3 different types of bread/roll (bacon brioche, nori foccacia & plain roll) that are brought to your table on request...all these things made me happy. The interior was a very clean look with white lights and seashells on the upper walls & ceilings. Breakdown:  Valet is $5.50. 4 people (3 tasting menu, 1 a la carte item), 2 sodas, 1 martini, 4 coffees, 1 extra dessert, plus generous tip = $400 Was it worth it? Most definitely!!!

I should give this place two stars.  Michelin gave it two stars.  They're proud of that.  They even have this plaque out in front...  big shiny thing, Michelin, two stars. What, are my stars not worth as much as Michelin's?  What do they have that I don't?  I even own Michelins.  I drove there on four of those.  Why should their stars still be worth 2.5 times as much as mine? Do I have to make a plaque and hand it to restaurants?  And if I do, will they give me free food? Here's your Tim plaque.  Five stars.  Apparently mine aren't worth as much as those tire guide people's. If you get the wine pairing with any of the tasting menus, you will find this hilarious.  My wife sure did last night.  :)

Extremely Overpriced Pseudo "Asian Fusion" Makes Me Want to Hurl... Since when does super highly rated, Michellin 2-Star, restaurants serve some of the most overated, overpriced, unoriginal chef's menu around town. Apparently, Providence does (at least to us). Providence came highly recommended, but failed in almost every aspect. We paid almost 1000 for 3 people to eat there only get to some lame asian fusion dishes that I could easily get at any real asian restaurant in LA.. The food was certainly not truly Asian, and definitely poorly "fused". Plus they served me a martini in a broken glass and took 15 minutes to replace my drink. They served Kompachi first. Why would you just serve us some sashimi? I could have gone to any decent sushi restaurant for this. Then they served seared ahi tuna, really not much better than the seared tuna I could get at Cheesecake factory or some other joint. Then we got pork belly which I could get at Sam Woo for $12 for a whole dish. I was simply baffled. World renowned chef serves wanna-be Asian food at super expensive restaurant. The wine pairings are good, and the cheeses were good. The desserts were ok as well. Maybe they were "experimenting" that night on us or simply didn't care enough to serve us something decent. My advice: stay as far away as possible unless you have a craving for wanna-be Asian fusion for $200 a person. Boooooooooo!

I feel so spoiled to have come here for the third time this year. Chef Cimarusti never fails to impress with his exquisite culinary skills. Providence is truly a delightful restaurant you can rely on. Today we arrived at 1:50 pm and we seated at the best table in the restaurant, which is at the corner left entering the dining room. Our waiter greeted us with kindness and was very accommodating. On to the food: Complimentary bread: You get to choose from a small variety: wheat roll, bacon brioche, and nori focaccia. My personal favorite is the nori foccacia which is already perfectly seasoned, and soft texture wise. The bacon brioche is also a popular choice, having tiny bacon bits inside the bread. I think the weakest would be the wheat roll, since it is very dense every bite is very tough. Amuse Bouche: The amuse bouche is simply one of the best I have ever encountered. It includes: a greyhound, margarita gelee that bursts in your mouth with a grapefruit flavor. A very cold gin and tonic that is activated by the squeeze of a lime. The gin and tonic acts as a palate cleanser for me. Up next is my favorite a soy marshmallow covered with wasabi. Then comes the warm and hearty cheese cream puff. The amuse bouche ends with an amazing cured trout with trout roe, cream fraiche, and a 24 k edible gold leaf which is simply just heavenly. Japanese Kanpachi with assorted spring blossoms, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and white soy. Kanpachi is the greater amberjack's fish most mature age. The kanpachi went very well with the white soy vinegar and the fish was very fresh. This was one of the most scrumptious sashimi presentations I have had. Wild John Dory with morels, carrot reduction, hazelnuts, and baby globe carrots. All three times I went there I have ordered the john dory, because it is simply just divine. Luckily, they changed there style of preparation today so I got to try it a different style. The fish was cooked just perfectly medium and had the perfect seasoning on top. The slight sourness of the morels really work well to balance the sweetness of the carrot reduction. The baby globe carrots were so tender and just sweet enough to compliment the sauce and the fish. Wild striped bass with roasted sweet potato, ramps, dijon mustard. The dish was beautifully presented and the sweet potato was yellow (my favorite kind). My mother was very pleased with this dish and said that the bass had no fishiness and was cooked to perfection. Mignardises included a chocolate truffle, a generous lemon macaroon, and a raspberry fruit gelee. All three were mouthwatering, perfect in flavor, and having a perfect balance between sweetness and sourness. Providence is the stand out for high class, well known, and Michelin star rated restaurants.

This place doesnt retain 4.5 stars from 710+ reviews for no reason. The first time I was here, I wasnt a foodie yet...and of course, I didnt know how to appreciate Chef Chimarusti's creativity. Many years later, I return as a passionate foodie...and "nothing less than spectacular" is still an understatement! Not going to talk about the food bc all you yelpers already made your opinion heard.  One thing I will mention, is the dessert: Passion fruit - mango gel on white chocolate coconut soy milk soup with thai scented lychee sorbet Texture - you have the gelatin (mango gel), you have the soft and light (lychee sorbet), you have the firm and crisp (roasted coconut) and the light and delightful (soy milk soup).   Flavor - everything just tasted right and were in perfect compliment with all others.  Now achieve this in a single dish with so many components and dimensions is no small feat.  First thing that hits you is the aromatic thai scents in the lychee sorbet, followed by the mango gel (this is a supporting actor role), all combined in a fragrant, lightly sweetened (really lightly and exactly how I like my dessert) soy milk soup....complete deliciousness. Oh, there is a couple pieces of japanese basil in the soup....as small as they are, they provided that palette cleansing effect...definitely leave you longing for more. I would definitely go back to Providence, no doubt.  Next time, I would seriously consider just going back for the dessert tasting menu.   One last thing I must mention, they have a after dinner drink called Riazul -- if you are appreciate cognac and tequila -- you must not miss it. It is a mild tequila aged in wet cognac barrel for 2 years...end result is a smooth sipper infused with the sophisticated cognac after-taste.  Wonderful combination.  Couldnt end this perfect meal in a better way.

Did the 16 course with wine pairing and then added in a truffle linguini because we saw them shaving them off at another table and we couldn't resist. It was my husbands birthday so we said "f*$k it!" and went even more all out. I believe there are smaller tasting menus for more wallet friendly experiences. Completely stuffed, completely amazed, and thoroughly enjoyed. Service was impeccable, presentation was excellent. I would come here for another special occasion over say, the Bazaar at SLS. It is smaller and more intimate. I don't like uni and sautéed mushrooms so they obviously accommodated the menu to my liking.. For nearly $350/pp I would hope so. I just saw a cocktail feature on the cooking channel which makes me want to go back just to have drinks and some apps in the bar.

At this moment, Providence is quite simply the best restaurant in LA.  Before that, there was the first incarnation of Bastide.  You could also include L'Orangerie  (which is now closed since LA diners became less interested in the classic French dining experience) in what was a fine, fine-dining establishment . Last week at Providence, for only the second time, I was utterly in awe of their innovative, perfectly balanced, and savory chef's tasting menu.  The wine pairings were unique, special treats that were paired with extensive information after my barrage of questions.  I forget what our sommelier's name was but she is originally from New Jersey and her passion and knowledge were a joy to experience. Treat yourself. Go.

Downgrading to two stars as I was reminiscing about how underwhelming the tasting menu was.... Had a very good meal at Providence, but in this stratosphere of cuisine, and cost, I'm looking to be wowed.   And I wasn't even paying, so I'm not even biased by the sting of the bill.  Had the recommended 5 course tasting menu.  Here's the rundown: 1) Amuse buche - Really cool trio of cocktail infused treats.  Enjoyed the Gin & Tonic the most, don't know how they had all the liquid on the inside! 2) Dungeness Crab - Crab filled crepe along with a buddy of fresh, cold dungeness.  The crepe was great, and the crab good, but have had equally good a mid-priced seafood restaurants. 3) Tuna Tartare - Very nice tartare, but not all that unique from the tartare you can have at any bistro (and much smaller) 4) Halibut - My favorite dish.  Fish was cooked perfectly with a really nice sauce and baby artichokes.   5) Veal - Very nice veal, simply prepared, and cooked perfectly. The wine pairings were really nice and highly recommended if you do the tasting menu.  The server seems to think we were the only people in LA who've ever heard of Portugese Vinho Verde.  Overall, outstanding service, extremely nice and soothing decor (albeit all the cheesy Burt Bacharach music you'd expect), but at the end of the day, the food did not strike me as unique and memorable as is required of a restaurant in the $$$$$ circuit.  While I didn't love Melisse, I found the food more playful, creative, and special...so would probably recommend over Providence.

I was so impressed by our first experience at Providence, that I made arrangements for us and some close friends to experience the chef's table.  I can't even think of a word good enough to properly describe the amazing experience we had. The chef's table is located in a really nice, private room just outside the kitchen, complete with floor to ceiling glass for a clear view of everyone in action.  Chef Cimarusti prepared one of the best tasting menus that I've ever had. Feel free to browse the pics of the night, complete with detailed explanations of the dishes: http://gallery.me.com/ja… This place is phenomenal, and Chef Cimarusti really outdid himself.  I can't wait to go back. http://www.pleaseaddbaco…

I have never had a bad meal at Providence. Definitely worth it's Michelin star rating. The restaurant itself is very understated yet classy, the food and the service steal the show.  Perfect for special occasions. I am not a fan of most tasting menus, but I have to say it is a "must" here.

This is the true meaning of five-star dining: atmosphere, service, preparation, presentation. It's all about attention to detail. If a restaurant can do all that, I'll kiss their feet and shout their name from the heavens. People talk about the neighborhood, but I kind of like it this way, and I think they put it here on purpose. I'm sure they could have set up their shingle anywhere they wanted to. It's not snobby in this part of town. In fact, I think there used to be a restaurant on this former site that I worked at for a few weeks or a month many many years ago. The most memorable part of that experience was accidentally pouring a drink down a lady's back, but I digress. Service was kind of unparalleled. We had a waiter, Steven, who was really, really nice. Best thing was, we could really talk to the guy like a human being. Wonder why that's so hard these days....hmmm. Kind of an existential question. Food preparation, presentation and quality was really remarkable. If I were you, I'd go for the five course tasting menu. I won't spell it out here, it's already been done ad nauseam. But definitely go for the hand harvested scallops, they should be illegal. Eating them is way better than sex, but that just may be a reflection of my current monk-like lifestyle (what can I say, I'm a grad student). One of the five courses is veal, done up just right, but not quite as good as sex. Momma told me it's not polite to talk about money, so I won't say too much about our bill. Let's just say its not cheap, but if the food is good enough to make you cry, why not? Have fun, y'all.....!

There is something off putting about a restaurant that oozes its status from every pore the minute you walk in. Understatement does seem to be the key when you walk into one of these higher end spots. Well, the out of the way location of Providence certainly hits that mark, however, by the time you enter and get to the wait staff, you know where you are. Or more apt, perhaps, is that THEY know where you are. With that said, I would rate the restaurant a solid 4.5 based on their salt roasted santa barbara spot prawns alone. I dream about these prawns at night - yes, they were that good. Other dishes of note were the Muscovy duck (4.5), lobster (4) and one of the better caviar's I've tried (4.5) (although in all fairness, my caviar expertise is still attempting to catch up with that of my duck). The bar? A 3. Sorry. If you want something with a bite to it, make sure to be insistent.

I need to just say up front, before I go jerking off the chefs at Providence, that at $35 an entrée, you may be whoring yourself on a street corner before you end up in here. But if you're lucky enough to have a large fine dining budget, read on. The vibe is a little strange for such an upscale place. The waiters, dressed casual but chic in tan robes and black t-shirts, are available to answer any questions about the unusual menu items while Beck, Fiona Apple, and Neil Young emanate softly from the speakers. I started with the Maine Lobster Bloody Mary, a salad of lobster and grape tomatoes with a tomato and celery gelee. It was joined by a celery sorbet with horseradish crème fraiche that highlighted the horseradish flavor without the painful, nostril-flaring heat it usually packs. I also tried the Foie Gras Parfait, which had a gel layer of Hungarian sweet wine and came with poached Asian pears, curry pear au jus, toasted brioche and foie gras powder. This all sounds kind of intimidating, but it's good if you can handle that much foie gras--I thought the buttery texture was too rich after awhile. Before the appetizers, the considerate wait staff brought us some spectacular amuse-bouche--free creations to sample while you wait. What looked like a mini mug of beer turned out to be a divinely rich melon soup with flavorful lime foam, paired alongside a soy marshmallow with crunchy wasabi seeds. The chef tries some wacky things, but you're in good hands here. Our attentive waiter always came by between bites, when our mouths were not full, and the staff was conversational without being annoying. Providence specializes in seafood, so for dinner I tried the Sea Scallops and Pacific Big Eye Tuna. Santa Barbara raw pistachios and Tahitian squash joined the scallops in a dish that plays mind games with your fork--think you're stabbing into another pistachio or squash chunk? It's actually sweet pistachio cream or squash puree. The scallops were velvety and nothing was overcooked, as squash and scallops can easily be. The tuna came with small chunks of chorizo, Japanese sword squid, fennel, and oven-dried tomatoes. The chorizo was very cured, which gave a strong flavor to everything, even the tuna. It was the heart of the dish, so make sure you really like chorizo before ordering this. With such amazing savory samplings, one might expect a skimp on dessert. Not here, where I was shocked to find bizarre flavor combinations pleasing my palate. The Chocolate Mousse with Horchata ice cream and green avocado-banana puree had glazed sliced almonds and cookie crumbs as a garnish, and a brown sugar crust on the mousse. This mix seems to lack focus, but put a little of everything on a spoon and you'll be astounded at the premeditated medley of textures and flavors. The same can be said for the Milk Chocolate Panna Cotta, with mini house-made marshmallows, cocoa-coconut streusel, and Kahlua sauce, where the creaminess of the panna cotta holds the family of ingredients together. Ordering these types of dishes can be scary at first but doubt fades with every course here, all the way up to the dessert amuse-bouche that accompanied the check--orange spice caramels, dark chocolate peanut butter cups with sea salt, and raspberry gelees. These chefs never skip a beat, though with that chocolate mousse, my heart surely did.

We did the 9-course Tasting Menu. Let's not talk about the bill. I don't know how Yelpers are able to remember and review each course with so much detail. Seriously, each dish was such a surprisingly complex blend of so many different flavors and vegetable ingredients that I had never heard of that most of the time we weren't able to identify what we were tasting as wonderful and interesting as it was. (I was also too self-conscious to take flash photos) Me: Wow, this black stuff is great. What is it? BF: I don't know. I wasn't paying attention to the waiter Me: I couldn't take all of that info in. BF: Me neither BF:  I like the white stuff. What is it? Me: I don't know. BF: I can't remember what the guy said it was Me: Neither can I. (We call the waiter over) Waiter: It's a "(4-syllable-word)" BF and I both stare blankly at each other. Waiter: It's a type of root vegetable. We thank him and continue eating. Never heard of it. And will probably never remember it. Yes, this happened with almost every course. In summary, we loved everything here. The cocktails (Pisco Sour and Mai Tai) were a little weak but the food was amazing. The gelatinous Mojito balls that burst with fresh-minted leaf flavor in our mouths were sensational, especially when followed with shots of chilled carrot soup. The Kampachi with the white sauce - delicious, as were the tart Scallops, and the poached oysters in a foamy (miso-based?) white broth. They do a lot of airy, foamy sauces at Providence. Also loved the cheese platter and the dessert with blood orange sorbet and blood orange meringue. Oh my goodness. Our 9-course menu took about 3 hours to complete and each course was the PERFECT size and the pacing of the courses was PERFECT. We left full but not bursting full. The service here is also impeccable and while you are in the restroom, they cover your food with a big silver lid and refold your napkin. BF thought the decor somewhat austere and un-intimate with its high ceilings, but that's a minor gripe. We both had a great evening here and next time, I want to try the 14-course Chef's menu and hope that someone else will foot the bill.

Final Decision: Good service, good food...that sums it all up. So one of my big food friends heard about the amazing deal that was offered this month and wrangled up all of her good friends for a potentially awesome night of food.  So after a few weeks of coordination, the night finally came and the crew rolled through for the what this Michelin Star rated restaurant had to offer.  This place is very inconspicuous and simple, on the outside several wooden planks that looks like the place was a boarded up home and a small, custom logo, literally I drive past this place all the time. Service: So we get in check on the reservation and was greeted by the host and several others who welcomed us warmly.   During dinner, we were approached by the sommelier, several wait staff, and were constantly checked by the head maitre d', a cool dude with a personality.  My only knock was that some of the wait staff seem to rush through their intro of the courses and at times I couldn't hear what were some of the ingredients, perhaps its their way to hide the recipes, but I do want to know what goes into my mouth. Decor: Smooth dark colors, at first glance you think that the restaurant was a small to medium sized spot nice and cozy, and then we were seated in a separated quiet private room, while others were placed in the main dining room or a slightly larger room, the place was surprisingly large. Food Ordered: 5 Course Tasting Menu:: Pre-dinner rolls - bacon brioche...that is truly the only roll you would need to hear and know of.  Warm, soft, delectable puff of heaven and earth as they are melded as one in the form of this dinner roll.  A must try whenever you visit. Amuse Bouche - Trio of 3 amuse...gelee of gin and tonic with lime, a margarita ravioli and small cup of trout with trout caviar and wasabi marshmallow and crisps.  The trout was fresh flavorful and well balanced, one of my faves out of the trio.  The ravioli was awesome as it looked like a small droplet of liquid bursting with flavorful liquor.  Gin I could do without.   Pacific Prawns - awesome preparation as they were fully cooked in 500 degree salt.  You would think the salt would dry up the shrimp but instead the product came out more juicier and the natural sweetness was enhanced by the saltiness.  I'd love this dish more if I hadn't tried the pacific prawns from Craftsteak.  See my other review for that. Japanese Kanpachi - came with crispy rice cracker, coriander and soy creme fraiche.  Nice smooth piece of sashimi with a modern spin on presentation of complimentary ingredients.  I wonder how this would taste in a hand or cut roll... Hokkaido Scallop - perfectly seared with eggplant, vadouvan and sauternes reduction and cashews. You can never go wrong with cashews...and here is a case in point.  The dish came out bright, and felt like an island of a scallop sitting on top of the sea of reduction with small nestlings of daikon and carrots.  Truly an exquisite and tasty dish. Wild Day-Boat Pacific Halibut - with summer squash, black olives dried apricots and basil.  I think I would have liked the dish more if the fish was not overcooked and the overpowering flavor of the olives were lightened up a little.   Veal Loin - One of my other favorite dishes of the night, something that truly you would not think of when having a tender piece of veal.  It was lightly seasoned and slowly cooked suvee style and which allow the product to maintain most of its moisture and came out a nice pink.  The final product has a soft consistency almost biting into a hearty sausage.  If I wasn't a beef lover already, I would be now. Yuzu Curd - with meringue and blackberry sorbet.  At first sight, I was pow pow wow.  After taking a few slivers of this and that off the plate, it was more pop pop flop.  The yuzu was very tarty, the sorbet was not too remarkable, and everything else was just okay.  I think I would rather have some kind of fried ice cream with some cool unique molecular gastronomic trick.   Caramel pieces - nothing too extraordinary...I was way too full to try any of these... In the end I felt that this place was a nice little splurge spot for a special occasion amongst friends just to have an awesome food experience.  However, keeping in mind any of the shortcomings that some of the 5 course dishes had provided, I feel that a return visit would far in between.  I love some of the dishes, but didn't like many of the others and feel that any other tastings would not be fruitful.

I celebrated my birthday here on  January 9th, 2010 and had a wonderful  experience that easily qualified as the best fine dining we've ever enjoyed in LA.  The 2 Michelin stars that Chef Cimarusti has garnered for this sophisticated seafood restaurant are well deserved. Service: This is where Providence far and away outshines most other LA fine dining restaurants. The service we received was flawless. Unpretentious, relaxing, perfect in every way. Attentive without ever being overbearing. Ambiance: The restaurant itself is modern, romantic, sophisticated and understated. Tables are spaced perfectly. Setting has a very Japanese/Zen aura. Food: Every facet of this menu is near perfect with unbelievablly fresh and exotic produce prepared in a multilayered, complex and beautiful manner. Our Dishes: Amuse Buche: Several delightful presentaions. Wasabi-Tofu Marshamallow, Gruyere Cheese Puff and lastly a Trout Sashimi w/ Gold Leaf, Lemon Gelee serve in a Shot Glass. These were the perfect introduction to Chef Cimarusti's menu. Whimsical, playful & refined. Bread: Amazing - Nori Focaccia & Bacon Brioche!! Yum! Appetizers - Chowda: My wifes App. - Silky, creamy, bold flavors with Bacon & Manilla Clams. Simply delicous. Foie Gras Saute w/ Cranberries, Quince & Nasturitums: I LOVE Foie Gras and I LOVE fresh Cranberries and this preparation was without equal. The absolute best Foie dish I've ever had anywhere!!!!! Lobster Risotto: Perfectly Al Dente though flavors were somewhat muted. Entrees - (ordered from Ala Carte Menu) Prime New York Steak w/ Burnt Brussel Sprout Leaves & Sauce Bordelaise- My wife's dish. Complex, multiple layers that complimented this perfectly medium rare beef. Pacific Ridgeback Swordfish w/ Hedgehog Mushrooms & Red Wine Reduction: My dish. Brought in that morning this fish was near perfect in every way. Rich, oceanic, meaty with complex, contrasting flavors. The reverance that Providence shows ingrediants and most especially seafood was apparent in this dish. Dessert - Un Caf Bordeaux - Caffe Mouse, Canalce Cream, Chicory Carmel & Hazelnuts - My wifes dessert. Rich, Silky and complex flavors with bold coffee undertones. These Pretzels Are Making Me Thirtsy: Chocolate Ganache, Pretzels, Peanut Butter w/ Chambly Noir Ice Cream - This dessert was a masterpiece!! The perfect marriage of flavor, texture & temperature. Unbelievable Belgian Dark Ale Ice Cream. The Pastry chef Adrian Vasquez is extremely gifted. Do not pass up the Dessert Menu at Providence. They even offer a Multi-course dessert tasting that I would love to return and experience some day soon. Mignardises: Several small, delightful candies to end our wonderful meal @ Providence. Upon reflecting on this meal some 7 months later it has to this date easily been the best fine dining meal and experience I've ever had in Los Angeles. Providence is a wonderful restaurant where service, food and ambiance marry to provide it diners with a unique and elevated culinary adventure.

Simply great.   Been there twice now, and each visit was sensational.  I had the pleasure to sit at the chef's table for my most recent trip to providence.  Chef Cimarusti was constantly keep his staff at an extremely high stand at all time.   This place may seem a bit pricy at first, but once you try it, it's worth every penny.  It takes at least 3 hours to complete their tasting menu, and each course will repeatedly blow your mind away.  On top of that, you pretty much constantly have 3 waiters serving you.  So far I could not find anything that does not satisfy me at this place.   You don't just get dinner here, you get a spectacular dining experience here.

This place is he quintessential place for seafood in la. Michael the former chef from water grill in downtown los angeles, has finally started a restaurant @ the former patina on melrose. My experience here the both times i went was averaging to about 3-4 stars.Only because they were both on Sunday and Michael wasn't there. The quality of the food was of great quality but the seasoning was off here and there. The appetizer are amazing. the combinations that the chef come up with are always up to date with new ideas and will definitely blow you away. Seldom they have truffle based tastings and if they do i highly recommend that you try it. Truffles are very delicate and when paired correctly it enhances the dish so much. Another must try, is their bacon ice cream over brown sugar. If you are a bacon lover like me this wont scare you rather call  our your name like a enticing hotty! The place has a nice decor and if you are going to make providence a special occasion, i suggest you try the chef''s table which seat you right in front of the kicthen with Glass doors to see all the action that goes down during service. Overall i have to rate this place a 4 because the taste of the food was not up to par when i tried it. But i know Michael has a great ideas and flavors because i used to go to water grill when he was there before.

The James Beard Foundation nominated Providence as the Best New Restaurant in the U.S. in 2005. The menu is mostly fish, the room is elegant, the service friendly (no attitude here), and the food is wonderfully innovative and delicious. Not cheap, but so worth it.

I was planning on writing this long review detailing everything about my experience there, but am unable because it was really just such an exquisite dining experience... nay, 5-hour adventure! I will try though... We did have an "in" since our friend is a chef there - appetizers! So, we did get major hook ups... head chef Michael came out from behind to say hi and thanks (so did the head pastry chef ... Adrien - I think that's his name)! An extra course here, an extra dessert here... but here's the skinny: My absolute favorites: - Smoked trout amuse bouche - Scallops with morels (I had John Dory - shellfish allergy) - Veal with chantrelles and a potato cooked in duck fat - Pork belly and octopus - Caramel pudding - White choco sorbet on yuzu gelatin Everything was delicious... the above is what stands out to me. Oh, can't forget my other absolute favorite... our server, Daniel! He's from Berlin and is wonderful! The service here was impeccable and divine. When we left I was SO FULL I had to unzip my high-waisted skirt a little in the car... yeah, classy, I know. I couldn't imagine EVER being hungry again. Yesterday I walked to class and back (4 mile round trip) to earn the dinner's calories. I'm going to walk today again... I would walk 8 miles any day to eat here again. Providence: (noun) God's foresight in his care for his creatures. I felt VERY cared for here.

Christmas Eve 2010 was spent at Providence. Yes, le hubby and I are a lucky duo. The decor was beautiful (under the sea!), the service was excellent (our waiter spoke to us in gangster-talk at times for kicks), and the food was splendid. For the special occasion, the Chef Cimarusti had prepared "La Vigilia - The Feast of the Seven Fishes" - a menu featuring seafood dishes inspired by his Grams and Great Grams. A limited a la carte menu was available as well, but le hubby and I decided to feast. I mean, doood, Christmas eve 2010 only comes once, you know? As an amuse bouche, we were presented with fish in a jar. I believe it was halibut, but I may be wrong. Omigosh, it was SOOOOOO good! Heaven spread out on toast points. *Nom* And then there were the "cheesy breads" (Yes, I just typed "cheesy bread" as a dish presented by a 2-star Michelin restaurant. Slap me now. Dammit. What are those Brazilian cheesy rolls called?) Insalata di calamaretti. SOOOO pretty. How does one slice vegetables so thin? Light and delicious. I wanted more... Capesante al tartufo nero sea scallops and black truffles. The most beautiful scallop I've ever seen. (Sorry, Top Scallop Jamie.) It was perfectly cooked and tasted incredibly rich when consumed with the cauliflower puree it topped. San pietro alla griglia limone, olivio, salvia, carciofi. A generous portion of John Dory. Looked like a painting. To be honest, I forgot what this dish tasted like. I do remember finishing the entire piece of fish though... Spaghetti alla chitarra sugo di aragosta. INSANE. Each strand of spaghetti was coasted in lobster sauce. So rich. So decadent. So delicious. Merry Christmas, self. Merry Christmas indeed!!!! Striped bass livornese. I'm full. Nothing's going to taste good at this point.   Dark chocolate hazelnut ice cream, espresso. Holy shit. Fancy nutella. I am in heaven. My stomach is fooled into taking in one last dish. INCREDIBLE. This dessert is incredible. What is love? THIS. THIS is love. Struffoli. WTF. I should never have eaten this. Taste like a day-old donut hole covered in honey and then sprinkled with NOT delicious jimmies. Bleeeech. Bleeeech. BLEEEECH! Man, I would've given Providence the 5 stars it deserves had they not served up the Struffoli. The day old tasting dessert left a nasty taste in my mouth that could only be removed with a good hard brushing. But the wonderful memories of that overall beautiful meal can never be taken away from me. Providence is an excellent restaurant which I hope to return to. Just no more Struffoli, PLEASE.

My standard of an excellent restaurant is if I can still have a sense of the amazing flavors long after I have left.  It doesn't matter the class of restaurant or reputation for this formula to work.  I can still remember the amazing flavors of Le Bernardin in NYC just as much as the yummy BBQ flavor of my local Leon's BBQ joint down the street from my apartment.   This place just wasn't memorable.  I ordered a john dorey fish and my boyfriend had the salmon.  We shared an appetizer of a raviolo with lobster and scallop.  The food was solid.  I had a good meal; but I have already forgotten it.  If I had gone out with friends just after having gone to this restaurant, I would not have found a reason to mention it.   Perhaps we should have tried to tasting menu since many who did that seemed to be happy with their experience, per the yelp reviews.  However, I won't be back to try it for fear of a very long and boring meal. On the upside of my experience, the dessert was excellent.  I had the milk chocolate panna cotta and it was amazing.  Yum!

My bf took me here for my birthday awhile back, and I was rather impressed by the 9 course meal including wine pairings. The restaurant is beautiful and the food was a well balanced milieux of lighter and heavier dishes. I loved the opening dishes of yellow tail and foie gras over the quail egg. The wine pairings were fantastic. The waitstaff was patient, nice and attentive. They never let my wine level go empty and constantly asked if we enjoyed our dishes. I would go back to try something off of their pre fixe menu.

How do you know when a restaurant is expensive?  (not a riddle)     Answer:  When they ask you during your reservation phone call, "Is this an anniversary or birthday?" So, be prepared to meet a ton of strangers who were conceived on the same day, or the parents of future babies who might conceive on that same night. Nymoo, had the 9 course tasting menu-- plus an a la carte prawn dish. Standouts were:  -  Egg yolk type thing with unni (sorry for this amateur explanation, I'm that tired from eating for 4 hours)  -  The Arctic Charr ...OH SOOOO goooood. (doesn't come in the 5 course tasting, and for that, I'm glad I got the full tasting menu)  -  The very right item on the Mousse Boosh (yeah, I can't spell-- I'm not a snob alright?) An Okay:  The bacon bread was good, but nothing that blew me away.  Was really looking forward to it from these reviews.   The above items are what will stick out in my mind when I think back to my Providence experience. Oh, forgot to add:  The decor was nice, not the best.  But, I really love their toilets.

****UPDATE 2/9/07***** I went back to Providence last night for my second time.  I was really looking forward to it because I had loved everything about the meal so much the first time I went.   ....I was so let down (insert frowny face). First of all, I don't remember so much "foam" and "gel" on the menu accompanying the large majority of the dishes.  I had loved this place the first time I came due to the fact that it was so unpretentious and just delicious food.  This time, I felt like they were trying too hard by adding unnecesary "frou frou" touches that just didn't add anything to dishes and perhaps took something away.   Once we ordered, (the waiter talked one of my friends into keeping the side of bone marrow that came with his steak, after he asked to hold the marrow), we were briskly served warm bread...followed by an amuse busch.  I could have done without the miniature (i mean SMALL) beer mug of cold pea soup w/carrot foam... the peekytoe crab was really delicious...you would think good crab would be hard to mess  up...but they  served it over lime jelly or "gel", which I really wouldn't have missed had the chef decided to drop it on the floor on it's way to my plate. Appetizers were uneventful.  My lobster "bloody mary" was a HUGE dissappointment.  There was nothing about it resembling a bloody mary.  Nor was it at all similar to what I ordered the first time I came to Providence...though funny enough it had the same name.  It was just lobster chuncks on a plate w/some baby tomatoes..eh.  Just ho-hum. We then waited a good 30-40 minutes for our entrees to arrive.  They didn't seem that busy so I don't understand what happened.  There is no music playing in the restaurant, so we grew a little bored and definitely anxious as our stomached grumbled and we watched everyone else around us eat in a timely fashion.  Even the proposal that occurred two tables away from us was just ho-hum...come on guys...can't you squeeze out just one tear?  Perhaps a squeel of joy or some shortness of breath at least???  I think I was more excited about the engagement than they were.   By the time our entrees came, I was ready to just get in my car and head back to the westside to catch Grey's Anatomy and snuggle up to a some Dreyer's.   My wild salmon was nothing special and undercooked.  I LOVE salmon and I remember loving it the first time I came (as you can see below).  But this time, I had about 3 bites...something I dont think I have EVER done.  The sauce and sides it was served with tasted like something I would get under some rubbery chicken on an airplane.  I was underwhelmed to say the least.  My friend's steak was good, but one taste of the bone marrow confirmed that his initial instinct to stay clear was the correct choice.  I think the waiter should have offered him something else.   Dessert...not even worth the effort of writing about.  Avocado banana puree?  Foam what?  Is that chocolate cake or just a fleck of dirt???  I'm not sure, it's so small I can hardly make it out.... Please just pass me a sprinkles cupcake with a side of pinkberry and let's call it a night. Sadly, I won't be going back to Providence anytime soon. BUT they get 2 stars b/c my first meal was really so good...what happened??! **ORIGINAL REVIEW*** I went here for the first time last night.  I had never heard of it, so being the food snob that I am, I  was of course hesitant when a friend told me he was taking me there.  But after combing thru their gorgeous website, I decided it was definitely worth a trip.   The decour is beautiful - clusters of sea shells climbing the walls and the ceiling. The wait staff are wonderful, attentive, knowledgable and not a bit pretentious or stuffy.  We had the sweetest waiter who knew the menu inside out and was very helpful.  We ended up sharing 2 apps, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts and were ooing and awing our way thru our entire meal.   We started with the Lobster Bloody Mary and the Kanpachi from the tasting menu (they had 2 different preparations).  Both had amazing flavors w/out overpowering the exquisite fish.  The lobster was unusually tender, similar to really great crab and served with a scoop of cilantro sorbet on the side, which was a perfect combo.  The kanpachi was like no other I've ever had and came with some sort of sauce that was both sweet and salty - a perfect match.  We then had the Salmon and the Tai Snapper.  I loved them both, but the Salmon was my favorite.  The greens (spinach?) it was served over were just yum and the salmon was cooked to perfection..again perfectly seasoned w/out masking how wonderful the fish was.  For dessert we had the chocolate mouse and ice cream.  The presentation of each dish was stunning, but nothing looked inedbible or overly decorative. Loved this meal.

We were invited and treated by our friends to join them in Los Angeles for a fun and elegant evening out. There were 6 of us and we were fortunate enough to have experienced Providence from a unique perspective--sitting in a private room with a view of the kitchen, the Chef's table. Since we were sitting at the Chef's table, we ended up requesting the "Chef's Menu"--which included 15 incredible tastings (but we did not get the wine parings with it). You would think 15 very small plates of food wouldn't fill you up, but we were VERY stuffed after our very long meal. To give you a sense of how long it took, we started at 6:00 p.m and we didn't leave our room until 10:30 p.m. It was roughly about 4 hours of eating! Right before dinner, the "Sommelier" --a trained and knowledgeable wine professional came in and recommended a bottle of white wine for us. Also, before each tasting, somebody would come in and introduce us to the dish. Each plate was beautiful and uniquely delicious. Compliments to Chef Michael Cimarusti for a incredible meal and an evening to remember. I won't name off all 15 dishes (I have all of them photographed here: http://www.flickr.com/ph…)  but here are some highlights: Greyhound, Mojito, Gin & Tonic: Refreshing and fun, a simplified way to describe these incredible pallet cleansers..." elegantly prepared and presented jello shots!" Yummy! House cured sea trout, trout roe, quatre epices; gougere; soy marshmallow with wasabi peas: A surprising part to this was the little flakes of gold served with the glass of the trout. It puzzled my husband that we were actually eating real gold! Santa Barbara sea urchin; in an eggshell, champagne beure blanc, caviar- had to be one of my favorite dishes, the presentation impressed me the most as it all fit inside a tiny eggshell, with the secret ingredient of course...egg! King Salmon; almond, morels, roasted baby carrots, port wine-the salmon was so soft, kind of like warm sashimi, and the salmon skin, ohh so crispy and perfect. ...before dessert we were greeted by CHEESE. Somebody brought in a cart with about 20 different cheeses and let us select a few.   By then the kitchen got a bit rowdier, but not too much --though I heard Chef say "Bring me the F***in'  ticket..."once, but followed it up with a polite "please." I also enjoyed watching them grab the live Spot Prawns out of the tank :P The desserts were incredible as well, but by the time we got to the last dessert it was hard to take in any more food! 15 courses was definitely a lot of food and I think we could have been as easily satisfied with the menu with less tastings!  However, I think the 15 surprise dishes made it enjoyable and special for all of us. We also got to give Chef our personal thanks on our way out. So if you are looking for fine dining paired with fabulous ambiance and service, Providence hits the spot.

My girlfriend and I had a fantastic experience here. This was not unexpected given that chef Michael Cimarusti once bested the great Morimoto on Iron Chef. To begin with, our cocktails were expertly made by the master mixologist Zahra Bates. The pisco sour was excellent and the Wonderland was appropriately named. Both were incredibly smooth. Cocktails should be a strong consideration here. Shortly after our cocktails arrived, we were offered a basket with three bread options: sourdough, bacon brioche and nori focaccia.  Our favorite was the focaccia, which was perfect for sopping up the remaining sauces left on our plates. For our first experience, we both went with the 5 course tasting menu. Since I'm a pescatarian, our waiter gladly switched out the veal tenderloin for the wild black bass. We ordered the wine pairing for only one of us and the wines were matched beautifully. It was also enough for both of us after having a cocktail each. The amuse trio was playful and flavorful. An icy cubed Mojito gelee, a membrane bound screwdriver on a spoon, and a three layered soup in a shot glass with a wonderful aged port at the bottom. We loved each course, but the scallop was my favorite. We ended up adding a cheese plate before our dessert course after seeing and smelling the amazing cheese cart with 20 something cheeses roll up to a nearby table along with a cheese sommelier.   The meal was expensive, but the food and service were worthy of their two Michelin stars. Next time, I would like to come on their Monday no corkage night and order off the a la carte menu.

My boyfriend took us here for our anniversary dinner. It was UNBELIEVABLE!! We were super duper impressed with the food...from all the free bite size appetizers, to my delicious main entree..the duck was med rare, and by far the best duck i have ever tasted! The restaurant also surprised us with a free dessert for our anniversary! Awesome food, service, and atmosphere. Will definitely go back!

Went all out and had the chef's tasting menu. 15 courses in total, when including amuse bouche(s). The meal took about 4 hours. Bread basket: bacon brioche (just the sound of this made me think i would love it, however it was not memorable). Nori foccacia on the other hand was one of the most memorable breads I've had.  the saltiness of the seaweed matched well with the butter which was on the sweeter side.  Very enjoyable.. I really would have liked to try one more piece, but with the full tasting menu upcoming i had to control myself.   The amuse bouche was 2  "cocktails" which were liquified orbs of greyhound, gin & tonic, and mojito. I enjoyed the first 2 but the mojito tasted off. Still, this was my first sampling of this particular type of molecular gastronomy and it was fun. I am a fan of chawan mushi and was happy to get 2 presentations. Both were served in the egg shell with santa barbara uni and a brioche at the bottom. One version was topped with black truffles while the other was topped with american caviar. Other highlights over this 3.5 hour extravaganza were risotto with truffles, abalone, and eel;  turbot with chanterelles, and scallops in almond butter.  The only meat course of the night was lamb, not memorable but the crispy brussel sprouts served with it were.  A cheese course came in between, followed by the best dessert offerings I've ever had. Wow, the desserts... I am not even close to a dessert person, I'd much prefer a savory course over a few sweets.  My favorite was the lychee sorbet with a coconut tapioca.  I have to say the desserts were all imaginative and lived up to the hype. In my not so expert review, I'd say this is about as good a fine dining experience you can get in LA.

Like most others, I can write a haughty-taughty NOVEL (g'lord ppl...) about this place, and list every plate tasted, every ingredient used (with symbols, translations and all) and rave on the service, decor, etc., but I WON'T. To simply put it, it is a great high-end restaurant. Definitely worth a try, but to be honest, not much different than most great "tasting" restaurants you find anywhere else -- esp when it comes to experience, quality ingredients and presentation. My date and I enjoyed every course, but didn't think anything was that memorable except for the amuse-bouche and table bread. We reflected on our meal the next day and could barely recall anything specific that made it different from other restaurants (of similar caliber) we've tried in the past. Very serene and romantic setting though. Con: only enjoyed half of the wine pairings, pre-dinner drink (mint cucumber?) was neither tasty nor strong. We think it was the bartender's first day. Complimentary desserts at the end were meh.

Very good food. Just moved here from New Jersey (yuck) but wondered how LA restaurants would compare to Manhattan.  We love tasting menus and Providence was highly rated so thought we give it a try.  The food was exceptional to very good.  They had our favorite Australian black winter truffles in the summer, and the pasta with the truffles was our favorite course by far.  The amuse bouche were creative, the sashimi great and the scallop wonderful.  The veal was fine but not spectacle and the dessert was just okay.  Good wine pairings. The service was pretty good, but not exceptional.  The waiters went over the food too quickly when presented and there were a few times with ten minute waits between courses. All and all it compares well with the better NY restaurants, but we'll keep looking for something as good as Per Se.

TWO MICHELIN STARS AND THE BEST PASTRY CHEF IN LA I have to begin my rave review by saying that I am not a "foodie." My girlfriend is a foodie and so were the two other people at my table, but me, I just enjoy good food, good atmosphere, and good company. And Providence definitely has the first two. (You still have to provide your own "good company," which my girlfriend did a great job of by bringing one of her myriad former boyfriends and his relatively new girlfriend.) Where to begin? How to begin an amateur review that has been rated as one of the very rare Two Michelin Starred restaurants? Perhaps that is the best angle to take, the view of the amateur, as this place has been written up by countless professionals. As a matter of fact, my girlfriend, a former well-known LA food critic, was the very first person to write up Providence when it opened up. Perhaps this is why we were lavished with the most incredible tasting menu and wine pairings that I have ever experienced. Rather than going blow by blow recounting our death by great food and wine I think it would be most effective to paint an overall picture of the evening, kind of like an Impressionist's view of his dining experience. (I never really got Matisse and Manet's work but I will attempt to transplant thier style into writing about food.) Visually, Providence does a great job of balancing luxury with simplicity. The lighting is perfect, colors soothe the eye, and the barnacle-like features scattered on the walls and ceilings give the rooms a unique yet very comfortable feel. We were greeted warmly by Donato, the dining room manager who clearly knew how to run a consistent high-end restaurant. The staff was well trained and attentive and they seemed to provide the same outstanding service to the guests surrounding us. We ordered the five course tasting menu and spilt a wine pairing. Drew, the sommelier, was exceptionally knowledgeable and our pairings were spot on. (It didn't hurt that his pours were very gracious, either.) My favorite for the evening was a very subtle red wine from the Dalmation Coast of Croatia. We ended up having three whites, two reds, and two dessert wines. If you are going to come to a restaurant like Providence and if you ever drink wine, I cannot imagine ever having the tasting menu without the wine pairing. I very much appreciated Drew's presence throughout the evening. As for the savory courses created by Michael, the food was not only incredibly good but created with such spectacular genius. Every single course including the amuse bouche ("appetizer" for us Cro-Magnon non-foodies) pleasurably engaged several of my senses, from the impeccable visual presentation to the fireworks on my taste buds. Michael is well known for combining many complex ingredients that most of us would have never thought to put together and they all worked so perfectly well. If it seemed like the food was never ending it might have been because they slipped in an extra course for us (along with an extra wine pairing!) By the time dessert rolled around (and well before we rolled ourselves to the car) I was stuffed. It is possible that THE REASON to go to Providence is for Pastry Chef Adrian Vasquez's creations. There is no question that Michael Cimarusti's reputation is well deserved, but Adrian is truly a genius when it came to dessert. We were spoiled with two courses of dessert and to make things even more incredible was that each of our couples had different dishes during each course meaning we were able to sample four different creations. Sure, the presentation was extraordinary, but the creativity and combination of flavors was mindblowing, especially for a dessert. Goat-cheese ice cream? And it was INSANELY GREAT! I could imagine my girlfriend and I just going to the bar and having dessert one night. I have traveled the world for a living for the last 25 years and have had some outstanding dining experiences. Again, I'm not a foodie, but I do very much appreciate a good meal and a great dining experience and I would probably have to say this was the best dining experience that I have ever had. I would like to thank Michael, Adrian, Donato, and Drew for a very, very memorable evening (all four hours!) and I can guarantee we will be back!

General Review: This is a place where food and art converge.  The food has such beautiful presentation that you're almost sad to mess up the plate to eat the food.  The staff was extremely friendly and very attentive throughout the meal.  Oh, and our sommelier knew his wine!  Yes, this place is extravagant and expensive but the service and quality of food is worth every penny. Specific Review: I took my wife here for our anniversary and we ordered the chef's menu.  We were taken on a sublime two hour journey of unique and savory fine dining.  At first, I was worried that each course was too small and I would be hungry after it was all over.  Fortunately, by the end of the meal, I was sure I could not eat another bite.  Every course was intelligently placed and the flavors of each dish transitioned very well.  I know I've just had the ultimate experience when I eat exotic dishes like sea urchin and gobble up all my veggies (which is usually not a pleasant experience for me).  I ate everything given to me because I wanted to make sure that I didn't miss a crucial flavor combination.   I can't recommend this place for regular casual dining but if you have a special occasion and don't mind spending some coin, you need to experience this extraordinary place.

Whereas Hatfields has a friendly neighborhood decadence and the London epitomizes the trendy LA scene, Providence is an experience of simple, but regal elegance. My boyfriend and i went all out with the chef's tasting menu.  Come with an empty stomach!  The courses are endless and by the ninth one we were unbuckling our belts.  This tasting follows the full tasting menu pretty closely but includes additional delights that must not be passed over.   The best of the best:  The mojito, gin & tonic, and screw driver gelees were the highlight of the meal.  Presented as a trio of shooters, these look like spoonfuls of egg yolk, but they are actually intense bursts of mojito/screwdriver encased in a jelly.  Think of a mochi ice cream dessert, but instead of  mochi, you have jelly and instead of ice cream, it's a shot.  The gin&tonic is a gourmet "fruit chew." In terms of texture, think gummy bear but coated with sugar so that it fizzes when you add the lime juice.  There's nothing like these; they are absolutely divine.   Providence holds all bragging rights to seafood.  The quality and execution is flawless.  their fish is perfectly seared with skin that's delightfully crisp while the fish remains rich and buttery.  Their shrimp is fleshy, sweet and snappy. The concepts behind each creation may be simple, but sumptuously rich.  My only regret is that each dish was a bit formulaic: seared seafood + sauce + sharp herbs or truffles.  though tasty, by the third dish, we were getting bored.  The experience could have been seriously enhanced if the chef had given us more variety in food forms.  Where was my ravioli?  my foie gras?  did they run out in the kitchen?   I do love the inventiveness of the desserts.  the chef creates some surprising sorbets and marshmellow treats with herbs not normally associated with dessert.  I loved the pairing of tart and creamy, salt and sweet. Ultimately i enjoyed my experience, but i wouldn't go back for the dinner tasting.  The best experiences were the sweeter items which can be found on the dessert tasting.   I read that some people get a box of the assorted chocolates with their bills.  I thought i might get a taste of that especially since i ordered the chef's menu?  bummer....  they certainly looked good!

I came here one evening for an "Au revoir, foie gras" tasting. As a restaurant specializing in seafood, Providence is probably not the first restaurant that pops into your mind when thinking of foie gras. Don't let the seafood specialty mislead you -- I had amazing foie gras dishes here. In no particular order: 1. Foie gras raviolis. Amazing. Nothing else to say. They are delicious. 2. Foie gras terrine. Lovely dish. I really liked the tomato element. 3. Foie gras sauté. OMG, OMG, OMG. my favorite dish at Providence used to be the uni and egg. until I had the foie gras sauté. I never thought I would have another mind-blowing experience like my first bite of uni and egg. Usually, that kind of ecstasy is once-in-a-lifetime. But I seriously had a foodgasm with this dish. I'm going to have to go back in the next week for the foie gras sauté before it goes "au revoir" next week. So sad....

Came here last night and tried the Chef's tasting menu with 15 courses. Like my first time, everything was exceptional and beyond spectacular. Our server, Daniel, was very attentive and explained each dish very well. Because the Chef's tasting menu courses are always subject to change and aren't listed on the menu, I'll do my best to list the dishes we received (note I may have missed 1 or 2 dishes): *Mojito + Screwdriver (starter?) *Oyster + Oyster plant *Miso-glazed abalone + Swordfish and chorizo *Halibut with champagne gelatin *Bacon-wrapped John dory with squash puree and black truffle *Uni with butter sauce and marinated black truffle on top of bread *Scallop with nori butter (seared in shell on a wooden plank) *Unagi (eel) with bone marrow and chestnuts on top of root puree *Seared salmon and onions with cauliflower puree *Australian wagyu beef on butter sauce and assorted veggies with slices of black truffle *Guava slice with guava sorbet and yogurt, yuzu, and sake drops *Pomegranate gelatin with frozen pomegranate seeds, pomegranate tapioca, apple slices, and dried blood oranges (we opted out of the Cheese plate and received this instead) *Mont blanc- white meringue with vanilla sorbet atop some bread and apricot jam *Ginger sorbet with banana pudding, chocolate ganache, rice, and blueberries *Box of mint orange jelle, passion fruit candy, and blackberry macaroons. Some of the more noteworthy courses were the oyster+oysterplant (so much flavor in such a small bite!), swordfish and chorizo (amazing combination of flavors and perfectly grilled), scallop with nori butter (the seasoning was perfect and complemented the scallops very well), and the australian wagyu beef (definitely one of my top 3 of the night. it was cooked to medium rare but had no blood whatsoever, and it was so tender and melted in my mouth!). The dessert dishes were all spectacular also, but I especially enjoyed the guava and pomegranate courses since I love the tart and fruity flavors! Overall, at $175/person, I would actually recommend the Chef's tasting menu over the 5- or 9-course tasting menus. Granted it's almost twice as expensive as the 5-course menu but you get 3 times as many courses and I think the dishes are more unique and delicious. Also, I'm sure the Chef uses the best ingredients of the day to decide what course to make so you'll get the best of the best!

The food here is very pricey but it is DELISH! It was defiantly worth it. I had the five course meal and thought it was too much food. By the time dessert came around, I will a little too stuffed to really enjoy it but I did anyway. My boyfriend had the full tasting and he was pretty full at the end of our meal. I can't imagine how anyone is able to finish the chefs menu. With every dish, I kept thinking that it couldn't get better but it did. The only reason that I gave it four stars was because of the service. When coming to a two star michelin restaurant, I expect to be treated like a princess. My water glass had a crack in it and the outer part of one of my dishes was dirty. I would say that about half the servers were AMAZING but the other half was very DISAPPOINTING. When changing out the silverware, some of the servers just tossed the forks and knives on the table while the others gently placed them on the table and straightened them out. When placing our yummy dishes on the table, some of the servers just placed them on the table (some of them were square plates and they would leave them slanted diagonally.) while others would set it on the table and then adjust the plate to look nice. Some of the servers acted a bit snobby towards us while other engaged with us in good conversation. I only wish all the servers at Providence were fabulous. Make sure to make reservations before coming here! The place fills up fast and for a good reason!

I thought  2 Michelin Stars has to be hella good.... but... me and my bf celebrated my bday there last Friday night. first of all, we waited more than 5 min to be seated, but we reserved seats a night before; second, the service is not good. We have to ask 3 times for breads during the meal; the waitress was not  too confidence when she explained each dishes to us ( I though in a high in/fine dining restaurant like this, we don't need to ask and they already know what we want or serve us the way we want it!) The service was pretty slow, but they were not busy at all!!! Overall, the taste is just ok, not as good as what i expected. but every dish we tried looks pretty nice, with the decoration and everything else on it!

One of the finest dining experiences in Los Angeles. We ordered the Chef's Tasting Menu with wine pairings. The service was top notch and each server that served us was well informed, extremely accommodating and seemed genuinely happy to help. All of the food was top notch and the pairings well executed. This place is great for a special occasion, especially if your dining companion truly appreciates food.

Providence is a great way to spend a special evening.  I brought my girlfriend here for her birthday to try Excecutive Chef Camarusti's 9-course tasting menu, and overall, the meal was a wonderful experience with a few minor setbacks. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the different rooms, each with a different decor.  We were seated in the first room, which was much darker than the adjacent, more well-lit area.  If we had a choice, we would have preferred to sit in the opposite room.. I guess there's always next time!  We each went with the 9-course tasting menu with one wine pairing to share, which was just the right amount. MY FAVORITES: - Japanese Kanpachi: By far my favorite dish of the night!  The sashimi was very fresh, and the citrus paired perfectly to make simple and delicious dish. - Egg with Sea Urchin: Wonderfully complex flavors with a fun and engaging presentation. - Scallop with Potato Puree: The scallop was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The Potato Puree was sublime.. I wish I knew how they did it. - Market Cheeses: One of the largest selections of cheeses I've ever seen at a restaurant!  The waitress driving the cheese cart was VERY friendly and knowledgeable, customizing our cheese to perfectly suit our taste (the stinkier the better). - Amuse Bouche: You would think people would start getting tired of molecular gastronomy.. but the frozen mojito and spheroid screwdriver were a fun way to start the meal. The salmon and striped bass were pretty good as well, but nothing to write home about.  The deserts were also quite delicious, but again, didn't blow me away. What really didn't impress me at Providence was the waitstaff.  Maybe he was new or maybe it was just bad luck, but our waiter was pretty inattentive, usually taking a minute or two before introducing each dish.  His knowledge of each course was very lacking - he said our egg dish contained lobster, and it wasn't until we tasted it did we realize we were eating sea urchin!  If our waiter had just taken 5 seconds to reference the menu, he would have avoided this.  I expected more from Providence, and primarily for this reason, I just can't give it 5 stars. That being said, I still recommend Providence to anyone looking for a fun way to spend a special evening.  Bravo!

It's the morning after and I'm still basking in the experiential after-glow of dining at Providence...my fingers are typing on clouds...   I love going to an establishment whose unassuming exterior says nothing about its attractive interior...and here I was.  Situated between the prime shopping to the west and Paramount Studios to the east, Providence has an organic and subdued environment of warm fawn-colored walls splashed with sand-dollaresque shapes serving as a playing field for the high-pace service of its super attentive staff.   After the hospitable welcome, my date and I had a chance to enjoy aperitifs in the bar while we waited a few minutes for our table.  This gave us the chance to browse through the amazing wine list which had an incredible selection of French wines as well as domestic and international appellations.   To bust my Providence cherry, I opted for the full tasting menu complete with wine pairings.  Little did I know that I was going to rock my mouth with multitudinous flavors, from the mojito ravioli, to the pan-seared scallop with almond puree, to my favorite course of them all....the cheese, of which I chose the stinkiest sheep's milk variety to be my fave, indulged with apricot marmalade, and dried figs.   Most of the wine pairings worked to my liking, except for a chablis which triggered skunky after tastes similar to that of Steinlager.  It worked well alone but not as a pairing for me.  The wine with the most distinctive flavor, was a white that I had never had before, a Jurancon, possessing a cognac nose and an apple pie finish.  Our paired wines included Muscat, Chenin Blanc, Chablis, Cote De Rhone, Pinot Nerro, & a Port, which was a nice change for myself who rarely deviates from the weightiest red on the list. Saturday night at Providence drew both dates, special occasion crowds, and the bitter music execs next to us, who kept the sommelier on his toes.  Everyone who cared for our table, from the busing staff to the unexpected visit from the chef, made me feel more and more apt to laugh carelessly at the bill, although my date found little to no humor in it.  I can now remove this restaurant from my bookmarks of places to try and add it to my list of those to return to soon.  But if I die tomorrow, it will be okay.

I always feel so intimidated writing a review of a place that is so highly regarded, so expensive, a 4 hour experience. I feel like I need to list everything I ate and give a complete rundown of what I thought for each dish. But, I'm too lazy to do that so I'll just mention the few dishes that stuck out. of the amuse bouche, there was one inside a shot glass and contained a gourmet version of pico de gallo, salmon roe, crispy rice. so good. the arctic char was to die for. perfect in every single way from texture to taste. the uni inside the egg shell with the yolk. so good. i could eat that all day. that's it. everything else was great, but i don't think about it all the time like i do with these three things. very expensive but the tasting menu is totally worth it if you have four hours. we got ressies at 8pm and ate until midnight and this is without the wine pairing! we were about to pass out as a result. great birthday place and anniversary place though. it seemed like everyone was celebrating something.

I'm not sure what the point is of piling onto so many reviews, especially since I really don't have anything to add and I'm not necessarily into hearing myself speak, but here I go. Went and had the 5 course tasting menu, which was very good.  Fish heavy, but every fish was very delicious and we really enjoyed the funky gelafied drink appetizers. The waitstaff was very attentive and enjoyable and kept changing up. Only because it is a Michelin rated restaurant, I can't help to compare to other fine dining and it is not comparable to Melisse in my opinion, but very tasty none-the-less. What I really did enjoy more than the dinner was my interaction with the bartender.  She clearly was proud of her drinks and made her own bitters.  Ever since my trip to Chicago, I've been trying to find a place that makes flips. She claims that they can, at the very least, she seemed to know how to make 'em. In the end, rather than a wine pairing, she agreed to pairing some of my drinks with the meals.  I can't tell you how they paired, but each drink certainly stood on its own.  Very delicious. Had the sazerac and the arsenal and one in between that was light and tasty. I remember that the dessert was delicious,

The Skinny: Food that is innovative and tasty (as in 4.5 kind of good), Subpar service (3), poor value for your money for chef's/grand tasting menu (2) After seeing Chef Cimarusti on Top Chef Masters, I was curious about this place. Let me say, that the cuisine here is excellent. We did order the Chef's Tasting menus which came with an delicious salmon sashimi with citrus gelee, outstanding Santa Barbara spot prawn with asparagus, and the I-can't-believe-it's-lamb-because-it doesn't-taste-that-lamby dish. Desserts were innovative and satisfying (shiso-lychee sorbet with coconut soy milk tapioca - who knew!). The thing that impressed me about the food is the how perfectly in sync the tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami) and textures (soft, crunchy) were. Another appealing aspect of the dishes was the sense of balance between new techniques and old. Having been at other restaurants that serve dish after dish of gelee/dehydrated/frozen/foamy stuff, it was nice to see the level of restraint demonstrated here. If we were to rate this restaurant on food alone, this place would easily get 4.5 on the verge of a 5. Where this place fails is the value of the chef's tasting menu and the service provided. First of all, we were the only table at the 5:30 seating that ordered the Chef's tasting menu which was $160 vs. $65 for the 5 course. The waiters during the evening gave us varying reports of how many courses there was going to be (someone initially told us 16, then 13, then it ended up being 14. That's not cool guys!) Secondly, we found that the people ordering the $65 5-course menu received 2 of our courses together as an amuse bouche (also not cool! What's the point of ordering a grand tasting ??!??!). As well, we didn't actually get to taste most of the items of the tasting menu. Most grand tasting menus are the regular tasting menus plus something extra. Not happening here. Third, our servers were not as good as others we've had in the past. We don't need our servers to be stiff (like the camera nazi at Alinea, or the French-stick-up-her-rear waiter at Joel Robuchon) or anything. We just like having waiters who provide great service and who have pride  from working at a Michelin 2 star restaurant. Most of the waiters chatted (rather loudly) amongst themselves and not paying attention to the customers. Finally, it irked us that we didn't get a print out of the menu we tasted. It would have been really nice to have especially since we felt that foodwise it wasn't worth getting the chef's tasting menu anyway. We really feel that this place is good, just not good value for your money if you get the chef's tasting menu. If you want to go here, stick with a 5 course or the lesser tasting menu. Do not get the chef's tasting menu because the value really isn't there.

Wow! - We had the five course tasting menu with the wine paring and it was just out of this world. The food is delicious and served in such a creative manner, you'll find yourself staring at it for a minute or two before digging in.  Don't be afraid, you won't be alone. Also don't be afraid to ask questions, we did.  The servers know exactly what they are taking about.  Go ahead, try and stump them. My biggest piece of advice is GIVE YOURSELF TIME to enjoy the meal.  We had concert tickets after dinner and had to speed things up a little towards the end.  Would have loved to have stayed for the nine course tasting menu. Pricey, yes.  Midweek, still a full house.

It was the wife's birthday and I searched "romantic" in Los Angeles on Yelp and ended up finding this restaurant.  Now I'm a fan. I liked it so much that when this review posts on my facebook, I will give myself a thumbs up and comment "great choice buddy" and then reply to myself and say " thank you, sexy." With so many things I wanted to try, the best choice was to go for the 5 course taster.  Just so you know, if you go with this course, be prepared to stay for a minimum of 2 hours. The dishes come out  small but because they take about 10-15 minutes to bring out the next one, you get pretty full by the time they bring out the last one and make women regret they wore a dress that tightens their stomach. I don't want to go on forever writing this so here's what came to me in the 5 course taster: Kanpachi with rice crackers, cilantro and soy creme fraiche - very fresh, but being Japanese, I wish there was soy sauce with the sashimi. Sea scallop with Japanese eggplant, rhubarb, and cashews in I think was a curry sauce - liked it a lot, never considered using curry on scallops. Wild halibut with squash, black olives, dried apricot and basil - delicious. The halibut was cooked very lightly only on the outside. Veal tenderloin with bacon, almonds, peas and maitake mushrooms.- this was the highlight of my meal. The veal was the best I've ever had. Makes me glad that I wasn't born as a rabbit, because no matter what anyone says, meat is damn good. Dessert was the a yuzu curd, meringue blackberry sorbet, with jasmine - I've never tasted anything like it. Awesome to the max. Overall I had a good meal here, but most important, my wife loved the food and the intimate setting. Good job Providence, the Michelin man will be proud and will not crush your restaurant with his giant foot. (this place received two Michelin stars, which probably also means the chef gets free Michelin tires for life... or not, but that would be an awesome perk.)

Providence is located in an unassuming building, couldn't really tell from the outside that there was a fine-dining restaurant inside. The inside architecture looks interesting, it almost feels like it used to be residential and got turned into a restaurant. But enough about architecture, now on the food. We selected the full tasting menu sans wine. Overall, we were pleased. Here are some of the standouts: - Mojito Gelee - Foamy Passion Fruit Consomme - Kanpachi dish: plated nicely - resembles "desert" - Santa Barbara uni in an egg-shell - Scallops with some leaves that look like porcelain; plate looks like a painting. The brown butter wow! worked perfectly with the scallops. - Halibut with meyer's lemon sauce. The rest were good to just-okay. Oh, and they don't have kids menu, but the chef' made some special pasta dish for our son (pretty good). 3.75 out 5 stars.

I wish I was rich enough to come here for every meal of every day... and only eat dessert. I went here for drinks and dessert on a friend's birthday. I hate driving out to mid-Wilshire, since I'm a Pasadenan but I made the trek out of loyalty to my friend. It paid off. Over two bottles of prosecco and the most heavenly desserts I've ever consumed, I'll be on cloud nine until I die. We did the tasting menu and the pastry chef was lovely enough to provide us with some comp'd desserts, as well. The Harry's berries and the spicy caramels were orgasmic. Everything was creative, beautiful, and absolutely delicious. At one point, I put a cute little chocolate with white polka dots on top into my mouth. When I bit down, my reaction was, "holy s__!" I ate a mushroom chocolate. It was tasty. It was scary. It was awesome.

This was one of the top 10 meals I have ever had.  The Michelin 2 star rating is definitely given their appropriate due here at this eatery.  I understand that most people would treat this as a special occasion restaurant, since I have limited time here in LA, I feel each meal is special.   The GF and I opted for the 5 course tasting menu with the wine pairing.  The entire experience here wound up being 5 stars from the moment we walked in the door.  We were greeted by warm smiles and seated immediately.  The decor in the dining room was interesting with the barnacles all over the wall.  We had ordered cocktails to start which were delicious.  I got the sazerac and the GF got some pineapple infused thing that was delicious as well.  Then I am not sure how to describe it, maybe angels singing, but the bread they offered was AMAZING.  I mean come on....BACON BRIOCHE.  I asked if they would dip that in chocolate and throw 1/2 a dozen in a bag to go.   The food was as follows: Amuse Bouche: A progression of gels and fun twists on cocktails (Gin and Tonic jelly which you squeezed lime over and a Mojito gel that burst in your mouth with one bite)  and a carrot soup.  Not sure how that all fit together, but played really well.   1st Course:  kanpachi shashimi for the GF and I asked for the Uni in the farm fresh egg.  Both delicious 2nd Course: Sea Scallop with ramp pure and ramps with almond foam, sherry vinegar gastrique.  The crunchiness of the almonds paired well with all the other items of the dish.  GF loved this dish 3rd Course: John Dory with some tomato confit with burdock root and fried burdock on top.  The sauce which was amazing for this dish with lemon sake and butter.  BY FAR AND AWAY THE BEST DISH OF THE TASTING MENU.   4th Course: NY STEAK with peas and hedgehog mushrooms with a delicious sauce (bordelaise sauce I think) (No need to add the cheese course, we were thinking about after 12 of those Bacon Brioche things, maybe not 12, 2 but I would have taken down a baker's dozen easily) 5th Course: Dessert of kalamansi gelee with white chocolate coconut soy milk soup with shiso sorbet.  YUMMY with tapioca pearls in there as well.   The wine pairs were interesting and some seemed a little obscure, but still  were pleasing to the palate.   Would like to go back to try the regular menu to try the more East Coast influenced dishes since only the scallop was from the East Coast on the tasting menu.  Overall it was a very well executed menu and the service was super nice and not overly intrusive but still attentive.

This place is an absolute treasure.  I came here for a celebratory meal with my family and we all ordered the six course tasting menu with wine pairing. Service, staff, food, dessert, and wine pairings were all among the best I've ever had. Among the highlights:  an absolutely amazing amuse bouche that was a display of molecular gastronomy - little bitty bites of gelee that tasted like different before dinner drinks, a scallop that was to die for, kampachi carpaccio and a veal dish that was like butter. This was all topped off by a dessert that combined three items I normally don't like into a party for the taste buds. The chef is one of the best in LA and the restaurant was absolutely worthy of this year's rating by Michelin of two stars (only two restaurants in LA acheived this rating).   Magnifique!

What is there not to LOVE about Providence?  I'm so surprised that (especially recently) reviews have been less than five stars. I would easily give them ten if I could. Los Angeles cuisine cannot get any better than this. We had dinner there last night and fully enjoyed the Chef's tasting menu with the wine pairings.  Wow! Every course blew us away. No one can do seafood like Chef Cimarusti.  To deny his genius is truly a shame.  The creative detail and attention to the food is incredible. Not to mention the way in which all of your senses are stimulated. The presentation, with all of the colors and plating and sauces, is simply beautiful.  The textures that he plays with are so fun. Mixing the texture of a Japanese Kanpachi, cream fraiche and rice crackers.  Who does that, and makes the flavors mix so well together?!?!  Hokkaido sea scallops with chanterelles, flageolet, and applewood smoked bacon.  The texture and the taste of these scallops are so different from what you would expect.  It was beautifully plated and simply exquisite on the palate. Highlights were: the pork belly, the urchin with caviar, egg and a bit of heaven (OMG!!!) I don't think I've tasted anything better. My goodness the flavors!!! The Santa Barbara spot prawn...simple and pure, the tastes were so clean.  The lamb was to die for and the cheeses were unbelievable.  All in all 16 courses with the amuse bouche. Seriously, this place has TWO Michelin Stars for a reason (not that those stars mean anything).  People like what they like. And I LOVE LOVE LOVE Providence. This is our second trip there and it most certainly will not be our last. Thank you Michael Cimarusti for your creative genius and for sharing it with us last night.

I am not going to write a long review of the food after reading the reviews, they are exhaustive enough. Also, I am sure my girlfriend's review and mine will be similar, so this is my perspective. I worked in fine dining for 15 years from high school until finishing graduate school. Providence is the real thing as far as the food goes. I will say the food is perfect. Amazing. 5 stars for the food alone. From the first course to the dessert, I was blown away. The reason I give Providence 3 stars is for how wonky the front of the house was. I bought my girlfriend there for a romantic dinner that cost more than any other dinner I have ever been on a date. However, the service was not stellar by any means, which one would expect at such a price. When we arrived at the restaurant, there was no valet. It was a Saturday, so I waited. Having also worked as a valet, I understand how it is but after 5 minutes, I gave up and parked down the street. It was a bummer to help my girlfriend out of a low sports car onto soggy grass in an unfamiliar neighborhood when she was in heels but she wanted to check this place out because she loves The Water Grill so much, so I dealt with it. When we walked in, no one was at the hostess stand but staff was running through the entryway like mad. After a minute we were greeted and told the there was a bottleneck situation with the tables. From working in fine dining, I understand that people notoriously camp out at places like this because this is a once a year event for  most people, so they try to get all they can out of the experience. We were told to wait in the bar, which was absolutely packed.  I did not go to Providence to hang out in a packed bar, so we decided to sit on the weird uncomfortable couch. About 45 minutes after our reservation time and 50 minutes after we arrived we were seated. I have to say, whoever did the interior design for this restaurant should lose their license. First, the fact that the staff must stream through the reception area with awkward cheese carts, steaming hot food carts, drink trays, dirty dishes and all else while the hostess and Maitre D discuss strategy on each table with a growing number of people waiting in a space that is insufficient for 2 people let alone the 6 that had gathered by the time we were finally seated is absurd. If you must take out 3 or 4 tables and make the restaurant a bit more exclusive, by all means do so because the chaos in that tiny room killed my desire to dine. The rest of the interior is pretty bad as well. For example, I ordered a Wagyu steak for my main course.  It was a $150 steak. That is more than I have ever paid for steak in my life. Steaks of that caliber that are normally carved table side. Once again, the poor interior design led my steak to be carved right behind my head with the cart angled diagonally touching another table as the waiter's ass invaded the personal space of the woman behind me to the point where she stopped eating and moved so that he could get a better carving angle. This also happened with our 2nd course where some scallops were cooked on hot coals "table side." The hot coals were close enough to the back of my neck that it made me nervous but also, I had no idea what was going on, nor did the woman sitting on the other side of me who actually commented that she thought her hair had caught on fire. Besides the poor interior design the food was amazing as stated above but one other flaw that I noticed was the poor timing overall.  Obvious was the lag time between our reservation time and the time that we were seated but there were also odd inconsistent gaps in service between courses. Drinks came in 5 minutes, first course in 15, 30 minutes later the second course was out and 20 minutes after the main course arrived. I wasn't bothered by this but I would assume for the prices charged, the timing would be impeccable.  Further, there was a 30 minute wait for the dessert followed by a 45 minute wait before we flagged someone for our bill because our captain had left. That was kind of a bummer because we got there 2 hours before the last seating and the restaurant was relatively full still when we were done. That being said, the Sommelier was great. He noticed a bit of cork in my girlfriend's wine before I did and replaced it immediately.  He gave really solid suggestions. My wine knowledge is not current, so it was nice to have a true wine expert offer up some amazing pours that perfectly matched the food. When our captain was there, he was amazing as well. Also, one of the owners greeted us towards the end of our meal, which was a nice touch. In the end, I really liked this place for the excellent food and the nice welcoming vibe the staff gave off after we were seated. However, If I were part of the management, I would first deal with the space issues. If it meant losing some tables, I think less tables could be remedied by a more tightly run front of the house.

It's difficult to contribute more to the plentiful list of positive reviews for Providence (all duly deserved) so I'm just going to reaffirm what has already been said. The food is amazing and definitely worth the money...a whole lot of money. I had the 9 course tasting and each plate was better then the last. My friend substituted her sea urchin plate for dungeness crab and she probably lucked out with a better dish. I loved like the pre-dessert cheese plate and I normally hate cheese. The ambiance and the service complimented the great food. Everyone was very friendly and our server was funny, down to earth and attentive. Definitely worth a try if you have money to burn. The 9 course tasting was overindulgent. The 5 course tasting is suitable for the typical patron with an average appetite. Wish I knew this before but definitely no regrets.

Providence is deserving of its Michelin stars. Everything from the service to the food to the ambience is top-notch, A+ quality. In contrast to its trendy Weho and snooty BH counterparts, this place is unassuming on the outside but delivers on the inside. And its quiet reputation is all the more alluring b/c of that. If you don't mind having 10 waiters/busboys/GMs checking on you consistently throughout your meal, then this is your place. Notably (or not), the only female employee was the bartender, who made our drinks (Splendor in the Grass-- a delicious champagne/lychee/blueberry/pomegranate? drink made virgin for moi). Here's what we had-- Wild Striped Bass- delicious, the roasted sweet potatoes accompanying it were even tastier than the fish. Hokkaido Scallop- seared perfectly, very tasty. Japanese Kanpachi- not memorable at all, kind of bland, definitely skip-able. Salt Roasted Salt Prawns- this was my favorite dish, but I'm pretty partial to prawns anyway (I even eat the heads, so)...These humongous prawns with long antennae come in a pan buried under rock salt, which our waiter dug and split open for us. They also presented us with in-between samplers on the house, like this trout concoction in a shot glass with these little crispy round balls, and wasabi marshmellow. Sounds weird, but it was so scrumptious (and NOT fishy at all). Also, we ordered this strawberry dessert (comes with these shortcake rounds and burrata icecream), but it wasn't half as good as the free little desserts they gave us at the end (little white sandwich cookies that melt in your mouth, caramels, and these small round Rocher-like treats). Next time, we're keen on trying the cheese plate (which our waiter explained comes with 20 different kinds of exquisite cheeses) instead of dessert. In all, if you're looking for quality of service and ambience that MATCHES the quality of food (which is NOT that easy to find in LA), Providence won't disappoint.

We decided to go here for dessert after a tip from a fellow yelp friend and I am so glad we went. We went for a 40th birthday and just for the 7-course dessert menu. For $5, it was worth every dollar. First off, they apparently don't just let people come for dessert at anytime. You have to come at 9:30 p.m. Weird, but whatever. Then I guess we weren't important enough so we got seated in the outdoor section which was totally covered but the cold night air still seeped in. But we made the best of it and allowed ourselves to forget being treated as steerage. We ordered coffee and tea while we waited. I had the ethiopian blend and it was so smooth. And I love how they served it in a mini french press. I believe this is the only way to make coffee. First course, cocktails. They took gelatin and made a sac of a margarita and a tequila shot. The alcohol was encased like an egg yolk. You swallowed it whole like an oyster. We were a little skeptical but the cocktail was so smooth and refreshing. I have had my share of tequila blunders and this tasted amazing and made me forget. My sister is pregnant so she was given a cucumber sorbet with cucumber bits in a frothy greek yogurt cream. Delicious. It was so light and refreshing. Second was kalamansi gelee. Being filipino, this was homeland food. I love the flavors. My appetite was being whetted. Next was mandarin rose sorbet with a pistachio macaron. The macaron was the best thing of the whole night. I just wanted more and more. I wanted to ask for a dozen for to-go. The burrata ice cream just melted in our mouths. I don't think I have had such a creamy ice cream, even gelato in italy. amazing. the basil puree smear added just the little bit of umpphh to set this dessert over the top. the caramel pudding was sooo good. i love dulce de leche flavors. the popcorn on top was a bit weird, but still good. since it was a birthday, we got an extra course. dulce de leche ice dream with toasted hazelnuts sprinkled around it. Then a fresh shot of espresso was poured all over the ice cream in a bowl. heaven in your  mouth. This place is perfect for a taste of heaven over 3 hours. we were the last people to leave. worth it, despite being steerage.

0mg, had the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing, and it was thoroughly amazing! Everything was complimented so well and the dishes were little master pieces of art.  From the amuse bouch to almost the end of the meal was spectacular!   The lobster and filet were cooked to perfection and were so savory.  However, I wasn't to fond of the dessert because it one of the elements was too tart for my liking but my companion loved it.  The little treats that they give you at the end made up for it though.   The staff was right on top of their game and were attentive without being intrusive.   The decor inside was interesting and unusual at the same time.  I couldn't exactly figure out what those white nodes on the wall were, but they were beautifully laid out in design.  They looked like seashells of some sort. The meal was pricey, but was an evening to remember!

Great dining experience.  Located  on Melrose where Patina was.   We did the tasting menu, which I recommend for the first visit, but once is good enough.  Because it becomes a food orgery and the next day I suffered a food hangover.   When I return I am going to order off-menu. The theme is seashore, and it carries throughout  the decor and to the food where the chef does incredible things creating a culinary and visual experience emulating the sea.  For instance, one of our dishes had something that looked like seafoam!  splendid.  Lots of picture taking of all the courses at the tables around us. The wine pairings were excellently done and appropriately brought each dish to the next level.  There is a cheese cart that is over-the-top and I can't wait to try that next  time. The wait staff was friendly and competant, but I found the host and hostess a bit on the aloof and rude side.

I've heard fantastic things about Providence; the food did not disappoint...in fact, it was absolutely fantastic.  This would be an expectation since it was recently rated a US top 50 restaurant and earned two coveted Michelin Stars; however, I thought the service was average; the assistants and greeters seemed pretty green and somewhat rushed throughout the dining experience; but, the sommelier and our designated waiter were excellent; and, the bartender, Ray, is sound...try one of his martini specials, you cant' go wrong. That being said,  the quality of food was impeccable and the food delivery pace between plates/pairings were timed perfectly; the sommelier's parings, descriptions, and insight were spot-on.

I wanted to give this restaurant two stars, because the sentiment "Meh, I've experienced better" really fits.  But truth be told, Providence is not bad at all.  In fact, many of my dishes were 'as good as it gets'...  However, for the money spent, and based on my prior experience with michelin starred fine dining, I didn't leave thrilled.  Maybe I was having an off night, or perhaps they were having an off night (in fact my server did say that this was the slowest he had ever seen the kitchen).  But no matter, the review will be written. I've dined here twice.  Once for lunch and once for dinner.  This last visit was for dinner and we went for the full tasting with wine pairings.  Last time I did the a la carte option with the six course dessert tasting option.  But I'll focus mostly on my recent dinner. Providence does fish, and they do it very well.  I didn't have a piece of fish that wasn't perfectly cooked or anything but fresh.  The preparations were creative and well executed, flavors all matched, and nothing offended my palate.  On that note, often I felt that Providence played it safe.  And off that note, there were certain dishes that were definitely different, unique, and surprising for my palate.  I do appreciate it when a restaurant does this successfully, and it did elevate the experience.  My friend and I looked at each other a few times last night and just said 'wow'.  It was really that good at times.  But our experience was certainly varied... The bread we got was cold.  Two of the varieties were amazing, the brioche and the bacon, but the third was cold & hard as a rock.  And sometimes we were left for quite some time just staring at our empty plates before the bus boy came and asked us if he could take our plates.  Uh, duh?  C'mon.   The wine pairings were most unusual.  And while interesting and never really 'off'', they left something to be desired in the end.  None of them were more than a couple years old.  I found this odd.  During the veal course I got a brand new Pinot, and it was only slightly above average.  It paired pretty well, but it felt safe and almost cheap.  The best pairing was with the scallops; a lovely and beautiful Southern German Reisling balanced perfectly off the sweetness of the scallops and its accompaniments.  Actually, this was both of our favorite dish. Other highlights included the amuse bouche, which really really were perfect.  The halibut was done sort of deconstructed, and it was neat.  Again, perfectly cooked.   Oh, and the cheese was amazing.  AMAZING.  Unfortunately, we were both so incredibly full from the meal at that point we couldn't finish.  And we sat looking at it for entirely too long before somebody came and brought our good but lackluster dessert.   It seems to me that Providence is holding on tight to their two Michelin Stars, and isn't making bold changes or even really focusing on making things better.  Perhaps the michelin rating system is flawed and my expectations are problematic.  In any case, if I go again, I'll probably return to the a la carte style of ordering, and find a bottle of wine from their wine list which is quite nice.  But for getting my gourmet fix on a more regular basis, I'll be going elsewhere.

Went there yesterday and ordered 9-course full testing menu.  Every dish was perfectly prepared/presented.  I have not been impressed by any Michelin restaurants for a while.  But Providence restored my confidence on the rating system.  Even though the place is famous for its seafood, the veal was surprisingly tender, juicy, and flavorful as well. The waiter chose 6 different cheese.  One of them is called Sottecenere, a truffle cheese from Italy.  It is definitely the best truffle cheese I have ever had. Service was great.  Everyone was friendly and attentive.  I made a special request via email one day in advance.  They replied quickly and did remember about it.

Okay... i've been struggling on how i should rate this place.... i am settled for 4 stars.... 3 stars for the food (i had 9 courses fixed menu), 5 stars for everything else... i enjoyed the breads, the complementary appetizers and the deserts... the services were nice... and i loved the decor; however, everything else..... it's OKay..... yeah, everything was OK... none of them really opened my eyes and made me WOW.... and i do like my food HOT but for the scallop & tenderloin dishes, i just don't think it's hot ENOUGH... i'd go back again, but if i do, i will probably order my dishes indiviually because there are so many things that look amazing on their menu... i wouldn't do the fixed menu again... oh i did the wine pairing, i don't know if i would recommend that... they were OK, but i don't think it's worth the price... and you have to be a person who CAN DRINK in order to take 9 different kinds of liquor... i liked it, but once is enough. it's a friendly high end dining place... it makes you actually feel comfortable comparing to some other fine dining places but i would suggest them (if i could which i won't)... to leave more spaces between the tables... i could totally tell that the couple sitting next to us were on a first date and i know who paid the bills!

Our vice?... to spoil ourselves with a new amazing restaurant and great chef every so often.  My husband treated me to this amazing restaurant when it first opened in 05. Since I'm a new yelper, I thought I'd write a review since this visit was quite memorable. The night started with a fantastic Screwdriver from the friendly bartender. Claiming to be a bar magician, his trick was to use a fresh orange. This lead to an amazing array of oysters shooters each with its own special doctoring, I've never found a match to this day.  Accompanied with the most amazing Tuna Tartare one can imagine with black truffle, brioche, and heart of palm. Already in euphoria, and since this was 3 years ago, I can't quite remember the white fish I had. But I can remember it melted in my mouth like butter. I believe my hubby had the New York steak that he could not stop talking about for months. Apparently, gluttons for a great evening, we did not stop there and were talked into sampling the cheese plate. With the help of the Sommelier, we paired, sampled, cooed, sipped, and squealed with every bite. Served with fine European cheeses, we could only have few tastes of the selection since it was clearly SO OVER THE TOP. As my head was ready to explode...comes dessert. Go to their site and read the dessert menu....I need not say more. As a finale, special chocolates were ours to enjoy after this spectacular evening. Overall one of the finest dinners I've had in LA!

I like this place, really like it.  At first I was skeptical from the appearance of the surrounding neighborhood, but once inside you are safe to say the least. The front of the house was very accommodating and moved our reservation up two hours, while calling ten minutes prior to that desired time slot.  We were promptly seated and proceeded engage in their dessert tasting courses.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable, genuine and personable.   The tasting was innovative, yet you could tell the pastry chef was not trying to "reinvent the wheel" (so to speak.)  Some courses were outstanding and one in particular I did not care for with the walnut torte.  Plating was exceptional.  Everything appears simple, but it is in fact quite complex and sophisticated. One gripe about the service, though I understand this is not an entirely "fine dining" formal restaurant.  Food runners and servers should have been serving with their left hands (palms facing inward) coming from the guest's left (as much as possible, of course with the exception of beverage service from the right, or clearing plates.) Will return for full tasting though, for sure!

My husband and I went here for our anniversary a week ago.  I can't say it was the best experience ever. I think Yelp hyped up our expectations of the place.  I was disappointed. It was not the best food I've ever tasted especially for the price and SIZE! We had teh 5 course tasting menu. I've had tasting menus before and this was too small! the appetizers were good but the main course were not. I can't say I'd come back here again. I gave it 3 stars because i was just thinking, MAYBE...i just ordered the wrong things?

This restaurant was truly my first foray into "real" fine dining, and I have to say that I'm happy I made the leap.  My friend and I both had the full tasting menu with wine pairing and it was seriously the best damn food I've ever had in my life.  Every meal I've had since my Providence experience 2 nights ago has made me sad that all food doesn't taste like theirs.  I can't even remember all the names of the dishes we had but it included a cute little starter plate of cocktail-inspired treats & a delicious broccoli bisque-esque soup, followed by kanpachi, uni in an eggshell, scallop & cabbage, salmon,VEAL (my favorite), assorted cheeses (not my fave), a "pre-dessert", then the banana dessert & barley ice cream...plus they threw in some bonus chocolates at the end. In my opinion I thought the staff was certainly knowledgeable about the dishes and wines they served us and were very personable, which I appreciated.  I mean, even the toilet paper in the bathroom at this place was high quality!  The only negative I can think of is that the neighborhood this restaurant is located in is rather ghetto.   I am by no means a fancy wine connoisseur but I would highly recommend everyone try the full tasting menu with wine pairing because the taste of the food is wonderfully enhanced by the wine in a way I can't even describe in words.   Thanks to Providence for de-virginizing me in fine dining and broadening my horizons all the more.  I look forward to my next fancy meal at a new place but will have to muddle through eating less-than-stellar "regular" food until then...

Surprised at how much we enjoyed our dinner here this past Monday. Monday?? Yes, Monday.... that's No corkage fee Monday for the budgeted foodies out there. Just in the wines alone we probably saved $300. We saw that they had some different Foie Gras appetizers so we brought a nice bottle of Sauternes. We also brought a Pinot & some Champagne. The Sommelier was very polite and courteous, he iced what needed icing and served them at all the appropriate times. (remember we did bring them in) He was very professional at serving us without letting us feel that pang of "Really... 3 bottles??" hahahaha we wouldn't of cared anyway, but at least he was pretty cool about it. Hmmmn, the food was nicely executed and has a bit of a molecular gastronomy flair to it. It was as if they understood Thomas Keller's epic and straight forward approach to food and quality, yet wanted to play in Ferran Adria's (el Bulli) Science lab of a kitchen. It was good. It was interesting. It didn't disappoint. They definitely executed better than the trendy Bazaar. We didn't get the tasting menu because everything that looked good to us was on the appetizers and a la carte side. So we made up our own tasting menu, I suggest you do the same, if you know what you like. Appetizers we had; Terrine of Foie Gras (actually two, we were greedy) loved it, but I would have loved it more with a little bit more pink salt. Foie Gras Saute, delicious. Foie Gras Ravioli (not as good as the first two). Maine Lobster, nice. Dungeness Crab, good. Scallops, good. Salt Baked Spot Prawns, very nice presentation, sweet. Yes, we eat a lot... Entrees: Wild Maine Lobster, very good, almost s good as French Laundry.... just kidding, but it was still good. Prime New York, good, but it's still a new york steak, they need to bring in some rib eye. Duck Breast, this was probably the best duck I've had, the strips were serious, they looked about as thick and meaty as the steak strips. We didn't get any fish, I have a hard time paying $45 for salmon, bass, trout, or john dory, unless it's some serious sushi, not going for it. I didn't remember seeing any Uni dishes, but I may have over looked that during my Foie Grasm. This restaurant received a 2 Michelin star rating while Michelin was still rating LA restaurants. If you really like the finer side of food, it's a definite don't miss in the LA area. It is just down the street from Mozza. You know it's good when Drew Barrymore is sitting at the next table.

Giving five stars was a no-brainer.  There are many reasons why Providence is on every foodie's bucket list.   My boyfriend and I did the tasting menu with wine pairing, which was really very exceptional.  I knew I was going to fall madly in love when the first course turned out to be kanpachi sashimi.  The following 3.5 hours was a culinary wonderland, amplified by the generous wine pours of course.  i thought about penning literary food porn by describing each course and amuse bouche in detail, but it's completely unnecessary.  Just go already.

Providence absolutely deserves the 2 Michelin stars that it has been awarded.  Both times I've been there, I originally had the intention of ordering the tasting menu, but both times, there were items that I really couldn't resist on the regular menu.  This time, we both had to order the chowda'.  If you love bacon, you will not be able to resist the chowda', which is full of yummy chunks of bacon!  (To go with the bacon bread?)   We also had a mushroom starter that had an egg on it -- the first few bites were not spectacular, but somehow, mid-way through the dish, when all the flavors had mixed, it turned out to be really delicious. My friend had the halibut, and I had the duck, for mains.  Even though Chef Cimarusti is known for seafood, I really enjoyed the duck.  I previously had the prawns in salted crust, which was light and enjoyable. The desserts are all very interesting, innovative takes on the usual, and worth trying even though you're full and receive the petit fours at the end. However, the absolute best thing is that Chef Cimarusti remains visible there.  We saw him both times, checking on how the service was going; he even held the door open for us.  The fact that he is so actively involved in the service may be part of why the food and experience are so spot-on.

Providence is a true 5-star dinning: great ambience, good services, excellent food.  What else do you expect?  It has it all... We splurged ourselves with 9-course tasting menu.  I like the idea of not knowing exactly what you would get, and betting your experience with the chef!  And, it didnt disappoint me!  Everything met if not exceeded our expectation. You feel it is worth every dime you pay!  If I have to nit pick, it was the basil ice cream that we didnt like.  It tasted Basil (of course, just as the name suggests!).  But that is totally subjective. My husband is very into Michelin rating, while I was a bit sceptical, as some of great restaurant are not even rated. But Providence is well deserved Miehelin 2-star!

I came here with my boyfriend two months ago, and it turned out to be the most memorable dinner we've had together. The ambiance of this restaurant is wonderful. Its high ceilings and decor really give a fun, classy and warm feel without being over the top. We weren't seated in the main dining room, however, which was a bit disappointing because it looked so great. But the smaller room we were in, which only had a hand full of tables, turned out to be cozy and quite private. It's been a few months since we were here, but we are still talking about our servers! Best service I've ever had--highly attentive, knowledgeable, entertaining and, most importantly, personable! Honestly, what an amazing wait staff. We had such a great time that we stayed for 4 hours and didn't even realize it... we didn't do a taster either, we went a la carte. And, best of all, (and I'm assuming it's because we were the last people there) we received a tour of the kitchen. Cherry on top of the night. Everything was absolutely, mouth-wateringly delicious. My only regret is that, sadly, we were fish and did not do a wine pairing. But maybe it's a good thing; I probably would have passed out. With that sad, I will mention the two items I had here that I have been dreaming about daily since they were introduced to my mouth. Un Caf Bordeaux jkatihgpiueqtekpoujgocds........ $#*%!!!

Is there a word better than awesome?! Because if there is, it would be the perfect description of Providence. We ordered the oysters and the 5course tasting menu. The oysters were delicious. I really liked the cool cocktail consommé that came with the oysters, way better than regular cocktail sauce! If you're in doubt, the tasting menu is totally the way to go. The 5course tasting menu consisted of: Screwdriver & Mojito Amuse Bouche: Such a cool and fun way to start the meal. Strong and sweet. Sampler Amuse Bouce: This consisted of a sous-vide Mexican white shrimp, a trout belly crème fraiche stuffed puff pastry and a passionfruit carrot shellfish cold soup shooter. It was a nice little teaser before the meal. The puff pastry stuffed with trout packed a huge punch and the shooter really cleaned your palate. Japanese Kanpachi : A great starter; very fresh, refreshing and the crispy soba worked so well with the beautiful fish. Scallops: It was served with potato puree and a walnut pesto. My gosh, that walnut pesto was like the best sauce I've ever had with scallops. It was just damn good. Halibut: The halibut was just gorgeous. It was very fluffy, moist and oh so tasty. The waiter had told us that it has never been frozen, meaning that sucker was still alive a couple hours ago. Veal Tenderloin: I'm really not a fan of veal but this tenderloin was ridiculous. It was tender, soft and just full of flavor. It also came with a nice red pepper puree and roasted shitake mushrooms. Green Tea Sponge Cake: Dessert might have been my favorite course because this sponge cake was just great! It was a matcha green tea sponge cake, on top of chocolate ganache with dehydrated dark chocolate mousse and topped with pine coconut ice cream and a bit of tangerine syrup. BOMB. Complimentary Dessert Sampler: Consisted of a peanut butter macaron, mint and chocolate marshallow. Oh we all know how much I love macarons and this was no exception. Simply one of my favorite desserts. Every bite of food was really really really good. The service was top notch, you really couldn't ask for better service. Truly one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Recommendation:  Tasting Menu

I love Providence. During a stint of visiting as many two michelin starred restaurants as we could, my friend and I finally made our stop at Providence. This was over a year ago and I can still taste my striped bass with peas and white truffles. Seriously good stuff. I came back last weekend to celebrate my mom's birthday. We were seated in an intimate room behind the bar. One thing I love about Providence is the dining room arrangement. It's divided into small rooms that consist of about five tables each, which creates a comfortable and intimate atmosphere. You don't feel like you're constantly eavesdropping on your neighbor's conversations. Long story short, after ordering our meal and finishing a round of drinks, my brother suddenly felt very under the weather and had to go home. The staff was kind enough to let us come back later on that evening to finish our meal, even though they were solidly booked. The food was even better than I remembered! The highlight of the meal was definitely the seared fois gras with matsumoto peach. I'm a sucker for foie gras, and this was the best preparation I've ever had! It surpassed the foie at both the French Laundry AND Urasawa. Super tasty. Also, I love love love the plating here. Taste and presentation are equally top notch. Another random note: This may seem like a weird thing to say, but the valet guy here is the best!! It's not every day that you meet someone who seems like a genuinely nice and humble person. He actually remembered us when we came back later that night and was sincerely concerned with how my brother was feeling. Such a nice guy!

Ouch my poor bf's wallet.  But it was gooooood :)  4 stars because it was a bit $$$ and for that much money I expected some of the dishes to be a little more complex and have more wow-factor. We each had the 5 course dinner and it was pretty awesome.  The amuse bouche was this plate of cocktails with a twist of molecular gastronomy!  Gelatinized mojito.. drool. The rest of the dishes were really good, but my favorite was the dessert.  They really put their efforts into the dessert which is nice because not all nice restaurants put an emphasis on that.  The best part I think was the small dessert plate the gave out in the end.. the macaron was SOOOOO GOOD.  Heaven put into one delicious bite. The BF and I don't eat shellfish so the restaurant was cool and let us substitute the scallop dish for a fish instead.

I wish there were separate ratings for food and service.  We recently did the kitchen table for our anniversary.  The food was excellent, amazing really.  The flavors are captivating and unique and the presentations are so perfect.   The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the service was off.  It was awkward, unrefined and the girl truly seemed annoyed to be serving us.  It hurts the overall experience.   I would still recommend this restaurant to anyone for the food.  Watching the chef in our private room was so fun.  The chef and his Sous or chef de cuisine were so on top of everything.  They were great. They offer the chef's tasting menu, but I suggest making your own.  My favorite was the crab and house made pasta with lobster.  The halibut is mouth watering. I like that they cook it on the rawer side and the potatoes that come with it are to die for.  You can actually taste the wood they cook it over.  The Sommelier was great.  He was on point and had some great wine pairings.

*NOTE: This review is for the full dessert tasting menu paired with wine ONLY! It's big enough for a meal, so we decided, why not? Dessert for dinner! I'm writing this down mostly so I don't forget it... 1. White chocolate "lollipop" with blood orange juice and cardamom - eaten in one bite, the crunch of the white chocolate, and the sensation of the blood orange juice bursting in our mouths was great. 2. Lychee-shiso ice cream on top of passionfruit gelatin with basil seeds and soy coconut milk - very light and refreshing. Came with a sweet white wine. 3. Squash polenta with mascarpone and maple syrup - "tastes like Thanksgiving!" we all agreed. Also worth mentioning - it was paired with an extremely sweet, very strong port which had a maple-y aftertaste that went perfectly with the polenta. 4. Pear gelatin with pear inside - served with almond bread and flavored with "sauces" in the form a jelly, foam, and powder (!) Maybe it was the sugar and previous wines kicking in, but I can't remember what this came with... I'm sure it was good, though. 5. Chocolate mousse with banana-avocado puree and horchata ice cream - some of the richest chocolate I have ever tasted, and banana-avocado puree might sound strange but it was amazing. Even the red wine that it came with seemed to have a chocolatey taste. Glorious sugar overload.

Judging by the other reviews, I know this one is a minority. I had the 9 course meal (for 2), and 2 alcoholic drinks. I liked about 3 of the 9 dishes. I thought another 3 were fine, and the other 3 were disgusting. Only one of the drinks tasted good. The other one was nasty. I also thought their homemade bread was bad. I think my favorite part of the dinner was the cheese. Anyway, $350 later (after tip), I wasn't happy. I kept thinking how much more delicious food I could have had for that much money.

Providence- You look at the beautifully plated, but small portion involved in each course of the Prie Fix menu an desperately think of the nearest fast food location to dash to after you done eating. You finish eating, then note to your surprise that you have been stuffed silly. That my friends is Providence. (pun totally intended) The cooking is innovative and involves tastes that you won't really get anywhere else. It manages to be flavorful without being overpowering. The dishes were cooked to perfection. The courses involved in the dishes complimented each other well. I highly recommend their prie fix menu. Their a la carte menu is not bad either. And much cheaper. $16-40 per entree-ish Though I have to say. . . as one of the handful of Michelin rated restaurants in LA I had better expectations. . .I still think Isis at the Luxor (which closed) was better. . . Each course is explained to you, but with a slightly haughty attitude and in words that make no sense to the commoner foodie. Did not like that aspect. Service was otherwise as to be expected. The bread was amazing.  . when I say innovative food I mean. . who else makes bacon dinner rolls.  . and makes it taste good? Though I think I liked the green tea focaccia better...

So before I knew anything about michelin stars or that this place had any, I took my boyfriend (now fiance) here for his birthday.  We were still college kids, and the only reason we came here was thanks to Iron Chef America.  His food looked so good on the show that we had to come and see.  So we got all dressed up and showed up expecting to be impressed!   And it was pretty amazing.  Of course, we didn't order the wine pairing..  Are you crazy? the idea of paying that much for wine was pretty absurd (our idea of good alcohol was strong alcohol, after all). I can still remember the very attentive service, and fresh seafood.  although, the uni in the egg was only tolerable since I'm not a big fan of uni.  The decorations were well done, pretty vibrant without being too over the top.   Anyway, they made us feel welcome and I didn't get any snobby vibes from them, so that's a plus.  Dinner for two was $260 i believe.

I think there's enough reviews written about this place so I'll keep this short.   Had the 5 course tasting menu and enjoyed the following: 1. hokkaido sea scallop - chanterelles, haricot vert, applewood smoked bacon, jurancon sec 2. japanese kanpachi - crispy rice crackers, flowering coriander, soy creme fraiche 3. Mexican bread pudding (dessert). Also loved the Arsenal cocktail and amuse bouche (mainly the mojito gelatin). Tasting menu was very good but nothing really blew me away or stood out.  Will need to come back and try more items before I can give a 5 star rating. Their specialty is seafood so stick with those rather than meat dishes.  Service was good, which is expected from a place of this caliber but didn't feel like they went over the top or went the extra mile.

Actually it's 4.5 Stars...  But I really enjoyed my time there, so I'll put 5 stars instead of 4 to boost their rating - not that they need it. Came here with a small group of friends for my... uhm... 25th birthday... yeah...  let's just say it's my 25th... The service was excellent, the drinks, the wine, and the food were fantastic!  Our waiter knows exactly what's being served and how it's cooked, as well as the wine, where it's from, how its harvested, and what kind of grape and how's made... Plus the artistic presentation of each item, I was very impressed. However, there was a minor incident during our meal that made my friends very irritated, hence the 4.5 star. We chose the 5 course meal plus wine pairing with a few additions. Bread and butter - I was impressed with the butter!  sounds really lame, but the butter comes with a little saucer of salt and a little scoop!!  so CUTE!   Amuse-bouche - cube of mojito, drop of greyhound wrapped in gelatin (looks like a large water drop on a leaf in the rain), and I believe it was yellow tail in a shot class.  I don't know how they make the greyhound go into the gelatin shell!  If you know the secret please send me a message - My bouche was VERY amused!! First course was the Kanpachi, with crispy rice crackers, cilantro and creme fraiche, the fish was seared, full of flavor.  YUM!  only thought I had was the bowl wasn't big enough.   We ordered one order of raw oysters to share, it came as our 2nd dish, it was very fresh, but nothing really spectacular about it... You can get good fresh raw oysters at a lot of restaurants.  Came with 2 sauces, a regular cocktail sauces, and another sauce that's got a kick to it - horse radish maybe? Half of us also ordered the Santa Barbara sea urchin, it's not part of the 5 course, but I like Uni... To my surprise, it was warm, and served in an egg shell.  It was delicious!  Although I let my husband have a bite, I think he took most of the uni... BOO!!! Next is bobby's block island sea scallops - my favorite dish in this whole dinner.  I wish they gave me more then 1 piece!!  It was also the first time I tried "foam" as a sauce... I've seen it on the food network, always wondering what it taste like, my conclusion:  it taste like air... At this point couple of my friends who are avid red wine drinkers were tired of the white wine pairing (being with seafood and all).  We asked for the waiter to suggest a red for the next dish, then next thing we know, the sommelier came out and put us in check - "I can't recommend a red wine for a seafood dish, You would need to pick a bottle, I pair the food with the wine for a reason."  We were SHOCKED!  Then he assured us that the next bottle of wine he's going to serve with the fish is going to have a red wine finish.  That's what made us curious and agreed to continue with the pairing. And he was right!  This wine is white, but tastes more like a pinot noir, very light, but not as crisp like the white.  If I was blind folded I probably would've guessed it's a pinot.  Kinda weird drinking it, because I feel like what I'm seeing is not matching what I'm drinking.  The fish is called Wild John Dory from New Zealand, never had it before, it's very... meaty, so I get why he chose this wine. My red wine drinker friends weren't pleased with the sommelier 's behavior, in their defense, he could've easily suggested a bottle of red wine instead of shutting down our mutiny.  That's why I took 0.5 stars off the rating... everyone's different.  Although I was glad I got to try the interesting white wine. Next is the veal tenderloin, it's very soft and melts in your mouth like butter!!!  sooo good!  We didn't think 5 courses were enough until the veal came out, I couldn't finish this one. After the veal, you have a chance to order some cheeses.  If you order it, they roll out a HUGE table of cheeses for you to choose from, you can taste it and you can ask questions, then they make a pretty plate for your table to share.  I really really really wanted this, but after the veal no one has room in their tummy for more food, and there's still dessert, so I can only watch other people getting this dish.  Next time... for another "20"ish birthday I'm gonna save room for this. Finished off the meal with banana bread pudding and some barley ice cream.  Warm and cold on the same plate, so good!  I don't usually like banana bread pudding, was hesitant at first, but turned out to be delicious. The chef came out and greeted us at the end of the meal which was really nice of him.  I'm pretty sure it's because they felt bad about shutting down our mutiny over the wine choices... LOL It wasn't a cheap meal, so it's not something that we can do all the time, but once in a while it's a good splurge to experience that kind of royal treatment.  Would definitely come back again when I replenish my wallet... or my husband replenishes my wallet, whichever comes first.

The food - especially the Santa Barbara Spot Prawns are amazing.  The service is part chemistry experiment and part culinary showmanship.   Beware tho - if you go the coursed route - which you most likely will, the service is almost painfully slow as in the typical 14 hour French provincial meal... not b/c the service is at all bad - but b/c they are giving plenty o time to ejoy the food and company. I love going here and it's a treat everytime but I get early setting so I don't fall asleep in my soup.

West Coast fine dining at it's best. Simple uncomplicated dishes, thoughtfully conceived and executed perfectly. Modern American cuisine that draws from California's many culinary influences and presents them as one cusines without feeling eclectic. From more classic combinations such as the diver scallops with chantarelles and fresh peas, to the earthy spice of the wild black bass with smoked paprika, Weisser Farm potatoes and Monterey Bay squid, to the bright flavours of the Yuzu curd, meringue, white chocolate sorbet with mint. Michael Cimarusti has put together a culinary experience that does Los Angeles proud. The service and design of Providence follow a similar path to the food and speak to you in a way that says, 'this is as good as it gets, but relax you are in California'.

Now I know how the "1%" do it! My boss called to let my Sr. Project Mgr and myself know that he was coming up to walk the job, and since we all had a meeting to go to that night downtown, he would take us out to dinner, joined by one of his old college roommates and his wife. After the meeting, we head over to Providence. Mind you, I had never heard of this place prior to going (I know, shame on me). We walk in, and are immediately greeted by Stan (college roomie), his wife and a bottle of Champagne! For some reason, once we were seated, our server kept on bringing us aperitifs. The 1st round was some special 3 shot drink specials; A mojito, greyhound and gin & tonic. The 1st two were were like jello and a liquid center. The G&T was an ice cube that fizzled once you put it in your mouth! The 2nd was three tasters. The 3rd was a round of chocolates (see below) Crazy good. Now that the champagne was finished, and a bottle each of Syrah and Sauvignon Blanc hit the table, a dozen half-shelves were served. Unbelievable! Again, the service was soooo good, but you didn't even notice anyone hanging by the table. Love that. Now, dinner. I started with the Big Eye Tuna Tartare. I haven't had tartare that good in a LONG TIME! The tuna melted, and the caviar was outstanding. My main course was the pesto crusted halibut. I can't stand how most restaurants overcook the halibut. This was perfect. Not dried out, not rare, but just perfect! Now that I'm too full to try their wonderful desert menu, they have the nerve to bring us another plate of chocolate tasters. Damn you Providence!!! I can't wait to see you again, or as Kevin said, "Dude, we gotta bring the ladies here!"

I had been wanting to dine at Providence for a couple years now and finally, I got my wish!   We both went with the tasting menu and my goodness was I impressed.  One dish that stuck out was this uni in the egg with mini bread crouton things on top.  Delicious.  I personally love seafood over any other protein and was so pleased that Providence focuses so much on this.  Every dish was phenomenal and so creative.  Loved the array of flavors and the service was great as well.  We were running late, so they even packed up some dessert for us.  Fabulous meal.  Wish I came here instead of Melisse that one day!

Food: absolutely delicious with dishes my palate has never experienced before. My husband and I got the pre-fix menu. Service: Very attentive and accommodating.   Price: expensive but you get what you pay for Other: If you haven't tried this place, you must go at least once and experience this dining experience. Just an fyi, we ordered the 5 course pre-fix menu therefore dinner took about 2.5 hrs (which is the norm  for gourmet restaurant).

After the experience of eating this chefs creations I was inspired to quit my job, move to France to study the culinary arts in an attempt to recreate the art that was presented to me. Amazing.... If only, I had something that resembled talent... OK I am getting carried away here... The hubby and I go there from time to time to order the 5 course tasting menu... It is always innovative, beautiful, and delicious... The service has always been amazing too. I know its a bit expensive but when you're talking about art just hand over the cash. It is not just sustenance... its art.

Michael Cimarusti does it again. Of course the seafood is incredible as one would expect but the foie gras was tops-bold, straightforward and my favorite of the year. It's hard to find good foie gras that is not covered in something sweet and hidden between layers of something else. I am grateful that they gave it the respect it deserves. My only complaint is that one dish was a tad over-seasoned, masking the true taste of the fish and that has never happened at the Water Grill. But since the Water Grill was on of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles, I have faith in Providence and will surely return for round 2.

Unlike other typical French restaurants here in LA, Providence is known for their seafood. Their mackerel dish is superb and tends to run out soon. Oysters and fish tartar are pretty delicious too. Everything is very well made and executed, including coffee. The decor is elegant and modern. It's a great place for a special occasion or taking someone special to. Tips: Make a reservation and dress nice before you go.

One of my all-time favorite restaurants in this town. Every single dish is a perfect work of art. Chef Michael's dishes are not only beautiful but also incredibly delicious. This is a place for people who love seafood, respect the elegance of classic French cuisine and who appreciate a modern, American influence (this time inspired by Asian-America, namely Japanese, Korean and Thai). The wine pairings are impressive especially those from South America. The service is wonderful and the wait-staff is incredibly knowledgable. The 5 course is appropriate for those who wish to be satiated in a respectable way. You leave floating on cloud 9 and will dream of the next experience you will have the next time.

Ambiance: 4.5 stars Food: 4.5 stars (5 stars for the macarons and the liquor spheres [they are amazing]) Everything we had were good. Service: 4.5 stars. Price: 5 stars. Overall: For fine dining experience, I think providence is the best in L.A. I am not giving it a 5 stars because I don't want you to fill up the reservation slots. I'd be very sad if I have to wait a month to get a table at Providence.

Solid 4 star restaurant. Dinner was extremely good and the amuse bouche may have been the highlight! Service started excellent, then midway through dinner, it was like "Wallah". They pulled a shift change midway through a 5 course meal and forgot to debrief. I am fairly certain we paid for a 3-person cheese plate which we pushed to the end, and never received this. I really liked the early service and thought the latter service was a bit fake. The prawns cooked tableside are also highly recommended. Bring a fat expense account! Ambiance is nice with an "under the sea" theme.

Not that great, too pricey, more focused on presentation than flavor   I should have known when we pulled up to the restaurant...There was no valet in sight at the valet stand, and when I finally saw them they gave us attitude. It was as if we were bothering them. Some other people pulled up and they would not even help them!! If you like your food to look good but not taste good, then this is your place.   Waitstaff was attentive. Nice decor.

Amaaazing!  Providence, how I wish we didn't live nearly 3,000 miles away from each other.  Perhaps the stars will align and bring us closer together one day so I can drink pitchers of your Lyone cocktail and have endless power dinners with the guarantee the food will be outstanding, the atmosphere exciting. My husband and I went here for our 4 year anniversary .... and the food, most certainly, is...well, nothing short of excellent.  It takes a lot for a cocktail to impress me....I was floored by the Lyone, and been thinking about it ever since. Yes, when I think of the *perfect* cocktail, the Lyone is at the first thing on my mind.  It's actually a disappointment because now I feel I will never be able to find anything so delicious and perfectly balanced as Providence's Lyone...oh well, such is life in the land of politics.... On to the next....the amuse-bouche: simply put, mind blowing.  The first serving of the three was a small gelatin square with a lime wedge next to it....squeeze the lime on it and it tastes just like a gin and tonic.  It will blow your mind and change the way to think about food.  Next was a syrup-y spoonful of mojito, and then the Tasmanian thunder sea trout.   Then the 5-course tasting with wine pairing:  Unbelievable attention to detail in each plate.  Courses were:  Japanese kanpachi, diver scallops, grouper, roasted veal tenderloin, and then the meringue for dessert.  All the plates were outstanding, but my favorite was the veal tenderloin...as perfectly cooked as a tenderloin could be, how I wish the dish never ended. I'll definitely be hitting up Providence for the drinks, if not the culinary masterpieces, the next time I am in LA. Hopefully fate wont keep us apart for that much longer...that would be a tragedy.

Dining Date: 4/7/10 I am having the nine course tasting menu with wine pairings ($165 per person) at Providence. First, a bread basket makes it's rounds. The nori bread has a salty surface, like it's been brushed with a salt brush.  And the nori is distinct, very unusual in a good way.  The bacon roll is more buttery and savory but less salty. The amuse bouche consists of three cocktails.  I squeeze some lime on my gin & tonic.  It's a mini rectangular block that turns into a mini slushy in my mouth, a fancy slushy that is. The margarita is one of those new fangled molecular gastronomy contraptions.  It's a globule that reminds me of a raw egg yolk with just a thin skin holding the cold liquid margarita in, love the flavor.  Can I get perhaps ten of these please? The smoked trout and creme fraiche looks like a little present topped with gold leaf.  I think there is a lemon gelee on the bottom, some little crunchy balls the size of roe and some actual roe. The japanese kanpachi with crispy rice crackers, coriander, soy crème fraîche is paired with a dry muscat, "gessami" gramona 2008. The santa barbara spot prawn with champagne beurre blanc, fennel, fines herbes is paired with cremant de bourgogne blanc de bland, comaine parigot & richard m.v. The spot prawn is nice and sweet and the beurre blanc sauce is the perfect light accompaniment.  Not sure how they can make a butter sauce taste so light. The hokkaido scallop with japanese eggplant, ramps, reduction of vadouvan and sauternes is paired with reisling spatlese, "brauneberger juffer sonnenuhr" fritz haag 2006.  Mr. T thinks the riesling is too sweet.  But I love it with the scallop. It's very smooth and easy to drink.  This is the last of the appetizers. The wild halibut (alaska) with smoked paprika, weiser farms potatoes, grilled squid is paired with trebbiano blend, "coenobium" monastero suore cistercensi 2008.  It's a really unusual white wine that will really stretch your palate in a good way.  I would probably hate it on it's own.  But paired with the halibut and being part of this particular progression, it somehow manages to work. The wild troll caught king salmon (alaska) with truffle vinaigrette, brussels sprouts, baconfava beans, french breakfast radish, dutch white asparagus is paired with rose, "albemarle" kluge estate 2009.  The pink hue of the rose matches the the beautiful salmon color.  I love how wild salmon tastes so pure and clean, the flesh is almost creamy.  Does wild troll caught mean that trolls are real and that they caught my fish?  Thank you troll.  I spend some time twirling my rose and pondering the existence of trolls. The marcho farms veal tenderloin (franconia, pa) with sweet peas, bacon, almond, and morel mushrooms is paired with pinot noir, evening land vineyard 2008.  I think the veal has been sous vide at 140 degrees for two hours and then lightly seared.  The springyness of the meat reminds me a bit of prime rib.  But the flavour is quite delicate.  The waiter comes by to check that I received the correct dish.  I don't digest almonds well which I expressed during ordering so my dish doesn't have any.  The service is very professional.   Next up are the market cheeses and a glass of bourgogne gamay noir, "terres d'en face" domaine sde la vougeraie 2007.  If you love cheese, Providence's cheese cart will make you swoon. The fromage fellow asks about your preferences and then tailors a cheese plate that he thinks you will appreciate.  Due to my lactose intolerance, I have never ordered a cheese course ever.  I often request no cheese or sauce on the side so as not to upset my stomach.  But I want to enjoy the meal as the chef intended and experience the complete vision.  So I pop Lactaids like crazy.  What a great decision.  I eat lots of stinky cheese and boy is it good.  I'd like to wax poetic about the whole experience but the multitude of wine and food is overwhelming.  Not too much quantity wise but just a lot of new things to take in at once. Next we have a palate cleanser, the blood orange tarragon sorbet with yogurt.  Tarragon is the flavor that stands out.  If you're a fan of tarragon, this is right up your alley. The yuzu curd, meringue with vanilla white chocolate sorbet, pineapple & mint is paired with welschriesling trockenbeerenauslese, rosenhof 2001.  This is probably the one dish that I find disappointing.  The flavors are really jarring. Nothing seems to meld together.  My favorite part is the little meringue kiss but everything else is just weird.  With all my talk about how I love mint, even the mint paste is strange.  Sometimes dishes are the sum of their parts but I can't seem to put this one together.  Weird. This is more like dessert, the petits fours.  The spicy chocolate is my favorite.  The lemon macaroons and the little pink cubes are fun and playful.  But the chocolate is unforgettable.  I want more.  That's a good way to leave a restaurant.

My favorite and best experience in LA so far. I absolutely love everything about this restaurant. This was my second visit AMBIANCE Its fresh, modern and just a nice fine dining restaurant without the stuffiness. SERVICE Extremely professional, knowledgeable staff. FOOD It really does live to the hype. I usually don't buy into it and am always underwhelmed. This time it really blew me away. We ordered the tuna tartare, lobster, clam chowder, pork belly and trout. The cheese cart..also a must. The only thing is that I wish I could come more often. It is pricey.

I went to Providence not for any special occasion, the experience was occasion enough. Of course, I opted for the tasting menu. The question was, "Which menu?" Skipping over the $90 five-course and avoiding the unlisted $160 chef's menu, I chose the $120 full tasting of nine courses. Chef Michael Cimarusti, originally from the city of Providence is amazingly skilled with seafood. His restaurant reflects these nautical themes, but in a subdued manner so as not to look like a white-tablecloth Joe's Crab Shack. Of course, with a restaurant of this caliber, the service was top-of-the-line. Tasting Menu 1. Gin & tonic, mojito, saffron & fennel 2. Kanpachi crudo/sashimi 3. Point Judith calamari 4. Sea scallops 5. Halibut 6. King Salmon 7. Veal Tenderloin 8. Market cheeses 9. Raisin, pear ras el hanout & hazelnut 10. Kalamansi gelee While the kanpachi, and halibut certainly stood out, none of the courses were sub-par. Each displayed the creativity and care of detail I would expect from a newly awarded two-Michelin-star restaurant. At La Terza, I had the honor of meeting Chef Cimarusti. From the brief conversation with him, I could tell that he takes his job very passionately. Both him and the co-owner Donato Poto show the professionalism and excellence that only true dedication can bring. What other maitre d' would prepare live roasted Santa Barbara prawns tableside (a dish unfortunately off-menu)? While I couldn't return too soon for fear of diluting the pleasant memories of this dinner, I would be honored to come back. If Providence is divine care, I'm in heaven at Cimarusti's table.

My stomach is still aching with happiness.  It wants to experience the 9-course tasting menu again: (0) amuse bouche: gin and tonic gelee, mojito ravioli, carrot puree (1) Japanese Kampachi (2) Sea urchin and egg served in egg shell (3) Seared scallops (4) Halibut with shiso (5) Salmon with gingered carrot juice (6) Veal tenderloin (7) Cheese plate (8) Pre-dessert cucumber sorbet (9) miso cheesecake with black sesame puree and crust. The scallops and halibut were the most memorable.  So many complex flavors.  If you like sea urchin, you will love the second dish served nicely in an eggshell.   I did not like the carrot foam that came with the salmon, nor did I like the salty flavor of the miso cheesecake.  Nice try, but I'll pass next time.  Cheese lovers will salivate over the cheese selection.  Lactose-intolerant cheese haters (e.g. my Taiwanese relatives) need to stay away; the cheese cart is pungent and reminded me why they joke about 'cutting the cheese'. As other reviewers commented, the amuse bouche was fantastic and I can still remember the taste.  I vote for the mojito ravioli as the best with the explosion of flavor from the liquid. Be aware there is a small seating area in the 'patio' area which they covered for dinner.  The chairs are patio chair with added cushions and the clearance between tables made me feel like I was eating in by an airplane aisle when servers collided with cheese carts and serving carts.  Ask for the main dining room if possible.

This was my very first tasting. I took my mother and brother out pre-Mother's day as gift instead of flowers this year. OMG, I thought the food was pretty incredible. However, I'm not sure about the service. I've read other reviews and I do have to agree the wait staff are a little snobby. I'm a little disappointed with their service because they didn't always explain the dishes that we were tasting. We're not going to remember what was on the tasting menu. I had the wine pairing but wished I had known that everyone in the table had to do the same tasting menu as I was charged for three tasting w/wine pairing but only I had the wine pairing. They should have explained that if one person does the wine pairing that everyone in the table would be charged the same even though they didn't do the wine pairing. As far as the decor goes, it was plain and simple, not much you can say. The atmosphere was pretty nice, dark. I couldn't imagine doing any more than 9 tasting. We had purchased an extra tasting which was the prawns. That was the most amazing part of the whole tasting was the prawns cooked in salt. They take the course salt and heat it up. Then they take the prawns and place in skillet where they cover them in the heated salt. They then bake for another 3 minutes or so before they bring it to your table side to cut and place on your plate to serve. It was so juicy and fresh! I know there were other good dishes but simply put, I can't remember them. I only enjoyed the prawns the best. I think if I ever go back. I would still love to do the wine pairing but would hope they would discuss more details. Sure, I'm not a wine connoisseur but I still would love if you they talk to you like you were so that you can take in what they say and see if you can't experience the complexity of the pairing. They never said why that particular wine would go well with the dish we were having nor did they explain what made that wine so good. They only said the wine came from what country/region. I would suggest this restaurant for now only since that's the only place where I've done tasting menu with wine pairing. However, please allow yourself plenty of time as it took us 4 hours to complete a meal of 9. They did take a little too long inbetween tasting to serve each course.

The good:  the food! The bad:  it's expensive. In short:  Really enjoy the food and the service is professional with attention close to that you get in NYC.  Providence is possibly the LA version of Le Bernardin. It's been a while since I've been back, but I'm looking forward to my first attendance at one of their weekend cooking classes and will see then if the food quality is still up to par.

I'm not a fish eater. My two friends and I choose a new restaurant, not necessarily "new" but new for us, every month.  Providence has been on our list for awhile, but for some reason we never got to it - until last night. It's probably because I'm not big into seafood, and as the more vocal one of the group, my preferences were taken into account for the selection of our next choice.  But after awhile, I thought that, at least after reading all the reviews, this meal wouldn't just be seafood, it'd be an experience, despite what type of dish I would be eating. My one friend and I met early at the bar and I tried the highly yelp-praised Arsenal, which was really great.  My friend tried one of the other bourbon cocktails (Hard Weigh, I think it was called?), and we were both astounded that the bartender freshly squeezed oranges and whatever fruits needed to create the juices of the cocktails INTO the actual mixer with a hand-juicer.  What was great about the cocktails is that, as the alcohol was the furthest thing from well, the mix of the bourbon with the other ingredients never let the actual alcohol take a backseat. Unlike most bars where, although they'll create tasty drinks, the ingredients will sometimes mask the alcohol, whereas our beverages really showcased the alcohol, but complemented the other ingredients as well, without coming off too stiff. It was a tough decision, but we decided to all do the 5-course menu with wine pairings.  What was really helpful was that my one friend can't eat shellfish and has an aversion to veal (man, did she miss out), and luckily all of our waitstaff was happy to provide her with substitutions (John Dory for scallops, and salmon for veal). Firstly, the bacon bread was an awesome way to start the meal, but then the amuse bouche came and blew us away.  I'm not sure how it was prepared, but a gelatinous gin and tonic gumdrop sat next to a molecular gastronomic spoonful of a mojito, next to a small shot of carrot soup with some small and amazing, but sadly forgettable accoutrements.  It was awe inspiring, and of course salacious. All of the courses are listed on the website, so it really wouldn't serve me any good to just list what the website does already; however, it's worth noting that every dish was just amazing, perfectly cooked, constructed and plated.  From the cloud like texture of the halibut, to the savory, and evenly cooked veal, no dish was better than the rest - they were all amazing, but just different.  The sauce of the scallops was something we all just wanted to suck off the plate. Apparently it's made with a French dessert wine, and it just worked so harmoniously with the mushrooms and bacon. I wish I could speak so eloquently of the wines, but that's not really my forte.  They all worked incredibly well, from the near sweetness of the first wine that matched well with the raw first course, to the robust red that accompanied the veal, and the almost chocolate-y port with the dessert, that wasn't very port at all (which is great, because I'm not a big port fan).  The service and attentiveness of the staff was sincerely some of the best I've ever experienced.  Not only were they well equipped with knowledge about every dish, but they were very personable and friendly. Not only were the fish dishes that I ate some of the best dishes I've ever had, but they've made a fish eater out of me.  Can't wait to try some great halibut again!

I've been here twice.  Once at lunch and a second time during dinner. That was the best lunch I ever had.  The amuse en bouche was amazing.  For starters, they laid out a plate of 3 round jello discs.  Each one filled with a different liquor.  An upscale jello shot, basically.   The next amuse was so beautiful, I didn't want to eat it.  Some kitchen student probably slaved for hours cutting strawberries into perfect symetrical mm sized cubes for free.  It was placed in a small black bowl and had tiny imported white fish with green string seaweed?  Words can't describe it. The bacon cheddar bread was fluffy and flavorful.  The wine the sommelier recommended was excellent.   My main entree was real Japanese Kobe beef.  Carved table side.  With perfect risotto, a perfect looking potato and a rich, dark demi glace.  I was in heaven.  Indulgent, self-pampering once-in-a-lifetime lunch.  There's a difference between hole-in-the-wall restaurants that blow your tastebuds away and the kind of food that takes you to another place completely, like this one.  Would make for an interesting essay. The second time I came was at dinner with friends.    I had a regular new york steak which was excellent.  My friend had the kobe beef which he loved.  His risotto however was undercooked.  The server took it back and gave him another bowl of risotto which was slightly less undercooked.  I peeked in the kitchen on the way to the bathroom and found 2 Le Cordon Bleu students at the stove!  It ticked me off cause we were dropping serious cash for our meal.   The amuse en bouche that night was a small beer mug, about 2 inches high and had a saffron foamy broth in it.  It was nothing spectacular.  The students probably made that as well. My other friend did get a generous shaving of black truffle over her foie gras salad, so that made up for the amuse and half-assed risotto.   I think they input what you order and what you drink in their computer.  The waiter seemed to know too much about what I drank 6 months ago at lunch.

Providence is where you want to be for celebrating special occasions or to go with your one and only.  I was here for a belated birthday with friends and after a 4.5 hour meal, I didn't want it to end. For drinks a few of us had the wonderland-vodka, lavender agave nectar, limoncello, and lime.  Presented w/ a few pomegranate seeds, it was bright with just the right amount of tartness. Choices of bread include a delicious roll studded w/ bits of bacon, foccacia, and sourdough.  Definitely try the bacon roll which are pillowy bites that make you want to eat more than one, but don't make the mistake I did getting a little full on 2 bacon rolls and foccacia.  There is much more to tempt the palate. Seafood is deftly prepared here.  The tuna tartare with quail egg was the best I have had, with the tuna chopped so finely it was almost like a mousse.  The lobster crepe was also delicious with gently poached lobster in an egg crepe.  Who knew scallops and hazelnuts would be a match that works well, with the brown butter complimenting both.   Desserts are also to be savored.  Of the four desserts we ordered, the brazilian coffee dome, walnut and scotch whiskey was the favorite of our table.  Smooth and flavorful.   Presentation of all the dishes are exquisite.  They are plates of art and one can appreciate eating with all one's senses here.  Chef Michael Cimarusti graduated from the CIA w/ honors, honed his craft at Le Cirque, Spago, Water Grill and spent time in Paris at the Michelin three star restaurant L'Arpege La Maree so one could only expect for him to have a restaurant that shines.

Yep, it was that good.  Note I was there for lunch and not dinner.  a 3 hour affair, with good company -- and incredible food. Waiter was great, really looked like he had something up his sleeve every time he described a dish, i asked him like a million questions (the selections were very unique, and i was curious) and he was happy to answer all of them. Went for an extended thank-you business lunch, and the hits kept on coming.  we had a couple appetizers and i had the risotto which was INCREDIBLE.  I was told to save room for dessert -- which I did -- and wasn't disappointed.  The service was excellent, and even the valet was really trying (how often do you see that)?  Expensive -- but i'll be back.  i believe they are a 1 or 2 start michelin place.

Chad A. already laid out the recent 5 course tasting menu (that starts with Japanese Kanpachi) that I enjoyed last week much more thoroughly than I could so I will keep my review simple. Everything was delicious. I love the tasting menu because this is one place where putting complete faith in the chefs really pays off. The dishes are masterfully prepared and the ingredients are unparalleled. This restaurant is worth saving up a little extra money for. The most memorable dish for me was the Nancy's Diver Scallop. I grew up on fresh Maine scallops, but this is the best preparation I have ever had. Amazing taste and texture. This is a seafood lovers dream. All the seafood is sustainable as well, which is a nice bonus if you're conscious of that.

They claim this is to be one of the best restaurant in town ... Nottt!!! Well, I dinned there on 7/7/07 for a special occasion. I called 1 week in advance, and the phone guy was rude as hell which he mentioned that I won't get it. On Friday, a female manager called me and mentioned that they have spot for me, so, I dinned there 7:30 ... The same guy who I spoke a week ago called me on my cellphone, he asked where I was ...  (didn't he said I won't get the spot?), but I already in the restaurant. Later on he showed up and apologize, he claimed that there's another person with the same last name came by ... errmmmm NOT! When I arrive there, the restaurant was not even FULL, many older people was there ... and gosh there's no need for VALET ... there are plenty of street parking. Anyway I started with foie gras parfait, which took about 20 minutes to arrive. The taste was not as I expected. I've tasted a much better flavor with far less price... (Santana Row ... San Jose/ Grand Cafe San Francisco was better). Then we got to the main course ... the Muscovy duck and sea urchin pasta. 2 pieces of dark meat duck with their cherry wine sauce ... ermm not very tempting.The skin was suppose to be crispy, the meat should be tender ... but NOT happening. (Kitty Chai New York better) The Sea urchin pasta was just regular ... 2 pieces of urchin, 3 Oz of Spaghetti ... w/ wine tomato sauce ... Not very tempting. Then we finished the meal w/ the salt&pepper ice cream dark chocolate cake ... It was okay (Gotham Bar New York was better) so anyway we finished our dinner around 11:15, spent close to $ 200 and without asking for anything ... we got amuse, and ahi tartar on the house ... which showed their gratitude for our time in the restaurant and their fast paced kitchen.

Delicious - totally delicious ... service was awesome as well. This is a kick butt place to bring a date ... here's how my experience went: Called up for reservations a couple days before hand - made reservations on a Sunday for dinner for two. Received a confirmation call a few hours prior to time. The normal stuff. My date and I arrived at the restaurant - and found parking in a residential area further down the street. I actually wanted to valet, seeing that it was freezing cold - but for some reason the valet folk were not out there. Probably the only bad thing about the night. We entered the restaurant and were immediately seated. My date and I looked around the room and really liked the ambiance. It is very elegant, yet simple. They have pretty neat handcrafted decorations that kind of resemble barnacles - but in a tasteful way ... not a Joe's Crab Shack kind of way. They brought by both the drink/wine and fooding menus immediately. For a drink, I selected a drink with gin - not sure of the name, but was very good. My date had a tangerine drink with vodka. That was even better. We picked had a few different selections of bread, in which I decided to have some of the bacon-topped dinner roll. My date had some Focaccia. Both breads were pretty good. We both decided to select the five-course menu with wine pairings. First up were some goodies from the chef: a gin gelatin - MMMMMM (I'm a total gin fan), a Mojito gelatin - was awesome as well (my date dug this a bit more), and what I believe was Cointreau with some sort of bittersweet syrup. That we did not like as much. We were brought some lobster to start. From what I recall, the lobster came with some grapefruit and avocado. It was very light, the ingredients did not mask the mild taste of the lobster, which I liked. Next up were seared scallops with tomatoes surrounded with a vinaigrette. These were awesome - it was cooked perfectly. It pretty much melted in my mouth .... or i ate too quickly because it was too delicious. Regardless, my date and I felt this was the best of the five dishes. After that was some Turbot. This was pretty good. Not outstanding - but pretty good. Very mild taste again, which I like. We then had some veal. This was very good as well. Cooked to perfection, the surrounding sauce went very well with it. Mmm... getting hungry now just thinking about it.... Up last was the kalamansi gelee. Seeing that I'm Filipino - I'm all about the kalamansi. My date however, didn't really enjoy the overly acidic taste to it. Whatever. Her loss. I loved the contrast with the coconut milk. I'm not a huge fan of white wine - but they all seemed to match well with the foods. Of course, my date had a different opinion as she doesn't like acidic wines all that much. Service was awesome, food was awesome, everything was awesome. So ya ... the place is awesome. Bring a date, or a few friends, and enjoy the wonderful food and drinks at Providence!

Maybe it was the wrong night. Maybe it was that they didn't offer any better bubbly by the glass than Tattinger. I found the experience to be over-produced. I also felt that I was really just paying for ten people to fuss over me throughout the evening. The 5-course tasting menu started with the Amuse Bouche: Yes, I know it takes a lot of technical expertise to get the grapefruit margarita inside a thin ravioli and have it resemble a dew drop. Somehow, though, the trio of the vodka gelee, margarita ravioli, and trout in a shot glass garnished with caviar and gold didn't speak to me. The Japanese Kanpachi was subtle, and the the flavors were well balanced, but I was not blown away. The Maine Sea Scallop was nicely prepared. Again, I just was not blown away. I found the Pacific Halibut too salty, and the vegetables did not harmonize well with the fish. The veal tenderloin was tasty enough, but I didn't want finish it and try to scrape up every last drop of sauce. I think what did it for me was that I had no desire to eat the Yazu curd, meringue, and blackberry sorbet. For me to not eat the dessert... I didn't walk away feeling that my senses were satisfied. The presentation was elegant, but the flavors of the food did not hold up to my expectations. The wine pairings were average. The highlight was the 2007 San Giacomo Pinot. I'd like a little less of everything else and a little more soul in the food.

All I can say is WOW!  The hottie and I went to Providence many moons ago.  It was our first tasting menu together and we were wowed by the food there.  Ever since we've pretty much measured all of the other tasting menus against Providence.  For our 2 year anniversary I decided to take the hottie back to Providence to see what Michael Chimarusti was up to .  We ordered the full tasting menu again and again it was da bomb!  Here is the review. Started out with an amuse buche cocktail.  They served a mojito frozen geleee on a spoon and also a screw driver in an egg shaped gelatin on a spoon.  Both were delissshhhh.  Next amuse buche was a puff with a shot of carrot soup.  The puff was nice and salty and the shot of carrot soup was rich and creamy. First course was the kanpachi.  Nice, refreshing way to start the meal.   Second course was sea urchin in an egg shell.  One of the best things I've ever had.  The beurre blanc was so rich and tasty perfectly compliment for the sea urchin.  Only complaint is that it was too small... wish there was more. Third course was a sea scallop.  I love scallops and this was no exception.  Went great with the beets and almonds and brown butter. Fourth course was a halibut with toasted sesame seed crust.  Probably the best halibut I've ever had.  The fish was tender and flaky and the toast sesame seeds added so much flavor to the halibut.  Great dish. Fifth course was trout with crispy pork belly.  The trout was seared so it was raw on the inside.  Served with some crisp skin.  Not sure the cherry sauce added anything though. Sixth course was the veal tenderloin.  The best veal I've ever had!  So tender and flavorfull.  Everything on the plate went well with the veal from the daikon to the chantrelles to the jus to the foam to the cherry tomatoes to the pea sprouts.  If its on the regular menu you got to get this! Seventh course was a cheese plate.  Awesome!  Waitress brought out a cheese cart with about 20 different cheeses on it.  The hottie loves stinky cheeeses so they waitress picked out 6 different types of cheese for us.  Included was some raisin bread with apricot and apple jams, figs, and candied walnuts.  It was really fun trying all the different cheeses.  Some good and some bad but lots of fun! Eighth course was grapefruit sorbet and yogurt cream.  Yum! Ninth course was chocolate creameaux.  This was the only course that I found to be average.   Service was top notch and everything was first class.  So what are you waiting for?

FANCY!  Fine dining in a sub-par neighborhood.  This place is all seafood American style.  If you are not into seafood and American cuisine take your $150-175 somewhere else.  That was the bill for 2 people including tip (2 apps, 2 entree, 2 desserts, 2 non-alcoholic drinks). This is a nice date place.  Nice atmosphere, low noise level, very attentive serivce.   Food is extremely well prepared and nicely plated.  Good flavor and the seafood is fresh.  Even though I liked the food I really can't remember it because I was on a 2nd date (it was a bad date).  I think I need to go back and try it again with someone who doesn't tell me their diet consists of Diet Cokes and eating at fast food joint.

Nicest and best restaurant I have ever been to.  Period.  Lovely decor inside, amazing food.  They offered us a free sashimi sample as something they were planning on adding to the menu, they wanted our opinion on what we thought.  We also got tuna carpaccio or something, which was super delicious. Everything was amazingly delicious!  The service was top notch, sort of a French/Asian Fusion type of thing going on in here.  My only complaint is that while everything looks great on the inside, it's located in a semi-shady part of town where you have to walk around conspicuously in your fancy attire.  Such is LA...

All of June, Providence has a special on their 5-course tasting menu. It's usually $85, but they've dropped it to $65 for June. We went for this deal and brought friends, and just as it was for our previous outing, everything was just perfect. Food was delicious and the waiters are genuinely friendly and helpful and do what they can to ensure you enjoy your Providence experience. We started with cocktails - I highly recommend The Last Stand. The menu consisted of an amuse trio (gin and tonic gelee, a martini bubble that bursts in your mouth, and what I think was some yellowtail sashimi with creme fresh and salmon roe and something crispy - this was amazing). Then the courses were kanpachi sashimi, scallop (perfectly cooked), halibut, veal (sous vide) and yuzu curd meringue (a perfect ending to a perfect meal). I really couldn't have asked for anything more. The dishes are small, but by the time I got to the veal, I was already so full that I couldn't finish it. I shared a single wine-pairing (for an extra $35) with my husband, which paired beautifully with the food. After the meal the final plate of marzipan, chocolate marshmallow and a piece of salty caramel was delivered to our table. Apparently Providence now makes and sells their own chocolates and we got a box. I haven't made it through the entire box yet, but I cannot wait to try the rooibos tea or the apricot saffron among others. Once again Providence, you did not disappoint - we will certainly be back. Hopefully sometime soon to try the chef's tasting menu at the chef's table.

Only come here after you have tasted what you believe was your "best" fine dining experience. Trust me, this will be your new BEST fine dining experience! There are simply no words that can describe my experience at Providence. Everything was decadent, delicious, and down right elegant.

Bottom Line: 3.5 stars, mixed feelings, may give it another try someday My husband and I visited Providence years ago, so this is a long overdue review.  However, we still talk about the experience and how disappointed we were.  We really wanted to love Providence b/c of the amazing reviews and reputation, but were unfortunately underwhelmed by the experience.   We did a tasting menu and were also suckered into adding an a la carte black truffle risotto.  On a positive note, it was a very generous portion of truffle (just wish it was white, :D).  It was all way too much food for us and the a la carte pushed us over the edge.   The presentation was absolutely beautiful, but the flavors were mediocre (sometimes bland, sometimes strange).  I did enjoy a couple of the courses but overall was not that impressed. I think the problem was that this place was so hyped up...I expected it to be a mind-blowing experience.   The atmosphere was a little stuffy, but the people were friendly enough.  As for the price, it was outrageous for such a mediocre experience.  We prefer the tastings at places like Sona (sadly shuttered) and Hatfields...maybe we're just suckers for the richer French flavors.

I've had better food, but the service was definitely top notch.  While the Alaskan King Grab Risotto Appetizer was pretty damn good, it was in no possible way worth $60.  We had some serious entrees, but the appetizer was the most expensive thing on the bill! Would be interesting to come back and try the 15 course chef's menu with wine pairing. As a sidenote, I felt like the other patrons were really kindof lame.  Reminded me of people with too much loot and not much taste.

I should have written this review sooner, but for one reason or another I never got a chance to. We had the chef's menu (14 courses, I believe) - $175 / $260 with wine pairing for our 9th anniversary.  The dishes were hit or miss, but the once that were good were absolutely fantastic (I seem to recall that there was an uni dish that I absolutely loved).  The wine pairing was superb and completely enhanced each dish.  The service was slightly on the casual side -- not too casual, but I prefer more formality when it comes to fine dining.   If you are thinking of the 14 course meal, brace yourself -- it is quite an undertaking.  In fact, around course 10, I found myself incredibly full and found it near impossible to continue.

Maybe just an off-night, but Providence felt like a poor showing of "the Best LA has to offer". The atmospherics were excellent, and despite a few blunders, the service was generally very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. We opted for the full tasting. The amuse was whimsical and created anticipation for the meal, but the next 4 courses (fish) were disappointing. Konpachi was good - but nothing inspirational. Lobster and Scallop dishes were horribly overcooked, and halibut slightly so. Flavors were good, but nothing revelatory like TFL or Coi.  Best dishes were Pork Belly for the BF (but hard to screw that up) and Fried Squash Blossoms for me (again, hard to screw up).  Dessert was a mess, all over the place.  Miso Cheesecake with shiso leaf would have been okay by itself -- but then the sorbet & peaches and sesame crumble came out of nowhere and didn't mesh at all. Redeeming factors were a truly excellent cheese plate (do NOT miss out on the Rogue River blue!), and consistently good wine pairings with each course.  And the Mignardises - Sarsaparilla gelee & caramel with salt flakes inside?  woot. Hard to imagine that this is the best (non-Sushi) food that LA has to offer.  Not as good as many 1-star quality restaurants in SF or Boston.

I was so excited when my bf pulled up here and suprised me for my birthday dinner. I have been wanting to go to this restaurant forever, I have heard such amazing things about it and couldn't wait to try it out. Everything we tried last night was better than I could have imagined, this is definitely one of the best dinners I've had! The staff, from the hostess, the sommelier, the waiter, the host, everyone was on point last night. As nice as the restaurant is it did not have a pretentious vibe to it at all. Everyone was very knowledgeable about the food and wine and were extremely friendly. Like I mentioned, the food was amazing from start to finish. The amuse bouche that they brought us was a great start to an amazing meal and was a preview to the quality of food that was to come. We shared the Foie Gras Ravioli as an appetizer. The waiter mentioned that this was the only thing on the menu that has been there since the restaurant opened. I can see why!!! The waiter brought us each a dish with three small raviolis in it and then a man came over with a glass case holding a huge black truffle which he grated over the ravioli. This dish was amazing, so rich and buttery but not overwhelming. This was one of my favorite foie gras preperations I've ever had. I only wish there was more. My bf and I joked that we wish we could lick the plate clean. For our main course I had the Prime New York Steak and my bf had the Wild Striped Bass on recommendation from our sommelier. They were both delicious. The steak was cooked beautifully and very tender. It was topped with pieces of bone marrow, shaved truffle, vegetables, and duck fat potato. It all worked so well together, and was actually quite filling. Even the vegetables were delicious. They give you a good amount of bone marrow too. My bf was very happy with his striped bass and from the bit I had it was cooked perfectly. Our dessert was my bf's favorite part of the meal and I was very impressed with it also. It was a dulce de leche panna cota with blueberry mousse I believe, and home made rice crispy treats. It was a great texture with the creamy panna cotta and the crunch of the rice crispy treats, also not too sweet, nothing too rich. It was a great end to a perfect dinner. The restaurant has a modern and classy feel to it, romantic and the tables aren't super close together like some places. I would definitely say that this is one of the best restaurants in LA and a great place to take any foodie for a special occasion.

Oh yeah. Providence is one of the best restaurants in Los Angeles and Chef Michael Cimarusti was chosen to compete in Top Chef Masters for good reason. This was my second visit to Providence. This time, it was just my husband and I for his birthday. It also served as kind of a farewell LA tour of the best in food. We had an early reservation last Monday night for a few reasons: 1.) it was my husband's actual birthday 2.) we got 1,000 point reservation on OpenTable 3.) They have no corkage fees on Monday nights! BONUS! BONUS! BONUS! We splurged and got the nine-course tasting menu. So. Good. The menu consisted of the same things Justin H. mentioned in his review. (0) amuse bouche: gin and tonic gelee, mojito ravioli, carrot puree (1) Japanese Kampachi (2) Sea urchin and egg served in egg shell (3) Seared scallops (4) Halibut with shiso (5) Salmon with gingered carrot juice (6) Veal tenderloin (7) Cheese plate (8) Pre-dessert cucumber sorbet (9) miso cheesecake with black sesame puree and crust. To be honest, I was a little nervous about the Sea Urchin and Egg, considering I've only had sea urchin once, and swore that it was one of the few foods I really DON'T like. Wow...Providence  COMPLETELY changed that! It was hands down, by far, the BEST dish of the night! I was blown away. Of course, presentation was amazing and service was spot on most of the time. The only exception was that there was a noticeable gap between the 8th and 9th course. They also didn't offer coffee until after we had dessert. We would've preferred to have it WITH dessert if we could muster the energy to have it. Everything was uber fresh, inventive and tasty. The only thing I didn't care for was the miso cheesecake...I didn't really enjoy the flavors, and by the end of 9-courses, I was jam packed, put a fork in me, full. Talk about being stuffed, but it was definitely worth it. If you haven't enjoyed the fine dining experience at Providence, you must go. Now. I recommend taking advantage of the bonuses of 1000 point OpenTable reservations (you will be the first in the dining room, but your dining experience will be long, and it quickly fills up) and Monday night no corkage fees.

Overall rating is 3.5 stars.  Disappointing! Atmosphere: 4/5 Food : 4/5 who can suspect the Michelin 2 star restaurant quality? Service:1/5 We went to LA for 2 full days having a very high hope/expectation to try this `top 5 LA restaurant'.  I admit we reserved the table last minutes but think god still managed to get a table at 9:45pm. However, after we got there,...waiting and waiting and start feeling more hungry and then guess what? we were set at 10pm (no offer of water, want you buy drinks at the bar instead while waiting). Here it came the nightmare:  the server said NO tasting menu cos we sat down after 10? what? what??? Open Table didn't metnion limited menu only after 10, the host didn;'t say that when we walked in??? this is the MAIN thing I want there and you said NO??? it is already 10pm what else i can do?? Grabbed a donut at convenient store?? I felt my great mood got cool down by half, finally still ordered two appetizers and two entrees,  Honesly they are all great, nicely presented, top grade ingredients ( this made me even more mad that i can't try their tasting menu!!!) Service is the horrible part, we were offered one piece of bread throught the eintire dinner until we asked to request more.  Water wasn't refilled in timely manner.  I was so turned down that finally i even passed my favorite dessert cos i was so damn pissed.  I feel the server should ask us more questions to ensure the dinner went great and all our concerns were taken care of. I hope this place realize they are selling entire dining experience (food+atmosphere+service). Great food isn't enough especially you guys are pusing $300+ bottle of wine !!

Wow.  Effing ayy..... WOW....  Btw... WOW....  Its not hype....this place is THAT good.  Such a treat to have a place like this in so cal... SO THIS IS WHY CIMARUSTI put Downtown's Water Grill on the map.... HOLY MOLY. 1.  Amuze Bushe:  A spoon (?) of chopped up fish belly from (forgot the name) marinated with citrus and a shot of Cold Fennel Soup.  This was the only avg. dish all night.  The fish was ever so slightly "fishy" and left an interesting after taste.  The Fennel Soup had a clean citrus almost sour like finish.   2.  Bread Basket:  Freshly baked   Brioche w/ Bacon, Brioche w/ Chives, and Ciabatta.....  Ok.... Brioche w/ Smokey Bacon was Genius.  So good... 3.  Tuna Tare Tare (special of the night):  WOW.... the gelatinous sauce was awesome.  Tuna tasted like it was just fished outta the water in a matter of minutes.  Great, but i've had better. 4.  Japanese Kampachi:  Excellent.  The flavors were so clean and fresh.  Kampachi melted in your mouth.  Sea Beans were perfect.   The most amazing part was the dried after taste of a salted fish.  Similar to a home made chinese "hom yu"....it was amazing.... Top it off with creme fraiche and the dried ginger.....WOW 5.  The Chowda~  A mound of potatoes, clams, EFFING DELICIOUS BACON, chives, and seasonings.... all in a small soup bowl... AND then the clam creme broth drizzled on top.... dude.... can i just tell you how good their bacon is in this soup..... Top 3 chowdas of all time... 6.  Lobster Rissotto~ Ok...when they say lobster, its not a teenie spoon of minced lobster....we're talking a heaping small tail of delicious lobster meat.  Rissotto was creamy, al dente, and perfect.  The foamy carrot  or orange puree thingy was a bit overpowering.  A dap here or there woulda been good.   Now i know why people are somewhat turned off by foam.... it should be for shaving....not eating.  But still a wonderful dish. 7.  Wild King Salmon for Her.  Prime NY Beef (nebraska) for moi.  Uhh.. yeah...I committed the ultimate sin.... BEEF in a seafood joint... Damn straight yo..... Surf and turf... Hell, I already had 4 dishes of seafood bliss.... why not take a stab at some corn fed nebraska fillet.  DiD NOT DISAPPOINT!  Perfectly cooked...when you say medium... that sucker is PERFECTLY COOKED!  The Wild Salmon was encrusted in this herb seasoning rub and perfectly cooked medium rare.... it melted in your mouth. 8.  Chocolate Ganache Cake w/ Horchata Ice Cream & Yu Zu Creme Fraiche Cheesecake.  Im not the best connoseiur of desserts...but these were off the charts.  Perfect compliment to an extraordinary dinner.   9.  Throw in a 2 coffees and after dinner cookies & mints.  NICE TOUCH.   Service was spot on, and very very thorough.  They dont miss a thing.  Plates and flat ware were always changed after each course.  Water and cocktails are constantly monitored.   Props to Providence.  You just moved into my number spot on my restaurant list.  Kudos!

So, my kid sis (the other family foodie) comes to visit from Boulder and I decide to take her to Providence for a treat. In past times, I have always had the full tasting, with great pleasure. This time we decided to go in  completely and have the chef's menu. She said it would be fun to not know what was coming down the pike. The waiter asked us if we had enough time, meaning three hours. People, it was more like four and that is a beautiful thing indeed. The reason I can write this up for y'all is that they were kind enough to print the menu up and hand copies to us in sealed envelopes. And here we go: Amuse 1: Sis had the mojito/greyhound/gin and tonic thing, and I was given a crab/tuna/fennel soup plate, as I am a teetotaler. As we chimed in, it was exactly what an amuse should do - it made the mouth water and want more. Amuse 2: Kanpachi belly, shiso, wasabi oil - less potent than the first, but a wonderful savory, spicy sashimi of beautifully cut fish. Uni, cauliflower parfait, crisy buckwheat, summer truffle - I love uni because as it's best, it tastes as if I were biting into the most perfect ocean breeze. The cauliflower was an unexpected, but totally welcomed foil to the roe. Hokaido scallops, persimmon puree, wasabi, pink grapefruit, watermelon radish - this had it all: savory, spicy, fruity, sour. Again, the persimmon and the scallop seemed and unlikely pairing to me, but was so perfectly suited. Japanese sword squid thai style, peanuts, mint, carrots, red curry - this was my least favorite of the entree dishes (the red curry just reminded me of srirracha sauce, but will say that the squid was cut perfectly like noodles). It was explained to us that this was the chef's take on a pad thai, and it should be noted that my sister really loved the textures and the flavor combination. Sweetbreads, almond, summer truffle, main lobster, jus de crustace - this was the first dish that almost made me lose my mind. A perfectly cooked sweetbread next to a perfectly cooked piece of lobster - forget about it! The consensus was taken when our eyes rolled back into our respective heads. Halibut, burdock, shiso, lemon - cooked exquisitely with those really nice Japanese flavors that brought out more the umami in the fish than might have been noted otherwise. Pork belly, kyoho grapes, pickled ramps, mizuna - Second lose-my-mind moment. The best little square of porcine butter in the world! Tai snapper, matustake mushrooms, rosemary - I have had tai a number of times in sushi (I miss Nikki at Azami! Sigh!), but this was my first cooked experience. Again, the rosemary with the fish was unexpected and really well suited. Freshwater eel, foie gras, shimeji mushrooms, truffle fondue - Third mind-losing experience, and by far, the evening's winner. Come on, really - read this combo again. How could you ever, ever lose? Lamb shoulder and saddle, carrot puree, vadouvan, spring onion, roasted baby carrots - I have become accustomed to having some sort of beef course at Providence as part of the tasting ritual, but the lamb was a welcomed newcomer. Served rare appropriately with a sauces that really accentuated the meat's quality. Cheese cart - Wow! All I can remember is that we had a somewhat soft cheese made of water buffalo's milk, a really good aged cheddar, a nice stinky-rindy blue, and a Haystack Mountain goat from Colorado. The water buffalo was not my fave, but the others were superb. Sis liked that the fact that the goat tasted like the farm (!) and I loved the cheddar paired with the apple jam that was served as an accompaniment. Palate cleanser: Celery sorbet, apples, and almonds - a really nice clean treat that did not merely taste like some Cel-Ray tonic or a relish tray! 1st dessert: Kalamansi gelee, white chocolate soy milk soup, litchi-shiso sorbet - almost like a fancy halo-halo. Yummy. 2nd dessert: Sous-vide jonalicious apple, barley ice cream, pine nut puree, north star dried cherries - not my favorite, mostly because I am not a fan of the traditional fall/winter holiday dessert spices. Mind you, I ate every bite with nary a wince. 3rd dessert - Burnt caramel ice cream, chocolate, ginger bread, pears. The dessert winner for me. I think that all ice cream should be served with "crumbly" things underneath it for life. I was in heaven. Petit fours: barley caramels, espresso truffles, and olive oil gelees - the caramels won, but at this point, it was a bit of a struggle to even eat one of these puppies. Whew! And although it sort of broke the bank, it was worth every penny and every moment. One thing about the staff. For the most part, they seem to be really adept in meeting the individual customers where they are at. We were relaxed and fun. They were relaxed and fun without missing a beat throughout the entire service. Lesson learned: save your pennies and do the chef's menu. Seriously. I am really open to having this experience again when the time arises.

This is a pretty classy place. My review on the other hand, not so much. But you'll get the jist. Granted, I only came here for the dessert tasting menu. But it's cool that you can walk in to a place like this in your normal clothes, sit at the bar, and enjoy a three course tasting menu that will blow your mind. Highly recommend. Highlights include: corn tortilla ice cream! DO ITTTTTTTT

You know what, after visiting 2 other Michelin 1 star restaurants, Providence comes way way ahead. Yup the service was a bit condescending from the guy, but the whole staff except him, including the sommelier and the GM were wonderful. The GM/co-owner of this place is so inspiring to the people who work in this industry. Thank you so much for the encouraging email! Yup, 5 stars!

A very well-deserved 2-star rating from Michelin. Most restaurants in Los Angeles are usually overrated as they care more about the ambiance than the food, but I'm glad Providence was able to execute in every dimension. Our dining experience here was probably one of the best dining experiences I had in LA. The restaurant is situated in a very unassuming place off of Melrose. It looks like it was once a motel? But the area is slightly residential with the valet drop-off station near a couple apartment complexes. But when you walk in, you're totally somewhere else. The menu is interesting - the chef's specialty is clearly seafood. I don't think I've been anywhere where there's a 12-course meal followed by an 8-course dessert. Anyone who does both probably will not eat for days. Food and service were great - I never had a liquid amuse bouche before - three different kinds of cocktails served like food - so beautifully executed. and oh so memorable. I definitely need to come back here. Didn't try their tasting menu yet but they do offer everything a la carte so makes it pretty flexible. But I think everyone at the table has to do the tasting menu if you want to try it so not very group-friendly.

Took my parents for their anniversary.  We ordered two 9-course tastings (for me and my father) and a 5-course for my mom.  We also ordered three santa barbara spotted prawns (which were AWESOME!!!! and a must order any/everytime you go there!).  It was just incredible from beginning to finish.  I loved the service.  As many have repeatedly said, their service was exceptional.  I felt like I got more returns on every penny I paid that night. I'm glad my parents' anniversary offered an excuse to go.  Now having experienced providence, i think any reason's a good reason to go ("it's a monday!"). Had a chance to check out the kitchen and meet the chef/owner Michael.  Eventhough it was really busy he was very friendly and really wanted to know how we enjoyed our meals.   We had a great time. Tho next time i go, i'mma hold off on breads.  I think i ate too many of them (since they are soooooooo incredibly delicious), and towards the end of my 9 course, i was dying to finish the last dessert plate.  Sad, i know.  Truly sad.  I mean how am i supposed to take on the 15course chef's tasting, if i can barely finish the 9course?

Yes, this is about as good as it gets here in LA.  It's tucked away in an area of Hollywood on Melrose where you wouldn't expect a restaurant of this caliber to be in, but maybe that's what makes it kind of magical. Everything about the menu was sensational and next time, we're going to try the chef tasting menu.  What we had wasn't necessarily mind blowing dishes on paper [NY Strip and Striped Sea Bass], but it's the execution of the ingredients that really makes each dish cohesive, imaginative, and thoughtful.  The decor is modern and unpretentious, but has class. The pastry chef even tried a bit of humor on the dessert menu with the chocolate ganache with chocolate covered pretzels byt having the phrase, "These pretzels are making me thirsty!", a homage to the famous line spoken by Kramer on Seinfeld.  I commented on that and the waiter said I was one of the very few that got the joke and he would pass it along to the pastry chef.  Alas, no freebies for being a Seinfeld fanatic [darn!]. Nonetheless, a great, great restaurant here in LA.

Wow.  I loved this place. First of all, we didn't have reservations and they were booked, but they did find a table for us and we only waited 5 or 10 minutes until we were seated.  I ordered the Asian Pear Martini which was so delicious.  They brought us this soup in a shot glass and a mini puff pastry which were so savory and light that it was actually an experience. We ordered 1/2 dozen oysters and the dungeness crab as our appetizers.  Perfect.  I had the lobster and he had the steak.  Amazing.  We were too full for dessert (and buzzed from the 6 Asian Pear Martinis).  However, the chef sent us a trio of mini dessert tastings anyway on the house as a sweet kiss good bye. Thank you, Providence.  You're like a hot, high class hooker.  Made my dreams come true and, though may be expensive, worth every penny and more.

I went here yesterday and let me tell you it was quite an experience. I heard of this place from a friend of mine who is a chef and highly reccomended the restaurant. I didn't know what to expect, except that it was fine dining. This is my firstexperience dining in this type of establishment so I was quite impressed the momment we walked in. The outside of the building is quite non-descript... you can easily pass it by as you drive down Melrose. There is a valet service but it is located on Cole Ave. The front of the restaurant looked real empty when me and my girlfriend arrived. The heavy-set door looked imposing and it gave a feeling that it wanted to keep people out rather than invite them inside. Once inside, we were in for an experience! We had reservations for 8:30pm, but they sat us down at 8:15pm. The lighting in the restaurant was a bit dim, but it added more to the whole feeling that we were in our own world. Our server for the evening was Robert and he took his time explaining the menu and wine lists. I'm a light wine drinker and so is my girlfriend, we have very little background in wine tasting, but still Robert was kind enough to explain the differences of each wine my girl was interested in. At the end we chose Gerwurtztraminer hugel, a white wine. As for our meal we tried the Full Tasting menu thats 9 course meal $125/person. I think it was $180 with a wine pairing. A bit more than what I'm used to eating, but since it was a special occaison.. we went for the gusto! The first plate that came out was mango-gelee, white coconut soy milk soup in a shot glass, and litchi sorbet cube. All of these items had light liquor in them so it wasn't overpowering. The soy milk soup was the best! Not bad to start off the evening. First course was Tuna Tartare. Everything here worked well together; nori crackers, wasabi, tartare sauce... perfect. Second course was Sea Urchin in a poached egg. I've tried sea urchin before but not like this and inside a poached egg! Third course was Scallops with foam, nappa cabbage and buckwheat. Food foam (or so I called it) is part of a lot of the dishes we had tonite. I loved the plating. Fourth course was Striped Sea Bass with lemon, cannellini beans, and butter. I loved this dish.. the fish was perfect for me. The lemons and butter were a hit! But my girl did not like this, she felt it was too "fishy" and she hates beans. Fifth course was Sea Trout with fennel, beets, orange, with foam. They crisped the skin of the trout and served that on top of it. It reminded me of chicharones.... This was a MISS for the both of us. I'm not too keen on sweet entrees and I felt the beets were too overpowering. Also on my girls dish the trout was not filetted properly and there were three fish bones on her dish. We complained about the dish to the staff there, but more on that later. Sixth course was Veal Medalion with radish, mushrooms, and trouffle fondue. FINALLY a meat dish! And what a dish it was... the veal was easy to cut, the meat was quite tender and flavorful, and that trouffle sauce was amazing. Seventh course was a Cheese Platter. I forgot the name of the guy serving us the cheeses, but it was a tray filled with various cheeses. We knew nothing about different types and textures so he offered to give us a sampling of cheeses. We sampled three types of cheese; Sheep (hard), Goat (medium), and Cow (soft). I would have to say that I care very little for the Sheep cheese... it was too pungent and hard for my liking. The Goat cheese was you average cheese that I'm sure most of us will be familar with once you tasted it. But the Cow cheese was quite delicious... it was soft, creamy, and light. Almost brie-like. Eight course was Lemon Sorbet with tarragon and yogurt. I'm not a fan of lemon and it was quite strong for me, but my girl reccomeded I take in more of the yogurt and it was a lot better. My least favorite of the courses. She loved it though! Ninth Course is Banana Bread Pudding with barley ice cream. I love bananas! And this was a perfect way to end the meal. They served the banana and bread pudding separately with a small spoonful of ice cream. Surprisingly I was quite full by the end of the meeal and my girl was already full from the 4th course, but like a trooper she marched on! The only bad thing I have to say about the restaurant is the Trout dish we had 5th course. While my dish was flawless, hers was not. I can understand that sometimes chef's will miss these things and while it may not be a big deal in lower-end restaurants. I feel that is is unacceptable in high-end restaurants. BUT, the restaurant did redeem themselves. At the end of our meal, the manager came out and apologized on behalf of the restaurant and the chefs. They even gave us a box of chocolates that is normally valued at $28 as well. Overall, I will come here again... and maybe this time try the Chef Tasting menu!

hard to say much else when most of the other reciews have said all that could be said of Providence, an amazing restaurant with great food and perfect service.  From the knowledgeable sommeliers and cheese mongers who make the right choices to the perfect plating of the courses I was thoroughly impressed.  My group decided to go with the full tasting menu which was the perfect amount of food for a big eater like me.  Some highlights for me werw the sea trout course and the uni and egg course.  I would come back in a heartbeat if i could afford to on such a regular basis.

The wife and I went here, because when we travel we like to "taste" the best a city has to offer. That day, we thought we'd try a restaurant some friends recommended, especially when we heard that it wasn't uncommon to have stars seated next to you. We ordered the full 9 course tasting. When the courses started arriving, I was a bit uneasy at how tiny the portions were, albeit with excellent presentation.... However, by the time the 7th course rolled around, I was getting full. Of the nine dishes, the most memorable are the scallops, the ravioli, and some of the fishes. There was maybe a dish or two that I was dissapointed with, but overall, I enjoyed the experience.

Providence is expensive. And I am suspicious of most expensive restaurants in LA, as they tend to charge premium prices without delivering a premium experience. The first time I went to Providence, I ordered off the standard menu. In objective terms, it was excellent, but I didn't enjoy it more than e.g. a meal at the Hungry Cat, which is considerably less expensive. Not worth it --- the meal was less memorable than the bill. The second time I went, I ordered the nine-course tasting menu. This was beyond excellent -- it was epic and spectacular and unlike any meal I've ever had. Even more expensive, of course, but this time the meal was good enough to make me forget the price. So if you're going to Providence --- go all the way.

Disappointing. For a Michelin star restaurant, I believe the food, service and ambience should all be amazing.  I've been to Jean Georges, Le Bernardin and Daniel and these are truly deserved Michelin star restaurants. I'll start with the positives.  First, the bartender is excellent.  I have not seen so much focus and meticulous attention to a cocktail in a long time.  Second, the cooked fish dishes are excellent. The majority of the reviews are on the "orgasmic" band wagon and there are so many negatives that I feel should be mentioned. The dining room and table setting are bland.  The walls are bare with mushrooms growing out of the corners.  You will not be wowed. The servers were all nice but the service was amateurish.  Napkins were not replaced or folded upon leaving the chair.  My empty cocktail glass remained on the table nearly the entire meal and it would have been there the entire meal had we not scooted it to the far corner.  The butter dish was empty the entire meal and was neither removed nor replaced.  The dishes were presented and taken away based on wherever it seemed convenient for the waiter, which was sometimes reaching across the table.  At least three random people were serving us food which included the sommelier.  He would be describing a wine at one table then serving us a dish the next minute.  Surprisingly, the valet didn't come in and serve a dish. After reading all the great reviews, we opted for what we felt would be the best and the most representative of Chef Cimarusti.  This was also the most expensive item on the menu, The Chef's Tasting Menu at $160 per person.   The amuse signature Cocktail Spheres were more a science experiment than gourmet.  This was neither fresh nor of quality.  Our next 3 courses were the Kanpachi, Uni Custard and Hog Island Oyster Shot.  These were passed off as three individual courses.  I've seen web postings of these served in exactly the same portion on one plate as a single course.  Passing these off as individual courses was a bit dishonest.  The Uni Custard obviously came from the fridge and was steamed egg boring.  The Hog Island Oyster Shot was putrid smelling.  I'm sure the oyster was fresh at one point but with the time taken to put it in the gelee etc...the oyster was not happy.  Seriously smell before eating this one. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Next came the Tuna Tartare which was flavorless and was drying out, likely another dish previously plated and sitting in the fridge.  Finally, to top off the evening, the dessert was amazingly horrible.  Two dice size pieces of chocolate cake with a dollop of foam on top and an olive size serving of ice cream rolled in chocolate like powder next to a few not so fresh melon balls.  Seriously, did the pastry chef really come up with this masterpiece? http://www.yelp.com/biz_… This is really disappointing if this is considered the upper echelon of dining in Los Angeles.  If you do go, I recommend drinks at the bar and ordering just the cooked fish a la carte.  Do not spend $160 on the above.

This will be a feat since I'm reviewing a meal I had here over a year ago.  Luckily I hung on to the menu and still have pictures on my phone to help jog my awful memory. Date:  1/23/09 Location:  Kitchen Dining Room Menu:  Chef's Greyhound, Mojito, Gin and Tonic - This was probably my first time having something resembling molecular gastro.  Each cocktail was in it's own gelee which burst immediately in your mouth.  I don't drink but these were a nice and refreshing. Parsnip Soup / Soy-Coffee Syrup & Scallop Targare-Rice Cracker - Scallop was extraordinary.  Very fresh and sweet.  The shot of soup was a little different.  The soy-coffee syrup gave it an almost bbq sauce like flavor. Kanpachi , Chive, Caviar, Lemon - Had a healthy dollop of caviar.  As you can imagine the flavors were very clean, letting the ingredients shine. Uni, Cauliflower Parfait, Brioche, Black Truffle - Weird presentation that looked like a bug of some sorts.  The parfait didn't add much for me.  Could have taken that away and just gave me more uni. Kumamoto Oysters, Salsify Veloute, Almonds, Fino Sherry - This was nice.  I love kumamoto oysters and in this preparation, it was in a warm foam with the oyster at the bottom, which was slightly warm but not cooked. Cod, Burdock, Shiso, Lemon - At this point, I felt like Chef Cimarusti began to shine.  Perfectly cooked cod with the crispy skin.  Nice delicate foam/sauce which brought it together. Sweetbreads, Celery Root, Maine Lobster, Jus de Crustace - Deep fried sweetbreads paired with perfectly cooked lobster in a lobster broth?  Yum. Steelhead, Chantrelles, Leeks, Jurancon - Another perfectly cooked fish dish.  Nicely seared and crispy on the outside but entirely raw on the inside. Lamb Shoulder and Saddle, Petit Pois, Crosnes, bacon, Trompette de la Mort, Juliet Tomatoes - Originally the menu called for it's own fois dish but the chef decided not to serve it.  We still wanted fois so he added a nice seared piece on top of the lamb dish.  Absolutely decadent.  I'm also not a fan of lamb but I ate this one. Cheese Selection - Can't remember the ones we got.  There was one that was a little too pungent for our tastes but it the others were absolutely terrific.  Served with figs, walnuts and apricot preserves. Celery Sorbet, Apples & Almonds - Palette cleanser Kalamansi Gelee, White Chocolate Soy Soup, Litchi-Shiso Sorbet - This was nice and fresh.  The soup had tapioca balls in it. Sous-Vide Jonalicious Apple, Barley Ice Cream, Pine Nut Puree, North Star Dried Cherries - I don't remember thinking the apple was all that.  The barley ice cream was interesting. Chocolate Ganache, Peanut Butter, "These Pretzels Are Making Me Thirsty", Chambly Noire Ice Cream - This was a little too rich for me. Petit Fours - Too stuffed at this point. So all in all, this was one of the best tasting menus I've ever had.  Desserts are certainly not their strong suit.  Either that or I'm just not a dessert person but the rest of the menu more than made up for it. Definitely recommend sitting in the kitchen if you're willing to splurge on the Chef's menu.  Service was adequate but not exactly something to write home about.  I seem to recall having a shift in staff half way through which was a little confusing.  Chef Cimarusti came by at the end and was impressed that we were able to eat everything.  I wouldn't say he's the most personable guy but it was a nice touch (though kind of expected if you're sitting in the kitchen?). They had just received their 2nd Michelin star, which purely based on the food, was deserved. Tip:  Ample parking on the side street.

The most beautiful food I've ever ingested, for sure. Although they are known to be a seafood restaurant, they did not fail to deliver such charming, delicious, vegetarian food. Watching the bartender make a cocktail is so much fun.

My husband brought me here for my birthday 2 years ago... unfortunately we had stopped by the SLS first and by the time I got to Providence I was sauced up and the only thing I remembered was the delicious bacon bread. Embarrassing! Soooo... we came back this past Friday for another go at it. We went with the 5-course tasting menu with the wine pairings. Our reservation was at 9:30 but we got there a little early so we could grab a cocktail at the bar. I ordered a cucumber/mojito-style drink topped with champagne (very refreshing) and hubby ordered a bourbon-based drink with crushed blackberries at the bottom (unfortunately I don't remember the names). The first time we sat in the room on the left, but this time we sat in the room to the right, past the bar, with a nice view of the glass wine cellar. Ok, let's get on with the food =p Bacon bread was brought by, of course. Warm and delicious.. although the second time they brought it around you could tell they were getting repeatedly re-heated throughout the night. We really, really, really wanted to get the $80 truffle supplement, especially since the waiter brought by the box and let us smell the little bundles of joy... but we controlled ourselves. The amuse bouche consisted of a little block of iced mojito, a bubbly bubble that tasted like grapefruit, and smoked salmon with some creme fraiche in a cup with some crunchy sesame seed balls and gold leaf on top ;) Kanpachi: Yum. Enjoyed it very much... especially the crispy rice crackers. Bobbys Block Island Sea Scallops: I'm not a huge fan of scallops because very often they can be rubbery, but these were plump, juicy and delicious. Halibut: Buttery and delicious.... it also had mussels which were delightful. On the menu it says John Dory but I guess that night they had halibut. Marcho Farms Veal Tenderloin: H E A V E N. Sous-vide so we prob didn't need a knife to cut it.. it just melted in our mouths... buttery, pink and delicious... It was too good to be true. I wanted to wrap myself in it and use it as a pillow. Ahhhhh! Cheeses: Delish. Banana Bread Pudding: I'm usually not a bread pudding fan but I had to take a few bites of my husband's. It was a very original dish. It had a sous-vide banana (wow), a rectangular piece of bread pudding and the barley ice cream... delicious! Extra Sweets: Bons bons and macarons. This was the only disappointment of the night. I adoreeee macarons, so I picked it up and put it in my mouth without thinking... and almost choked on it. It was hard as a rock, no joke. All in all it was an enjoyable meal... the service is OK... not as polished as most 2-star Michelins, but the ambiance is nice and cozy and the food was original and delicious.

This restaurant is for SEAFOOD fans only.  I'm really not a big seafood enthusiast or a crustacean enthusiast.  I don't enjoy things that have been crawling on the bottom of the seabed eating all the dirt, residue and waste material dropped by other organisms and by humans.  No.  But I do enjoy dining at a fine dining establishment because of the care that they take while preparing and constructing each dish. Also, I love to be pampered, surprise surprise.  I'm a girl who lives well.  I wasn't handed this lifestyle, I took it for myself. It was my BF birthday and THIS time, it was my job to treat HIM.  So being a loving, doting, GF, I treated him to a dinner at Providence.  He was enjoying himself but I think he was tiring of eating at fine dining establishments.  Instead of ordering the Prix Fixe menu like we usually do, he opted for just ordering one main entree Item.  I was VERY surprised and he simply said that he was just not that hungry.  The staff at this restaurant seemed surprised as well but they didn't mind.  Whatever they lost in padding the bill with extra fees, we made up for in our choice of wine.  Instead of a $480 bill at the end like our experience at Melisse, it was $240 for the two of us.  Not bad. A on SERVICE.  After we ordered our entrees the service personnel pretty much disappeared.  Maybe they checked on us once.  They came to our table only to pour the wine.  I felt like they were attentive but not as attentive as Melisse in Santa Monica. B+ on FOOD.  The portions were big, well big for a restaurant in this class.  It could have been smaller portions but with food that had more flavor.  They need to use more salt & pepper. A on FOOD & WINE PAIRINGS. A on Valet service. Would we come here again?  No.

Food: Good Drinks: Good Service: Excellent Ambiance: Semi-Formal Portions: Average Facility Type: Fine Dining Cuisine: Seafood (Contemporary) Price: Moderate-High Parking: Street Parking next to valet parking lot, or Valet What I've tried: 5 course tasting menu $85/$120 with wine pairing per person Japanese kanpachi: Below Average. So fishy, I could only eat one bite. Bobbys block island sea scallops: Very Good Wild Pacific Halibut: Average White Fish (off menu to substitute veal): Average Dulce de leche-miso panna cotta (to substitute banana bread pudding): Average.  To sweet for my taste. Pumpkin Polenta ($12): Very Good.  Unique. Overall, Providence is good, but not very impressive.  I've had way better seafood elsewhere for less. 3.75 Stars

I came to Providence for me and my boyfriend's 4 year anniversary. We found street parking but the area is very sketchy. I'm not sure if it's safe to walk around at night. However, the restaurant decor is very modern. The bartender made up a virgin cocktail for me with fresh pomegranate. It was very refreshing. I ordered the 5-course meal ($95) and I added the Fois Gras ravioli with truffle sauce ($35). My boyfriend ordered the 9-course meal with wine pairing ($180). Everything was excellent. All the flavors of each dish were unique and blended well together. Most dishes had some sort of puree sauce with something crunchy sprinkled on top. The dishes that stood out were the scallops, my boyfriend's Sea Urchin dish (it doesn't come with the 5-course) and the Fois Gras ravioli. I was so full by the end that I had to get my beef tenderloin dish and my boyfriend's cheese plate packed to go. The staff is very attentive. Each table had several servers who explained each dish and glass of wine. Most of the wines with the wine pairing are white. My boyfriend likes reds so I think that was a little disappointing. I will probably come back for another special occasion and just order a la carte since I've already tried the tasting menu.

The 5-course meal was a 3.5 stars for me. Yes, everything tasted good and it was prepared perfectly but nothing was mind blowing. My husband and I got a 5-course at Michael Mina Bellagio and every bite was insane. So, I admit I had high expectations. My favorite dish was the scallop dish and my least favorite was the veal. The staff was excellent and didn't make me feel uncomfortable by being pretentious. Also, it was cool that we were sitting next to five celebrity chefs/hosts from Food Network! I wish I have had the balls to ruin their dinner and get a picture-autograph with them~~~ I give 5 stars to certain items I fell in love with: 1. Amuse Bouche 2. Dessert ice cream 3. After dinner Macaron 4. Cocktails: Try the Wonderland 5. Weingut Keller Dalsheimer Hubacker Riesling Auslese 2006  (recommended by the sommelier) I will definitely go again and re-review. BUT next time I'm getting the Chef's Menu. I think that's where the WOW factor is.

In General... There are only a few restaurants in Los Angeles that push the limit and exibit tendacies of perfection, Providence is one of them.  It's hard to judge a restaurant like this on a one time experience for the food is in constant flux and rotation.  With not only the seasons of change but with the farmers who make it all happen.  The tasting menu alone changes at least once a week.  But the food exibits just plain good cooking.  Anything PORK BELLY or FOIE GRAS.  is always masterfully presented with all the foams and purees you could think of.  As of 07 Summer the Pork Belly comes with apricot puree made like a jam. salsify and mizuna greens... the foie comes with rhubarb at least three of four ways.  But if  one looks outside the elements of food science, you find very precise and creative cookery. The seafood and shellfish remain the center of this restaurant and within the SALMON. TUNA. SNAPPER . HALIBUT.  LOBSTER. BASS.  SCALLOP  shine on a pedastal while the mix of steak, duck, foie, pork belly,  veal. kobe. batarga. and condiments of the sea... caviar and uni.  All accompanied with a farmers market driven menu and a mad scientist at the helm, you will be satisfied and impressed to say the least.  The food - the service... is impeccable and what you will find here is a michelin caliber restaurant meaning one of the 200 best restaurants in the world.

White Devil Approved. It would be silly for me to write a review. Just read what others write. There is a reason this place has TWO Michelin Stars. LA best is here on Melrose (just down the street from Blu Jam Cafe). In a word: Go. You will not be disappointed. Do expect to spend $135.00 per person. (You could save $7.00 and park your own car.)

This is really a very special place.  We celebrated our anniversary here, and will never forget the beautiful ambiance, superb service, and amazing meal. First of all, I must disagree with Yelpers who felt a snob vibe.  The exterior is so inconspicuous and unassuming that we initially drove past it.   The decor inside is sophisticated and unique. Once we got inside, we received one of the best dining experiences we have ever had in terms of service.  Our waiter was professional, warm, and truly made it a personalized experience.  He remembered details of our conversation over the course of the entire evening, and really made us feel relaxed and comfortable. We ordered the five-course tasting menu without wine pairing, and added a truffle risotto.  We were started off with an amuse bouche that really awakened the palate and prepared us for the culinary loveliness that was in store.  There were 3 lovely choices of bread, and if there is a negative in this review at all it is that they ran out of the seaweed roll.  Every course was delicious, and immaculately presented.   Providence is, without a doubt, worthy of a special or rare occasion.  Absolutely wonderful experience.  The staff even broke up the chef's tasting menu to honor a special request by giving us awesome chocolate-dipped strawberries, which was something sentimental for us.

Had dinner here tonight and all in all, pretty good. But I was confused by a couple of things:   first:  the black winter truffle-- risotto, pasta alla chitarra, soft scrambled eggs, raviolo   alluovo (on their market menu).                   Our dish was just the pasta in a butter sauce with shavings of black truffle, the truffles looked like pieces of confetti on our pasta.  Did I miss something or was the dish incomplete-- I didn't see half of what was on the description in the dish.  I'm still confused. second:  usually, Providence has complementary corkage on Mondays.  We were surprised when we were charged for corkage tonight, when we asked they said someone just forgot to tell us when we made the reservations, mmm... ...........The loss with paying for corkage is two-fold: one, we missed out on trying some of the wines on their great wine list; and two, we could have had more than one type of wine tonight. We had most of the dishes on their Market Menu sans the spot prawn-we opted for the spot prawn ANDscallop--and the wagyu beef. My Valentine's day menu includes rib eye, I'm not silly enough to compete with Providence's Wagyu beef. If you decide on dessert, I would recommend the Dessert Tasting Menu.  Each dish was unique and different, presented beautifully and executed flawlessly.  Bravo!

Probably the best restaurant in LA. We had the Chefs menu, 14 courses of food bliss! We spent 3.5 hrs at the table and enjoyed every second. The staff was outstanding, knowledgeable, professional, there when they needed to be and gone when they should be. each course was another epicurean jewel and a delight. We will be back! Thanks Providence.

It was difficult to decide whether I should give 4 stars or 5 stars.   There is painstaking attention to detail in each of the small plates.  Some of the flavor combinations are beyond compare.  However, other plates are overdone, with too many flavors on the same dish - the chef was just trying too hard.  Others have odd flavors.  One in particular - a warmed egg yolk with bits of sea urchin served in a half egg shell - was difficult to stomach because of the consistency.  Perhaps the warmed yolk would have been better in a dessert, as it would have mirrored a custard a little better.  Lastly, the tasting menu included delicate plates of seafood, but one plate had a large quality of red meat.  If you're going to serve delicate plates, keep them all consistently delicate.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the vast majority of the dishes. The service was very good.  Although not the best I've ever had, but still compensurate with the qualilty of the food.  The sommelier was exceptional. As an overall experience, I would not hesistate to go back.  You can get the full tasting menu for only $110 without wine.  You can't find a deal like that any where else for this quality of food.  Also, I appreciated the attention to the preparation, even for the dishes that I felt didn't quite work. Note:  You want to sit in the main front room.  The rear rooms have a bit of a strange vibe in comparison.  Also, if you are not adventurous with your palette, and in particular with raw asian inspired food and consistencies, you probably want to avoid this place.

I really enjoyed my experience at Providence. Everything was awesome there! Loved the food, service and the ambiance! We all had the tasting menu. 4 ppl had the 5 course and one had the full tasting 9 course menu. It was great that they could accommodate two different types of tasting menus. We also ordered the foie gras sautee on top of the tasting menu and it was superb! It was seared perfectly on the outside and it was melt in your mouth on the inside. seriously one of the best foie gras I ever had! I am too lazy to write about all the dishes on the tasting menu, but let me just say they were all very solid! I especially loved the scallop dish! so fresh, tender, and lots of umami! Providence is pricey but definitely worth it.  For sure, I'd like to go back when I save up more money =P

My friends and I came here for one of our friend's birthday this past Saturday.  This is my second time at this restaurant and we always went with their tasting menu to see what the chef has in store for diners.  The mojito and screwdriver started well.  Next came the main tasting plates, they were delicious and it was mainly seafood with the exception of the veal tenderloin.  At the end, it was cheese and desert.  Excellent cheese selections, but the desert was not very pleasing this time.  The presentation of each plates were very well done and it made the experience that much better.

I've passed this restaurant many many times and I've heard about it with it's glowing reviews.  A good friend of mine and I finally went there and made reservations.  First of all the lighting was phenomenal....I looked AMAZING under their lights...being photosonus and all.  Going back to the restaurant.  While deciding on what to eat ...I saw that they had a tasting menu with wine pairings..( I thought to myself ..I will be drunk out of my mind if we did this)  So I decided to stick to the menu.  Whle deciding the chef gave us an amuse-bouche ..one of them had 24 carat gold shavings...(wow..I thought).  It was just an explosion of delightful tastes in  my mouth. It was a work of genius.  I went ahead and ordered the John Dory for my main and course and ordered a bottle of Syrah 2005. I tell you the food was just incredible.  The staff seemed a little stuffy at first.  But I just have this uncanny ability to put people at ease and the service just escalated to an all time high.  My every move and every nuance triggered a response from the staff which made my experience unforgettable.  My napkin was folded everytime I left for the ladies room.  My water goblet never reached half empty and my glass of wine was always poured by the staff.  Michael Cimarusti's restuarant deserves the 2 star Michelin ...without any doubt..  For dessert...we had the dark chocolate ganache...(sinful but refined).  I am left with no choice but to return and sample the tasting menu.

Such a disappointment!  The fish was cold and had to be sent back to the kitchen.  And, after that, the entire meal was forgettable.  My cousin and I were both massively disappointed with our meals.  It's especially disturbing when you pay a high price and don't get your money's worth.  I will never return. A colleague of mine happened to mention that she had a similar experience at Providence.  After that, I thought I'd better write a YELP and give others the heads-up.

Providence trip was for a special occasion. I have read rave reviews boasting of food quality, impeccable service, and an exclusive experience. Often times the hype does not live up to the real experience. We, however were not disappointed. It was everything most have boasted about and more. We ordered the Chef's Tasting Menu with wine pairing. The next four and a half hours were an exclusive journey filled with flavors, and wine selections that didn't miss a beat. The staff service was a poetry in motion. An incredible experience. Highly recommended.

One of the best fine dining experiences I have had. We made reservations with my wife and although it took a bit longer to seat us - we arrived a bit early - they were quite busy and backed up, but understandably so. We ordered several items: Australian Style Wagu, Foie Gras Ravioli, The Chowda, and The Pumpkin Polenta dessert item. We were also given some kind of tuna with gel and gold sprinkles compliments of the chef. What it was exactly I have forgotten but it was beyond amazing. The food here is one of the best I have ever had in all my years in los angeles. I cannot think of a better fine dining experience in recent years. This place is for the senses. Come with open senses and u will be blown away. An artistic culinary experience, but with real food u actually enjoy and can get full on. Very satisfied with wine selection too.

Yea. What everyone else said. Do the tasting menu with the wine pairings. I usually come with my dad to the wine events because he loves wine, and the food is really superb. I even saw the food critic from food network, I don't know his name but he's the old guy with white ish hair and glasses and the really strict serious one on the iron chef America. Haha pretty cool. And obviously all the wine connoisseurs that I keep meeting through my dad and just all the wine ppl who know food and wine. If u enjoy and appreciate good food, you should definitely come here. If you don't, then save your money for that leather jacket you've been wanting to buy.

Now I'm understanding the meaning of  2 Michelin stars... We started out in the bar had a few drinks and I have never met a bartender so knowledgeable about ALL alcohol than Zara. My boyfriend tried a scotch that she recommended that he had never heard of and I tried one of their signature drinks. The meticulousness of how my drink was made was impressive, i felt like I was back in Japan. To top it off the drink was wonderful! We were having such a great time chatting with Zara we lost track of time and eventually was pulled into the dining room for our dinner reservation. We ended up sitting next to a lovely couple that were very generous with their wine and food before we even got our own food! Of their's we sampled the truffle risotto which was of course amazing. Its been a few months since then so I can't recall what else we tried of theirs. (After the couple next to us left the waiter told us the husband was one of the investors of Providence, what are the odds?) Our dinner consisted of (what i can remember): Complimentary hor doeuvres Kumamoto and another type of oyster Scallops Prime New York Steak Santa Barbara Spotted Prawns cooked in salt (to die for) Side of bacon risotto De-constructed pumpkin pie That was one of the best birthday dinners I ever had. I can't wait to go back again!

The money is well spent on this amazing restaurant. We ordered the 5 courses tasting menu which is probably the best on the menu. The regular menu didnt impress me at all. There is not much needs to be said, it is absolutely mind blowing! I have this girlfriend who is currently teaching in the culinary institute in NYC, and she couldnt say enough how impressed she was with the tasting menu. Everything is well prepared, from the presentation to the absolutely amazing taste of the course. I love it! Another highlight of the night is their prawns. If you dont order this, you are totally missing out. The prawns were buried under the salts and being baked in the oven. Well, I am not going to tell you how great it tasted but they all looked so juicy!!! hahahaha I have said enough, you gotto try it out! =)

1048 reviews!  Why not one more!  We came here for the first the last Saturday night. Tasting menu versus a la carte menu? Tasting menu allows you to taste more dishes but the a la carte menu gives you more than just a taste of a dish you like. Which one? Why not both!? We chose from the a la carte menu for our meal but got the dessert tasting menu. We ordered between the two of us the chowda, Santa Barbara sea urchin, foie gras ravioli, charcoal grilled turbot for two, cheese cart and the six course dessert tasting menu. The chowda was creamy and the clams had no sand which is a rare occurrence whenever we get clams. The sea urchin was rich and smooth, I only wished I also ordered it with caviar as I think the caviar would've enhanced the flavor. The ravioli was also rich and creamy with the pasta cooked al dente. The turbot was my favorite part of the meal. We were shown the fish and vegetables in a pot before the bones were removed from the fish and the food was plated. The fish was cooked perfectly, it was moist and tender. I only wished they were able to make the skin more crispy. The vegetables were an assortment of baby vegetables such as onion, turnip or radish (not sure which one), peas and mushrooms. The vegetables were also cooked perfectly and eating the fish and vegetables together brought the food to a higher level. The Chef's display of the food on our plates was very beautiful. I would've taken a picture but we needed a flash and we decided not to do so as we didn't want to disturb our fellow diners. We also got a half bottle of wine based on the sommelier's recommendation. It went perfect with our meal. The cheese cart was good. I can't say that any of the cheeses we tried wowed us, but the condiments that came with the cheese taught me there is more than just bread and crackers that go well with cheese. There are also jams/jellies and dried fruit. The six course dessert tasting menu was a first for us. The pumpkin dessert was my favorite, it was like a deconstructed pumpkin pie. The pomegranate dessert had a concentrated taste of pomegranate which was too much for me. Most of the other desserts I thought were too busy, too many items in the dessert. Too many items caused the desserts to have too many flavors in the dish which is the opposite of the dinner menu. I'm glad we tried the dessert tasting menu as it was a first for us and I would recommend it to people to try itbut I would not do it again. The service was excellent, from the front desk to our waiter. Even though this is a high class restaurant, the staff didn't act like snobs and were very friendly. The staff also made sure the diners wouldn't feel embarrass because they suggested we take our leftovers home with us which is something you would be afraid to ask in a nice restaurant (if you do take your leftovers home watch the other people around you and see their look of surprise!) and I noticed that our waiter seemed to realize that not everyone who comes in doesn't have bottomless wallet so he took costs into consideration when discussing our order without actually talking about how much things costs. Not an easy thing to do! The restaurant was elegantly decorated. The lighting varied depending on where you were seated. Some of the tables were pretty close together which is where we were seated. This is a upscale restaurant so you should get dressed up (guys, this means wear a jacket, I don't know how many came in without one), but no dress code is enforced. We saw a guy with jeans and sneakers. Overall, we enjoyed our experience here and the food was one of the best meals we've had. The restaurant truly deserves its two Michelin star rating. I see that people compare Providence with Melisse. I ate at Melisse about 2 months ago and as much as I like Melisse I'd have to say that Providence is better.

I was soo excited to go here, especially after seeing the menu and viewing their online pics and praise.. The decor is nothing special, service was professional and good, no problems there.  However I came for the food!   Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, it was ok but noting to rave about.  I enjoy every kind of foie gras, however the foie gras ravioli here was so disappointing, I couldn't taste the foie gras, all I tasted was oil, it was drenched in oil..sad.. I aslo had the lobster ravioli, couldn't even taste the lobster.. My friend ordered a few things that I took a bite of, nothing too exciting worth listing. Overall I am disappointed, maybe I ordered the wrong food, our meal came to over $450.. I would not go back, but feel I should give it one more chance and perhaps try the chefs course or tasting course to see what everyone is raving about, would love to up the rating. Keeping fingers crossed!

When I made reservations to Providence for my anniversary I was excited but I didn't expect a 5 star experience. I thought the hype and price tag would influence me to take 1-2 stars away. But, to make a long story short, I was wrong. Being indecisive, lazy and fans of prix fixe menus it was no surprise that we ordered chef Michael Cimarusti's full tasting menu with wine pairing. The service was first class and each plate was given a proper introduction upon arrival. The following were my personal favorites: - Mojito: Super refreshing. - Luna oyster: I'm not a fan of oysters. Especially raw oysters. But, this was acceptable. And, I'm recommending it because of the jalapeno, cilantro and lime it was prepared with. A perfect balance of aroma, spice and tang. - Uni: This might have been the best plate of the night. It was prepared with caviar, corn, egg and brioche truffle in a champagne reduction. When it came out I thought it was an odd mixture. To add on we were told to take deep spoonfuls, making sure that we got a bit of everything. Load and behold; culinary excellence. - Sea bass: My bias takes effect here. I love fish and it was made with asparagus (like) in a sunchoke and eel puree. It didn't make me go wow but it tasted great. It makes the list because it was unique in a great way. Something I've never tasted before but wouldn't mind pigging out on again. :) - Dessert: Omg, there were so many desserts; 5 courses. And, everything was delectable. Have you ever had to hold back on a meal just to make sure that you have enough room left for that dessert you were eying on the menu? Well, I've been a victim more times than I would like to admit. But, the portions here were perfect. After all was said and done I was full without feeling stuffed. But, if I had to recommend a single dessert it would be the truffles. I just smiled writing that. I'm such a dork. Tips: - There's no dress code. I came in a casual blazer and jean ensemble but would kick it up on the fancy scale next time. - Be prepared for a long night. My meal lasted 3.5 to 4 hours. - If you're a fan of food with wine definitely opt in for the wine pairing. It's well worth it. And, this is coming from "not an expert on wine."

So many people have gone into depth about the tasting menu at providence but this review is not going to do that but rather I wanted to talk about what set this dinner apart from anything I have ever had, along with some suggestions. I had been wanting to make a trip out to Providence for some time now after seeing Chef Cimarusti on After Hours with Daniel Boulud. I could not stop thinking about the spot prawns that everyone talks about. Unfortunately, I still have not had them, but I guess it works out because now I can make another trip out there so I can try them. A couple of weeks ago we celebrated our 7 yr anniversary. I made reservations a few months in advance knowing we would be going to Providence and partaking of the Chef's menu, and seemed only appropriate to have the Chef's table. This area is separate from the main dining area so you are secluded from everyone else. We arrived at 6:40, were greeted warmly and were seated immediately. We did not leave the restaurant until 11:45pm, yes folks, 5 hours! This was not only the most amazing dinner but also a complete dinning experience by being able to see the kitchen in action. I would definitely recommend eating at the chef's table this at least once and as it is truly an unparalleled experience. What sets Providence apart from many of the other big name restaurants is that not only Chef Cimarusti the head chef, but he is also the owner. If you were to go to Bar Americain you would not have Bobby Flay in the kitchen expediting each night. Not only was the food exceptional, but also it was awesome to see how serious and intense the kitchen was and that everyone there needed to be on point. I had already set my expectation for not liking one or two dishes since everyone's palate is different but I was surprised that I actually loved everything. I realize that the chef's menu changes all the time but here is what I absolutely loved. Recommendation: Oyster - On the half shell, Australian finger limes, mild jalapeño, cilantro blossom. This thing was so flavorful and I could go back and order a dozen of them on their own. Spot Prawn - Grilled peel n eat with smoked butter and roe. The prawn on its own was tender and perfectly cooked but the butter was RIDONKULOUS. Australian Black Winter Truffle Risotto - This was an add-on but I would highly recommend doing it. I could not believe the intense flavors of the Australian truffles. It was incredible. The risotto was excellent on its own and the addition of black winter truffles made it the perfect dish. The truffles brought an earthy and nutty flavor that is so hard to describe. American Wagyu Beef - Now this dish could totally be replaced with whatever he happens to make, ours happened to be wagyu beef, but the real star was the bone marrow béarnaise. So ask your waiter to give you anything with this incredible savory, mouth-watering sauce. ------------------- What topped the whole night off was at the end Chef Cimarusti came into our room and talked to us, we then asked to take a picture with him. He invited us into the kitchen and we walked into the middle of the kitchen while dinner was still being served. We then talked for about 8-10 minutes in the middle of his kitchen, about everything from his plans for Labor day to his restaurant and his future. He was so personable and friendly and truly made our experience like no other. Bravo Chef Cimarusti!! Bravo!!

Not sure if adding review number 359 here will impact anyone's opinion, but I can't not review this place. Recently I was in LA for a conference. Since a couple of my fellow conference goers and I are foodies and we wanted to find a great restaurant to visit in Los Angeles. We settled upon Providence. We decided to go with the nine course tasting, complete with wine pairings. The entire experience was fantastic from start to finish. We started off with an aperitif that was the essence of three different drinks, including a mojito and a gin and tonic; two of them were essentially solidified jello balls with a liquid center that just exploded in your mouth. From there the menu meandered around to different items, including sea urchin in a soft boiled egg, veal, and salmon (which I loved even though I generally can't stand cooked salmon). In fact, come to think of it, I can't think of anything outside of the cheese course that I didn't like. The wine selection was fantastic. Each wine was introduced before the associated course. My favorite description from the sommelier was the use of the word "funk" to describe the flavor one of the grapes used for the sparkling wine added to it. Gotta love a sommelier that's willing to use the word "funk" to describe a wine. If you're in the area, and you're willing to drop a good amount of coin for a fantastic dinner, you have to check this place out.

Prepared to be WOWed, by the Food and the Price! There is something wonderful about this place that is unassuming yet serves such amazing flavors!  Double date, Sunday night, reservations for 4.  We got the 9 course tasting menu, which was Superb!!! We started out with drink orders, the men got the a japanese brew while my girlfriend and I opted for the 2 most popular cocktails, a pear martini and the wonderland.  The Wonderland is wonderful!!!   Chef's compliments preceded our meal as we were greeted by a flight of 4 miniature goods ranging from mint mojito to bread puff.  The courses proceeded along nicely as we wrapped up in about 2.5 hrs.  Some outstanding courses were the veal and the fish.  Didn't care much for the 2 desserts and could have definitely done without the cheese course.  The meal totaled to $700 with 4 cocktails and a bottle of the Stonehill Chardonnay.  If you have ever had the Melisse 15 course tasting menu, you would spot the difference!  While I love it, I think a second visit is better saved for Melisse!

Mmmmm....Is all I have to say! I love this place! Its my 2nd time here. I went a few years ago and was kind of scared bc I did not want to be disappointed with the superb dinner I had dinner back then. Took the bf and some friends here for his bday. Up until yesterday, I had been emailing the restaurant to make sure they are Ok to cater the 5 course tasting menu with no seafood. I know, I know...no seafood for a seafood restaurant?! The bf doesnt like seafood so had to make sure this was doable. Our 2 friends had the 5 course with seafood and we had all meat. Both were superb! I was more scared that the others wouldnt like the dinner as much as I did since I felt like I hyped it a bit much =) Our server answered all of our questions including questions on why he loves being a server at Providence. He was great, very attentive and got everything we wanted. I would describe the food but that would just take too much of your time and frankly I wouldnt even do justice to it. I hope I get to again sooner than later!

FINALLY!!! there is true fine dining in los angeles. thank you, providence for being innovative and delicately restrained. the food is as delicious as it looks. the plating is freakin' incredible! thank you for making my food look like a precious jewel ready to be devoured. once the amuse bouche came out (with the play on temperatures - 1 cold, 1 medium, 1 hot)), i knew the meal was going to be amazing. had the full tasting with the wine pairing. the pairings were spot on and complemented each dish very well. i had the BEST VEAL OF MY LIFETIME as the last savory course. the service is not as effortless as other places i've dined in my life, but is attentive and professional. after tip you're paying in the 500s for 2 people. (fyi - candles on our dessert, they read our open table notes about the special occasion!) you will not be disappointed. totally worth it. p.s. the decor is a "metaphor for sea-life"

I was underwhelmed.  Perhaps I just went on an off day. I had lobster risotto as an appetizer.  I thought it was prepared well and it tasted fine.  It just bored me. My main course fish was clearly oversalted.  I eat out every meal, in a wide range of cuisines, and am not particularly susceptible to salt, but this fish was flawed.  I probably would have sent it back had it not been a business dinner.  Everything else about the main course was blah.  I can't even remember with accompanied the fish. My dessert was creative and lovely.  It just didn't didn't taste all that special.  While I enjoyed the foams and cute plating and strange ingredient combinations, I would have enjoyed a piece of apple pie with a buttery crust much more. The best thing to me was the breads.  They were all delicious  I also enjoyed the amuse bouche, mainly for the sashimi fish spoon.

What am I missing?  I was invited to a dinner here, and we had a 9-course meal in the private dining room.  The dishes were all extremely blahhh - yeah truffles are cool, caviar adds a nice touch, and the whole molecular gastronomy was really pretty, but what happened to food that tastes GOOD?   I will say that the staff here is amazing, and they really know how to treat their guests.  I will definitely give this place another shot.

I was super excited to come back to Providence. The last time I was there, dessert was a revelation... and a tease! This time, I opted to decline dinner in favor of a full dessert tasting. I already had wine with a meal earlier in the evening, so did not take advantage of the sommelier's pairings. The selection of dessert wines, sherries, grappas, and cognacs was impressive though! This full experience would've been wonderful for a more leisurely evening with several close friends. Sit in the intimate bar area if you really want to drag it into the night! My favorite dessert of the night was the milk chocolate-whisky panna cotta.  So good, in fact, that I probably would have been happy with having it brought to me for every course afterward! If you are at Providence and this is on the menu, please do yourself a favor and at least try! It is so good. Photos/full review at: http://thelovingspoonful…

This was far and away the greatest meal of my life.  We had the great fortune of being seated at the chef's table for the chef's tasting menu.  The service was impeccable.   From each server to the maitre d' and Chef Michael, I felt like an honored guest in a long lost (and rich) family member's house. Every bite was magical, transcendent, spectacular.  Tears of joy threatened to salt my food and my heart burst with flavors of life that I had never before experienced in such a way.  As though a shade was lifted from my taste buds as they emerged from their womb, all of my senses were suddenly more vivid and brilliant with each mouthful of wonder.   The wine pairings were true marriages of flavor with each wine complementing the food and vice versa.   Chef Michael himself presented two of his dishes with great care and humility and the only thing preventing me from prostrating myself before him is that I needed to sit up and eat the next course and melt into oblivion.

This place needs to change its name from Providence to "Holy God, make me rich so I can eat here everyday."  Okay scratch the name change, but if you get the chance to come here there is no doubt this place will be one of your favorite places to dine.  The food is amazing. Expensive, but AMAZING.  That night I got home, I actually said a little prayer for the talented Chef Michael Cimarusti.  And it went a little like this: "Dear God, Thank you for blessing me with life so that I can dine at Providence.  Please continue to bless Chef Michael with success so that everyone living gets to taste a piece of this paradise you allowed him to create. Oh, and PS, make me rich so I can eat here everyday." $150 New Year's Eve 9 course tasting menu.  My favorite three dishes in order of preference: 1) Nancy Hill's Down East Sea Scallop (almond infusion, aged vinegar, bacon, parsnip), 2) Tai Snapper (avocado, american caviar, smoked sesame), 3) Santa Barbara Sea Urchin Custard (warm black truffle, sherry syrup, brioche toast). The food was truly to die for, but the desserts...not so much.     By far the most expensive but also the best meal I've experienced. Service: amazing!! Parking: $5.50 valet.

Fortunately, we had the 5 course Tasting Menu, which was the appropriate amount of food, and for $65 I think it is not too bad, especially for a 2 Star Michelin Restaurant.. Basically, this is a seafood restaurant, as I remember he mentioned on Top Chef Masters...I think he learned a lot from Water Grill.. All I say is Bacon Roll.. Geez, this was warm and delicious.. Um, I could have had like 10 of these and be done with the night, but needed to definitely keep an open palate and empty tummy for more wine and culinary delights.. Interesting Amuse Bouche - refreshing I'd say, a gin and tonic mojito, yellowtail sashimi..  It is what an amuse bouche should be to entice the senses to want more.. Then we got the Yellowtail sashimi with crème fraîche, salmon roe - very colorful presentation with a gold leaf to boot...  Very tasty delight.. Next was the Japanese kanpachi, crispy rice crackers, coriander, soy crème fraîche - I think I am really beginning to like Kanpachi, only really nice Sushi restaurants has this delicate fish.. Then we had their flagship entree the - Spot Prawns served Table Side in salt - more for flair and presentation rather than taste, it was served very naturally with olive oil and sea salt.. Next was the Hokkaido scallop, Japanese eggplant, ramps - excellent presentation, very pretty to look at.. Scallops were sweet and done to perfection..  Always love scallops so I am partial.. Wild Alaskan halibut, smoked paprika, weiser farms potatoes, grilled octopus - this was ok.. hearty..as a main course.. Marcho farms veal tenderloin, sweet peas, bacon, almond, and morel mushrooms - nice since it was part of the tasting menu.. definitely comfort food at its finest, did we say bacon.. For dessert, we had the Yuzu curd, meringue, blackberry sorbet, jasmine - very refreshing again a great end to a great meal.. Mignardises - macarons, salty sweet caramel, hazlenut ball - at then end, though it was just ok.. not the greatest, felt like it came out of a package.. Definitely, a great value at $65, if I had to pay more, I am not sure.. The decor is pretty, but looks like the episode of Star Trek with the flying orbs..

Five star for the cheese selection. I think they have the best cheese in LA and they actually know about their cheeses. i love their pairings with fig, apricot jam and walnuts. Yummm As in the rest... Three stars. Been here three times and ordered the courses, seperate menus... All in all it's just okay. It took me three times to finally give up and decided this place is only cheese for me. Oh make sure you don't have any plans after Providence because they sure do take their time with everything.

I enjoyed an excellent dinner here with my wife on her birthday. Our five-course tastings were sumptuous and filling. Each course was innovative and delicious, with the striped bass being best of all. Additionally, the servers were professional and the presentation was spotless. There's a fine line that separates very good restaurants from excellent ones and it's clear that Providence stands above that line. That said, when you spend upwards of $150/person for a dinner, you expect absolute perfection. And there were a few ways in which Providence fell short for me, some worse than others. Things started off on the wrong foot, as we were coldly welcomed by the front of the house. Not to take anything away from the hostess, who was gracious and professional, but the maître d' was rude to us from the first. Given that the restaurant is his livelihood, it surprised me how quickly he lost patience with us as we worked through a minor snag in our reservation. Relatively speaking, our table was one of the worst in the house. Normally this would not be a problem, but we were seated when other tables were open, implying that we were getting second class treatment. Along those lines, our servers were professional, but the service waned as the evening proceeded. Notably, bigger spenders received better attention. Finally, the bathroom was in poor shape for a restaurant of this caliber. The floor was wet and the garbage bins were overflowing. Despite my critiques, I really did enjoy my meal here, because the food was truly excellent. I think my wife enjoyed the meal even more, although she was nearly full halfway through the tastings. Considering everything, a great dining experience marred by flaws in the service.

It must have been an off night... It's definitely a nice restaurant in west Hollywood but off the main strip but close to one of the major studios (bfd). We decided  to go a la carte. The food: It was pretty good, except for one dish which was well over cooked. Great presentation overall. Service: A bit confusing and sparse, we had three different waiters serving us (why?) and often we were unable to track down a waiter to refill our drinks. I was expecting a better overall experience given the two Michelin Stars. Try it for yourself, enjoy!

My friend and I shared the crab entree.  It was decent. I only ordered 2 appetizers instead of an entree due to the fact that I overstuffed myself the night before with All You Can Eat Kobe Beef in Gyukaku.  Ill tell you what, the dinner at Gyukaku was a lot more enjoyable. My 1st appetizer was a dish that featured Uni, prawns over tofu pudding with gold leaves.  The gold leaves obviously took the spotlight though the taste really got lost in with all the other ingredients.  4 stars for this dish. My 2nd appetizer was lobster in something.  It was good, the lobster had that exquisite "snappy" texture to it but again, the taste that could be found elsewhere, for a lesser price. 4 stars. The duck entree was good, nothing earthshattering, but good.  Skin was crisp as it should be. The chef's gifts came in 4 dishes in total, even though we did not order the tasting menu, and it was very generous of them.  They all taste very interesting, however, none blew our mind. Probably I should go with the tasting menu next time.  Until then, 3 stars for now due to the taste, and the extremely high price.

let me begin by stating that the baseline of this review is with other restaurants that are michelin rated and not your run of the mill restaurant that serves you comfort food on a nightly basis.  it has taken me over a month to sit down and write this review so that i would be less irritated at the service and hope to concentrate on the food.  sorry, that didn't happen :( SERVICE: 5 stars for the host 1 star for the server(s) obama was in town and we were running a little late, so we called in that we were stuck in traffic and the host was very gracious and understanding.  the night started off great with us entering the restaurant and being seated in a timely manner.  the server arrived promptly to the table and offered us some drinks.  he seemed knowledgeable about the variety of drinks and we had some of the house specials which they did a great job with. but then... we started discussing food with the server.  at this point, things began to deteriorate.  to summarize the conversation in a single word as to what really bothered us was "pretentious".  the server wanted to know more than me no matter what our conversation piece was and this really bothered me for some reason.  he began by trying to sell us on the truffle dishes.  so i had to point out that its june and not white truffle season and he then tries to sell us on australia's new grey truffle and how its just as good as the white truffle... i think not.  next he tries to tell us how innovative providence was because they had developed this uni butter pasta dish.  yummmmm uni butter pasta dish... sounds delicious.  maybe if they added a hefty dose of fine caviar it would add a wonderful texture and salty flavor to compliment the smooth texture of the uni butter.  oh wait, that's neither new nor innovative.  they make this exact dish at le bernardin AND because of this dish, anthony bourdain had a segment on his no reservations show (food porn) about it.  this guy was really starting to piss me off now, not only did he think he was better and smarter than us, but now that we called BS, he avoids us for the rest of the night.  (i wouldn't normally call BS on what the server says, but i like to have civilized non-pretentious conversations with our server to learn more about the food we are about to eat and how they prepare the meals).  not even per se, french laundry, melisse (the #1 restaurant in LA) or gary danko have pretentious servers and if you imagine any restaurant being pretentious, its gotta be those right? and before i hit send, i had to come back and mention that one member of our dinner party went to the restroom and they still served our food.  were we supposed to wait for him to return and our food get cold?  were we supposed to eat without him and not experience the food together?  ugh!!!! how unprofessional. ok, i hated the service.  i understand why they are NOT #1, but i do not understand why they are #2 and if food were my career and i could petition for them to LOSE a michelin star, i would be first in line to do so. FOOD: 4 stars IF they were not michelin rated 2 stars because they are michelin rated the first half of the meal was good with special notice of the hamachi dish.  but somewhere in the middle, the black truffle foie gras ravioli came out and everything just went down hill from there.  the ravioli was way too rich and we could only have a few pieces before it felt gluttonous and heavy.  i think if they had actually thought about the order in which the food was going to come out, it would have made the meal much more enjoyable.  the salmon was dry, which came out after the rich ravioli... the steak may as well have been just a normal piece of skirt steak as it tasted bland, had no marbling and was over-cooked.  (if you read my other reviews, you'll see that i am a bit of a steak snob).  then the cheese came out and the server says we should choose 5-7 different cheeses.  how does that make any sense?  any more than 3 and you may as well not try the last ones.  anyways, i chalk that back up under the bad service... so the cheese, i think one of the cheese we described as "tastes like how i would imagine a dirty gym sock would taste". so our 3rd server of the night got really offended when i asked this question, i didn't see it or say it to be offensive, but here was my question: "so you guys are the #2 restaurant in LA, what's the name of the #3 place?"   bottom line:  go to this restaurant if you know little about food, it will be a good starting point before you go to really good restaurants.  don't challenge the servers as their panties will get scrunched and you won't get the service that you are paying for.  if you do not have much to compare to, the food will be good.  if you've been to other michelin rated restaurants and see that providence is the #2 in LA and expect something awesome... go to melisse, they will give you something awesome.  how this restaurant got 2 michelin stars i have no idea.

The two-star rating I gave it says, "Meh, I've experienced better." Definitely the truth. The Japanese Wagyu was really good but everything else was just average as far as fancy hoity toity Los Angeles restaurants go. The deserts were interesting to say the least. The tubular cheesecake was straight up NOT GOOD. The mushroom caramels are apparently their most popular desert, but we took a handful back to the office to play some pranks instead. Put a caramel in your mouth and wait a half second before it starts to taste like cream of mushroom. Everytime we try to find a place for dinner, we wave off this place for sure.

Orgasmic.... The BF and I celebrated an anniversary with this extravagant dinner. We did the full tasting menu plus the wine pairings. Every dish was a piece of art and an explosion of flavor. I cried a little bit... Loooved the cocktail amuse bouche to start and the decadent fois gras raviolis somewhere in the middle of the meal. The service was impeccable, the sommelier (who happens to be an acquaintance) is very knowledgeable and friendly. The meal took close to 3 hours and I was in a state of euphoria at the end of it. Plan ahead for this long meal because I ended up missing my sister's birthday party.  It was worth every second and cent!

this is clearly one of the best restaurants in the country.  I mean really elevating american cuisine to the "3 star michelin" establishments in europe with the likes of thomas keller. (ps bouchon in vegas is SHIT, dying to try french laundry). thoughtful, beautiful, flawless. and i say this, having ordered mainly meat dishes. i know i'm a tool because their specialty is seafood. their staff could not be more courteous or attentive.  everything from the homemade bacon brioche to the cocktail we had at the bar to close out the evening was FANTASTIC. i had to make a great effort not to cry as the waiter brought out a huge white truffle to shave onto my foie gras ravioli.  a spontaneous giddy clapping did escape me. i'd like to go everytime i can afford it :) setting aside a "providence" monthly savings fund wouldn't be a bad idea.

This place is completely amazing.  We had the 9 course tasting menu which if you have 3 hours to spare I would highly recommend.  The only course I didn't like was the salmon.  They have an awesome cheese course where they bring out a cheese tray and cut it for you table side.   The service is the best I've had anywhere.  It has a really nice look inside...very cozy.   And since you are going to spend a lot of money you can save a few bucks by going on a Monday and taking advantage of no corkage fee if you have a nice bottle of wine you would like to bring along.

I brought my management team to discuss business, have a good time, and eat some great food. I can say with out a doubt the FOOD was exceptional! There were 5 of us, 3 had the 5 course and 2 of us had the 9 courses. 4 1/2 hours later we were all full, our taste buds were completely satisfied and the service was some of the very best in Los Angeles. As for drinks I myself stuck with Scotches as they had a great selection, my wife and the rest of the team did the wine pairing. From what I saw not one glass was every left with a drop of wine. So I take that as a sign the pairing was perfect. As for the Scotches, I bounced between the Highland Park 18yr and the Glen. 12yr Sherry cask!! Both were fantastic - Couple of drops of water and one ice cube!!! The service was well deserving of the 2 stars it received from Mich... I am sure all of us will be back..

We were considering the 5 course tasting menu but wasn't thrilled with the options so we decided to go a la carte.  The amuse bouche they served was a spoonful of cubed raw hamachi paired with a little mug filled with hot and cold liquid which was meant to be a shooter to get the full flavor and experience the mix of temperatures. The fish was great but the shooter was not. I did not experience the mix of temperatures it just tasted like cold salty soup. To start we got the Japanese Kanpachi and the Salt Roasted Santa Barbara Spot Prawns (one of the Providence Market Specials). Both were delicious.  Three large prawns were buried in a mound of salt that had been heated up to 500 degrees. The server cut, presented and served the prawns at our table. Delicious! The mains took a while to arrive at our table but it was fine since we were enjoying our wine and conversation. I ordered the Wild Stripped Bass and my sister got the Wild Alaskan Halibut. Although the bass was great I was regretting I didn't go with the halibut. After our mains my sister insisted on dessert so we went with the Miso Glazed Pineapple, Yuzu Curd. After we finished the waiter brought out some complementary desserts for us. They were all amazing but definitely put me over the edge in terms of fullness. I was so happy I wore a loose fitting dress instead of my TAJ (tight as jeans). This place was great, nice atmosphere, delicious food, attentive service. If you want seafood, this is a winner.

Came here for my first anniversary dinner. We had the 5 course tasting menu. The first 2 courses were delightful, very delicious. But my 2 fish dishes were too salty that I didn't finish one of them. The server came to ask about it, and I told him it was too salty for me. He immediately took it back and brought me a new dish. This time, it was perfect. :) The other dish that was too salty wasn't nearly as bad. But I don't know why they cook their fish so salty. And at the end they surprised us with a small chocolate cake with candles on it because my boyfriend wrote in the comment box that it was our anniversay when he made reservation on opentable. Very delightful. If only the fish was perfect, I'd have given it a 5.

Omg my boyfriend took me to this place for our one year anniversary and omg it was unbelievably good! The restaurant is located at a very unusual area in Melrose...I say this because this is a pretty expensive restaurant and I'm surprised it's not located in more high-end neighborhood haha. Be prepared for time and an appetite! It was four hours and there was about 16-17little dishes. Every little dish was unique and delicious but I think I love the cocktail bubbles the most hehe. Our waiter was super friendly and very knowledgeable about each and every dish. The overall experience was great and it might cost a few hundred...but it's really worth to try it at least once! =] I definitely want to go again hehe.

The best meal I've ever had in Los Angeles, and without a doubt worth every penny.  A dinner at Providence isn't going to be cheap, but letting the chef take care of you on a course through a tasting menu is possibly the closest culinary thing you'll find to heaven in this city. My girlfriend and I did a 9-course tasting menu (the option for 15 courses seems...wow, I don't even know how you could do that in one evening.  Food overload!) with a bottle of wine suggested by the sommelier, taking our likings into account.  Every dish cooked to perfection, this was a meal to remember. Then came the cheese.  Okay, I've been a cheese fan my whole life, and there are too many restaurants that just don't do it right.  Either their variety is skewed, or the server doesn't know one blue cheese from the next, but Providence hit the nail on the head with this one.  We discussed which cheeses we tended to like, and the server gave us three to snack on, and again the sommelier helped pair wines that would go with the cheeses.  It was so amazingly great that I had to ask the waiter to write down the names of the cheeses for me, so if I came across them I could buy them in bulk. If you're looking for a night to remember, feasting on ambrosia, you need to look no further than Providence.  It'd even be a great spot if all you're looking for is to have a bottle of wine and some great cheeses with some friends or that special someone.  Perfect for anniversaries, birthdays, or just a romantic night out, I highly suggest this restaurant.

Ah, LA.  How I miss seeing a cute little restaurant tucked away in the midst of a semi-ghetto neighborhood! Modern chic decor (I like), with barnacle-like white on brown walls giving you a "under the sea" feel.   I was still a bit jet-lagged and wasn't feeling up to too much food, so I started with the kumamoto oysters (you can't go wrong with these, standard delicious oysters), then had the spaghetti alla chitarra (good, I love my uni any day, any plate).  Dessert was the passion fruit mango gel off their dessert tasting menu and that that was phenomenal.  Absolutely phenomenal.  And our waiter was very sweet and brought us these mojito and screwdriver jelly cubes when we asked about them (I think frozen and jelli-fied with nitrogen?) which turned out to be the best part of the meal! I think I'm skipping the meal and going straight to their 6-course dessert tasting next time.

It's been well over a year since I dined here, so while I don't remember every single detail I'd be remiss if I didn't say what a great experience the mrs. and I had at Providence.   First things first, Cocktails + Molecular Gastronomy = Best.Amuse.Bouche.Ever.  The most memorable were the Gin & Tonic in gelee form and an egg yolk-esque Mojito (think thin solid layer on the outside, liquid on the inside).  We were also treated to an extensive bread selection, my favorite of which was the Bacon Brioche.  It has bacon, how could it not be? For dinner I went with the 5 course tasting menu along with wine pairings.  Highlights included a course of hamachi with puffed rice crisps and flowering coriander, as well as a tasty veal tenderloin that was uber tender (hence the name?).  I thoroughly enjoyed each course and the wine pairings were spot on.  Pricing is definitely on the high side but you'll definitely get the experience and service to match.  Those two Michelin stars are well-earned and I would definitely go back if I was in town with a little extra cash to burn.

I won't be able to compete with all the eloquent words used to describe this restaurant by other reviewers. So let me put this in layman's term .. Go here, it's worth it. Try the tasting menu at least once. Don't compare the portion to AYCE KBBQ Get the prawns baked in salt. It's good. Don't go when Chef Cimarusti is on vacation. There's plenty of parking on the street so you don't have to Valet. you can thank me later.  ;-)

We were the first ones in on a Monday night, but the room quickly filled up, making it less awkward.  There's a good amount of noise, but tables are spaced far enough apart so that you're not overhearing too many conversations .  The decor on the walls is interesting, and the dining room feels quite intimate. We did the 5 course tasting menu, which included kanpachi (very fresh and interesting combination of fruits and vegetables on the plate), a seared scallop (my favorite), turbot with hearty shiso flavor and burdock, veal (very tender, with flavorful chantarelles), and a dessert course.  We weren't too interested in the dessert listed, so we were allowed to pick our own off the menu.  The cheescake was a weird swirl of creamy stuff drawn across the plate, and the presentation was really random.  The other dessert was chocolate and came with chocolate pretzels and a cool champagne sorbet.  The most memorable part was the trio of amuse bouches, which had molecular gastronomy-like textures and alcohol involved.  Warm bacon brioche to start kind of melts in your mouth and really gets your appetite going. Good to know - free corkage on Mondays for parties of less than 10. Service was attentive, as plates were cleared quickly but appropriately.  The servers knew the menu well and were very gracious.  However, the sommelier was a bit intimidating (maybe because we brought out own bottle?) Street parking is available about 1 block away, but there's also valet.  It's at the location of the old Patina, I believe.

Had the tasting menu here with my girlfriend on her birthday last year. It remains one of the best meals I've ever eaten in my life. The server was incredibly pleasant. The food is so good here that they forced me to like dishes that I normally don't eat. Whatever you see on their menu, be advised that they will likely give you the best version of that item you have ever had. That was my experience anyway. It wouldn't be an every night type of place for me, but I am looking forward to the special occasion that brings me back.

I came here with extremely high expectation, hence my review might be biased. I did have a good time here. As usual, I only go for the chef's tasting menu and the followings are what I had: (AB) mojito, screwdriver 1) Kumamoto Oyster 2) Oysterplant 3) Naked cowboy oyster 4) Abalone, Squid and chorizo 5) Scallop nasturtium 6) Engawa - yuzu kosho, oro blanco, mung beans 7) Santa Barbara spot Prawn 8) King Salmon Belly 9) Octopus 10) Unagi with dashi butter and foie gras sauce - my favorite of the night 11) striped bass face 12) Wagyu beef 13) cheese 14) jicama, raspberry, lemongrass, perilla 15) ceme fraiche, sable breton 16) whipped chocolate ganache The food is good, just not as great as I want it will be. Some dishes definitely hit the spot, extremely creative, some dishes are just good. Through the menu, I feel like i'm being built up and when i'm ready for the top, it just flatten out. If there's just one more dish to push me to over the top, it would've been a complete meal. Don't get me wrong though, I think the place is awesome, I just expected more. I will definitely come back, just not right away.

What a disappointment.  The service was just poor for an establishment of this caliber. I took my parents for my father's birthday and specified on the phone when I made the reservation that he loved fish but didn't eat shellfish.  No problem. He had a hard time finding an appetizer he could order and the waiter wasn't very sympathetic.  (he doesn't eat foie either, which became a limitation).  The entrees were good but the unaccommodating attitude ruined the evening for us. 4 stars for food, zero stars for service, I would never return.

I really wanted to like this place.  I wanted so much to be able to write a similarly glowing review to those other 1000 diners that matches its 2 star status.  However I simply can't help but feel somewhat let down after all the built up expectation.  I've been to Providence twice to try the chef's tasting menu--once to celebrate a friend's promotion and another during their anniversary.  Both nights had their highlights, but overall the service was kind of a let down (perhaps because I'm not a drinker and didn't seem like the sort of customer who would generate a big ticket but that was still no excuse for not making me feel welcome).  Some of the food was great, the scallop and the sauces were delicious.  The fish immaculately cooked.  The cheeses were quite delightful.  And the candies at the end.  However there were some places in the meal that kind of didn't work as well.  The bread was cold and tough and dry and flavourless.  The gelee in the amuse bouche was fun but bleh in terms of flavour.  I liked the other thing on there, a truly unique salmon mousse complete with salty crunchy skin that I wish more of the food could be like.  The meat course (a sous vide veal loin) was completely lacklustre and left me wanting more flavour.  Unfortunately for the poor veal the asparagus on the plate was crunchy and perfect and in every way more desirable.  I keep trying to figure out why I'm not similarly wowed by this place that everyone in LA seems to rave about.  I think at the end of it is that it is too LA.  The flavours are safe and boring and it's more about the glam and the hype and the dressing up.  I want to be wowed by a restaurant like this, but for the price and the hype it leaves me feeling curiously flat and disappointed after my visits.

I was always a fan of Chef Cimarusti since he was at Watergrill. Funny thing is I find his meats to be better than his fish. In an interview he spoke about fish being more challenging and I think he has just mastered both. So, go even if you are not into seafood. Granted I like sauces and some of the fish lacked enough sauce for my liking, but overall the dishes are just exceptional. I didn't do a tasting menu for budgeting reasons, but I'm certain that's the best bet. The service was good and it's a fun place to go and you can eat at the bar, so it's easy to just stop by for a bite if you're showered. He even came by and let us see the kitchen, chill guy. Best dishes I had: Clam chowder, scallops with black truffle cream, foie gras ravioli

Costs a pretty penny (came out to near $200/person, and we didn't even do the most pricey thing there) but very worth it. All the dishes were well-executed: we did the tasting menu with wine pairings and it was simply 3 hours and 9 courses of pure delight, from the cute soup 'n salad amuse (carrot soup with curry foam, dungeness crab stack salad with lemon jelly) to the assorted mostly-seafood entrees (we had john dory, scallops, sweetbread and salmon) to made-at-tableside soda, wonderful cheese plate and wicked desserts. For the full course-by-course lowdown with photos: http://la-oc-foodie.blog… Definitely worth coming for that special occasion (or even a not-so-special one... if you're ordering things a la carte it's more like $50-70/person), it's definitely on my list for a return trip (if only for drinks & their dessert tasting menu!)

So my aunt and uncle wanted to take me out to an "expensive seafood restaurant". I decided to pick Providence because my cousin had said it was one of his fav places in LA (and Chef Michael was just on Top Chef a few months ago).  Anyway I was about 20 min late for my reservation.  I called them up and let them know (it wasn't a problem and the staff was really understanding about it).   We were seated and the three of us decided to order the tasting menu (I also got the wine pairing).  The first thing that was brought out was the chef's cocktail amuse (gin & tonic gelee, mojito sphere, and carrot soup).  It was super creative and you could definitely taste the alcohol in it.  I liked the fact that we had to squeeze the lime onto the gin & tonic gelee.   The first course was a Japanese Kampachi with endive.  It was fresh and didn't have that fishy taste at all.  Then came the seared scallops with heri coverts and bacon in a white wine sauce.  It was soo good (the sauce was amazing).  Next we had the halibut with shiso roasted tomato and burdock root.  It was good and the fish was flake-y and delicious.  Then came the veal tenderloins with roasted potatoes, sweet potato puree, parsley, and hazelnut.  The veal was tender and the hazelnut actually went really well with the dish.  Lastly, we had the miso cheesecake with black sesame puree, matsumoto peaches, and peach sorbet.  I was probably most intrigued with this dish (miso cheesecake??) but it was probably the only semi-letdown.  It wasn't that great (the black sesame crust wasn't to my liking)..but still okay nonetheless. They also give you bread..as much as you want.  The bacon brioche was soo good and I definitely had seconds and thirds on that.  The wines were also great (mainly because I like white wines and it was mostly whites since we were having seafood).  The riesling and the mascato d'asti were my two favorites. Meal was delicious.  Food was pricey (good thing I didn't have to pay because hell, I'm barely employed and would not have been able to afford a $100 meal, haha) but reallllly good.   Chef Michael was even at the hostess stand when we were leaving and was nice and asked us how our meal was!  Good service and good food? Five stars!

Once again, I didn't think this restaurant was as great as I expected.  My friend and I ordered the tasting menu (9 courses with wine pairings). The food was mediocre at best (for the price) with many uninspired dishes. They have a 17/20 on Gayot and 2 Michelin stars. I think they deserved one star. There are 4 restaurants in LA with 2 Michelin stars (none with 3). Melisse is a much better restaurant than Providence.  Spago...UGH. Lastly, Urasawa, which is most definitely deserving of that status. ATMOSPHERE - It was pleasant and lovely. I thought the shellfish and barnacles along the walls and ceilings was creative. SERVICE - Perfectly fine. FOOD - There are few restaurants that offer a seafood tasting menu and comparatively, I think Le Bernardin does it better.  The chef needed to seriously edit.  Many of the dishes were a little messy in flavours and overworked. - Gin and tonic gelee, mojito ball, and saffron shot - I usually prefer to start my meals with something savory but the mojito ball was the highlight of my evening.  It just burst in your mouth and was so delightful. - Kanpachi with persimmon sauce - The best part was the sauce. - Squid version of pad tai. They used thinly sliced squid in lieu of the noodles. This dish had well balanced flavours and just the right amount of heat. - Scallop with truffle on top - Well cooked but didn't have much flavour. - Fish with a light buerre blanc sauce - There was a sun dried tomato on top and I think an olive oil foam. Snoooooze, totally boring dish. - Arctic char with a sherry sauce and piece of pumpkin - Awful, awful dish. The pumpkin was raw and flavourless. The sherry sauce completely overwhelmed whatever fish flavour remained. There was also this limp and overcooked piece of green on top. - Veal tenderloin - This was a well cooked piece of meat without any dressings. The meat wasn't flavourful enough to hold its own so it needed a sauce of some sort to accent it. This dish was completely uninspired. - Amuse bouche with celery sorbet on top of green apple bits - This dish was VILE. I found it almost offensive. I didn't spit it out but I came close. I still had the horrible celery taste on my palate 2 dishes later. - Cheese course - Shizo gelato on top of a lychee gelee, which is in a coconut tapioca ball soup. - There are bits of coconut flakes, peanut bits, and micro mint. The shizo gelato was actually quite interesting but the lychee gelee was so sour that it overpowered the whole dish. The best part was actually the coconut tapioca soup. There was too much going on in this dessert. It was light but the flavours didn't complement each other that well. Completely overworked. I don't plan on coming back.  It had good ambiance but the food was just so average.  I've attached photos but they're poor in quality. I forgot my camera and only had a cell phone on me.

I am in town on vacation and needed to take our host out to dinner.  I am a bit fussy on all levels but always review apprpriately I think.  I have been around the block and eat out a lot especially on our 4 month U.S. vacation so wanted somewhere nice, good value but fabulous as a thank you to our host. I cross checked a ton of review sites to find Providence and I was so glad it worked out. The place is apparantly in not the best part of town and you could kind of see that.  However, with valet parking at $5.50 who cares, we dumped our car and walked in.  We had a 6:30 pm booking which I did on opentable and got 1000 points as it was an early booking, very nice thank you.   Place was empty apart from one couple but it filled up very fast. Our first Amuse bouche (free) course was what looked like 3 teeny courses from the 11 course tasting menu as someone else mentioned.  We were all having the 5 course tasting menu at $65 an incredible value. Anyway to cut a long story short.  Stunning stunning meal.  The Veal course was the least interesting and it was still very good.  Our favourite I think was actually the amuse bouche which was stunning, textural, flavourful and delicious. We had the wine pairings which brought it up to $100 per person for effectively 6 courses.  Totally totally worth the money and one of the best restaurant experiences I have had in years. GO AND ENJOY

I was more than lucky that my wonderful wife suprised me with Providence for my 30th birthday. All the reading here on Yelp and online does not give it justice on how remarkable this restaurant is.

Providence is to food as the Met is to art. You'll enjoy your time there and stare at the items in front of you;  you'll ponder how it was done, how many hands it took; you'll pay a pretty penny but believe it was worth the experience; you'll talk with the staff and they'll impress you with their knowledge of the space and its focus: food or, as I'd truly call it, art. The most expensive dinner my husband and I have ever had but a very fun evening to celebrate 3 years of food-filled marriage.  We'll be back... maybe when three more years have rolled on by.

I wanted to dine somewhere special for my birthday, so of course why not celebrate at the highly acclaimed and Michelin star rated Providence. Decor: is clean, contemporary and elegant. Service: top notch, friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. Now to food... With being awarded Michelin stars and of course with a nice price tag to follow you expect to be presented with the best. The food was solid, had clean flavors, everything cooked to perfection and presented beautifully yet it was missing something. I not once had a "WOW" this is amazing from any of our entrees, aside from a side dish of duck fat potato on my brothers prime NY. Now that I can say was probably one of the best things I have ever ate! Soooo rich and flavorful, I just hoped that my entire meal besides a measly side of potato were to give me the same reaction, however it didn't. We had the foie gras ravioli with both black and white truffles, the John Dory, the wild King Salmon, Prime NY and Sea Bass which were all good yet not great. I'd say overall my experience up to this point is a 3.5. However, the only reason my review is receiving 4 stars was due to the desserts that were presented compliments of the chef. Somehow he heard I was celebrating my birthday and a few other things so he sent out this dark chocolate and peanut butter, tamarind and banana dish. I have to say this man is a GENIUS! Not because he sent me out free desserts, although this does give him bonus points. But he literally sent out one of, scratch that...THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER EATEN! Who thinks of combining...peanut butter, tamarind, banana and jalapeno? And who actually makes this taste AMAZINGGG!!! He does, If i could have, I would've walked into the kitchen and hugged him for presenting me with an amazing birthday gift. Many many thank yous to Pastry Chef Adrian Vasquez, he would be the only reason for me to return just to be able to get a taste of heaven once again ha ha.

I went here for my birthday last year with a few friends for the Chef's table.  The food was fantastic and its a great splurge for me.  Every course was unique and thought provoking.  Even if I did not like the dish, I appreciated the effort. Service was impeccable and the restaurant itself is beautiful.  Parking can imagine might be difficult. I was not fond of the macaroons or the caramels.

Seafood done right. I got the 5 course and every platter was beautifully designed, delicious and good portions. The lamb plate was cooked just enough to perfection, melted in my mouth. The little mojito jellys were fun to eat and refreshing. I loved almost every dish. *great service *parking on street or valet

Actual review is 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4 because I'm feeling generous... I went here chasing Michael Cimarusti's footsteps, as his former restaurant, Water Grill, was and still is the best American-style seafood restaurant in all of Los Angeles.  So we came to Providence with high expectations, considering the chef's pedigree and rave reviews.  We got the 9-course prix fix.  It was good, but not wow-good.  Seafood courses were fresh, dishes were intricate and artistic.  However my wife and I came out of there wonder:  what's with all the jello-shots?  It's like being back in college again!  I don't know, maybe this is nouveau cooking, but it may be too nouveau for my taste.  I'll stick with Water Grill, sans-Cimarusti!

My new favorite restaurant! I had the Chefs tasting course with the wine pairing and loved everything! I loved the bubbly jelly thing in the beginning and the celery sorbet too! The, baby hamachi, veal, 2 fish courses, cheese..and a whole bunch of other stuff were all really good and perfectly portioned. The wines were all really good! I can't wait to go again.

AMAZING SERVICE I took some clients here for dinner and we decided we'd do the full blown tasting menu, 13 courses and 4 hours later the amazing experience was complete. I watched a TV show with Chef Cimarusti and was impressed with his passion, knowledge and pairings. He thought through everything from the wine to the garnish for each course. Make sure you order the salt cooked prawns, amazing taste and presentation. Just noticed they got a two star Michelin!

Providence is one of the best restaurants in Los Angeles. I would frequent it more if it was closer to the Santa Monica area.I Luckily I was invited for a dinner early this year and I have dine three additional times and will return more often. The restaurant takes pride in the food and service. Every item I have had has been excellent. Some of my favorites are the Japanese Kanpachi, Foie Gras Saute, King Crab, Salted Shrimp, Maine Lobster Risotto, Sea Scallops and many items that change on their "Market Menu" The atmosphere is subdued but nice. The experience is more on the level of fine dining. Some items are prepared table side such as the Salted Shrimp, Japanese Wagyu and items that are served for two. Desserts are worth having. The wine list is quite good and the sommelier is quite friendly and not pushy. The service staff are all friendly but reserved. They have a bar area that is nice but most of the people come here to dine. Great for a date, business dinner or a romantic occasion. Valet parking is available like most restaurants in LA.

Seeing Chef Cimarusti on Top Chef Masters reminded me that I have eaten at his wonderful restaurant.  We were celebrating and went all out; tasting menu, wine and apertifs plus tip came to around $500.  It was insanely delicious, just out of this world.  The service was a delight.  We had course after tiny course of beautifully presented dishes.  With the sole exception of a cold curried carrot soup, which I did not care for, everything was delicious.  Note that my husband loved that soup, so YMMV. As is often the case which Cali haute cuisine, the atmosphere was quite casual.  People at the table next to ours were wearing jeans.  Other than Lawry's does anyone dress for dinner anymore? If you've got the scratch, Providence is for you.

Surprised the Fiance and took her to this place on Monday for our one year anniversary.  Everything was what I expected from this place after reading all the reviews.  Service was excellent and the food was top notch.  We haven't gone to Joel Robuchon's place at the Mansion in Vegas, but we always wanted to experience this type of dining and we finally were able to experience it.  The staff definitely made you feel that you were the Shizz Nit aka Royalty and always checked to see if we were doing ok, filled our wines glasses constantly, and explained to us in detail what each dish was.  We had the 9 course tasting menu and I would recommend that this should be at least the minimum.   Prior to making my reservation, I checked their website and under the wine section, it mentions that Monday's have no corkage fees for parties of 10 or less.  I definitely took advantage of this and I didn't feel embarrassed or shy at all because about 3/4 of the tables all brought their own wine.  For a normal $30 corkage fee, it's well worth it!  So, I brought in 3 bottle, but only opened 2.  The Assistant Sommelier was very professional and very pleasant to talk to.  It was the first asian or vietnamese Asst. Sommelier that we've ever ran into and we thought that was cool. He knew his wines and we offered him a glass of our wine. I agree with everyone that this place is not cheap.  However, if you ever want to try this place and save a little money and get wasted, go on Mondays!

Came here with the family for Mother's day this year--delayed review, I know. We were all blown away. This raised our culinary awareness to the next level. My dad didn't mind the check, saying that it was worth every penny. The service was great, without a drop of snootiness. Will definitely come back... hopefully forever. It's absolutely exquisite.

This is one of those places that you HAVE to eat at least once in your lifetime.  Very classy and very pricey.  And this is all well worth it.  The food is incomparable.  I have yet to go to a restaurant that has served food so well (the waiters are basically catering to your every need) and proper.  Each bite you take, it's like a explosion of tasty elegance in your mouth. The place is beautifully decorated with sea shells, very calming and soothing.  I had the salmon, which was so fresh, it melted in my mouth.  My friend had the duck, which I had never tried before, but I had a bite it was fantastic. You have to have like a 4 or 5 course meal when you go there (I don't remember exactly).   The dishes are pretty tiny, but the taste is so well put together that you don't even notice how small your food portion is. I had the carrot cake dessert, it was put together in a unique way.  The cream on one side and the sponge part of the cake on the other and you had to put them together.  That was also delicious. Definitely go here if you want to wine and dine someone special or yourself.  It is well worth it :)

Finally.  A trip to Providence.  The expectations were extremely high.... We arrived a bit early and took a seat at the bar.  Took the advice of another reviewer and ordered up the Arsenal.  I'm normally not much of a bourbon drinker but when you throw in blackberries, agave nectar and a puree of passion fruit - I'm in.  It went down easy.  Probably too easy.  I'll take another please.  Dinner called and before heading off I asked my new best friend to use those mixologist skills to hook me up a vodka based dinner drink.  After being seated I anxiously awaited the arrival of my beverage.  What hit the table was an outstandingly prepared cucumber martini.  I could get use to these kind of cocktails. Come to think of it I'd better not.. drinks this good could lead to a problem. It was a bit late so we opted to go for the 5-course prix fixe menu rather than the 9 or 12 course selection.  Rather than go into great detail about each of the dishes I'll just hit the feature portions: 1st Course - Kampachi 2nd Course - Seared Scallop 3rd Course - Grouper 4th Course - Veal (BEST I've ever had by far) 5th Course - Chocolate, avocado cream sauce, vanilla ice cream The preparation and presentation of each dish is virtually flawless.  The expectation of what's next is met head on with the bar being raised. Quite simply Providence is everything it's said to be.  I'll be back for the 12 course prix fixe menu in the near future.

An ultimate dream come true! Where else can you have 8 courses of dessert with dessert wine pairings! Once I heard about this place, it was a definite must do once I schedule a visit to Southern California. How lucky I was to obtain reservations for 6! and then switched to 2 and then to 4 and back to 6, and yes, they were oh so accomodating! Service was impeccable with each course served in unison to the entire party. I swooned with every sip and bite. Complexity of plating and taste was evident in each dish served. Favorite standouts were the kalamansi gelee as well as the whisky chocolate panna cotta. Both dishes had the perfect balance of flavor and temperature and texture. They were intricately plated with detailed garnishes that enhance the overall taste experience. SUBLIME!

First thing I've got to suggest is, if you're going for dinner - skip lunch.  There's just too much that you'll want to try and they provide you a couple amuse bouches along the way, so you will get a good amount of food, even if you don't get the nine course tasting menu, but have some drinks. It's a two-star Michelin restaurant, so it's going to be shi-shi; roll with it. The service is impeccable.  The waiter is so knowledgable about the food, but not in a snooty way.  He's kind of like a food somellier.  He can describe how it's all prepared and can make suggestions based on what your tastes are.  There is an Asian seafood fusion thing going on, of which I am normally not a fan of, but this place takes it to a whole new level.  At no point do you not feel like you are in the presence of incredible professionals. We went for a work dinner with seven people, so there was a lot on the table, so I won't try to describe everything.   Some highlights were the frozen mojito amuse buche, the one bite tasmanian sea bass, the duck breast entree (super crispy skin), the lobster risotto, the oysters,  and the handmade 20 piece chocolate sampler for dessert.  There is a lot more, but I honestly can't remember them all. Pinot Noir from Anderson Valley by the glass was perfect.  Only negative was a bad white wine recommendation to go with the fish.  I could have switched it out, but by that time I was pretty much in Happy Time, so I didn't care that much. Save it for a special occasion, since it's not cheap, but you won't leave disappointed.

Letting us shelling it and eating it ourselves. Oysters were good. Bacon bread! Awesome! Omg foie gras ravioli was aaaaaamazing. super amazing. will go back for more. the fish...wild john dory. yum yum yum. Service was slow at the beginning but gradually got better as dinner prolonged. Awesome dessert and nice chef, came out and greeted us. Nice waiter, took us for a tour around the kitchen. What a good looking staff hiding in the kitchen...........

I must come here to try their tasting menu as unfortunately my large party for a friends birthday weren't thrilled with the idea of food coma before hitting the town. I did however get to try the kobe steak and let's just say I was in pure heaven. My heart probably stopped for a couple of seconds from the injection of fat I put into my body but if I were to die eating this I must say it was a good death. Service was spectacular and the decor was crisp yet warm.

One of the best dining experiences I've ever had. it was excellent pretty much all around. beautiful restaurant, beautiful people! haha. the only slight downside? my server didn't really explain what we were eating very well; however, when there were 1 or 2 dishes that were brought out by others and they did an excellent job of explaining what we were eating. Somewhat of an inconsistency in the service; but still worth a trip here.

I came here for Father's day and had the 5 course tasting menu.  I won't go over it course by course since that's already been done.  Suffice to say, everything was delicious, just as it always is at Providence.  I'm not sure I know of a more consistent restaurant in LA.  I especially liked the amuse with a gin & tonic bit, margarita on a spoon, and salmon/creme fraiche/something crunchy/gold flakes.  We added on a cheese plate to our meal (because I miscounted courses and thought I'd still be hungry), which I don't recommend doing - it was $30 for 5 cheeses (which totaled probably 8 oz) & accoutrements, and the cheese was yum, but nothing that I thought tasted much better than cheeses I could find at Whole Foods.  Although it does come out on fun a flashy cart and some of it is made in a bathtub in Washington. I love the sea-inspired ambiance and decor of the restaurant.  It's fun yet classy.  That and the staff always make the meal a special one.  The one thing that struck me from the last time I was here (more than 3 years ago) was that the service seems to have declined ever so slightly.  The last time I was here, the server said "Cheers" after every sentence and changed our tablecloth after the first few courses, since we were dirty bunnies and had breadcrumbs/various spills on it.  This time, bread was slow getting replenished (I love my bread, even though it takes up valuable real estate in my tummy), which was only an issue because it was just a bit too long between courses, enough for me to wonder if they'd forgotten which # course we were on.  However, they were very nice about modifying certain courses to meet 3 of my 4 person table's dietary needs. Overall, I love Providence and would love to come back when the occasion calls.

I've been to Providence three times and I must say every visit is a better visit and that's saying a lot because how does one top an excellent meal?   The waiters and staff are amazing and attentive.  They're friendly and non judgmental.  They explain every dish that comes out with great care and seem to take great pride in presenting to us. My first visit involved a never ending feast. I think we had a 17 course meal because that's what it felt like.  The only minor minor downside is that they serve the heaviest dish - the kobe beef (or it felt heavy because we were stuffed out of our minds with really great dishes) last.  So I felt I was letting the chef down because I couldn't enjoy the dish as much as I could. Every bite is breathtakingly good.  The flavors are thoughtful and mesmerizing.   The dessert tasting is also to die for and I must say I was overly eager and ambitious thinking I could go for a 5 course + wine pairing tasting.  This goes the same for any tasting you do at Providence. They don't let you down and I promise you'll be stuffed with deliciousness.   Overall it's delightful experience and I would come back here in a heartbeat...after I save up for it.

The finest restaurant Los Angeles has to offer. With an ever changing menu it is unlikely that you will have the same meal twice. In that way it is difficult to recommend anything specifically. What can be said is that the food is excellent. Be it the tasting menu or the ala carte Providence delivers fantastic food. This is also home to one of LA's finest bartenders Zahra Bates. With such a fine bartender this is perhaps the only restaurant in LA that will pair food with cocktails well. The wine here is also very good, but  that can be done at many restaurants in LA. Only here can you get a tasting menu paired with cocktails executed perfectly. The restaurant is also open later then most. Which is great for dessert reservations. Yes after a meal elsewhere a great way to end the evening is with dessert and a cocktail at Providence. I haven't done the chef's tasting which takes a little over 4.5 hours. But I look forward to it. Service is impecable. Waiters are well versed in everything you throw at them. Every request is taken with grace and care. I make plans for my next reservation at Providence with every meal I have here and after every bad meal I have elsewhere.

Don't have much more to add to the great reviews.  It's one of my favorites for fine dining and seafood, one of LA's best in more ways than one, imho deserving of the Michelin status compared to some others on the list that's far cry from first class. Only been here few times thus far, always impressed.  Even the one time I wasn't feeling the best so I skipped the tasting menu and ordered only a risotto, it was still that good.   Service here is always impeccable yet personable, down to every fine detail.  The cheese they recommend is always excellent.  even the caramel they leave at the end leaves me wanting more.  When I had diet restrictions, our waitress was more than accomodating.  The service is first class! Some fine dining experience is exactly that, an experience.  Once I've been there, done that, I wouldn't think of going back often for one reason or another, ie..maybe just not worth the price tag.  IMHO Providence is priced reasonably for the quality you get.  I will go back again and again not just for special occasions. I haven't had to valet, always found metered spots on Cole.

Took my bf out here for his birthday so we decided to try the five course tasting menu with wine pairing.  My belly was about to burst by the third plate and I lost count cause they also gave us a couple of extra treats :) Service is excellent.  I love how they explain each dish and the regions of the wine and how each wine complements the dish.  Each dish was flavorful and cooked to perfection.  The wine was excellent as well and definitely brought out the flavors of each dish served.  My bf loved the warm bacon bread.   My bf loves truffles so we asked if we can have them in one of our dishes.   I feel like he's a truffles expert cause if his brother makes him fly to italy to search for the best truffles in the world, then I'm guessing he can distinguish the different tastes.  I will be honest I don't know the difference, I've always thought they were chocolates that you receive during the holidays or are they? ..... This restaurant is definitely a treat if you ever want to celebrate a special occasion and spend some hard earn cash.  Definitely pricy and worth trying once but I definitely won't be frequenting this joint weekly.  I'd give it 4.5 stars.  They did have excellent service and the food and wine were excellent, but it is very pricy and I know its a 2 star michelin restaurant, but it's still extremely pricy.  If I had to choose between a flight or the cost of the meal? I think I take a flight somewhere new. But I definitely say it is worth giving a try once in your life.  It's about experiencing new and different things.

Loved it. We were shocked at how affordable this place was, for such great fresh seafood! I am very picky about seafood, but not by choice. My stomach cannot handle any seafood unless it's super super super fresh. I can't even go to 99% of sushi restaurants because of this... and I LOVE sushi!! =*( We had the 9 course, and every single dish was perfection. I could see all the Japanese influences Cimarusti infused into his dishes (which is obvious since he has been training in Japan quite often this days). I am in love with his dashi foam!! Oh, and HELL to the YEAH on him getting his kanpachi from Kagoshima (my hometown). Woot! The man clearly knows his fish!! One small thing I was disappointed about was the service. No doubt they had excellent service, but it was still not on par with other restaurants of this caliber. For example, when my husband was making his cheese selections, another server came over and started discussing another customer's request right in front of us. Was it that urgent that you could not wait 2 minutes to ask? Can you please do this later? I was a bit annoyed to say the least. Overall, great experience, and a restaurant I'm more likely to frequent if I'm ever in the area.

It's not very helpful, but it goes without saying that the food here is delicious. Beyond the actual quality of the food from Providence is the creativity of the menu items and the attentiveness of the dining staff. I'm not a picky eater and will love almost any bread you give me. Providence provided me with a basket of BACON brioche and nori (seaweed) focaccia. Swoon. I had food coma before any actual menu items were served. I am a cheap date. Free bread and some not so free wine. Done. Despite being full of bread, I ate the rest of the course and even took the time to appreciate the flavors (I usually eat like the cookie monster), because the food was flavorFULL not just well-cooked. We also received a beautiful box full of their house-made chocolates because there was a delay in seating us at a table. Forgiven!

FAV: wine pairing with tasting menu Came in for my birthday last august with the BF and everything could not go better!! we got the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing, i wasn't a big fan of wine at the time, but this place did an amazing job with every one. Each of the wines complemented the course perfectly, from the amuse bouche to the dessert, i couldn't have asked for a better meal. by the time i got to the fourth course, which was the veal i couldn't even breathe and had to take the rest home, which the servers were perfectly fine with packing up for me. the service was amazing, there was always someone on hand if we needed anything (take pictures, more bread, packing up leftovers). this place is definitely top notch, but with that comes a hefty price tag, so if you are heading here for dinner expect a little dent in your wallet when you leave.

Okay, this place was amazing. I entered hoping to have an amazing meal and left with an epic dining experience! A quick summary, the staff was amazing and friendly (Anyone wanting the staff to be silent, invisible stone statues, go back to the East coast, this is LA. If I wanted a somber dinner I would go to the morgue.), the food was fantastic in taste, beautiful in presentation, and amazingly executed. Our waiters were great, being friendly and funny and talkative without getting annoying.  The wine pairings were all hits, complementing the food very well. The sommelier was almost perfect with each selection. The fluidity of the chef and kitchen was fantastic - anything we could think of, we got, including making a couple alterations to a dish or the menu based on our tastes and pretty much had a unique dinner customized specifically for us, even to the point of ordering some of those delicious bacon brioche rolls to go.... I got there early and had a drink at the bar. I forget exactly what I had, but it had bourbon, bitters, and another one or two alcohols. Strong, and turned out surprisingly tasty with everything blending together into a coherant drink while not letting any one alcohol overpower the others. Definitely a good start. Once the rest of the party arrived, we were seated right away next to a large glass window with the wine cellar on the other side. Started off with a glass of Cab. I won't really review the wine, since that would be better suited for another website, but I will say that the wine list was long and didn't disappoint. Anyway, on to the food!  First off was bread, with a selection of nori focaccia, bacon brioche, and french rolls. I really loved the nori focaccia. It was dense and soft and salty and had a strong nori flavor that was awesome in bread form. Next we got into some amuse-bouches. First were the cocktails, a little sphere of screwdriver and a little crushed ice brick of mojito. Next we got miso marinated grilled abalone on a stick, and fried squid and chorizo on a stick. They finished up with a table full of goodies, puff pastry things filled and topped with tasty stuff. There was trout topped with caviar, mozzarella topped with tomato confit, scrambled egg topped with caviar. The mozzarella one seemed a bit soggy so I wasn't the biggest fan, but the scrambled egg one made up for it. We also got a shot glass of tomato water soup with fennel foam which was my favorite. The fennel foam was a perfect compliment and balanced the tomato. Finished off the amuse-bouches with some very (overly?) salty fried crispy salmon skin and rice crackers. The first course was tuna tartare with a quail egg on top and served with nori crackers. I loved it! The tuna was fresh and tasted great, the quail egg added that little bit of richness to the dish, and the nori crackers had that fishy sea flavor that went really well with the whole thing. It was fun to eat and was paired with a sweet, dry white (Riesling maybe?) which was perfectly paired. The crackers were the same as the amuse-bouche ones, a little bit too salty for my taste. The second course was a grilled Santa Barbara spot prawn with butter, salt, and lemon on the side. It was a BIG prawn that had a great smokey flavor. It went even better with the smokey butter, although I preferred just some lemon and salt to keep the taste light and focus on the prawn. Next up was a foie gras ravioli with a huge, thing slice of black truffle on top. The dish was fantastic. It was rich and complex while keeping all of the flavors balanced, and the truffle gave a perfect earthiness to the dish.   The fourth course was truffle risotto with a metric crap-ton of black truffle grated on top. Like the ravioli, this had full of flavor and nothing was overpowering, it all just balanced out and melded together perfectly. The truffle was amazing, too, and seeing the amount of truffle on my plate made me want to take it and run, before anyone could think that they should take some back. It was MY truffle now. The fifth course was wagyu beef with bone marrow gastric, potatoes, and some other goodies on the plate. It was amazing, super tender and full of flavor. The final course was dessert, a sketchy looking chocolate raspberry ganache with ginger meringue, graham cracker crumbles, raspberries, and graham cracker ice cream. It was probably the best dessert I've ever tasted. Super rich to the point of making the dish seem like a huge portion, and all of the little extras around the plate were fun and delicious to play with. If you don't want to spend the big bucks for a full meal, at least come here for the dessert! Finished up with petit fours.  =A caramel candy, a little sandwich cookie thing, a fruity jelly candy, and probably something else I'm forgetting.   Overall experience was amazing and while it's not something that I'm going to be doing very often, I hope I get to come back for another dinner experience before too long.

This is our favorite restaurant in LA and it is always yummy. We go about 2x/year b/c it is pricey-about $300 for 2 people for the 5 course meal and 2-3 glasses of wine.  The food is consistently great but for the past 6 years, the menu hasn't changed much. We love providence and glad that is is still consistently great but wish they would change the menu up a little more. Can't wait to see you again next year Providence!

Providence was great! Well worth the money. Service was immaculate. It was a busy night but the service was great never had to ask for anything.  We order the 9 course dinner, which was about $125 per person without tips and tax.  It was a 3 hours meal. They explained each item to us. I love tasting menus bc u get to try a bit of everything and so you dont get bored of eating the same thing. I would recommend this restaurant to my friends and to try their 9 course meal if it's the first time... especially nice for dates.

Not accommodating; inflexible to requests. I wanted to take my wife here for our anniversary. We've never been before and I wanted to do this right - have the Chef's Menu while my wife had the Vegetarian Menu. Problem is, you can't do that. Both parties need to have the same number of courses. And I'm totally fine with that. Problem is, the maximum number of Vegetarian courses is 9 while the Chef's Menu is 15+ (it's a difference of about 2 hours in terms of dining experience). I asked if they would be willing to make an exception since I was planning on spending a lot of money that night and was told they'd call me back once they talked to the chef, and never did. I called back the next day, and told the same thing. Never got a call back. Then the third day I I asked if I could just pay extra for additional Vegetarian courses and was put on hold for a few minutes, and then told no. In short, it's not possible to get the Chef's Menu if your dining companion wants the vegetarian menu. Let me explain something here: Vegetarian tasting menus are not the most unheard-of thing with Michelin-star rated restaurants. The French Laundry does an *amazing* Vegetarian Chef's Tasting menu that is the same number of courses as their regular Chef's menu. As does Cyrus, Melisse, Meadowood, Joel Robuchon etc. And all of them don't just "do it" to please the palates of some...they do it right, and with purpose; they make veggies taste amazing. And I've dined at all of these places. Why Providence won't do a Vegetarian Chef's Menu is just beyond me. I had to go with another restaurant that was more than willing to accommodate the fact that one of us wanted a Vegetarian chef's tasting menu and the other didn't. Boo.

Lets just say Michelin got it right. There only one other restaurant in LA that compares you can search my reviews for that you but its basically invite only.  All I can say is Wow, I sat down with my hubby cousin and good friend for the experience of a life time.  Listen I'm not a foodie by any means but I do appreciate edible art.  They are known here for there Fish dishes, however my favorite was the duck!  Amazing!  We did the 16 course tasting it took a little over 4 hours, so get ready for it.  We brought our own wine 35 corkage fee, and thank god for that I don't think i would have been able to walk out of there if we did the wine pairing too!  Definitely an experience of a lifetime!

Being still somewhat new to LA, I was jonesing for some seafood and a friend recommended that I try Providence.  Since we went there on a whim after a movie, I was really under dressed but the staff never made me feel it.  On a cold night for LA, Providence was warm and elegant with fantastic food.  I feel my review might be a bit premature as I have only dined there once, but what the heck...I liked it enough to yelp about it. When it came to the service, all the staff were super personable without being annoying and the Sommelier was extremely helpful without being snobbish.  Both wines I had were truly delicious.  My husband and I both opted for the seafood chowder to start off with which was great for the cool night, but I thought the lardon might have made it a bit too salty.  The lobster risotto killed and I highly recommend ordering a full portion and sharing it with either your date or the table.  The seasonal scallops I had were super fresh and served with a delicate buttery mushroom cream sauce We opted for the cheese course instead of a dessert and which is so far the best selection of cheeses I have had at a restaurant in LA.    I'm a big fan of robust and stinky/gooey cheeses and each one we chose stood up to expectations. Like I said, I feel this review is premature as I usually like to review after a couple trips to the establishment and having sampled more of the menu, but my dinner last night was so good I had to speak up.  Look for more comments on their entrees after I have been there 3-5 more times.

Just went last night. 9 course full tasting. I'll do course by course recap: Amuse Bouche: "Mojito" gel, "gin and tonic" gel and a little shot glass with soup.  We had the "mojito" before, still good but a little bit unadventurous in terms of flavor, especially for all the work that goes into it. After all, it tastes pretty much like a mojito. Gin and Tonic elicited similar feelings but the soup was great! Japanese Kanpachi Sashimi: The fish (a sustainable breed of yellowtail tuna) was melt in your mouth tender. I set the coriander blossoms aside (unfortunately, coriander and cilantro taste like disgusting soap to me) Sort of a long wait in between these two courses. It let us get acquainted with the bacon brioche! Uni in farm fresh egg: How do you cut the eg like that? Very rich, savory flavor, the uni was a really subtle addition to the broth. The brioche croutons were a fantastic rich addition. sea scallops: best course, by far! beyond tender, perfectly seasoned! wild day boat pacific halibut: the fish itself was very ggood but served with this foam and burdock root that looked interesting but lacked any real flavor. only misstep of the night. wild river king salmon: amazing quality fish, the sauce was great too. served with a white "pinot noir" i think, where all the grapes had been skinned. roasted tenderloin of veal: i think this was cooked sous vide? with the only red wine of the night. perfectly cooked, amazingly tender with this garlic sauce on the side and a another wasabi (i think) sauce? market cheeses: it's a cheese cart man! rhubarb palate cleanser: just ok. the wild strawberries were nice but not amazing, i think we were still coming down from the cheese cart. kalamasi gel: has to be a favorite dessert of mine. i made sure ever last bite was eaten. overall one of the best meals i've had in my life. the grand total was in the high 300's but worth every penny. next time, a while from now i'm sure, i'll hold off on the wine pairings.

Like a country looking to invest its large current account surplus, my six-week haute respite had reached a critical mass. Nine months had passed and the Michelin Guide had awarded Providence a second Michelin star since our last meal, so it seemed fitting to revisit. Our effervescent server wasted his breath describing the entire menu because it was the nine-course tasting we were after. The inimitable amuse - mojito, gin and tonic, grapefruit-vodka - introduced me to liquor. Imbibing the grapefruit-vodka gel brought on a paroxysm of citrus. First course: Kanpachi sashimi, crispy rice crackers, coriander flowers, endive, soy crème fraîche. Of all the courses, only the kanpachi missed the mark. Coriander masked the fish's delicate flavor. Second course: Sea urchin roe, curdled farm egg, champagne beurre blanc, and brioche croutons. These luscious eggs could be eaten by the dozen. Third course: Seared scallop, yellow chanterelles, fava bean purée. I have not seen chanterelles at farmers' markets in months, which makes me more than a little envious of Chef Cimarusti's supplier. Each component - the chanterelles, scallop, and purée - had a silky finish, leaving a desire for something crunchy. Fourth course: Wild Pacific halibut, tomato compote, burdock, shiso, Meyer lemon foam. As a white fish devotee, I really liked the halibut; its alabaster flesh flaked into bite-sized quadrilaterals. Fifth course: Wild Washington King salmon, carrot-miso butter, carrots, baby leeks. Having professed my affinity for white fish, I should mention that no complaints surfaced when the medium rare wild salmon came out. Cracklings, mirroring the airy texture one finds in a pork grind, provided the right counterpoint to the fish's fatty flesh. Sixth course: Veal tenderloin, hazelnuts, roasted garlic, King Edwards potatoes, onion, veal jus. Deceptively large, this dish nearly filled me up. A caramelized onion, roasted garlic clove, and hazelnuts kept the tender loin, sitting in its own jus, from becoming too rich. Seventh course: Goat, Swiss, Époisses, Oregon blue.Providence boasts a formidable cheese cart. The tangy goat cheese, unpasteurized Époisses, and crumbly sheep's milk cheese from Oregon towered over the recumbent swiss' herbes de provence rind. As the savory courses receded, a quenelle fest ensued. All were smooth and refreshing. Eighth course: Strawberry sorbet, rhubarb, cassis, yogurt. Ninth course: Kalamansi gel, white chocolate coconut soy milk soup, litchi-shiso sorbet, granola. Adrian Vasquez, Providence's pastry chef, makes dessert worth looking forward to. His ice cream's concentrated flavor leaves one wondering, why cannot all ice cream taste so good? After finishing the petite fours - milk chocolate amaretto, salted caramels, hibiscus jellies - and the ten courses that preceded them, I sat in effete contentment, knowing that I had just experienced one of Los Angeles' best restaurants.

A lot of quality and thought go into this menu. Michael Cimarusti is a refined and classy chef who knows his seafood. The ambiance is so elegant but not pretentious. The cocktails are really good (and I'm not a cocktail kinda girl)! This is def a special food night kinda place - good for anniversaries, graduations, birthdays, and celebrations - so it's expensive. But to me, worth every penny.

Came here twice in one week for my birthday. Both time I got the 9 Course tasting menu. Hands down probably the best resturant i been to my whole life. This is not a resturant you want to eat everyday. Simply because you probalby didn't realize these kind of flavors exist. But don't get me wrong, I'm not saying its not good, but its like eating Ice cream for the very first time. I dont' know about you, but for me its kind of a sensory overload, Call me weaksauce, but until you try it you will understand what i mean. Providence tasting menu is a place to explore new taste in the world. The food comes second fiddle to the exploration of taste in your mouth. Not a resturant you go that often, but when you do go it will rock your socks off. IF its your first time get the tasting menu.. It rocks, and get the wine paring. If your spending 100 already.. what is another 50.. drop it like its haaawwwwttt.

If you are looking to experience good quality food - sea food specifically - this is the place to go. Remember you are going there for quality. My sister, cousin and I went here for dinner tonight. We were going to think of going alle carte but after some calculation my sister thought that it would be more cost efficient if we ordered the 5 course meal. We started out with am amuse bouche - 4 sea food dishes (yellow tail - a kind of carpacio, hallibut with 2 sauces, grilled scallop) and a meat dish (suvee veal), and for desert a miso cheese cake. Every course was truly a delight and satisfied my sense of sight, smell, and most importantly taste. The service was excellent - and the best part  was we got to meet Chef Michael. A restaurant that deserves the 2 Michelin stars. Would it be too much to ask if one more star was added? :) Just an idea. Will I go back? Yes! And next time I hope to try the 16 course meal and maybe the 8 course desert menu. There is always room for desert.

I really wish that I could give this place a higher rating, because I was really looking forward it and was expecting the experience to be amazing. Unfortunately, I was not very impressed with the food nor the service. To celebrate a special occassion, we opted for the Chef's tasting menu (omakase style) and left it in the hands of the chef to decide the fate of our meal. The chef's tasting menu had 14 dishes; yet, none of the dishes had the special "wow-factor" that I would have expected. Of the 11 savory dishes, there were only two dishes that was non-seafood.  I would have liked to see a little more variety in the tasting menu. I will have to say that I agreed with the other Yelpers that the Santa Barbara shrimp, which was served table side, was pretty tasty. Besides the shrimp, I was not impressed. The service was another story. The wait staff seemed unorganized and the place felt somewhat chaotic. On multiple occassions, our dishes were brought out too early and you could hear the wait staff arguing amongst themselves as to why the dishes weren't coming out at the right time. On another occassion, someone described our dish as having baby artichokes. When I looked at my dish, there was cauliflower...but no artichokes. It appeared that the wait staff was not knowledgeable about what was being served. I expected a little more service for a $160/person meal. All in all, the experience was just okay. I don't think I would come here again.

The food was amazing.  I had many moments of quiet nibbles with eyes closed in enjoyment.  From start to finish, there were many memorable bites and pleasant surprises.  It is the sort of place where you take your time with your meal.  The pace is slow and deliberate to allow time for tasting and conversation.  Our server seemed to leave before we finished our meal and we waited a very long time after desert and coffee for our check.  I'm not sure if this was deliberate or an oversight.  The timing of the rest our our meal was spot on though. There were some details that I think should be addressed to improve the quality of the experience: -There was no valet when we pulled up, so we went and found street parking around the corner.  So parking is an issue.   -There was only one restroom--there was a line for both the ladies' and gentlemens' restrooms.  The lock was confusing enough for there to be instructions posted inside the restroom.  I opened the door on someone inside, luckily they were just washing their hands and not on the toilet which is in full view of the door.  It would be very embarrassing to walk in on someone on the toilet.  A new lock might be a good improvement. -The restaurant was packed when we arrived at the time of our reservation.  We were told things were running a bit late and were directed towards the bar to wait.  The bar was full and the only seat in the entrance was occupied.  My date and I had to stand awkwardly in the small entrance area.   Food coming out of the kitchen is curiously routed through the crowded entry, which made us feel in the way with carts and rushing staff coming and going.  We waited for about 25 minutes.  The staff were apologetic and while we didn't mind the wait they really should change up the entrance of the restaurant.  The only seat in the entrance proved to be strangely uncomfortable, we kept sliding off of the satiny pillows.  It is your first impression and for us it was enough to have us on our iphones looking for somewhere else to eat. -The tables in the main room were too close together for the cart service they use for many courses.  The experience would have been much better with a couple less tables and a bit more clearance for the carts.  We ordered scallops which were seared table side.  The captain pulled the cart as close as he could but it was awkward.  He was basically blocking in two other tables.  The cart had a small bowl of hot coals on it and my date could feel the heat of it close to his head.  There was a woman seated at another table nearby that turned to see what was behind her.  It wasn't dangerous but it wasn't elegant.   The captain went to great trouble to provide elegant service and had very nice knife skills but only I could see it since the cart was slightly behind my date.  Also, the cheese cart, which was larger than the other service carts required two people to trundle it back and forth through the dining room and through the entryway.  It just sort of looked silly to have two men pushing along the heavy marble topped cheese cart because the space was cramped.   Long story short, I believe the dining experience would be greatly improved by taking a couple tables out of the dining room and by sorting out the routing of the food from the kitchen to the table.

The price is steep, but the dining experience is worth every penny. I went here with my family to celebrate my brother's birthday. The entire table went with the full tasting menu (which, if ANYONE wants to eat from the tasting menu, EVERYONE must eat from the tasting menu, restaurant rule). Each and every dish from the tasting menu was an interesting taste sensation unto themselves and none of them disappointed. My favorites were the mojito ravioli (it's as awesome as it sounds) and the cheese platter (what can I say? I love cheese). If you've got a special occasion to celebrate and don't mind shelling out prime coin per person then this place lives up to the hype quite handily.

Oooooh yeah, this is place is for REAL.  My girlfriend's parents took us here for the Valentines Day tasting menu over the weekend, and let me tell you, the 9 or so courses were all good.  Couldn't find anything to complain about.  The "shot to the heart" of black truffle soup started things off with a bang.  The diver scallop, tuna sashimi, swordfish, arctic char, and the mind-blowing lychee sorbet and intricate chocolate dessert.  The champagne cocktail (Love Potion No. 9) was tasty.  The food was awesome.  And, on top of it all, the service was fantastic due to our professional waiter, Martin; he was unpretentious, sweet, and rolled with/contributed to my girlfriend's father's humor (he's hilarious).   But my favorite part of the meal may have been the supplemental foie gras, served with a delicious type of fruit (customary with foie, apparently) and cherries, and paired with a perfect riesling.

Yes, this place just may be the best restaurant in Los Angeles as some people on here are saying. I had the 11 course menu (or was it 14) and it was as if I was on another planet. These guys do some crazy stuff with stuff and call it food. It didn't put a hole in my wallet... it put it in my bank account. But you have to do this place at least once it your life. It's worth it regardless of how much money you have or don't have. My only dilemma with this place is, if I ever get rich enough, do I come back here and take the risk of it not being as good as the first time, or do I never come back here again and just cherish that trip that one time I had dinner in the clouds.

Insanely, insanely expensive, but such a wonderful experience, if you can afford it.  We had a tasting menu and I'm not sure about this one "dish" from the chef... I think it was a raw egg...?  But whatever that was, to this very day, just THINKING about it gives me chills because it was BY FAR the BEST, most INCREDIBLE thing I had EVER eaten.  The flavor was explosive! Service here is FANTASTICALLY PERFECT. Ambiance is classy. If it weren't so overly priced, I'd give it 5 stars, no doubt!

Service:  Excellent.  Servers were very attentive and catering.  Water was being poured when you just think I'm running low. Food:  Upscale fine dining, but worth a try on a very special day.  The food was very fresh, tasty, and beautifully displayed.  An average main course runs anywhere from 43-49.00 and appetizers run around 26.00.  All the fish dishes are delicious and the duck was absolutely yummy!  Try the prawn for appetizer or the summer truffle ravioli/pasta....did I mention the pasta is hand-made?   They do have set course meals with wine pairing, but we didn't think we could finish all the course so we just opted for 2 appetizers and a main course. Ambiance:  Simple, but dim and a bit dark, but sets the mood.  I think if the lighting was a little but brighter it would be nicer.....but this is just my preference. Extras:  They brought a pre-appetizer plate for each person that came as a house service which was excellent and they also brought dessert yummies on the house as well!  Like I said service is excellent and they do treat and cater to all their clients. Oh...an fyi:  valet charge is 5.50 in case anyone was curious!

I have been here 2 times and both times I have been thoroughly impressed with the food. Granted, it has been some time since I've been here.  I went to Providence for my bachelorette party (you heard me right!) over a year ago...  they were extremely accommodating to my party of 6.  I know, you think bachelorette party and you think of pin the schlong on the hunk and embarrassingly rowdy women... not so much for us during this portion of our evening.  We were very well behaved (that is, until karaoke later in the evening, when questionableness abounded).  I suppose we're a well rounded bunch. Back to the food and wine.  Both times I dined at Providence, I got the tasting menu with wine pairing.  The focus, for me, was on the seafood since they were kind enough to alter the menu to avoid red meat and pork (this is LA, they must hear this all the time).  I had the best prepared scallop of my life at Providence, and I've had my fair share of scallops.   The only slight ding is that I wish the sommelier (or person who served our wine) was a little less rushed and took the time to describe the wines more thoroughly, but c'est la vie!  The cheese is awesome, so is the dessert. Go here, trust me!

Wow, what a meal. I went there with my best friend after hearing about an incredible meal his sister had there. We got the 5 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. DEFINITELY get the wine pairing, it's one of the best paired menus I've ever had. The amuse bouche was a nice start to the meal, with a gin and tonic fizz jello, a greyhound "ravioli" and a trout shooter. The first course was a kanpachi sashimi dish served with fried rice chips. Nice, fresh and tasty first course. The second course was probably the best scallop I've had. The curry that the scallop sat on top had a nice spicy bite and was excellently paired with an off-white riesling. The third course was a small halibut filet served with a pesto sauce. This was also quite good, but was probably the weakest part of the menu. It lacked the panache of the other dishes. The fourth course was a hearty serving of veal tenderloin. I have to admit I don't have a lot of eating experience with veal, but this dish was so tender and flavorful. The combined flavors of bacon, almond and the maitake mushrooms were ridiculous. Finally, dessert was a yuzu curd topped with a blackberry sorbet that was a sweet enough to offset the tart curd. The meringue was sparing but fantastic. Go eat here, it's one of the top meals I've had, up there with L'Atelier. They've earned those Michelin stars and I look forward to returning on my next trip to LA. PS: you can ask for as much bread as you like. the bacon brioche won out over the seaweed focaccia for me but both were great.

Best birthday dinner ever.  My boyfriend took me here to celebrate my 25th birthday.  I loved everything-- the interior decor, placement of tables, very friendly and knowledgeable staff, heck, even the restroom.  And of course I loved the food.  My boyfriend and I being big foodies and former culinary students, were very impressed by the menu selection,  taste and presentation of the dishes.  All the seafood I order was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The scallops were plump and juicy.  The shrimp were huge and oh my goodness tasty.  After our meal we were able to take a little tour of their kitchen. Uber clean and organized kitchen. Def a great place to celebrate special occasions.  I liked the casual and unpretentious feeling of the restaurant.  I had a great time and I'm coming back to try their dessert tasting menu!

It's all a blur... like a dream, but more like one those dreams you wish never ended and would keep going and going.  This was my experience with the full tasting menu at Providence.   Apologies for not writing this review in complete detail, as my dining experience was almost a year ago!  I guess I put off writing about Providence because there is nothing bad to say about it.  And I shouldn't have to write a glowing review because it is a given that the experience at Providence is amazing! Do not be afraid to order from tasting menus if you have certain food restrictions or if your just a picky eater.  Let your server know, and the kitchen will obliging adjust the menu to your needs.  Flavor and quality will not be sacrificed.   Course after course, the food is unbelievable, right down to the cheese course, and even the bread.  Service is amazing.   Mignardise to top off the night included amazing rosemary caramels.   Lasting impressions all around!

You can read from the others than the food is exceptional. What I'd like to compliment is their phenomenal service from a recent dining experience. One of their dishes from the chef's menu was adorned with very small edible flowers from their herb garden. When admiring the presentation of the dish, I noticed a very tiny little green caterpillar crawling on the petals of one of the flowers. "Cute bug" "Evidently, the flowers ARE fresh" and "Glad this wasn't half a caterpillar." went through my mind. I pointed this out to the wait staff and joked that they did not need to impress me with the freshness of their herbs with live bugs. The staff was stunned, embarrassed, and were extremely apologetic. Sheesh... it's just a little green caterpillar. It's okay. It's not a cockroach. But they were insistent that it was unacceptable and went way out of their way to make matters right. They included additional dishes. They comp'd our wine. The manager on staff even stopped by to give us a variety of handcrafted chocolates in a beautiful presentation box. Needless to say, I was very impressed. They hold themselves to the highest regard for their service and hospitality.

I went there only few times, but I was keep thinking "I could be wrong, this time will GOOD one." After all, my repeat tries proved me I was right. The service, decor, creativity - they are all there, but.....it is an upscale, not-so-cheap-at-all restaurant. U spend at least $50~150 per person here.

One of the best meals you can have in LA.  Everything from the tuna tartare, the cripiest pork belly and to die for panna cotta was spot on. Service is just fine, and the wine person is super enthusiastic.  I believe he used jazz hands when he desribed the cab i had as "jammy."  Love love love.   Also, the portions look small but are quite filling, I don't know how people do the 18 courses.  I can't wait to go back!

What more do I need to say about this 5 Star establishment. Impeccable service. Great and inventive dishes. I don't have any additional insight to offer.  Honestly, its rare to pay so much and yet feel that it was well worth the cost.

I was actually looking forward to this dinner. I heard many great things about it from co workers and also from fellow yelpers. We started with appetizers which was probably the highlight of the dinner. I had the oysters (typical oysters but delicious nonetheless). The sea urchin pasta was actually pretty good. I am a huge fan of sea urchin, so it was an interesting to eat it as a pasta dish. I would order it again. This place was supposed to be known for their seafood, so I chose to go with the wild striped bass. It didn't really have any flavor, the potato gratin was sort of bland, and it came with a side of broccoli and turbot (its like a thicker type of bacon). It just didn't mesh well. I should have ordered the duck, which a couple of people ordered in my table. I was quite jealous and I loathe that feeling that I should have ordered something else. Never again. For dessert, we ordered different types, but none of them stood out. I got the pumpkin polenta which was interesting, it tasted like sweet pumpkin pie mashed together with walnuts. I was glad I tried this restaurant, I did enjoy some parts of it, but overall, I wouldn't go here again to spend the money. There are better places that serve better meals. Don't let me deter you from trying it if you haven't tried it.

After reading all of the good reviews, we went here on Saturday night with another couple to celebrate my wife's birthday. We give this place a solid 4 stars because of the food. We all ordered the chef's full tasting menu and brought 2 bottles of our own wine in, had a cocktail each, and bought 1 bottle of petite syrah near the end of the 7 courses . As stated previously the food was very good, The downside is the service was a bit on the slow side, the food and wine is over priced, and the restaurant is located in a crappy neighborhood.  When you spend over $800.00 (not including the tip) for a meal for 4 people, you better be on top of it. The $30.00 per bottle corkage fee is also ridiculous.   All in all we had a good time and my wife was happy.  That is the main thing.

This was my second visit to Providence, and I am torn between the 3-4 stars but will go with the 4.   My first experience was a few years ago and it was just not good.  The food was fine, but the service was just terrible.  My second go around was better but not amazing.   My husband and I dine in many fine dining restaurants, Michelin Star ratings and all.  While Provedence has 2 Michelin stars, it doesn't outweigh my experience at Le Bernadin.   The food is great, don't get me wrong.  The fish is beyond fresh, the ingredients are wonderful and the tastes are incredible.  What turns me off is the snooty attitude.  I get it, you have a Michelin Star or two you just don't have to be a total snob.  When you are pouring my wine, don't have an American accent and then transition into French.   We had the Truffle Rissotto for an appetizer (6 oz of Black winter truffles YES), and the tuna Tartare.  Both amazing!   For our entree we had the John Dory and a Bass, I cannot remember what kind.  Both amazing.  VERY heavy on the butter but what do you expect?  The freshness was wonderful, the ingredients again were delicious! We also had the coffee/espresso dessert.  It also was amazing! Overall the dinner was wonderful, we had a grea time and the food was just what we wanted.  The only negative is the attitude.  I would go back though, because the food is worth it.

I've been in love with Providence since the first bite. This restaurant is for me one of the best things about Los Angeles. It is sophisticated without being stuffy, the decor is clean and minimal, the service is on point, it really is all about the food and oh what wonderful food awaits. Providence is bursting with creativity, each dish an experience of texture and flavor, fresh, alive, you never know what to expect next. I love a restaurant that can surprise me, that offers flavors not to be had anywhere else but what makes Providence so enchanting is that it is not just about the uniqueness but that the unique alchemy tastes so wonderful you find yourself asking why it has not always been done that way. It takes a special magic to make the contemporary timeless, and Providence's does this with exceptional flair.

overall i wasn't wowed, esp for the price i paid for 3 5-course tasting menus plus wine pairing.  It has a lot of catching up to do with NY style fine dinning. Super expensive for nothing flashy or extra ordinary. the food was classic french american, with a foam here, and perfectly cooked meat there, execution of the techniques where definately spot on... but the flavour combinations are getting old. i guess i was expecting a lot more, esp with service. my friends and i kept joking that everytime something went wrong or unnoticed at our table by our server, they would loose 1/2 a dollar sign in value. by the time we left the top rated "$$$$" establishment, we were walking out with one and a half $'s.  unattentive staff made my experience in short, only an ok dinning experience

Before going to Providence (9/25) I had high expectations; being a michelin 1 star and also being on the gayot top 40. I've read that Sona (one of my favorites) was a lesser version of providence so I was very happy to try it. Driving up to providence, the outside decor looked kind of tacky (christmas light looking like fixtures). The inside decor was not bad, but nothing amazing. Its a quiet restaurant for the most part. Bathrooms were nice (real hand towels). We decided to go with the full tasting menu ($120/person) and one wine pairing ($55). It's supposed to be a 9 course but it's really more like 8 w/ a shot (you only get 8 glasses). We started off w/ 3 tasters (not included in the tasting menu) that was pretty cool. One was a gin n tonic jello and another was like a mojito in a jelly mochi like ball. We had kanpachi, calamari, scallops, halibut, salmon, veal, cheese, shot of something, and dessert. Kanpachi was good, but i think they should go with a nicer fish like yellowtail or something. Calamari was good, but nothing special. Scallops i thought were cooked well, but the sauce didn't seem to go well with it. Halibut was maybe my favorite dish. The sauce and everything went perfectly with it. The salmon was well cooked, not dry. The veal was very tender, but the sauce was a lil overwhelming (salty too). Cheese, we had some strong cheeses so I wasn't a big fan, but they do have a nice selection for you to choose. The shot, weird, don't really remember what it was. And dessert, was a coffee type ice cream and bananas, but the ice cream had some sort of spice in the middle that turned me off. Overall the full tasting menu gets you very FULL. I think a 5 course would've been perfectly fine. The wine you get in each glass is actually very little. Food was good, but nothing spectacular that jumped out and was like WOW! but overall well cooked food. Service: In the beginning the service was slow. Picked up a bit later in the night, as there were less people. They seemed a little blah, just not enthusiastic. They did explain every dish and wine well. The utensils and plating that they used was really cool. Have to give them a plus on that part. Finally, in my opinion, SONA ranks above Providence, but providence isn't bad, but for the same money, i would choose Sona. It might actually be slightly cheaper. All and All, all the food was cooked well and tasted good so I can't dock any stars for that. I do think they can improve on the selection of stuff to cook. Everything was pretty basic. BUT I still enjoyed the dinner, or maybe it was just the company I was with.

I took my girlfriend here for our eight anniversary for a very, very long meal. We had a reservation at 6:30pm and left at 12:30am. If you do go, like many of the other reviewers stated, do consider the Chef's Menu (15 course tasting menu). The food is phenomenal. You might not be the biggest fan of every dish, but it gives you a good sense of what the restaurant has to offer. The chef is definitely skilled, and if the wallet lets you, splurge a little more and get the wine pairing as well. The wines complimented each dish superbly. I can't recall every dish I had nor do I wish to go into detail about 15 plates, but a number of them stood out. The first course was an alcohol filled "bubble" and a frozen gin and tonic. I'm an alchy; so I loved this. It was indeed interesting. There was also an uni dish fairly early on. I've always been afraid to try uni, since everyone says it's an acquired taste, but this was amazing. It was probably the white truffle that topped it, but nevertheless, very good. Entrees were also very good; one of them, if you watch iron chef, was a bass plate prepared by head chef Cimarusti when he defeated Morimoto. The waiters will be eager to tell you this fact :) Personally, the only course I didn't care for was the cheese pre-dessert. I've never been a big fan of cheeses. And these cheeses were not prepared by the chef, so not really a negative here. The desserts were good, but not great. Not sure really what to say about them. At this point though, it's hard for even heavyweight drinkers to say they're not buzzed from all the wine that's been doled out with every dish. I did enjoy the 20 year old tawny at the very end, but as far as desserts go, not really impressed. It's the only thing keeping me from rating it 5 stars. As for service, it was superb. Our primary waiter was interesting, explained the courses in detail, and answered any questions we had. I say primary waiter because, from what I can recall, we had about 4 or 5 waiters that evening. Another last note, if you do the wine pairing, be sure you have a fairly high tolerance, or assign a designated driver. It's a lot of alcohol...

The food was really good!  Great seafood. We had the chef's choice - YUM!!!!! We also had the wine pairing along w/ the chef's choice so the meal was expensive. This is a special occasions type restaurant to me. Everything was well prepared. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. The only thing I didn't like about our experience was that they put us in the table near the back of the restaurant so we were right next to a rear entrance of some sort.  Well, at least we had privacy!

Friends took me here for my birthday celebration part 2 (in LA), so I very much wanted to love this place - but I was a bit disappointed.  The setting/decor was beautiful - elegant, modern, and relaxed.  The service was attentive and professional.  But the food was nothing spectacular, especially given the price.  I ordered the turbo as my main course, which our server claimed was the 'best' on the menu...good but I've had better.  I did really like the lobster risotto. While I loved the experience and am thankful to my friends for taking me here, this will not go down as one of those truly memorable dining experiences that I have had at other similar type restaurants...(e.g. bay area's Aqua, Chez Panisse and the old Bastide).  But I will still give it 4-stars for the overall dining experience.

A friend of mine and I were really excited about trying Providence out, especially since it has been awarded 2 Michelin Stars, and the Chef/Owner was featured on Top Chef Masters. The Service was exceptional... no doubt about it.  The ambience was fantastic. The food was... good... but it wasn't so amazing that it jumped out at me. There were definate highs, and not so many lows... I'm glad we went, and got the experience...but considering the price, and the other great restaraunts in LA, I am in no rush to go back. The meal started out with 4 Amuse Bouche, compliments of the chef (a cold carrot soup, a cheese filled pastry, a soy marshmallow, and a trout sashimi). The next courses consisted of oysters on the half shell, a dua of foie gras (one seared, one in the form of a ravioli with truffles), the salt roasted prawns with evoo, the roasted duck breast and the sea bass, and to finish, a coffee type cake (I forget the name) and a deconstructed banana cream pie and a raspberry white chocolate lolli pop. The best items were definately the seared foie gras and the coffee cake and the amuse bouch. Everything else was good, but not extraordinary.

Came here in June for my 30th with a group of five, and it was worth it! When I called and made the reservations, I mentioned it was my birthday. And when we walked in, we were showed the center table, which according to my brother was the best table since if you're a celebrity, you'd want to sit here and be seen by everyone. Well, I'm not, and maybe he's lying to me, but it made me feel pretty good about the restaurant staff. We opted for the nine-course tasting menu but not the wine pairings (we're all Asian and lightweight, and wanted to make sure I compose myself properly amongst all this starch white tablecloths). You can read the other reviews for details on the dishes, but they were super creative. My brother and his wife, being uber snobs of Japanese food, did say that the uni wasn't the freshest (in the egg) and the sashimi (I think it was fluke) could be better. But for me, I really enjoyed the inventive combinations of tastes and textures, totally tickling my fancy. The service, really good, always friendly, but not always the most attentive. Or maybe I'm just a tad impatient? Definitely recommend for a special occasion :)

I was so excited to be going to this restaurant which has such high ratings.  My date is a total foodie and he picked it so I was expecting the most delicious meal of my life.  Unfortunately that was not the case.  We ordered a la carte as we didn't have time to do a tasting menu.  I had the risotto as an appetizer and it was ok, I felt it tasted a bit too rich and on the salty side.  My main course was the Arctic Char, and it was kind of blah not tremendously flavorful.  I did very much enjoy the white wine we had with our meal, it was a blend but I don't remember the name as my date chose it.  Desert was ok but again not earth shattering.  I've had a much better meal at Katsuya and the vibe is more laid back. The service was pretty good but our server seemed somewhat inexperienced and wasn't very friendly.  Overall this was an ok experience but for the the price I expected much more.

We visited Providence with some out town friends and we all wanted to add Michelin 2 star restaurant to our lists.  I really liked the ambiance at this place. We started off with many of the signature martinis and all of them were great! On to the food: We had the five course tasting menu with wine pairing.   Starter: Japanese kanpachi with crispy rice crackers, coriander, soy creme fraiche Dish 2: Hokkaido sea scallops at top japanese eggplant, rhubarb, cashews, and reduction of vadouvan and jurancon Disk 3: wild pacific halibut with smoked paprika, potatoes, and grilled squid Main dish: veal tenderloin with sweet peas, bacon, almonds, and morel mushrooms. Desert: yuzu curd, meringue I don't remember all the wine pairing but they matched perfectly. OMG tastes and presentation of the food was awesome.   The staff do give off an little attitude but hey it's Michelin rated restaurant.  The only poor part of the service was the waiter forgot one of our friends wines which was order in the beginning of the meal. All in all awesome meal.  I wish for service like Urasawa but it's not Urasawa.

I had its 9-course tasting menu with wine pairings, and yes, it was a fun experience, but I wouldn't go back. To me, this restaurant was one of those American/ Asian Fusion restaurants that have similar items on the menu and taste very similar to their competitors. The vibe is cool and it's a good place for a formal date because it's pretty quiet and romantic in there. Go there if you're a boyfriend who wants to impress his girl and have some romantic time with a bottle of vino.

Everything about this place screams michelin stars, it's no wonder they have 2. The bartender was skilled, personable and friendly. I had the strawberry tarragon julep and hubby had the pisco sour. Both were fantastic. We enjoyed our time at the bar while we were waiting for our table. Once we arrived at the table the fun really began. The service is incredible, quirky and perfect. I enjoyed the banter with the waitstaff and the sommalier. overall it was high on my list of best places ever, overall. It's expensive but well worth the cost. We had the tasting menu (9 course with wine pairing) we  never get the wine pairing but this may be one of the only places where it's more than worth it and a great deal of fun!!

Made our Memorial weekend trip to LA! Had the 5 course tasting menu, and it was worth every penny. Good deal actually for a 2 star Michelin restaurant! I loved the scallop appetizer, and the veal was a good size portion and the softest red meat I've ever had. They did a great job on the salmon too, with a nice crispy skin and really nice mild asparagus and some other veggie based foam sauce. So glad we decided to come here :-)

Holy schnikeys... Husband arranged to have my 30th birthday dinner celebration here.  Men, if you have a woman that loves good food, especially when it comes to desserts and you want her to LOVE you (if you know what I mean), bring her here! I had one of the best meals EVER.  My night started off with some of the freshest oysters followed by a very decadent but surprisingly light main course of foie gras truffled ravioli. The waiter shaved the truffle right there in front of me.  I just about nommed on his hand...   Some of the other people in our party ordered things like chowda (a truely beautiful clam chowder), cheese platters that had some amazing dairy derivatives from goat, sheep and cow and spot prawns that had been cooked in a layer of salt and rosemary and were split table-side. Most of us indulged in the 7 course dessert tasting menu and for $45, this is a bargain.  Some of the best desserts entered my tummy that night.  I fell in love with the kalamansi gelee and the lighter side of panzanella, flirted with rose sorbet and oogled mini macarons.   Unfortuantely, for me, Husband found the food a bit too "fancy" for him so he's not as eager to return as I am.  Sad as currently for the month of June, Providence is running a $65 5-course tasting menu.   P.S. There's a more in-depth review of our meal on my blog.

Providence and Michael Cimarusti are in a nutshell impeccable in presentation, innovation, taste, ambiance, and anything else you can think to rate. We've had the pleasure of dinning at Providence on several special occasions for a total of 3 visits. Each time I am blown away by the flavor/texture combinations as well as the beautiful presentation. This last time we took my mom to celebrate her retirement and birthday. She said "this is the best meal I've ever had".  We enjoyed the Amuse Bouche (to make your mouth happy), the Foie Gras Ravioli, the Fois Gras Satue (with cherris), Scallops and the Wild John Dory.  All mind-blowingly fantastic. I have to say I'm always lured in by the specials (June/July 5 course tasting menu) but never end up ordering them because there are so many other interesting items on the menu.  Of course I'm pleased and proud that a majority of the produce comes from the Wednesday Santa Monica Farmers Market.

It's obvious why this place is a Michelin rated restaurant- talk about mastering the art of food, people! I had the 9 course meal. Don't get this unless you're ready to BRING IT, because i got full around the 4th course and had to huff my way through the others. One dish that particularly stood out to me was the Uni (sea urchin). OK, so uni makes me gag. I can't stand the taste and texture and i don't know why i keep giving it a shot at japanese restaurants. So when the waiter brought out the uni at Providence i was obviously hesitant. Ummm, I LOVED IT. . i don't know if it's the yolk they mix in with it or what, but it was so good i spooned it all up. That's how good Providence is- going from uni dry heaving to licking the cup clean. Why didn't i give this place 5 stars? The only issue i had was that my date had to ask the waiter 3 times for a drink refill and i felt that to be a little off for a 2 star Michelin restaurant. Everything else was perfect.

Excellent food and exceptional service! It is white truffle season at Providence right now and they have the most exquisite tasting truffles. I had the white truffle with pasta alla chittara. I loved how the the creamy pasta enhanced the delicate tasting truffles - it was a perfect complement that made each bite taste better than the last. My husband had white truffle with risotto. The risotto was very tasty but it (slightly) overpowered the delicate taste of the truffle. I could still taste the truffle and it was still a delicious dish, but I thought the pasta enhanced the taste of the truffles better than the risotto did. Both dishes were from their market menu and they each cost about $80. For dessert, we had the passion fruit mango gelee which was good enough for me (I'm not much of a dessert person so although I iked it, I'm not gonna gush about it). This dessert is part of their dessert tasting menu but you can order it individually. We also had various complimentary tastings from the chef (my favorite part of the dinner!) that included four appetizers and three desserts. I can't remember what they were now, but trust me when I say they were phenomenal (especially the appetizers). Oh and how could I forget the fresh baked bread, specifically the bacon brioche! Try it! You'll love it! A tip: Reserve EARLY and let them know if you're celebrating something :)

I was here October 16th with a friend, and we ordered the 9 course tasting menu.  It was the 4th nine course tasting menu I have done within the year, and I have to say the food is really hit and miss, given the fact they alter the preparations every so often.  Unfortunately I asked the restaurant to change it up, which meant basically they just prepared some dishes with different side ingredients, to varying success.  This was probably the worst of the four times I've done this tasting menu (also with smaller portions than before), which I really do enjoy and have no problem actually paying for. As for the specifics, the kampachi was forgettable.  It came on a thin rounded slice of watermelon, which while it looked very presentable the complexity in the flavors were really missing since the watermelon watered out the fish; I wanted my friend's traditional preparation with the soy creme fraiche. The uni chawanmushi, basically uni in a cold custard, was actually quite gross. While understandably this appetizer can be eaten hot or cold, I particularly did not like the grainy texture, and I did not taste anything spectacular about this one; again, I wish I had my friend's preparation with warm egg yolk while I grudgingly ate mine (perhaps I was being punished for asking to change up my meal?). As for the remainder of the courses, they were decent but I wasn't blown away this time as I was the third time around back last month.

Had dinner at the Providence last week to celebrate a late christmas dinner. Started off with the asian pear cocktail, it was nice and refreshing and that started the night for me- Ordered the 9- course tasting menu. Before I begin sharing my experience with the 9 course. The bacon brioche is a must try! I really liked the buttery soft bread with a hint of bacon in it. Amuse bouche was very interesting- I thought it was a great introduction to my meal. Sea urchin with the egg worked for me, and using the egg for presentation was bright idea and very artistic. I did not enjoy the two fish dishes that came along with the tasting menu. The flavors did not come together for me. Also, the veal dish was not very tasty. The sauce that came with it was really good though, but the veal itself was bland. I skipped the cheese tasting- went for the 3 desserts instead. The lemon sorbet with tarragon was delicious! The banana pudding with barley ice cream was good. I enjoyed the crunch on the side, combined with the barley ice cream. Thumbs up on these 2 desserts. The last dessert I did not find tasty, the chocolate was a bit bitter for me and I am not a cherry fan. Overall, it was a decent meal- there is definitely room for improvements. Especially on the entrees. Service was good throughout the meal. Except for one bald man in a suit. Extremely rude and I did not appreciate that. At a fine dining restaurant like this, this attitude is uncalled for.

I can't give 5 stars, because I didn't stay for dinner! We came for drinks.  We had a number of drinks and passed them around our group for tasting - all this to say that I forgot the name of my drink, oh no!! I really liked it, too...we had at least 1 Wonderland, an Asian Pear Martini? Mmmmm...basically, I will want to return to have dinner and will *have* to re-try the cocktails.   I heard a no corkage Monday is available? Thank you!  I'm in!!

Well, tonight I got a treat. We went to a play and then snuck in this beautiful restuarant for dessert. There ensued a crazy 6 course dessert sampling! All was amazing, a treat for the eyes and then to be savoored slowly, paying attention to all the details in each little plate. The Maca tea dessert was my favorite, followed by the most amazing strawberry dish, with at least 6 different ways to eat strawberries! I can only imagine what the dinner would be like. What I saw go by me looked and smelled great. The wait staff was like none I've ever seen. Informed, almost a dancelike swiftness...you just have to see for yourself! I will definately find a very special event to go there for soon! :)

Providence is beautiful and the food is absolutely amazing.  Presented beautifully, tastes and textures well combined and served to perfection.  We had the 9 course tasting -- a bit too much food for me but all fabulous.  Our water, Steven, was totally sensitive to my gluten problem and an enthusiastic and warm server.  No criticisms at all.  But, yes, it is expensive.

I celebrated my birthday here on  May 1st, 2012 and had a wonderful  experience that easily qualified as the best fine dining we've ever enjoyed in LA.  The 2 Michelin stars that Chef Cimarusti has garnered for this sophisticated seafood restaurant are well deserved. Service: This is where Providence far and away outshines most other LA fine dining restaurants. The service we received was flawless. Unpretentious, relaxing, perfect in every way. Attentive without ever being overbearing. Ambiance: The restaurant itself is modern, romantic, sophisticated and understated. Tables are spaced perfectly. Setting has a very Japanese/Zen aura. Food: Every facet of this menu is near perfect with unbelievablly fresh and exotic produce prepared in a multilayered, complex and beautiful manner. Bread: Amazing - Nori Focaccia & Bacon Brioche!! Yum! Appetizers - Chowda: My wifes App. - Silky, creamy, bold flavors with Bacon & Manilla Clams. Simply delicous. Foie Gras Saute w/ Cranberries, Quince & Nasturitums: I LOVE Foie Gras and I LOVE fresh Cranberries and this preparation was without equal. The absolute best Foie dish I've ever had anywhere!!!!! Lobster Risotto: Perfectly Al Dente though flavors were somewhat muted. Our Dishes: Amuse Buche: Several delightful presentaions. Wasabi-Tofu Marshamallow, Gruyere Cheese Puff and lastly a Trout Sashimi w/ Gold Leaf, Lemon Gelee serve in a Shot Glass. These were the perfect introduction to Chef Cimarusti's menu. Whimsical, playful & refined. Entrees - (ordered from Ala Carte Menu) Pacific Ridgeback Swordfish w/ Hedgehog Mushrooms & Red Wine Reduction: My dish. Brought in that morning this fish was near perfect in every way. Rich, oceanic, meaty with complex, contrasting flavors. The reverance that Providence shows ingrediants and most especially seafood was apparent in this dish. Prime New York Steak w/ Burnt Brussel Sprout Leaves & Sauce Bordelaise- My wife's dish. Complex, multiple layers that complimented this perfectly medium rare beef. Dessert - Un Caf Bordeaux - Caffe Mouse, Canalce Cream, Chicory Carmel & Hazelnuts - My wifes dessert. Rich, Silky and complex flavors with bold coffee undertones. These Pretzels Are Making Me Thirtsy: Chocolate Ganache, Pretzels, Peanut Butter w/ Chambly Noir Ice Cream - This dessert was a masterpiece!! The perfect marriage of flavor, texture & temperature. Unbelievable Belgian Dark Ale Ice Cream. The Pastry chef Adrian Vasquez is extremely gifted. Do not pass up the Dessert Menu at Providence. They even offer a Multi-course dessert tasting that I would love to return and experience some day soon. Mignardises: Several small, delightful candies to end our wonderful meal @ Providence. Upon reflecting on this meal some 7 months later it has to this date easily been the best fine dining meal and experience I've ever had in Los Angeles. Providence is a wonderful restaurant where service, food and ambiance marry to provide it diners with a unique and elevated culinary adventure.

I rarely give 2 star ratings and never for a place that used to have a michelin star but Providence might have been one of the biggest disappointments I've had for fine dining, possibly because it was so highly rated on yelp and elsewhere. I'm sure many people have had good meals here and maybe i just got an off day but if you've eaten at melisse or ursawa and are planning to go here, set your expectations lower before you go and you'll probably leave less let down than me. 1. I heard the street traffic the entire time. The restaurant is situated on a busy road so if you are seated on the street side there is a good chance you hear it 2. It took me hours to get through this meal. I ate faster at alinea and that is 22 courses 3. Service was slow and the waiter actually didn't understand the food dishes on the menu. I was asking him q's and he would make up answers and i called him out on it because he blatantly had no clue what he was talking about 4. The guy filling water lifted it so high it kept splashing on me 5. first place i've been to where if i left to use the bathroom they didn't fold my napkin. they may have just not noticed i left though so i'll give them this one 6. Ended up being a very an expensive meal for something that wasn't that good. When we initially ordered the waiter told us we didn't have enough food so we got more but later were infuriated bc we had too much. I had a half a bite of my dessert. For a person whose favorite part of any meal is dessert this is very depressing 7. All the food was so-so; lobster was chewy, turbot was too hard, some spaghetti with sea urchin made me sick, foie gras ravioli was so rich. Compared to SF or Napa or anywhere i just wasn't impressed with the caliber of food. Only good things were the cocktail i had, food design on the plate and the entertaining people across from us

This is a solid 5 Yelp star experience.  Don't let the naysayers fool you.  I save up once a year to have a no holds barred dining experience here.  If you love wine and food pairing, wait until you experience the mixologist's pairings!  They are to die for!  A friend of mine could not understand paying this much for food, until he accompanied me.  That down home, North Carolina boy gladly paid the bill.  It was worth every penny!!

Flawless. Truly one of the best dining experiences I have ever encountered.  Prices aside, what people truly need to realize is you're paying for so much more than steak or the slab of fish you ordered. Providence is an entire enchanting culinary universe that comes with the decadent dishes.  My experience with Providence is the closest I have ever been to being left speechless.  A remarkable restaurant equipped with a symphony of subtle "mms" and "ahs" that'll lure you from the moment you open the front door.  "Your table is this way..."     This dining experience was so memorable, I still recall all the flavours, textures, smells and above all tastes of the dishes I partook.  I started with the Bigeye Tuna Tartare with fresh wasabi and crispy rice.  The precise layering of the ingredients took the dish to a new level.  The tuna was not only fresh, but was seasoned perfectly with the ideal combination of the mild natural sweetness of the Hawaiian Bigeye, spice of the seasoning and tart from the citrus.  The crispy rice was popped so to speak, to perfection and added a delightful crunch to every bite.  Being a huge fan of wasabi, I was delighted to discover the use of the fresh ground variety.  P-e-r-perfection.  For the main course I ordered the American Style Wagyu Beef off their "market price" menu.  At $20.00 an ounce and a conditional 3 ounce minimum per order, I thought to myself, "this better be the most gratifying heaven-sent beef I ever taste..."  It was.  I ended up ordering 6 ounces and devoured the whole plate all the while savoring every fork full until its entire consumption.  The beef was purposefully tenderized to perfection and cooked impeccably.  The accompanying side of mash was buttery, creamy and fluffed.  Exquisite.  Mere words cannot describe the instantaneous soiree that ignited in my delicate embouchement upon contact with each luscious morsel.  Lastly, I finished my meal off with an order of the Dulce De Leche -a Miso Panna Cotta with huckleberries, yuzu and puffed rice.  The dessert was perfectly formed, paired and plated for an amazing finale.  Needless to say, the finale was just as impressive as the rest.  All the while, a flurry of wines, champagne and cocktails served as the perfect companionship and accompanied each dish splendidly.  How divine.   As mentioned before, words will not do justice to this restaurant.  I suggest all self proclaimed restauranteers to try this restaurant.  Whether you're from Los Angeles, Kentucky or Malta, you will not regret dropping the Benjamins for this priceless culinary experience.

One of the best meals of my entire life.... I love seafood but when I go for a really expensive dinner I usually choose French, or something else.  But so happy I finally tried Providence.  Everything I had was really wonderful.... unusual mixes of flavors, really creative dishes.  I can say that the Uni brioche, caviar cracker, Grilled prawn, were total standouts.  We did the full chef's menu with wine pairing and am so happy I did, it really was worth it.  Might as well go all the way at a place like this!  Of course, it hurt the wallet... I think for two people it cost about $700 or so... but I've tried to block that part of it from my memory :)

Came here for my 25th birthday. Aww :) we got the fixed menu, I forgot how many courses there were. :( But anyways! The food was good, but not amazing. We also ordered oysters and Foie gras ravioli with truffles on top. Omg! The foie gras ravioli was the star of the night! The service was great. BUT our waitress had a spitting problem. She was really nice but eww, I got kind of grossed out every time she introduced our next course. Haha

Valerie and I went here to celebrate a very special occasion, and man, this place delivered!  Because Providence is super expensive, we don't plan on eating here often, so we decided to try as many things on the menu as we could.  Val ordered the 5-course tasting menu and I, worried that 5 small courses wouldn't be enough food, ordered the 9-course "full tasting" menu.   So that people will actually read this review without their eyes glazing over, I'll try to keep this somewhat concise.  The ambiance was very romantic and quiet, and the service was spectacular.  Nothing like being served hand and foot.   - Course #1: Japanese Kanpachi: I can't describe what this was, but it was delicious. - Course #2: Santa Barbara Sea Urchin: served in an egg shell - absolutely mouth-watering - #3: Hokkaido Sea Scallops from Japan: actually a misnomer, because they only give you "a" scallop.  However, it was delectable - one of my favorite dishes. - #4: Wild Alaskan Halibut: so tender and flavorful - #5: Columbia River Wild King Salmon: "best I've ever had" - #6: Roasted Tenderloin of Veal: Val didn't eat hers, because she has a weird thing about eating baby cow.  So I had a double helping...it was very good, but Providence definitely does seafood better than it does beef. - #7: Market Cheeses: again, Val didn't partake, because she's not a huge fan of cheeses.  Her loss, my gain.  Some of the most delicious (and expensive and rare) cheeses I've ever had. - #8: Cucumber, Juniper Berry, Lime & Yogurt: tasted like Pickle ice cream.  Yet, somehow this was a good thing. - #9: Chocolate Brownie with Avocado-Banana Sauce: melted in my mouth....so good. If you're looking for a restaurant to celebrate a very special occasion at, I highly recommend Providence!  It's very very pricey, but it's worth it!

I am a lucky girl. My fiancé took me here for our 1st anniversary. Since we have been together, we have explored so many restaurants but only one restaurant that we both agree as our favorite is this place. We had the five courses with wine pairing. The company, ambiance and food were one of my most memorable nights. The dishes are beautiful and the wine paired with the dishes really compliments each piece. It is a bit pricy with the wine pairing but it is worth it. We try to go back every once in a while.

I was in LA with my wife for my 40th birthday, and decided Providence was the choice for dinner.  I booked reservations 45 days in advance to make sure we got a great table. When we arrived we were seated in the overflow patio. The patio was completed covered with heaters overhead. For a patio I found the decor to be better than the restaurant itself. The only complaint was the noise from the traffic on Melrose Ave. It was extremely loud for the first hour, and subsided after 8pm. I would have thought booking 45 days in advance would have gotten a better table? Our server was quite interesting. Someone well suited for this type of restaurant, but he was a bit odd. Think of how SNL would portray a creepy German waiter. We ordered the 9 course tasting menu with the matching flight of wines. The food & wine were magnificent. I couldn't say enough about the dinner itself. The bill came close to $500.00 with taxes and gratuity, but well worth it. They acknowledged my birthday during the dessert which was a nice touch. Overall it was one of the longest dinners we ever ate! Bottom Line: Being seated in the overflow: 2 stars Service: 4 1/2 stars Food: 5 stars Price: Very Expensive, but worth a 5 star meal

Incredible food and service.  The loss of a star is mainly for the ambience of the place but that is being hyper-critical.   We had the 5 course taster menu which was the perfect amount of food and everything was just perfect in flavor and texture.   If you want to feel like a judge on Top Chef, go here.

We did the 5 course tasting -- but we substituted the halibut for their risotto with summer truffles -- and we added the yellow fin tuna tartare. So, all together we had 6 courses which was way more than enough food. I thought they were going to have to roll us out of there. All the food was DELICIOUS. But my favorite was indeed the yellowfin tuna tartare with the quail egg. And then Providence did the coolest thing: They only charged us for one and split the plate. Not only was it a lot of tuna, but it turned out to be the best deal on the menu for the price. Although very delish -- the risotto substitution was not worth it. The portion was very small at first blush -- but it was so rich that they did the right thing. Anymore in the bowl would have been a disaster. I was so full by the time the sous vide veal arrived, I reluctantly shared a lot of my veal with my dinner companion. Lucky lutz. The sous vide veal was HIS favorite choice of the food we had. The bread is addicting. Neither of us enjoyed the bacon bread -- very salty and very bacon-y -- but the focaccia bread was excellent. Just only have 2 pieces. Don't make the mistake I did -- using up precious tummy real estate on bread at a place like this was a shame. But I just couldn't help myself...

So, I'm not a person who usually enjoys fancy food and overly friendly and helpful staff. I like a quick table. Simple menu, matter of fact staff who help when asked, and good simple food. I was more than a little apprehensive about Providence when I walked in a dimly lit room that was well decorated and the staff so very helpful. I usually get a little uncomfortable with such attention from the staff, but they were great. They were extremely helpful with the menu and not at all condescending to two obvious novices to fine dining. I really don't know how to describe the food that we had. It was food that I had all had before, but re-imagined in a way I had never thought possible. I suppose one can call it Japanese fusion, but whatever, the food was great. The appetizers were recreated cocktails and were fantastic and fun. The 5 course tasters menu was a rich mix of different flavors that blended into a fantastic experience for both my friend and I. Definitely worth the cost and splurg once in a while. Gonna have to do it again sometime soon.

What needs to be said? This place is awesome, pricy but you get what you came/pay for. We did the 9 course tasting menu, but got tired by the 5-6th course. As I heard on Iron Chef once, "All these favors tend to tire one out" hah, well I guess thats true! I'd say if I could do it again I think the 5 course tasting menu would have been perfect. I ordered wines by the glass and they were perfectly picked (with some tastes to make sure) This place doesn't disappoint!

As good as it gets. Seriously. The market menu was great, next on my list is the dessert menu + chef's menu. _the food: 4 stars Amuse-bouche: Watermelon soup - light, refreshing, out-of-the-box. First: Santa Barbara Sea Urchin (champagne beurre blanc, fines herbes). I mean.. words cannot express.       Second: Bobby's Block Island Sea Scallops (buckwheat, napa cabbage, dashi butter) - the scallops were succulent and cooked JUST right. Clearly fresh and didn't look, taste or feel like it had touched the freezer. Third: Wild Pacific Halibut from British Columbia (fresh cranberry beans, meyer lemon, red pepper, mussels) - interesting mix of ingredients and it was a very different way to fix up a halibut dish. I was a huge fan. Fourth: Wild King Salmon from Quinault River, WA (sake, matsutake mushrooms, rosemary) - this was probably the opposite of the previous halibut dish - earthy and fragrant. The salmon was a perfect medium rare.       Fifth: Salt Roasted Santa Barbara Spot Prawns (live spot prawns roasted in salt, served simply with olive oil and lemon) - substitute for veal - this dish is a testament to how simplicity is sometimes the best. No frills, just amazing quality prawns in olive oil with lemon and salt.     Dessert: Miso blueberry cheesecake - hands down my favorite dessert. The best ever. I need to learn how to make this. _the ambiance: 4 stars I didn't like where we were sitting (high traffic). There was a curtain that separated our dining area from other areas, and the staff constantly came in and out. Other than that, the restaurant is lovely, with underwater/ocean decor, greys and soft lighting. And the service was so attentive. So attentive that it bordered too much. But no complaints here! Definitely a must-visit in Los Angeles, especially if you love fine dining and seafood.

What can I say about this place?  Perhaps the best meal I've ever had.  It was truly spectacular.  I came here on Valentine's day and they had their menu prepared especially for Valentine's day with the standard wine pairing (they did have a premium selection as well).  It was a 7 course meal with a Amuse Bouche and a Mignardises after the meal, so it felt like it was 9 courses.   The Amuse Bouche consisted of a cheese puff, a Cognac elixir with cheese froth at the top, a screwdriver in a gelatin shell that looked like an egg (served on a spoon), and a mojito in a gelatin cube.  It was the first time I had had the gelatin and alcohol concoctions and I was very impressed with both the presentation and the flavor.  They were surprising despite knowing what they were. The first course consisted of a yellowtail sashimi salid with little cucumbers, radishes, and avocado.  The yellowtail was cut into little cubes and felt very fresh.  Out of all of the dishes, this was actually my least favorite (although, it wasn't bad...its just based on how delicious the other dishes were ;-)).  It was paired with a dry Reisling, that was also quite surprising in its dryness.   The second course was a lightly smoked wild alaskan king salmon frisée with grain mustard, a fingerling potato, and American caviar.  I love salmon and the light smokiness set it apart.  The caviar was served on the potato and paired very well with it as well.  This was definitely one of my favorites of the night.  It was paired  with. The third course was a maine day-boat scallop vadouvan with ground cashews, eggplant, and rhubarb.  It was the best scallop I've ever eaten.  I didn't realize this could be cooked so perfectly.  It was seared to perfection and had a consistency that didn't make it seem so chewy as these large scallops typically are.   The forth course was a grilled wild striped bass nori meunière with sweet peas and a black truffle.  I love sea bass but this felt somewhat unimpressive.   The fifth course was a mishima wagyu rib eye onion purée with roasted green asparagus and sauce velour.  The rib eye was cut into two scrumptious slivers.  They were fantastic.  Cooked to the perfect medium rawness. They just melted in your mouth with their juiciness.  The asparagus had the perfect crunch to it, where it felt easy to eat and not stringy.   This was paired with a Cabernet Savignon and it was a perfect match. The sixth course was red raspberry litchi with shiso.  This was served in a very large bowl with the sorbet at the bottom.  I was trying to eat slowly so this started to melt a bit more than I would have liked, but it was quite good and not too tart.  It was paired with a light port that I wasn't as impressed with. The seventh course was a dark chocolate creameaux with candied blood orange.  This was a unique item that consisted of a cake layer, mousse, and a hard chocolate top layer.  It was paired with a strong port that balanced quite well with the flavor of the chocolate.   The Mignardises were petite gelatin candies that I would normally not enjoy, but tasted quite good and weren't overly sweet as they typically are.   All-in-all, this was probably the best meal I've ever eaten.  If money isn't an option, this is one of the best restaurants you can eat at in Los Angeles and perhaps anywhere.

I think I was a little too harsh in my previous review, and especially now after being to quite a few other restaurants that lack a fresh take on food, which Providence definitely has.  It's modern in a lot of respects from the decor to the play on different dishes, and I'd like to return for another round.

This place was NOT worth my $400bill! I was so hyped up by the review that everyone wrote about this place, but it was horrible! The bf and I ordered the special course. All I can say is that everything LOOKED pretty but tasted average or worse. I have never paid so much to eat very cooked fishy salmon! If you are the kind of person that does not care about how the food taste but the look, then this is def the place for you my man!( btw, the bathroom was very disgusting!

We really enjoyed our experience here.  Besides ordering enough for 4 people, the 2 of us were stuffed leaving this place.  Bill is about $400.  We ordered our own little tasting menu. Worst:  wagu beef and spot prawns.  No taste to the prawns and over cooked.  Beef, tried wagu a few other times so maybe it is just not my thing.  Best:  sweets shrimp (raw) with caviar, uni, and gold flakes.  We loved it so much we ordered another.  All the raw dishes was amazing!  The rest were good too but not as memorable.

Absolutely adore this place! The restaurant space is lovely and the service is great - ie. prompt but not stuffy. None of the dishes were overwhelming or  underwhelming. Everything is amazingly fresh and the fish/meats were perfectly cooked. The flavors were light and decadent. My only disappointment was that by the 4th course, I was so stuffed and couldn't finish my veal! Oh, and did I mention how reasonably priced the 5 course meal is? $145 including wine pairings ---- amazing!

I have met the chef owner at a local market, I have been there now 3 times and clearly I now know why Watergrill was so amazing, not a lot of palates like Michaels on the west coast, I travel all over the USA and believe Michael is at the top of the class in his profile of food, it's worth the money if your goal is to be stunned on how just how someone can be so bold and creative while keeping the integrity of the product he cooks.

A true dining "experience." Despite the detailed & patient explanations by the servers when each course of the Chef's Menu was served, I'm still not sure I could tell you exactly what I was eating, but I can tell you that it was exquisite. Be prepared to leave any food prejudices at the door...in fact, if you're the sort of person who needs to ask "what's in this?" then you might be better suited at one of the thousand other restaurants in Los Angeles. While Providence is more than accommodating for people with food allergies or aversions, it sort of defeats the purpose if you question what is being brought before you. Just sit back and enjoy, and try not think what this is costing.

For our anniversaryagain this year, my boyfriend and I decided to take a trip down to LA to go to Providence.  (We now live in the SF bay area)  I knew it was going to be a solid meal since I loved everything I tried the year before and was ready ready to order pretty much the exact same things since they were so good. ... I thought I knew what to expect. Thank goodness the items I wanted were not on the menu anymore and THANK GOD for our wonderful, charming waiter!  I remembered service as being polite and attentive but this time, our waiter was so helpful and even entertaining without imposing! (I only wish I could remember his name so I could give him teh credit he deserves!) Because the sea urchin pasta wasn't available, he offered to let me try the santa barbara sea urchin off the tasting menu.  It came in an eggshell in a very pretty gold-toned holder, slightly warm.  (We took a picture even though we've vowed not to the type of ppl who like looking at food more than eating it and lugging huge cameras w/bright flashes to nice restaurants with nice atmospheres... no offense to anyone) This was the BEST THING I HAVE EVER TASTED.  It had so much flavor and richness for something that was so small.  Even my bf who normally doesn't care for sea urchin thought it was wonderful (the waiter insisted I give him a small taste even though I was reluctant to.) I also had the black sea bass with matsutake mushrooms which was perfectly cooked and the flavors went together nicely.   My bf had the clam chowder as an appetizer which I didn't much care for (it was pretty smoky flavored, if you like that). We also tried a few of the cocktails which were very good as well.  I would definitely recommend coming here for drinks at if you're not feeling dinner.

New black stilettos, New little black dress, and New MAC super red Lasting Lust lipstick for dinner tonight. There is no formal dress code required  at Providence but how could I show up to a 2009 Michelin Two Star Guide Restauant in blue jeans and a white t-shirt? Jean-Luc Naret, director of Michelin Guides worldwide may have discontinued the LA Guide in 2010 because "...the people in Los Angeles are not real foodies. They are not too interested in eating well but just in who goes to which restaurant and where they sit."   This probably explains why Michelin did not think that there was an establishment down here worthy of a 3 star.  I am from the Bay Area so I still value the Guide's opinion and I agree on ranking Providence as one of the top 4 restaurants in LA,  and quite possibly THE best restaurant in Southern California. I am still really full from the festive late lunch in Garden Grove but the call of the Michelin Guide made me get into my white Chevrolet economy class rental to drive all the way downtown to Providence. Sunil was making fun of my car because everything in there is manual. My new nick name is Auto, last name is Matic = Ms. Auto Matic. We were laughing when they had to crank the windows down since we were not sure if the car had air conditioning.  I had no shame handing my keys to the valet ($5.50 service charge) though because we were in the armpit of LA. Directly across the street is an apartment complex! As a matter of fact, prior to Patina (the previous resturaunt's banquet room who relocated further downtown),  this building was an apartment complex. Don't be fooled by the distressed location because the 15 sous chefs in the busy kitchen are focus on emphasizing the superb quality and intricate presentation of each dish. Tonight there was alot of empty tables. I am glad that I did not have to compete with 165 reservations last night for the wait staff's attention. There are 5 dining rooms including the the covered patio and two additional private rooms in the back with a exclusive Chef's Table in the kitchen which requires at least 4 diners (maximum 6) to accommodate everyone. The restuarant and full bar of 5 years have an understated earth tones with modern furnishings. I stared obsessively at the odd mushroom or coral like white shells that bedecked the big posts and corners of the ceilings.  Somebody please tell me what was the inspiration because it reminds me of moldy trees with mushroom next to a moist abandoned apartment complex near the forest. Does Co-owner/General Manager Donato Poto want to remind us of the building's humble beginning? Co-Owner and executive chef, Michael Cimarusti offers ala carte entrees, a 5 course, a 9 course ($125), and a 15 course ($175) tasting menu. I did not travel 356 miles just to have a la carte plate. The menu for the smaller prixe fix looks delicious but I took a gamble on the Chef's tasting menu which is trusting the chef blindly to create courses of beautiful and divine seafood in its finest and purest form. The highlight of the Chef's 14 course tasting menu (15 if you count the oyster with fresh red and green jalapenos on a bed of ice and seaweed) was the foie gras. It looked like a fried retangular tofu but tasted like heaven with the dehydrated black olives and slice of orange, white solid egg foam, and scarlet turnips marinated in a tangy sweet blood orange sauce. Divine indeed... The cheese cart selection (with 19 different cheeses) was better than anything that Manresa, French Laundry, The Restaurant at the Meadowood, The Dining Room at the Ritz Carlton, or Joel Robuchon has ever offered me. The generous fromager selected the most delicate soft cow cheese, especially my favorite Kunik from Thurman, New York which was like Brie, to accompany the hard candied walnut ,roasted figs, apricot chutney, jam, and toasted slices of nutty bread. I have to admit the nuns and monks from two different regions of France are excellant cheese makers. I can still taste the aromatic black truffles in my mouth. Roger and Sunil, the two of you can continue to make fun of my rental. It is not a shiny black BMW like yours or an Aston Martin because unlike the movie stars and socialites of Hollywood, I did not come here to be seen. I came here to taste the culinary genius of Chef Cimarusti who has the vision to cut fresh fish in the cold room so they never reach room temperature. I am not surprised at all  that he beat the Iron Chef Morimoto in 2008.  Providence is actually fortunate that the harsh critics are not coming back to rate their restaurant; it means that they can continue to hang the Michelin 2 Star Plaque on the shelve in the hallway near the foyer.  When I come back to Providence I would like to be seated, not seen,  at the private Chef's Table near the fresh water shrimp and lobster tank for another 3.5 hours of bliss. I just need a simple car to get me from point A to point B, my new favorite restaurant in LA.

My husband and I dined here for our anniversary, the staff was great, they gave us menus that had our name and anniversary on them which was a nice touch.We ordered the 9 course menu, we were satisfied but not stuffed. The food was great everything was prepared perfectly. The wild mushrooms on a couple of the dished were amazing. My husband really enjoyed the sea urchin. We don''t get out often but when we do we like to go big. The reason I gave 4 stars is while all the courses were flawlessly prepared all the courses were mild, nothing really blew my mind. Everything was seasoned well but there were not many bold explosions of flavor. I have to say the exception was the amuse bouche cocktales. They were WOW yummy.

If I could give this place six stars I would... My experience here was pretty much restaurant perfection.  It is no wonder it has been one of the "Top 50 Restaurants in America." I mean, dude... check this out: * We were running a little behind on our reservation time, but they accommodated us with graciousness. Upon arrival, they greeted us by name and had us wait in the cushy lounge for about 120 seconds and then came to pick us up and whisked us off to a nice corner table. * We took them up on their corkage fee ($20) with a bottle of Champagne and they immediately put it on ice for us. * Their tap water is filtered, and they pleasantly told us so. * The fresh rolls were piping hot, steam coming out of them. * The service was impeccable.... we must have had 12 different people take care of our every need. I'm serious! * Our head waiter Martin was fantastic. *They started us off with a complementary appetizer which was a small slice of trout sashimi with a shot glass of watermelon soup. YUM! * The food was outstanding.  We had the Kanpacahi, Clam Chowder (which is listed on the menu as simply "Chowda"), Salmon, and Lobster. Every bite was heavenly.   * When my girlfriend went to the restroom, she was waiting in line and the matre d' kindly escorted her to an unoccupied other restroom. I could go on and on but the point is I cannot think of any stone this place left unturned. Their attention to detail was truly amazing. A little pricey, but worth every penny. If you must, hock something you own to eat here!

There's so much I want to say about Providence, so much that I'm left a bit speechless.  Simply, it is by far, one of the best restaurants in L.A.  From the second you walk in, you feel like you are going to have an amazing experience, and that is just what Providence delivers.  In a quiet, subtle, comforting way, it transported me into a foodie oasis.  It must be experienced to understand.   Don't walk...Run.

Truly a 5 Star experience! I enjoyed everything from decor, to service, to ambiance, to the little votive candles holders on our tables.  What topped it off, was that everything that I ate that night...was truly mind blowing!  Their drinks were amazing, and their food was even more so.  I haven't stopped raving to all of my friends how great this restaurant is, and I will definitely be going back.   One area of concern that I do need to share; the desert was horrible.  In fact, it ruined my fabulous dinner.  Their pastry chef does not live up to Providence's chef, and really should not be there.  I applaud him for trying, but he missed the mark with everything that we ate.  He first served us a complimentary desert, and that was horrible.  Then, we ordered this cafe mouse with hazelnuts and ice cream, which just left a dry chalky taste in my mouth.  I wish I could have just turned back time, and did everything the same, but without the desert. I would definitely go back, and am going back soon, but now i know...just get desert somewhere else :)

We came here without reservations but they were able to seat us within an hour. We waited at the bar and the drinks were very good. I ordered a greyhound and the bartender squeezed some fresh grapefruit for my drink. The service was wonderful! We chose to have the 5 course tasting with the wine pairing. Since it was a bit late, the chef threw in some amuse bouche for us prior to our 5 course tasting. It was a trio of their version of a gin and tonic, a margarita drop and this delicious tartare. First course: Kanpachi Second course: Scallops/Uni Third course: Halibut Fourth course: Veal Fifth course: Raspberry sorbet with some meringue The meal was AMAZING!!! The service is superb!!! This is definitely a 2 Michelin Star Restaurant!

Felt like a king almost.  Well maybe a peasant that was invited to the kings palace.   I had the chef's menu with the wine pairing.  We probably got seated around 7.  Ordered by 7:20.   The chef's menu felt like a 15 course dinner.  The problem is each course took sooo long to come out.  I think I spent more time drinking wine between the different courses than actually eating.  That said each course was a work of art.   Each course looked visually like a work of art but taste wise it was maybe a zagat 25.  By course number 12 it was already 11PM so we told the waitress to just wrap up the rest b/c we were tired.   I don't want to knock it b/c it was a very good restaurant and if the food was a bit faster it might have gotten a five star rating.   Food 4 star (effort 5 star, effort is also very important in my book) Atmosphere ( 4 star) Service (4 star) bottom line: would definitely go back for another special occasion but would recommend ordering something less adventurous.  Perhaps the full tasting or for a average night out just the five course.   check

tried the five course tasting menu. Every course is so delicately put together, regardless of the taste (which is a very subjective judgment), they deserved their 2 Michelin stars. and DONT GET ME wrong, the foods were delicious. The scallops, Kanpachi, halibut and the veal... mm... would very much go back again. o and the one star lost is for the customer service, horrible... we were left alone for 15 minutes after being served to a table. The table next to us came later than us and were serve right away with a menu and breads. can I say discrimination?

We had a large group (9 people) here during a conference in LA this summer. They were kind enough to adjust our party two times (as word spread we were going to providence more people were interested in joining). We started with cocktails and then went into the full tasting menu paired with wine. I remember liking basically every course. The uni and the cheese cart particularly stand out. The only downside was the wine pairing with the uni. Myself and a few others felt that it paired pretty poorly (a blanc de blanc). Both were fine on their own, just not together. The rest of the pairings were quite good, and our sommelier was great.

An excellent restaurant. You already know it's going to cost you so that's not an issue. Don't order set menus anywhere unless you have to. They are great if that's the only option. Not so much if one can order a la carte. Rounding off the food, service, and decor, I would have to give the place a five. Los Angeles would be worse off without it.

Outside of a few restaurants in New York City, this has been my favorite meal in the past few years. To boot, not only was the food superb, the service was impeccable. My friend and I ordered the 7 course tasting menu, but we were allowed to subsitute what ever we wanted, and in fact I ordered an extra dish my friend got. The Uni Shooter served out of a poached egg was simply sublime, if only I could eat like this every day. I would highly recommend the one goes with the tasting menu. The drinks were great as well, the bar seemed pretty popular before we were seated. Not too much of the typical LA riff raff (IE Ed Hardy).... If seafood is your food of choice, Providence really can't be beat. And unlike Red O and a few other top restaurants, it didn't seem too pretentious. I can't wait until I go back!

Easily one of the best restaurants in Los Angeles. Chef Michael Cimarusti outdoes himself with each item on the menu. Deliciously crafted with a unique taste, but not so different that you don't know what you're getting. Together with co-owner Donato Poto, they have created one of my favorite dining experiences. A number of friends and I make sure to see everyone together each holiday season, and choose Providence as our venue to make it special. The staff are extremely friendly, and take the time to get to know their patrons, who aren't treated like patrons but like friends. As well, Zahra livens the libations using her personal approach to mixology, completing the experience. Favorite Dishes: Chowda, Diver Scallops Item I Want You To Bring Back: Salt & Pepper Ice Cream!

Pros: 1. Maine lobster ($65) and NY steak ($51) was delectable and beautifully presented = A+   - Chef: Michael 2. Service = A+   - Seated in 2 min @ 5:45 on Sunday Feb 13, 2011 although 15 min late for reservations     - Maître D': Steven was friendly   - Wine expert suggestion of Riesling was sweet   - All staff solid Cons: 1. Portions were small 2. Drinks were overpriced   a. 1 bottle of Panna water $8   b. Margarita $11   c. Riesling half glass $16 3. No booths for privacy 4. No blender (from fancy restaurant?) for mixed drinks 5. Don't eat the complimentary dessert afterward. Savor the flavor of the main course. 6. Too much service. I don't want to layoff anyone, but cost can be decreased if someone comes every 10 min instead of 2 min. I can also ask for help and open my own doors. Prefer Cafe Sierra @ Hilton Universal for $55 prime rib, lobster, king crab legs, and scallops buffet. Lobster not as fresh. But then again I can get it at a seafood market, and boil it with only succulent natural flavors instead of drowned in butter. Guess I'm not one for fine dining, but glad I tried it. Now I know. Bottom Line - Overrated, but with this much hype on Yelp, you can't verify until you experience it. Hope this helps newbies.

ok, it's pretty obvious by the reviews that this place is good.  i just want to talk about my quail egg and the goodness that was inside it.  SO GOOD.  i don't remember all the ingredients unfortunately but the thing was a party in my mouth.  the other standout was the cheese selection.  the glorious cheese woman there, all i have to say to her is: yes yes yes.  what i was surprised by and enjoyed was our waiter - unpretentious and funny.  though the food was very fine dining i liked that the energy and diners of the place felt relaxed.

I wish my birthday was everyday, it was such a treat.  I felt special, like I was a part of the elite group.  The service started the moment you stepped out of your car during valet.  The hostess greets you immediately and checks for your reservation, we were early so we were guided to the bar to relax and soak in the atmosphere.  The bar was lovely, the bartender knowledgeable and before we could finish our drinks, our table was ready, it was 8:01 ( our reservations were for 8pm)  The hostess picked up our drinks and lead us to our table where we resumed conversation and sipped on our remaining libations.  We were checking out everyone else and noticed nifty bento box like platters, it was our chef special appetizers, we were delighted to receive our very own, darn I had to share it with my husband :-P  Our choice of appetizer was the caviar, first for my husband and was it a treat. We enjoyed customizing our little rounds of caviar, like a fancy taco my husband described, such a novice, very endearing. Our dishes were beautifully presented, we did not opt for the tasting, too much food.  I tried the fish, Wild black sea bass, so smooth.  I am a major fan of mushrooms so that and fish and I was good to go.  It was light and so flavorful, such a delight how smooth the dish was.  My husband had the steak and perfectly medium minus not too rare yet not quite medium, so done too perfection.  We enjoyed the serene environment and observed other patrons all enjoy their dinners.  We were so stuffed by the end of the night I didn't have a chance for dessert, boo, next time.  My only regret was not partaking of their cheese tray, the variety looked so amazing.   For an evening, I felt like how the otherside lives.  The food was beautiful but the prices were to match, it will have to wait for another life's event :-D  I will miss you Providence...

My husband and I went to providence last Friday for a special date! I have to say providence was one of the most unique experiences I have had so far. Food was absolutely phenomenon. I love the fact that you get wine tasting with every meal that comes to the table. The service is outstanding. food portions are just enough and I like the fact that there is a small break between each meal so you don't get full fast. I have been to another version of providence ( Gary Danko in SF and I loved it). I have to say as far as service and quality of food these two places are the same. The only reason I gave this place 4 star and not 5 was because I thought the price was too high. As I said, food is awesome and its a wonderful experience.GD cost us almost half the price with the same exact quality. BUT, Highly recommend it for your special night, enjoy!

Providence raises the bar on what dining is all about. By far the best dining experience I've had. It's also among the priciest but it's worth every penny. If you have an opportunity to dine here you'll be glad you did. It not only lived up to the hype but surpassed it and I can't wait to return. We started with an order of the foie gras which was excellent and then opted for the full tasting menu. We were treated to an incredible serving of at least a dozen courses, each one better than the next. If I could do it over again I'd have gone for the 15 course chef's tasting. Providence catered to our every need from start to finish. It seemed that every time a small team of people appeared to clear each course, others appeared to deliver the next.  It was refreshing to receive such amazing service from staff that was also so polite and friendly. It's clear that a lot of thought and attention goes into the combination of ingredients in every dish they prepare in addition to impeccable presentation. If you want to experience something special, this is the place.

My amazing girlfriend took me here for my birthday. I was amazed from beginning to the end. When we got to Providence i was immediately greeted by the Manager who already knew it was my birthday & that i was studying to become a chef ( thanks to my girlfriend ). He also asked us if were interested in a special tasting menu that the Chef created just for us, and of course we were! Then one by one culinary creations at their finest started being brought to our table. Not only was the presentation 100% flawless, my taste buds where in HEAVEN. They incorporate so many distinctive, original tastes into such small portions, it will have your jumping with anticipation for the next work of art. After our AMAZING dinner i was greeted by the head Chef and was thanked for dinning with them. When we got the check i felt good leaving a big tip, because Providence deserves it. On the way out i spoke some more with Matt & Wong the managers of the melrose establishment. Very knowledgeable, well mannered, presentable people. I recommend this place to ANYONE & EVERYONE who loves the culinary art.

Delicious.  The cheese plate alone is worth the trip and the expense.  Be prepared to shell out tons.  You're lucky if you walk out of there at $150 per person. Next time, I have to try the full tasting menu. The only downside was some snootiness from a couple of the employees, but what do you expect?

Unbelievable! My wife and I are visiting from Chicago and went as a group of four with our hosts on Saturday night for a 9pm reservation.  Our table wasn't ready right away, so we spent a few minutes in the bar, which was well worth it.  The cocktail menu is interesting and our group ended up with two glasses of champagne and two cocktails, all of which were spot on. Once we sat for dinner, we had to decide between one of the tasting menus (5 or 9-course) or the a la carte menu.  We decided on the 9-course menu and asked the sommelier for some assistance with choosing a white wine (we brought two fantastic bottles of red for $30 corkage).  He led us to a beautiful marsanne that paired terrifically with the first few courses. I can't say enough about dinner.  Every course was wonderful, though there were some clear winners.  The sea urchin, scallop, and halibut were all table favorites.  The cheese course was fantastic, as well, and dessert was enjoyable, if not memorable. Finally, the house-made tootsie rolls that came with the check were outstanding and a nice ending to a fantastic meal.  This dinner at Providence was as good as advertised.

My husband and I moved to LA less than a yr ago. Since we spend most of our dispoable income on food and wine, I cant believe it took us 10 mos to try Providence, despite the hoopla from credible references. Providence is now in our top 5 dining experiences of all time. (We travel and have spent time in the industry professionally so the bar is high.) Humbled to come clean that we actually engorged on Chef's pairing w/ wines  (12 courses verging on 16 w/ A.B.s) vs the popularity of 9-course reviews. ...won't recount course x course playbook - but standouts included urchin in quail egg with champagne buerre blanc & caviar (exceeded Rubichon's)... unagi & foie gras + fava beans/ daikon/ dashi (close 2nd to sweeter fave with peaches at Auberge)... perfectly charred baby octopus, blood sausage & potato... and my husband - who swore he'd never eat sweetbreads in his life - practically licked his sweetbread, polenta, wh truffles, egg & frisee plate clean. (Babbo has finally been bumped with this interpretation.) Note: drop few grains of sea salt on Sally's kitchen cheese... yum. Wine pairings were outstanding (Drew Langley). Surprised to try a wine  varietal I've never had before: Coenobium/ monastero suore cistercensi 2008. Perfect pair to the octopus. Props to the pastry chef [Adrian Vasquez? spelling?] for his mastery of seemingly simple bread. Bacon brioche perfectly tender and flavored... even the white roll had the 'just-right' carmelized Maillard crunch with a perfectly-proofed crumb interior + just enough specks of fleur de sel to complement the creamy french-style Vermont butter.  Desserts were deelish and executed to the letter. Service was beyond attentive with one server in particular a real joy to interact with... [sometimes  'palaces of gastronomy' get too stuffy and pretentious - swapping elegance for rigid formality].... But they did a masterful job of balancing our ease about food with the (primarily) groups of businessmen & intermittent couple that seemed to prefer textbook white glove service without much interaction. The dining room is nice/ comfortable; but the star is the food - not the decor. We paid for it the next day when we literally were too stuffed to eat and fasted - not by choice. It didn't help that nothing consumed would have satisfied after that menu, anyway.

I ate here a while back during white truffle season.  It was a plate to remember.  Cimarusti and his staff were on point.  This was THE BEST risotto I have ever had.  Italians had nothing on it.  Creamy, al dente and body tingling goodness.  If you like truffles keep on the look out.   I don't remember much else because this plate overshadowed everything else.  Service was attentive and I wish I could add more.  Hopefully they will repeat and you can all experience risotto nirvana.

This place blew me away and is easily the best place that I have ever eaten.  NOTHING about this place was bad.  The service was attentive, the food was totally amazing, with little surprise dishes in-between courses that were such a delight, words can't describe.  The restaurant was tastefully decorated and the staff were all well informed. The dishes were beautifully presented and if you want a special experience, with a 2 Michelin starred chef, then this is place for you.   Dress is probably smart, but we walked in off the street in jeans and they didn't turn us away.  Just an amazing experience eating there.

Had dinner last night and ordered the five course tasting menu. Interesting food but does not blow you away. The scallop course was the best followed by the kampachi. The striped bass was bland and boring. The meat course of suveed veal did not go down well with 3 out of 4 diners at our table and one person at our table had a sea trout instead which was overpowered by sweet beets. The dessert course modt of us left on our plates. The breads really disappointing including the gougiers on the amuse. The bar tender sent out tepid sazeracs which were made by a novice. The one thing about service that really amazed and bothered us was that no one particular server was assigned to our table. It was a parade of new and uninterested servers all the time. Chilly service was not conducive to a great evening. At this point not sure if we will go back though we do admire the chef

Wow, just wow. Providence still lingers on my palate even months after me and my wife came there for the first time.  The restaurant has so much going for it, it's in LA, has good parking, the wait staff is superb, and the food...whoa baby, DELICIOUS!!! Providence is a dining experience, which can be had in as a 9 course meal, a chef's menu, or a' la carte items.  The 9 course is the best way to enjoy the restaurant as a first timer, unless you have the pre-requisite 3 hours to spend enjoying the chef's menu.  Yes, you heard it correctly...3 hours of delicious entree after entree.  Of course each entree isn't abundant in size, but the flavor profile of each is distinctive, memorable, and unique in the joy each will bring. The price is up there, but much worth it. If you're looking for a place to enjoy a fancy and memorable dinner, book a reservation at Providence, you won't be disappointed.

I returned to Providence to treat my boyfriend to a fancy birthday dinner, and it wasn't quite as good as I remembered.  It was still a great meal, but I've paid less for better.  That said, I don't have much in the way of complaints - the service was top-notch and everything was delicious. I loved our waiter.  He was so friendly and helpful, and he checked in on us all the time.  Providence has a great staff, worthy of its high-end status.  Okay, I do have a couple small complaints.  One, still hate the barnacles on the walls.  Two, I'm pretty sure the music comes out of a 6-CD changer, one of the slots of which is occupied by jazzed up Christmas music.  We heard both Silent Night and Little Drummer Boy, mid-spring. We settled into our table with a couple of drinks.  We brought a bottle of wine and swallowed the $30 corkage, but we also started with a couple cocktails.  Providence has wonderful drinks for a hefty $15 a pop.  I loved my Ward 8, a strong, smooth cocktail of bourbon with pomegranate syrup and orange and lemon juice.  Matt's Dorian Grey was also great, a gin and campari concoction that was well balanced, with a mild bitterness and pucker. Bread service was excellent, and I helped myself to some smoky salty bacon brioche and a delightful nori focaccia.  The salted butter was right on point.  I also loved the amuse bouche platter, which was a highlight of both my meals at Providence.  This time we got a mojito gelée, a screwdriver bubble, a gruyere gougere, and a shot of parsnip soup with port wine reduction and parmesan foam.  The cocktail bites were fun and tasty, and the parsnip soup was beautifully flavored.  I didn't care for the gougere, though, which was weirdly chewy when served at room temperature. We decided to get the five-course tasting menu and add spot prawns and a cheese course.  This was a hefty amount of food, but I was happy with the additions - the spot prawns turned out to be the most memorable part of the meal. Our first course was Japanese kanpachi with olive oil, agretti, and a yellow tomato vinaigrette.  The sashimi was light and fresh, but nothing about it was memorable.  It was quickly eclipsed by the spot prawns that followed.  These were three large prawns, cooked in salt and prepared tableside, butterflied into six sizable pieces.  The presentation was great, and the prawns were insane.  They were treated with minimal flair, with only a drizzle of olive oil and a side of lemon wedges.  The meaty bodies were sweet and almost lobster-like in texture.  The heads were delicious, with more salt than the bodies and no mushiness.  The three prawns were $36, but I thought they offered better value than the meal as a whole. The tasting continued with Nancy's scallops with potato puree and walnut pesto.  The large scallop was perfectly cooked with a creamy interior, but it didn't have me in raptures.  The wild striped bass that came next, though, was the highlight of the tasting.  It was a beautiful piece of fish glazed with sesame seeds, and it was served with a dollop of smooth artichoke puree and the single best piece of asparagus I've ever had.  This was one stalk, cooked al dente, with enough asparagus flavor for a whole bunch.  The whole dish came resting on a brown butter Meyer lemon sauce that was worth licking off the plate.  This was followed by the single meat dish of the night, a veal tenderloin with braised daikon, chanterelle mushrooms, black truffle fondue, jus de veau, and pearl onions.  The meat was nearly flawless, cooked a uniform pink, but I got one hunk of something stringy and cartilage-like that I actually had to spit out.  Pretty unusual at a nice restaurant.  I also thought the accompaniments tended towards heavy, especially late in the meal. The cheese cart was a lot of fun, and I'd recommend it to anyone coming through Providence.  After hearing some descriptions, Matt and I got three cheeses - a hard, nutty comte, a creamy reblochon with a burrata-like flavor, and a pungent Italian triple cream cheese the name of which eludes me.  Unfortunate, as that was my favorite one.  These were plated before our eyes with nuts, jams, and dried fruits, all of which we put to good use. If I'm not mistaken, there was no palate cleanser and we went straight into dessert.  This was a green tea and caramelized milk chocolate pave with a coconut long pepper ice cream.  It was good, but not great, though I did like the peppery kick and the almost cracker-like texture of the chocolate.  When dessert was done, we got nice little mignardises - lemon macaron, chocolate marshmallow, and mint pate de fuit. With tip, our meal came out to just over $400, and it turns out that when I ate the bill, I expected more.  Dinner was great, but it didn't live up to the first one, and I've had meals in the interim that impressed me much more.  Matt and I enjoyed Providence but agreed it wasn't worth the money, and it will be a number of years before we're tempted to return.

My friend and I came here to treat each other to our birthday dinners (our birthdays are within 2 weeks of each other) and of course, it was an excuse to eat a fantastic meal. We asked the waiter about the 3 types of tasting menus and we decided on the 9-course one.  There were several waiters that served us but one of them did ask beforehand if we had any allergies.  I told him no mint and I was happy they kept that in mind as there were two courses that did have mint in it later on.   The amuse bouche was suppose to be a mint gel and a screwdriver on two little spoons, but since I couldn't eat the mint, he gave me a cheese gel? with a little leaf of basil instead.  The screwdriver looked just like an egg yolk that before the waiter told us what it was, we thought we were going to eat some sort of raw egg yolk, haha!  Loved the screwdriver, I can actually taste the vodka although my friend, the lush, couldn't, hehe. I'm not going to mention every course because we kind of lost track after awhile.  The ones we loved were:  salmon wrapped in pork belly, salmon skin chip and this little crunchy cookie with some sort of sashimi halibut inside (OMG, delish), the uni was fantastic, tenderloin was melt in your mouth perfect.  Geez, I forgot but there were other ones that we also loved.  The only course we weren't too fond of was the halibut slice, it was tender but not much flavor.  We also had four cheeses as one of the courses that came with homemade jams, candied walnuts, and a dried fig that was to die for.  I was never a fan of figs but this just converted me.  The amuse bouche to the dessert was a mojito sorbet so of course they gave me another flavor, I forgot what it was but it was good.  We thought we were finished with the final dessert but the waiter brought a tray of other sweets for the ending that put us over the edge of overstuffed.  Who would have thought a tasting menu of little bites could fill us up so much but it felt like we ate a lot of food. Our waiters described each different course but we didn't always pay close attention because we were staring at the foods.  All three of the complimentary breads were yummy, even the sourdough ball (I recommend the seaweed one though).  Our favorite waiter, who was the friendliest (one of them seemed a little impatient) asked whether we enjoyed our meal and of course we told him a big YES! We wanted to also try the 14-course chefs tasting menu but now I'm not sure if my stomach can handle it.  We'll probably be back next year for this though, oink!

I dined at Providence for my birthday with a party of 7.  I recommend the 9 course tasting menu.    2 of us 7 did the wine pairing.  The sommelier was very informative and enthusiastic about each wine.  The food was excellent and the service was outstanding.  Definitely a place to go for a special occasion and a place to splurge ($$$$$).

Extraordinary! It's the best word to describe my first experience at Providence on Sunday night. The service, atmosphere and cuisine were exemplary and I can't say i've had a better dining experience anywhere else in LA!   We arrived 15 minutes early for our 8:45pm reservation and the maitre d gave us no hassle whatsoever.  In fact, instead of making us wait an obligatory 15 minutes, he cordially escorted us to our seats. In terms of the menu, my date and I went with the special Valentine's Day 7 course tasting menu with wine pairings and, I must say, it was sublime! We started with the breads, which included a seaweed foccacia, sourdough and bacon brioche.  Of all the breads, the bacon brioche was definitely my favorite!  It was warm and pillow-y soft with the most irresistible aroma of bacon! With crispy bacon bits baked right into the dough, who could resist, right?! Amuse Bouche (Mojito gelee, Screwdriver shot, Cheese puff and parsnip soup shot) If the goal was to "amuse" the dining guest, I felt the chef was very successful with this whimsical selection of classic cocktails & savory assortments! My personal favorite was the "screwdriver," which came in the form of a dainty orange yolk on a serving spoon.  Upon popping it in my mouth, the citrus-y flavors exploded with the gentlest pressure of my tongue, leaving a zingy orange tang that awakened every taste bud on my tongue! First course "Fresh" (Kanpachi sashimi) The plating was immaculate and all of the ingredients looked very delicate and fragile, almost too beautiful to consume! With each bite, I savored the vibrant and refreshing flavors, which were incredibly mild and understated, as well.  It was the perfect starting dish for a 7 course meal and the accompanying riesling added a nice clean finish. Second Course "Sultry" (Lightly smoked wild Alaskan king salmon) With my fork, I was able to cut the salmon like butter. It was smooth, supple and quite flavorful. Much like the first course, the flavors were incredibly clean and fresh. I simply loved the addition of the crisp salmon skin, which tasted very much like a fried pork skin! It was crunchy, savory and had me wishing I could get a bag of them to enjoy later in the evening! The fingerling potato was a welcome starch to the plate.  It was cooked perfectly soft and topped with a delicate serving of exquisite caviar!  The Rose Champagne added a bright & clean finish, which rounded out the flavors of this confident and texturally accomplished dish! Third Course "Spicy" (Maine day-boat scallops) Although not as spicy as I expected, the dish was still quite successful with a perfectly cooked scallop that was surprisingly dense and rich. The scallop was nestled on an eggplant puree, which was very smooth and creamy.  I marveled over the sheer beauty of the plating which had the most beautifully deep red rhubarb reduction that was also equally tangy and flavorful! The spice component was most likely attributed to the vadouvan foam, which is considered to be the new culinary "it" ingredient.  With hints of curry, garlic, and cumin, this aromatic spice added a pleasant intensity of flavor to an otherwise mild plate. The pairing of the Pinot gris was splendid, which added a touch of sweetness to this earthy dish. Fourth Course "Dark & Mysterious" (Grilled wild striped bass) The grilled bass had a beautiful sear and a warm buttery texture that melted in my mouth! Surprisingly, they paired this course with a red (Spatburgunder), which added a robust finish to this incredibly mild yet substantial dish. Fifth Course "Decadent" (Mishima Wagyu Rib Eye) Decadent was definitely the best way to describe this hearty dish! From the succulent rib-eye, which was beautifully marbled and incredibly tender to the marvelous truffled onion purée and perfectly cooked green asparagus, I loved everything about this dish! All the individual components on the plate were very harmonious and the result was pure ambrosia! Sixth Course "Flirty" (Litchi, red raspberry and shiso) This dish was a light and refreshing departure from the previous savory and hearty dishes.  The Litchi sorbet was sweet with an almost  floral aroma, which paired wonderfully with the bubbly Brachetto "Birbet," with its intense fruity, yet fragrant notes. Seventh Course "Ardent" (Dark Chocolate Creamieux, candied blood orange) The chocolate was rich and indulgent, while the candied blood orange added a pleasant textural twist! The complimentary mini desserts: chocolate marshmallows, vanilla bean macaron and cardamom gel, were all very delicious and topped the meal off perfectly!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to celebrate a special evening in a warm, elegant yet unpretentious environment. Although this epicurean experience came at a hefty price tag, I sincerely felt it was worth every penny! Happy Eats!

i spent my anniversary at providence with: 1 piece of scallop the size of my toe 1 piece of veal the size of my wrist 1 piece of halibut the size of my knee 5 pieces of kampachi sashimi the size of my eyes 1 whole sexy man (the bf) all prepared to perfection (bf polished up very well ;)).  i had the 5 course tasting while the bf had the 9 course tasting with wine pairing.  i really enjoyed providence for its innovation and creativity in combining eastern and western ingredients.  kampachi with creme fraiche?  brilliant!   wine paring with the courses complimented very well.  they paired an array of white, champagne, pink, and red wine of local and foreign origin. service was flawless.  my only complaint was the proximity between tables.  the couple next to us was having some couple drama and the fiancee started crying after a couple of wines and got moody and bitchy.  mood and atmosphere kill.  other than that, everything at providence were culinary work of art!  i can vividly remember everything i ate :)

5 star dining experience with 3 star food. I've been eyeing providence ever since I joined yelp. After hearing many of my friends brag about it, poring over multiple blog entries, we decided that it was time. We thought long and hard about the tasting menus versus ala carte. Reason: Neither of us like sweets or desserts so we didn't know how we'd feel about 4 out of 14 courses being a dessert on the chef's menu or even the regular tasting menu. Nothing against dessert fiends, we just love meat THAT much more. Service was impeccable as you'd expect. The waiters give great recommendations and for a 'upscale' restaurant they were extremely personable and was there to accommodate your needs. Plus they were hilarious. We asked our waiter if we should get the prawns and he was like 'fo sho.' lols. Our waiter also recommended that we do the 5 course tasting and order the rest ala carte. Win win. A quick note before I get to the food, the décor is really nice. Draped in a simple blue grey palette with high ceilings, it was airy, calm, spacious. Quite the nice getaway from the bustling restaurant scene.   Food Breakdown:   GREAT - Santa Barbara Salt Prawns - These are amazing! They smell so delectable and the table side presentation was pretty cool. Roasted in kosher salt and rosmary, the prawns shelled in front of you and drizzled in olive oil. It tasted amazingly sweet. Almost like crab flavored lobster.   - Foie gras ravioli italian summer truffles, aromatics, parmesan  - I love foie gras, infatuated with pasta, and I love love love truffles so technically this dish can't fail and it didn't. The truffles are shaved tableside and he didn't hesitate to overload my ravioli with truffles. Mmm. Random: they bring out the huge black truffles and white truffles for you to smell. So baller. - Japanese wagyu beef with wild mushrooms - This was the 2nd to last course and by this point, I was pretty stuffed. The wagyu is sliced tableside and was deliciously fatty. Almost too fatty at this stage of the meal. I was slipping into food coma. The intense fattiness of it went well with the asparagus and chanterelles and potato. Paired nicely with the wine. GOOD - Cod in shiso and lemon - The cod was so delicate. I have cooked cod before and it was NOTHING like this. It was one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had. Thought the sauce was a bit overpowering though for such a delicate fish. - Hokkaido sea scallop with chanterelles, bacon - I love scallops and this was no exception. The flavor pairing was good albeit salty but the wine really cut the acidity of the sauce. - Kanpachi sashimi with soy crème fraiche with blossoming coriander - Good. Fresh. - Veal tenderloin, hazelnuts, roasted garlic, King Edwards potatoes, onion, veal jus - Perfectly cooked. It was so tender and juicy. The accompaniments paired nicely though I wish the meats were served in the middle rather than the end cuz I was so full. - Mojito, the gin and tonic, and chilled carrot soup - the amuses. It was ok. Creative and cute. Liked the mojito the most. The gin and tonic tasted like frozen G & T which is the point but I kept thinking. It's a G & T ice cube! I'm so pedestrian I know. - Cheesecake, pear sorbet, glazed pears - Interesting take on a cheesecake (which is my favorite dessert actually) I enjoyed the trio of pears, the pear sorbet was delicious. Very light and not too sweet. - Panna cotta - had just a teensy bite of this, but pretty good. MEH. - Chowda' smoky bacon, manila clams, creamy clam broth - It was ok. The broth wasn't creamy enough. It tasted like watered down clam chowder. It actually tasted like the sauce the scallops was paired with .. Just like the soup version. - Bacon, Mushroom, Truffled Risotto - I really don't want to sound full of myself. But I will. I know I can make better risotto. In fact, BOTH of us thought the same thing. This risotto was noticeably undercooked, lacked the creaminess I expect from risotto, and the bacon threw it off. I did like the truffles on top cuz it's truffles. My problem isn't that the food is overly 'avant garde' or innovative to the point where I'm just dining on foam and gels but I thought the flavoring was off in a lot of the dishes. The sauce and/or seasoning was either too salty or too rich in contrast to the protein. I don't think the flavors enhanced the meats but rather taken away from the burst of clean, fresh flavors that I expected from a renowned seafood restaurant. Despite my minor quips with the food, I am so so so lucky and thankful to have dined at Providence for my birthday no less and had celeb chef moment: I almost head butted Chef Michael Cimarusti when I was trying to escape from the bathroom (the door is uber heavy). He's so nice and has such a pleasant demeanor although I think I confused him cuz I got nervous and bowed and waved at the same time. Fml.

An 8 course dessert tasting menu? a post-dessert dessert? You kidding me? I kid you not my friends, it's all possible here at Providence. A group of us experienced such diabetic-inducing phenomena this past weekend and I have to say, besides being a memorable experience, most if not all of the desserts were delicious. 1) Mojito: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Probably my favorite dessert of the night. It's like how did you make that? I want to know. Think of it as a jello with a liquid center, with a nice rum kick. 2) Kalamansi Gelee (white chocolate coconut soy milk syrup, lychee-shiso sorbet): (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) The lychee-shiso sorbet was simply delicous with an Asian infused coconut soy sago base. 3) Sous-Vide Jonalicious Apple (Barley Ice Cream, pine nut puree, north star cherries): (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) The barley ice cream was good, as were the apples. This dish didn't stand out, but it was solid. 4) Pumpkin "Pie" (curry ice cream, pecan streusel): (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Curry ice cream? We're not on Iron Chef! Yet, the flavor of the ice cream complimented the pumpkin puree. Simply delicious! 5) Milk chocolate-whisky panna cotta w/bailey's ice cream, coconut raviolo: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…)  First of all, another winner in the ice cream department. I mean, I like Scoops, but the ice cream here is a notch better (of course, also many notches more expensive). Plus, that coconut aviolo is really something. 6) Burnt caramel ice cream, chocolate, ginger bread, pears: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) First of all, can I take a quart? Fuck, a gallon of that Burnt caramel ice cream to-go please?? Yes, it was that fucking good. The best Ice Cream I've had. I heard it tasted similar to Hagan Daz's Dulce de Leche ice cream. Even though I doubt that statement, you bet when the weather gets warmer, I'm getting myself a pint of that HD Dulce de Leche goodness. Oh ya, the rest of this dessert was good too, but I'm still thinking about that Burnt Caramel... 7) Chocolate ganache, peanut butter, pretzel, chambly noir ice cream: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) First of all, this dessert was a bit too rich for me, but appropriately, it was served in the end. I'm not a fan of peanut butter, so I was pretty OK with this desset. I do love the Beer Ice cream though. You got it, Chambly Noir (Beer) Ice Cream. 8) White Chocolate, crimson berry tea lollipop: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) This was probably the coolest dessert of the night. Pure liquid (crimson berry tea) nestled in a think white chocolate shell, in a shape of a lollipop. Simply amazing, I have to say. 9) Post dessert, dessert (Green cube: Olive oil gelées Black: Truffles, Brown: Salty Caramel): (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Solid presentation, 3 interesting mixes of flavor to cap our meal. All in all, for $50 (pre tax/tip), the 8 course dessert tasting menu was well worth it IMO. Pastry Chef Adrian Vasquez (http://www.adrianvasquez…) really showed us his true talents with his various creations that may be bold, but all delicious. Also, our server Steve was friendly and answered all of our questions to the full extent. Providence was truly an experience, and coming here for the dessert tasting only made me want to come back and try either their 9 course or full chef tasting in the near future. One might argue that it's not cheap, but for the service, food, ambiance, presentation, I was truly impressed with Providence. Oh, and a shout out to Tony C (http://sinosoul.com) for planning and hosting this awesome event. Mad props to you bro! I hope to do an update in the near future for their savory menu. Oh ya, come here nicely dressed. Business casual. Even my polo/khaki might have been slightly under dressed. Damn! *Note* 3 course ($30) and 5 course ($40) also available. Wine pairing also available: 3 course ($45), 5 course ($60), 8 course ($80)

Wow, excellent food here. Went here to celebrate a special occasion. We arrived early and each had a fresh, tasty, and original cocktail in the bar area. We ordered the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings. Each course was amazing, and the wine pairings were matched perfectly and tasted fabulous. The timing of the courses was incredible. Not too fast, not too slow. Everything moved along at the perfect pace. I don't know how they are able to time it so well. If you go, I definitely recommend doing one of the tasting menus with wine pairings. For 2 people with pre-dinner cocktails, and the 5 course menu with wine pairings, plus tax & tip, our bill was just under $400. Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Yes. If you eliminate alcohol, Providence could be much cheaper for you, but what fun would that be? :)

Providence Part 2...The Meal continues...(this is a continuation of my first review.  Please start with that one in order to read from the beginning) The last of the main courses was Veal Tenderloin, braised dikon radish, chanterelle mushrooms, black truffle fondue, and jus de veau.  We were told that the Veal was cooked for over 2 hours sous vide and would be the most tender veal we'd ever eat.  What I wasn't told was that mine would be cold.  It tasted so good, I hated to send it back but when comparing the temperature of my veal to everyone else's, it wasn't close.  It was actually so cool to the touch, I had thought that perhaps it was supposed to be that way.  When they brought me a new one it was presented with a metal lid over the plate.  The lid was only removed after placed in front of me.  Something didn't sit right with me about this, it was a little over the top and made me feel like they were sticking it to me.  "Oh yeah, it wasn't warm?  Here you go, is it hot enough for you now?"  Just serve me a warm piece of veal, don't make a big deal about it.  I didn't make a big deal when I sent it back.  I even said "This tastes so good, it pains me to send it back, but it's cold."  Anyway the funny thing is, the 2nd one wasn't much hotter than the first.  And it was still cooler than my dining companions veal.   As for the veal itself, it was perfect medium rare all the way through and cooking it sous vide brings out the pure flavor of the meat, it was outstanding.  It was sitting on a 1/4 inch thick circular daikon radish slice.  It had the texture of a slightly firm potato.  Under this was black truffle fondue.  This thick gravy was so rich, but didn't overpower the veal.  It was the perfect amount of truffle flavor.  The rest of the plate was filled with an au jus from veal, which was nicely soaked up by the chanterelle mushrooms. Next up was the cheese cart.  It was so impressive, there were 17 different cheeses.  The fromager asked us what kind of cheese we liked.  We told her, everything from mild to ripe strong cheeses, however my wife preferred milder cheese.  The fromager then picked four cheeses and told us a little about each one.  The first two cheeses were described as mild, one goats milk, the other sheep.  The 3rd and 4th cheese she cut, we assumed would be stronger, but were also very mild.  What a waste, all those great cheeses and she gave us 4 very similar cheeses.  I'm not a cheese expert, so I didn't want to say, "excuse me but I don't see any blue or green veins, you got anything like that?"  You would think that "We like everything" would have gotten us a nice diverse selection.   The cheese was served with a few different toasts, roasted figs, apricot chutney, and candied walnuts.  Also there were 3 of us, but only two large pieces of walnut was presented.  So I tried cutting one of the walnuts, only to have half of it go flying the speed of light into the air and hitting our waiter standing at another table.  Classic!  He joked, are you throwing food at me now?  I just hope I didn't hit other customers, because it was an explosive situation.  Note to self....never try to cut a walnut again....Note to Providence...don't serve 2 walnuts for 3 people. I thoroughly enjoyed my wine pairings all night, however the wine pairing for the cheese, I didn't like at all.  When my waiter asked how I liked the wine (as he did for every course), I was polite, "I'm sure it's a good quality wine, I just don't care for it."  He seemed surprised and said, "Sorry" then walked away.  Really?  That's it?  No offering of a different wine?  What's the point of asking?  I didn't drink more than a few sips, it's not like I downed it and then told him I didn't care for it.  The glass of this unfinished wine also remained on the table for the rest of the meal like a scarlet letter.   The next course was really just to cleanse the pallet.  Rather than a sorbet, it was a small bowl of Paige tangerines, junmai sake, and lemongrass granite.  The lemongrass granite is sugar, water, and lemongrass boiled until it becomes a syrup.  Then it is frozen.  It was shaved very thinly into sheets of ice and placed over the clear sake.  The result was like breaking small shards of glass with your spoon as you ate it. Along with the tangerines, this dish wasn't sweet or savory, but created more of an airy like flavor.  It was very refreshing. The final course of the evening was green-tea & caramelized milk chocolate pave with mandarin coconut-long pepper ice cream.  Yes is was as good as it sounds.  A pave is a flourless cake, so it was plenty thick, rich, and heavy on the chocolate flavor.  The green tea and caramel flavor came from, what I can best describe as a think crunchy chocolate like cookie that covered the top of the cake.  It was excellent. 3 hours and 45 minutes later, we all zoomed off home with big smiles on our faces.  Providence is amazing, and I'm thankful I got to experience it.

i would've written a really detailed review of this place--the multi-course tasting menu we had since i took pictures while making mental notes on the taste, texture, and presentation of each dish. unfortunately(?), as we were about to have the desserts, my boyfriend got down on his knees, produced a ring, and popped the question. i should've known that something was up when he had flowers delivered to the restaurant. but I didn't--i thought he was being extra romantic. and somewhere between the surprise and water spill from a wobbly table that soaked my bf (while still on his knees), i lost whatever thought i had about the dishes we had. nevertheless, five stars for the best surprise ever!

The portions are perfect for someone who eats out alot and is trying to watch their figure. The food is exquisite!! Great fine meat, truffle pastas, egg and uni, the best cheeses... The wine selection is probably the best in LA. I will try the tasting menu next time because there are so many choices plus I have a feeling their wine pairing will compare to Craft:)

definitely not as good as everyone states or raves. not impressed. if this is what they call 'One of the best restaurants in LA" then LA has real problems. I really think the knowledge of food experiences in the US is very low. Low standards of taste.

An intimate and elegant setting with top notch service.  The tables are spaciously arranged in rooms with high vaulted ceilings allowing for a comfortable and personal experience.  TI like how the walls are artistically decorated with tiny ceramic fixtures that represent sea life since they since they specialize in seafood.  The food is incredible! The crab dish with passion fruit was amazing. I had the lobster for my main course and it was the best I've ever had because I didn't have to drench it in butter or work to take it out of the shell. They also have a great wine menu.

When it comes to fine dining, Providence is my favorite. I am in love with Michael Cimarusti. A man that can cook like that, won't you please marry me. I've had the 5 course tasting, 9 course tasting, and a la cart items; everything that leaves the kitchen is exquisite. Every dish is thoughtfully put together and beautifully presented. Bold flavors and textures are a huge part of the menus success. Sometimes, there's a little too much foam and gelee but that's okay; how often are you going to get curry foam? Don't forget the wine pairing, Drew Langley is a god. If he doesn't turn you into a wine lover, you have no hope. I love happy endings and pastry chef Adrian Vasquez makes sure that I always leave happy. Unique combinations of flavors and ingredients used in desserts that are beautiful to look at and tasty too. He's so good that he has his own dessert tasting menu! It's rare that I am able to be excited about a restaurant, visit after visit but I find myself giddy with excitement every time. Like the night before a trip to Disneyland, it's hard to sleep and all I can think about is all the fun I'm going to have at Providence. With Providence, you can tell they want every aspect of your meal to be perfect. It's a beautiful restaurant, fine dining without the stuffy snobby feeling, great food, perfect pairing wines, and decadent desserts. It doesn't get any better than this. Bon appétit. *If it's dinner for two, ask for the Best Table in the house (table #7) and enjoy a 10% discount! Also known as the worst table of the house at Providence (it's a great table even if it's considered the worst) .

Ohhhhhhhh. Heaven. And it was in my MOUTH! Where else would heaven be? I hate to say it, and I'm gonna say it (mom, I hope you're not reading this), but a night here was better than a 2 hour marathon I once had in bed... and dinner lasted just as long! Save your Benjamins for this place because it's worth every penny. The Little Door used to be my fave dining place in LA, but now Providence has convinced me to leave that old hag for something more fresh and more sexy. Chef Michael Cimarusti - I bow to you and will be your humble servant if you keep feeding me your gastronomic dishes. I came here with 2 other friends and had dinner reservations at 9pm. Late. I know, but was totally worth it. We each did the 9-course tasting and it took about 2.5 hours before we paid the bill and left. We actually shut the place down and the staff didn't rush us out. Everyone here was very knowledgable in each dish and how it was prepared. Now the 9-course: A. Amuse bouche - We were served a heavenly tray of 4 "spherical" starters that included a Mojito Gillette, Greyhound sphere, Gruyere cheese bread, and a shot with a delicious port at the bottom. 1. Japanese kanpachi with crispy rice crackers and creme fraiche - Butter. Pure butter. This dish melted like butter in my mouth. 2. Santa Barbara sea urchin - Holy crap! This was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. I've never been a fan of "uni" because of a bad experience at a sushi restaurant. It's been 9 years since I last had a taste of uni and Chef Cimarusti has me absolutely loving it! 3. Wild striped bass - The brown butter that was served with this dish was savory. The fish was moist and very tender. It's easy to overcook fish, but this was as close to perfection as you can get. 4. Tasman sea trout - This was served sashimi style. Ohhhhh, it was better than any piece of sashimi you'll ever have. Butter. That's all I can say. Everything about Providence's seafood is so fresh everything just feels like butter in your mouth and it's just as flavorful. 5. Sea Scallops - It's easy to overcook scallops as well to the point that it becomes rubbery and tasteless. The sea scallops were moist, large, and perfectly seared with a brown crispy edge and a soft center. Perfect. 6. Veal tenderloin - This was the only dish I didn't like. I'm not a fan of veal, so this is just preference. The veal itself, however, was cooked medium rare and when cutting in to it it felt like cutting into a silky smooth filet mignon. I took a few bites of this dish but didn't finish it. This was the dish that started to make me feel full, so I decided to put the knife down and wait for the rest. 7. Market cheeses - Dinner would not be complete without a tray of cheese at your choosing. The figs that were also served were so delicious. I've never had a pure fig before and it tasted much better than Fig Newtons (which I really love). While picking our cheese from their display, my friend asked what was the smelliest cheese they had. The server pulled out a lump of cheese in plastic from behind the cart (like it was a secret stash of crack) and handed it to us to smell. EWWWW! That was one disgusting smelling cheese. Imagine gym socks, dirty panties, soiled towels, and grandma's undergarments. Gross. Gross. Gross. Apparently, though, it's one of their most expensive cheeses. Yeah, not gonna try it even if it was made out of gold. 8. Granita - This was a lemongrass granita with sake jelly to cleanse the palate. Very refreshing. 9. Banana bread pudding with barley ice cream - I'm not so much a fan of bread pudding, but once again Chef Cimarusti has me converted into a believer that the sweetness of heaven can also be in the form of banana bread pudding. This was so good, that no matter how full I was, I managed to finish the entire dessert. I even came close to licking the plate clean. Perfect way to end the meal. Other dishes we ordered that are a MUST try: The Santa Barbara Spot Prawns that were cooked in front of us in a bed of salt and then de-shelled in front of us. Incredible display! We also tried the Ravioli Black Winter Truffles - the server did not skimp on the truffle either! If Yelp allowed 10 stars, this place would earn an 11. I'll come back to try their 14-course tasting which has an entirely different menu than the 9-course. Every dish was expertly executed and perfectly presented as if it were fine art (and that it was). You'll spend $125pp for a 9-course tasting and it's worth every penny. The service, the ambience, the food... it's ALL worth it. Allow a 2 hour dining experience when ordering the 9-course. I hear the 14-course will take about 3 hours. Time flies when you're enjoying your dishes. Bring great friends you can have good conversation with and enjoy a few cocktails as well. It'll be a night to remember. Promise.

I wish I were able to give PROVIDENCE more than 5 stars but that's all I'm  allowed.  Dining here just isn't a night out, it's an experience.  The decor is subtle and classy, the service superb, and the food . . . amazing!!!  My partner had the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings but with all of the extra courses the chef sent out, it ended up being more like 12 courses.  A little pricey . . . sure.  Worth every penny . . . definitely!  Can't wait to go back.

my thoughts on my second visit to providence, where i took advantage of the 5-course anniversary tasting menu for $65: -the seaweed focaccia, a new addition to the bread basket, definitely won me over with its subtly briny seaweed aroma and taste. i haven't had quite anything like it before and i have to say i even preferred it to the bacon brioche! -the foie gras ravioli was every bit as decadent and rich as i expected, and a generous portion (although i think it cost an extra $28 to add it to our tasting, *ouch*). the freshly grated black truffle dusting the top was a nice touch. -the halibut was very disappointing, especially since it's one of my favorite types of fish. it was undercooked and oversalted. i also may have been biased because i don't particularly care for olives. this is the only course i didn't finish (although my dining companion was more than happy to finish it for me). -however, the veal cooked sous vide was amazingly tender and flavorful. that dish alone deserves 5 stars! -the yuzu curd with blackberry sorbet didn't quite work for me. it was a bit too tart and unbalanced. come to think of it, i didn't quite finish this one either. -overall, i wasn't as impressed this time around (although i couldn't complain about the company aka my dining companion). i do still want to return someday to try the full chef's tasting menu with wine pairing.

i understand why many consider this the best fine dining restaurant in LA.  it was an amazing memorable meal.  the elements of flavor, texture, and presentation were spot on.  particularly the seafood, not so much the beef. bread: bacon brioche was the best of the 3 amuse bouche: gruyere-filled gougere was sublime with that powerful flavor of melted cheese inside a perfect puff pastry the marshmellow with nori crunch was an interesting texture contrast and then the shot glass with parsnip and truffle had a great complex and tasty flavor profile ~ big eye tuna sashimi blood orange, red shiso granita, mizuna :good ~ nancy's hand harvested diver scallops mcgrath farms english peas, and baby vegetables, hinting at spring :the purees were phenomenal, such a bursting of flavor in a small dollop ~ wild local swordfish weiser farms pee wee potatoes, pei mussels, extra virgin olive oil lemon zest, italian parsley :this one had a little too much tomato but was otherwise good ~ crispy skinned medium rare arctic char braised turnips, black truffles, frisée, bacon :my favorite dish, the truffle sauce was plate-licking good prime dry-aged strip loin of beef macaroni gratin, roasted asparagus, bone marrow :the only dish i didn't care for as much ~ litchee sorbet, rose, raspberry with macarons :actually an edible rose petal, this was really tasty, i want macarons and sorbet together all the time ~ chocolate mousse with a crisp edge, salted caramel, passionfruit banana sorbet, red chile :ridiculously delicious dessert, the contrasting flavors, and textures were spectacular ~ petit fours :just ok but the box of chocolates from the pasty chef were very beautiful of course, the only thing that topped the meal was the person i was sharing it with!

It is truly the most decadent culinary experience you can find in Los Angeles.  After living in the bay area, I  had yet to find a restaurant that measured up to the chez panisse/gary danko/zuni cafe standard.  That is, until I ate here.   I did the full tasting menu with wine pairings ($140 for nine courses), but the waiters kept bringing out little extras that the chef had prepared.  By the end of the night we'd probably had twelve courses.  I let the waiter pick one of the restaurants signature cocktails (which I highly recommend), but I was not expecting such long pours on the wine with dinner and found myself far too drunk for a Tuesday night.   All in all, the food, wine, service, and decor were amazing and I highly recommend Providence to anyone with 4 hours and too much $$$ to spend on dinner.

This has to be one of my favorite dining experiences. The restaurant itself is painted in warm colors, filled with soft lighting and decorated with modern accents. The food was fantastic. Our dinner was preceded by a trio of palate cleansers: a wasabi marshmallow, a savory creme puff, and a salmon tartar with cream fraiche and trout roe and fleck of gold leaf. The creme puff was outstanding and the tartar was a tasty medley of ingredients, including some sort of sweet gelee in the bottom. The bread bowl included a fabulous herb foccacia. I had three slices and they're sizeable. Appetizers: potato and leek soup with manila clams and bacon. The broth was a like watery creme. There wasn't enough clam flavor. (LA Mill Coffee in Silver Lake makes this exact same dish but infinitely better.) Kampachi with crisped rice was really tasty. The fish was fresh and lightly dressed. The only downside was the diminutive portion. Entrees: Prime New York steak with potatoes roasted in DUCK FAT, roasted cauliflower. Words cannot describe how exquisite this was: the steak was seared to utter perfection. It was uniformly cooked to a lovely pink medium, tender, moist, and flavorful. Every item on the dish was created with an equal amount of consideration. The cauliflower and fat roasted potatoes were so damn good. That should be an appetizer. The wild striped bass with parsnip puree, roasted potatoes, tomatoes was also perfection. The fish was juicy, flaky and tasted fabulous. It was the best striped bass I've had. And the potatoes, puree, celery leaves and diced tomatoes were delicious, and together created an artistic and colorful presentation. Dessert: The Kalamansi gelee was fantastic. I love this sweet and tart citrus which was the star of this desert. It's topped with a lychee sorbet, small tapioca, crisped rice puffs and white chocolate coconut soy milk soup. The tropical flavors had sweet, crunchy, jelly/gelatinous, creamy, and cold components. It's one of the best deserts I've ever had. Chocolate with sesame ice cream, crushed peanuts, ginger. I'm not a chocoholic and didn't think this was too good. I thought the ginger overwhelmed the milk chocolate. The peanuts seemed like a forced addition. The sesame ice cream was very good. After dinner tea of chamomile. The teas are served in heavy pots to hold the heat, and the tea was so delicious I decided to lift the lid. I discovered a sachet of whole flowers, leaves and herbs suspended over the hot water. The aroma was wonderfully fragrant. Petit fours: chocolate marshmallow, pistachio taffy, french macaroons. I wasn't impressed with this at all. The marshmallow as soft and delicious but the coating was weakly chocolate-y; the pistachio was too too sweet; and the macaroons were too sugary. Even for macaroons, they were insubstantial. We had a large table and I think we overwhelmed the staff. If we needed anything, it was hard to find the scarcely there server. The uniforms seem to make them blend into the walls. We couldn't figure out if that was the look they were going for. Overall, a near 5 star (maybe 4.75) experience.

i can finally say, i've tried providence. verdict? i've died, gone to heaven, met Jesus, and dined with the heavenly Father. i went with 5 course which is $95. i didn't try wine pairing because i drove and didn't want to get drunk (someone told me they got drunk afterward). 5 course, in my opinion, was plentiful, but we did order tuna tartare and octopus with blood sausage. next time, if someone out there who is nice to enough to take me, i'd probably go with their regular menu and order what i like. if this is your first time, go with tasting menu for the whole "experience." if you are ordering off reg. menu, i highly recommend octopus w/blood sausage over tuna tartare. the tartare was average to me, or at least not to my liking, but, octopus was excellent. i also got to try 3 different types of bread [perhaps that is why i was so stuffed!] and i like sourdough the most, seaweed then bacon bread. [i could be minority on this since i prefer simple bread] when i was done with the first bread, i requested to my waiter, "can you send me the man with bread basket again??"  the man in charge of bread basket knew to check in with me everytime he was near our table.   with each course, the head waiter kept coming back to check in with me, "how did you like the dish?" i kept saying, "oh, THIS was my favorite!" he thought i was hilarious since my favorite was whatever the last dish i ate. i appreciated delicious, interesting, innovative combos -- this place is big on fresh cream and daikon. who knew?!? -- the chef created. NOTABLE MENTION: one annoying table i witnessed - there was a young couple (very casually dressed i might add) was playing with their phones entire night! perhaps they don't have much to talk about, but come on, put down your freaking phone and savor the flavor! they were playing with two years old, 3G iphones from beginning to the end of the meal. their parents should have taught them better, those kids ought to have better table manners.   ugh!  young'ems in these days..

My fiancé's family and I came here in early June 2010 to celebrate a graduation. My fiancé and I are chronically early, especially in LA where it's impossible to predict traffic. So of course we were early for our reservation, which was at 6pm when they open. Luckily for us, the door was unlocked and the host and servers were really friendly and understanding. Even though they were not finished with their meeting, they sat us at our table and provided drinks for us while we waited for the rest of our party. I was so glad we had such good luck! It's a beautiful restaurant, and being able to view it empty was a treat. I love all the little details: the sand dollars on the walls, the light fixtures, the beaded candle holder. It definitely got me in the mood to eat some fish. After everyone arrived, we decided on the full tasting menu. It consisted of: 1. An amuse bouche of three items: a frozen square of a mojito, a bubble of a gin and tonic, and a little glass of a fish dish I can't remember topped with crème fraiche and gold 2. Japanese kanpachi with crispy rice crackers, coriander, soy crème fraiche 3. Santa Barbara sea urchin served in a farm fresh egg, champagne beurre blanc, fines herbes 4. Bobby's Block Island scallops with Japanese eggplant, rhubarb, cashews, reduction of Vadouvan and Jurançon 5. Wild Day-Boat Pacific halibut with summer squash, black olive, dried apricot, basil 6. Wild troll caught King salmon with fava beans, french breakfast radish, white asparagus 7. Marcho Farms veal tenderloin with sweet peas, bacon, almond, maitake mushrooms 8. Market cheeses 9. Cucumber sorbet with yogurt foam 10. Yuzu curd, meringue with blackberry sorbet, jasmine 11. Mignardises of macarons, jellies, and chocolate covered nuts Everything was delectable. The standouts were the fish in the amuse bouche (1), the sea urchin in the farm fresh egg (3), and the cheese service (8). Unfortunately, I don't remember what kind of fish was in the amuse bouche or what the other ingredients were (and it's not on the menu I took home), but I remember becoming more and more giddy after every bite. It was SO good. The sea urchin was also exciting. I wasn't expecting to like it, as I've had sea urchin at sushi restaurants and wasn't the biggest fan. Here, it was served warm and with other things. It worked beautifully, and the presentation was stunning. It was served in an egg stand made to look like a bird's nest. The cheese service was outrageously luxurious. A server who knew a lot about the cheeses rolled over a cheese stand overflowing with rare and very expensive cheeses. She asked what kind we all liked, and I was the only one of my party who preferred mild buttery cheeses to sharp stinky ones. She helped us pick a plate that would satisfy all of us and taught us about each cheese she offered. It was almost theatrical and very interesting! We wound up with a cheese plate piled high with cheeses and accompaniments that were all to our liking. Wonderful service. I was very impressed with Providence, the food, the atmosphere, and the service. It's no wonder they have 2 Michelin stars. They deserve it. I hope I can go back soon.

Providence is my husband and my favorite Michelin restaurant in the US and overall favorite upscale restaurant in LA (besides Osteria Mozza and Sushi Zo).  We've had the 5 course tasting, full tasting, wine pairings, and have also tried the a la carte menu. Every time we've left completely satisfied....which isn't always the case when you spend a lot of money on one meal. What I like about Providence besides the great food is that it's not pretentious, no dinner jacket required, the price point is reasonable, there's option for a la carte, it's not hard to get a reservation at all, and the service is good. Their cocktails are pretty delicious too.

Based on reviews from Yelp and Open Table we got a last minute reservation. Upon arriving we did not realize that we will be seated in a private room which only had 4 tables.  So I can't comment what the atmosphere was like in a main dinning room. We had the 6 course chef's pre-fix menu, entire bill including tip was about $480 for 2 ppl. The menu did have quality high end ingredients and interesting presentation but the meal was sadly lacking. For this kind of money I expected more. It does not compare to Daniel Restaurant in NYC. Overall it was a good experience but the flavors could have been better. Risotto with black truffles was great. Service was just ok. After having bread waiter didn't even remove the crumbs from the table.

Providence [prv'-dns] n. - a foodie destination in Hollywood, one of the 4 restaurants in LA to receive 2 Michelin Stars, THE place to take your date to wine, dine, woe and swoon her.  My bf sure found the short cut to my heart when he took me to Providence to spend our first Valentine's Day together....smooth, reall smooth. The intimate, romantic and soothing environment is perfect for any special occasion.  I was captivated by the coral-esque candle holders on the table..they were so pretty, I almost wanted to take one home, but my purse was too small. (Joke) We ordered the 5 course chef tasting menu.  They were beautifully presented from the amuse bouche to the le petite four, and the flavors of each dish is calculated to perfection and dances with my palates. -- Amuse Bouche: seafood salad, water chestnut shot of soup and tuna tartar bite.   http://www.yelp.com/user… -- A drink trio of a greyhound gelee, mojito gelee, and gin and tonic cube.  The gelee bursts in your mouth...an explosion of flavor and liquor. http://www.yelp.com/user… -- Lobster Ravioli with fava beans, king oyster mushrooms and ginger http://www.yelp.com/user… -- Dunguness Crab with cashews, apple, jalapecoconut (my mouth is watering as I type...) http://www.yelp.com/user… -- Maine Lobster Risotto: carnaroli rice, sea urchin (uni), shimeji mushrooms, nori and lemon http://www.yelp.com/user… -- Deconstructed Cheesecake, passion fruit sorbet, handmade donuts http://www.yelp.com/user… -- Chocolate Ganache, peanut butter ice cream, dark chocolate covered pretzel http://www.yelp.com/user… -- Le petite four: kalamansi gelee, salty sweet caramel, hazelnut chocolate cup Best meal I have had in L.A. thus far.  Truly deserves every recognition it receives.

Get the tasting menu.  My favorite dish is the sea urchin pasta. Service is fantastic and unobtrusive. Our tables were a little late that night and the chef sent out appetizers for everyone waiting in the bar to munch on.

The amuse bouche, melon soup with Riesling air and a salmon tartare with salmon skin, set the bar high right at the outset of our dining experience. Although the soup was served in a tiny little shotglass, it was infused with flavor that awakened taste buds I didn't know existed. Appetizers and entrees are served beside a few scattered sauces that finely complement their seafood counterparts. The meal was the perfect fusion of culinary technique and an emphasis on preserving the freshness and flavor of the natural ingredients. Desserts mainly comprised of cooked fruits with the white peach being a stand out. Entrees $30-40. Our second go at the restaurant was lackluster. The server seemed uninformed about the menu and answered my questions with little or no detail. The lobster salad lacked any sort of flavor beyond the sweetness of the fruits present in the dish. The sea urchin and crab risotto was sourly milky (in Vietnamese, we call this beo). I confirmed with out waiter that the monkfish was mild, but he failed to mention that it had the texture of a scallop crossed with a fish. My dad's ahi tasted like it had bacon wrapped around it (though it didn't), but the preparation was as good as ahi gets (given that I usually despise seared ahi). He recommended the lemon verbena panna cotta for dessert, but didn't warn me that it wouldn't be tart at all--it was savory and spicy. However, the first time I went, I confirmed that Michael Cimarusti, the head chef, was indeed in the kitchen. Perhaps this time he wasn't. The melon soup amuse bouche didn't taste quite on par.

So on my day off I decided to take my gf and go to Providence. Lucky me cuz Providence is open for lunch once a week and it just happens to be my day off (Friday). so i make reservations at 12 and we walk in a little early and behold its empty. i hated the fact that it was empty and just us two, but i tried to be positive and look forward to a great meal. i found out this meal that being the first customers is a good thing. having researched the menu before, i had an idea of what we should order. we ordered the clam cakes, salt roasted santa barbara spot prawns, lobster risotto, and the halibut. first the amuse came out. it was a spoon of cured tasmanian trout with creme fraiche and crispy rice. it was a tad salty but delicious. then part two of the amuse came out. i was kinda suprised, but when i saw what it was i kinda knew it was coming. my coworkers at craft told me about the mojito "sphere" and the "gin and tonic" amuse and that is exactly what was presented to us. it was cute and fun and pretty delicious even though i don't like gin. then the first suprise of our lunch came, a third course for the amuse. it was a trio of seafood: santa barbara uni custard with reduced soy sauce, scallop sashimi with american caviar, and finally dungeness crab with celery, coconut, apple, and black tea gelee. it was all delicious. i don't know if they sent this out because we were the first customers or what, but i sure appreciated it. **side note: finally some other diners came in, but my gf and i were doing some spying and noticed that other diners only got one course of amuse. then our clam cakes came out. these were basically chopped clam fritters served with a yuzu kosho mayo. this dish originated from chef cimarusti's grandmother and i definitely tasted the love in it. it was light, fluffy, moist, and crispy. and the mayo added the perfect acidic/sharp counterpart to the crispy fritter. even though the entrees are usually the piece the resistance, we decided that the prawns were def. the main highlight of this lunch. our waiter came out with a cart and there i saw the same prawns that were served on daniel boulud's show After Hours at Providence (http://video.aol.com/par…) (check out 18min 22 seconds for the prawn scene).   basically, its 500 degree salt and buried under it is the prawns with rosemary. our waiter then shook off the excess salt, cut and presented us the prawn with olive oil and lemon. WOW. WOW. WOWIE! moist and mouth watering. it wasn't salty at all, perfectly seasoned. and also, eating the head of the prawn was to die for. all the flavor of the ocean packed into this tiny little head. finally our entrees, came out. the halibut was crusted with basil (no breadcrumbs) and served with oven roasted tomato, tempura clam, and roasted baby artichokes. eating all of it together was heaven in my mouth. reminds you of being on the mediterranean coast. and my lobster risotto was perfectly cooked (both rice and lobster). i was too full to go on, but i new that the pastry chef (adrian vasquez) was quite famous for his desserts, so we ordered the "fig newton" with mastic ice cream (pistachio) and some red tangy foam. when the dessert came out, two plates showed up. our second suprise of the day. we got another freebie. it was the deconstructed yam pie with curry ice cream. i usually don't order desserts but i finished my dessert. ****we also got a dessert amuse: coconut tapioca with a litchi gelee and rauram sorbet ( i think) the bill came out to 110 dollars, which i thought was totally reasonable, especially after all the comped items. i thanked chef cimarusti and chef vasquez for a wonderful meal and i can't wait to return and try the tasting menu.

Holy cow! Best and most expensive meal I've ever had. It was an experience.The staff could have been stuffy and rude, but they were very personable. We went on a Tuesday (my birthday) and it was full but not insane. I recommend going during the week. we felt very attended to. The food was beyond BEYOND!!! Wine parings were generous. Decor was minimal. Lovely frou-frou cocktail menu.

This has to be one of the best meals I've had in Los Angeles. I've been here a while ago, dined a la carte, and had a fine meal. Coming back this next time, I had high expectations for the tasting menu. Service was excellent. The servers were gracious and honest, and were really receptive to any feedback we had. We decided to get the chef's menu, adding an extra 2 courses: -Greyhound, mojito and gin & tonic 'bubbles' and gelee Beautiful presentation, and this was a great amuse, showing some molecular gastronomic flair. The greyhound and mojito were essentially bubbles of flavor that, when put in your mouth, burst and tasted just like it was supposed to. -Kanpachi sashimi with endive, summer truffle vinaigrette, soy creme fraiche The kanpachi had a fairly chewy texture, which was a little unexpected. The truffle vinaigrette and creme fraiche was a nice complement to the kanpachi. -Soft poached egg with osetra caviar A very nice dish here - the egg was a nice creamy consistency, combined the croutons and caviar really made a delicious combination. -Santa Barbara spot prawns grilled over bincchotan charcoal with olive oil and lemon Great presentation as the prawns were presented tableside whole and on a bed of salt and rosemary. They were then cut in half and dabbled with olive oil and a lemon wedge. Sweet and succulent, these tasted really fresh. It was very simply prepared - perfect for such a fine ingredient. -Unagi with summer truffle, crushed potato, quail egg This dish was very tasty, although noticeably salty. The quail egg was nice, and combined with the potato matched the unagi well. One problem, however, was that one member of our party found about 10 bones within the small piece of unagi. Obviously a huge flaw as each bite had to be carefully chewed and sifted for bones. -French turbot with matsutake and rosemary I don't really like white, meaty fishes so much, and this was not an exception. I don't think the preparation was flawed (although my first couple bites of the fish seemed a little undercooked), it just didn't meet my personal preferences. -Niman ranch pork belly with carrot-orange puree The pork belly here was delicious. It had a nice strip of charred, crunchy skin and just enough fat to make it very moist and flavorful. Though Providence is known mainly for seafood, this dish was cooked flawlessly. -Wild king salmon belly with kumquat and peas This dish was fairly middle-of-the-road at this point, given the previous dishes had mostly been very good. This was a good dish, but nothing spectacular. The salmon skin was nearly seared for that crunch, and the kumquat and peas were a good accompaniment. -Saddle of colorado lamb with tomato compote, eggplant, and artichoke The lamb here was cooked medium. I would have liked the lamb more rare (rare to medium rare) and more tender. The tomato compote, eggplant artichoke, and the sauce were all delicious. However, I expected the lamb to be more tender. -Japanese wagyu beef with wild mushrooms We had to order this extra dish, as it was just teasing us as a supplement on the bottom of the menu. The japanese wagyu here was not as fatty as Urasawa's or Cut's. If you had told me it was American Kobe, I would have believed it. The mushrooms and carrots accompaniment were nice; but the center of this plate was obviously the wagyu. Tasty and tender, but not as marbled as I was expecting. -Hokkaido scallop with squash blossoms We ordered this extra as well, as we saw a neighboring table eating it. The scallop was huge - about an inch and a half in diameter, Cooked perfectly with a juicy, yielding center. Not too fishy, it had a good flavor. The mission fig, fennel, and onion puree fit well with the scallop. -Kalamansi lime gelee, lychee-shiso sorbet, white chocolate coconut soy milk soup with tapioca balls This was a great dish. I was amused that the server called the tapioca balls "boba" to us..because we're asain? It's listed as tapioca balls everywhere else. Anyway, the lime is indigenous to the Philippines, and the gelee is served with the lychee sorbet and a delicious white chocolate soy milk soup. It's as delicious as it sounds. The mini boba in the soup were nice as well. -Melon float with blackberry, lime granita, vanilla ice cream, mint Refreshing and tasty. These flavors really melded to create a great summer drink/dish. I would totally pay good money for a large glass of this on a hot day. Puts Jamba Juice to shame. -Carrot cake with goat cheese ice cream I could have done without this course. The carrot cake was kind of dense, and I guess I don't really like goat cheese ice cream. Interesting..but ehh.. -Milk chocolate-whiskey panna cotta with bailey's ice cream and coconut raviolo This was a nice end to the meal. The panna cotta was smooth and creamy, and the Bailey's ice cream was nice with it. There was also chocolate cookie crumbles to add a nice crunch. -House-made chocolates In all, a really fine meal. I can't wait to come back.

This was my second visit here. The first time was a good (but budget-breaking) three-course dinner in 2009. This time, I came for the dessert tasting menu following visits to the bars at the Peninsula Hotel and Hatfields earlier in the evening. The desserts here aren't bold and heavy, but lean and taught. Again, it's not for the financially faint at $50 for a 6-course tasting and $85 with wine pairings. Yeah, that's over $200 for desserts for two. The tasting was a blur of plates with multi-component ingredients. Excuse the lack of details because I didn't take notes, don't have a great memory, and didn't steal a dessert menu. 1. The frozen yogurt with cucumber was like a salad starter course. This gave me an idea that they should create a dessert tasting that resembled dinner courses. So start with this cucumber dessert as the salad, follow with a soup that is something is a melon bath, then have a primi with a sugar nest as the pasta, a secondi of a Wellington with something en croute, and then finish with a conventional dessert. The first course had no wine pairing. 2. Opened with a Sauterne which begged for something salty. Instead, a bitter beet gelee with little sponges was served. It was the most attractive looking dish with the deep red colors, but it was also the least tasty. The frozen pomegranate seeds were the only fun part of the dish. 3. Led with a beer. That's right, a beer. I understand the pairing, but to have a beer between white wines is poor planning. The spiced cake and pumpkin puree was ideal for the holidays, but the soy milk ice cream wasn't worth eating. 4. Began with a fine reisling. The dish was a pavlova like with baked meringue chards and piles of different light creams. It was good, but I prefer the vacherin I had a week earlier at Patina. 5. Started with a 1998 Graham port that was too young and acidic. The dessert was basically a pile of piped heavy creams in different beige tones. The only thing that stood out was the puffed wild rice. 6. Not really a course, but three petit four to have with coffee and the check. Ultimately, the tasting is too much dessert and too much drink. The pavlova in itself was a full-sized dessert - not "two or three bites" as promised by the waiter. The four drinks were half-pours so it was comparable to two more glasses of wine. The service was good, but not for a 2-star Michelin restaurant. Beware of sitting on the enclosed patio. It looks like it's part of the dining room, but they have trouble keeping the temperature steady.

Finally decided to head here for dinner after reading/hearing all the great reviews.  Not sure if I over hyped the place or perhaps it was because we didn't order the tasting menu.  However, I left disappointed with the food and more so with the service from the sommelier.   We didn't opt for the tasting menu since I've seen mixed reviews about the kanpachi and really wasn't hungry enough to fit in 5 courses. We had a few appetizers to share and we each ordered our own entree. First bread was brought over and I opted to try both the nori and the bacon.  Both pieces of bread were awesome though I did like the nori with both butter and a little bit of salt (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  I was hoping to get another piece of bread but none was offered to our table, though I could hear the guy ask tables all around us if other patrons wanted more bread (strike 1 on service).  The bacon bread was also good as the flavor of the bacon was present with every bite (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Amuse bouche - parsnip soup and a little gryuere cheese puff (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  Both were tasty and I thought this was a start to an awesome meal.   Kumamoto oysters (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  This was served with 2 different types of sauces (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) instead of your typical cocktail sauce.  I believe they were a tomato water and horseradish and a vinaigrette of some sort.  The oysters were good but not as sweet as the ones we recently had at Bouchon.  I did enjoy the creativity of the sauces. Spaghetti alla chittara (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  Good but I would've liked the pasta a tad bit warmer.  You could taste the sweetness of the uni and saw a few pieces, but did not have any pieces of lobster on the plate.  Perhaps it was just lobster stock that was used for the sauce?? Grilled octopus (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  Served with little potato cubes and peas.  Wasn't memorable and doesn't even compare to Osteria Mozza's.  Woudn't recommend ordering this dish. Wild black sea bass (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  Overall a decent dish but there were bits that had a fishy taste.  I was a little puzzled as to why certain pices were fishy.  Was cooked well as it wasn't too dry. Wild striped bass (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  Probably the best dish of the night.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned well. Low on the hog (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  Pork belly wrapped in a skin and then deep fried.  In my opinion it was ok and could'nve used more of the whole grain mustard sauce as the fried pork belly was pretty bland without it. Desserts: Roasted apple (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  Decent but definitely wasn't blown away.  the serve this with a little scoop of apple ice cream.  If people love sour things...this is a defnite must try. The waiter recommended we try their banana bread pudding (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  Another average dessert and again was not overly impressed. Now onto the service ... Arrived, was warmly greeted and escorted to the table.  Originally we had made reservations for a party of 4  but one person had to cancel at the last minute.  The maitre d then asked if we had 4 an when we mentioned that we only had 3, he gasped and walked away.  WTF???  We opted to order a bottle of wine for out table and during the course of our dinner, the sommelier came by to refill our glasses which was cool.  It was during one of the stops when he asked me what I thought of the wine and I said that i was 'just so so' and is when I think he took offense.  It was shortly after that I decided to refill my glass and he hurried over and asked to pour it ... I obliged and let him do so.  Nearing the end of our meal, I wanted to finish the bottle of wine and proceeded to slowly pour out what remained of the bottle to avoid any sediments pouring into my glass.  He once again noticed this and again rushed over and quickly dumped the rest of the bottle into my glass.  Simply awesome ... exactly what I wanted to avoid.   Again 4 stars for the food but the service from the sommelier and the maitre d killed the dining experience.  Don't think I'll be back to try again in the future.

update: watch this video, it's After Hours with Daniel, featuring Providence:  http://www.hulu.com/watc… the first course served is the Mojito.  Beer foam also makes a cameo now back to the review: meeting people from the internet is scary, let alone eating with them.  we weren't sure what to expect from a Tony C. and company of 20+ people, especially when the meet time is 9pm and the website says the place closes at 9pm on Sunday.  But, the lure of a dessert tasting doesn't fit the M.O. of a 'cereal' killer so we decided to check it out and hope for a good time. i figure - go big or stay home if you're gonna eat at a Michelin 2 star-rated place like this...  C and I had gone to see the ballet and after dinner, the three of us came here for the 8-course dessert tasting menu.  J got the wine pairing and i took sips.   Thank goodness we had western bbq before coming to this.  Either rich people have small stomachs or we're just giants in a midget's world of desserts.  I kid but at the end of the night, i felt pretty full. My favorite was the Mojito, which was our first course http://www.yelp.com/biz_…   we were warned that this was a "closed mouth affair," which means take it all in one mouthful.  Once you pop the thin membrane, it's an unrecoverable wet mess.   Very delicate and tasty.  check out the leaf suspended in the blob! the kalamansi gelee came next and was the runner-up.  this filipino citrus, lychee sorbet and tapioca menage was also memorable. the last course, white chocolate crimson berry tea lollipop - another closed mouth affair, was interesting.  C popped it with her mouth open and crimson tea indeed spilled out, luckily onto the tablecloth. the other courses  in between were not as memorable except for the fact that they were really rich and nothing to pine for.  the wine pairing was mere expensive mouthwash for the next course.  they didn't really seem to pair with the respective dessert much. C, J, and I agreed that we would have loved to just pay $20 to have an ice cream tasting.  All the ice cream served that night were excellent and interesting.  then again, we could just go to Scoops and save some money. Please take a look at my pictures starting from this one and advance forward for the different courses and pairings so that i don't have to write about everything.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Chef Adrian Vasquez is one hell of a presentations guy and he did an excellent job.  Applause goes to Steve, our waiter.  Super friendly and attentive.  An extra Yelp star for that.  3 for the dessert + 1 for service = 4. and lastly, thanks to Tony C. for setting the event up.  From the emails he sent, this sounded like it was a stressful job putting it all together.  Maybe he should spend more time at home with the fiance? Overall, a very nice event at a very nice place.

We went here for a birthday celebration and did the full (9 course) tasting menu with wine pairing, as opposed to the five course market menu or the 14 course chef's menu. The ceramic barnacles on the wall were fascinating - I had to reach up and touch them. Everything else in the restaurant has such clean lines and textures that I was a little intimidated, thinking I was going to spend a fortune to make some huge table etiquette faux pas (like touching the barnacles), and the amuse buche didn't help. It was a bite of slow cooked trout in a sweet lemon tarragon sauce with a 1 oz beer mug filled with a sort of green pea soup topped with a creamy vichyssoise with a straw. Once I got over being embarrassed to pick up the tiny mug and drink through the half a coffee stirrer, I realized that it was delicious, and the barnacles and tiny utensils were supposed to be fun, not pretentious. We hit a slight snag in figuring out whether the sake we got afterward was supposed to be a palate cleanser for the amuse buche or just our wine pairing for the first course served early, so we took a chance and downed it. We chose wrong, but they gave us more - nice. The wine pairings really helped us enjoy the experience, even if we didn't know what half of them were aside from "that one is darker than that one", "that one makes my tongue tingle", "so THAT's a Rose", or "that's plummy saki". The next course few courses were seafood, starting with the kampachi wrapped in heart of palm with fresh ground wasabi sauce and radish diamonds - beautiful! By that point, my husband just asked - how would you recommend eating this? We are rubes and were about to pop it in our mouths like sushi, as that is what it looked like. Our waiter, who was fantastic throughout, showed us that he likes to spread it on his brioche, which is what we did. The lobster risotto helped me understand why people care at all about risotto. I loved that every dish had a sweet element to it, and in the risotto it was the peas, replete with beautiful, and tasty pea tendrils! There was also a celery leaf on top that made it somehow feel a little like downhome comfort food. The scallop and leek dish was excellent, but I don't quite remember what all was going on with it, except that the scallops are delivered to the restaurant alive. The striped seabass with lemon foam and roasted tomato was the biggest surprise of the night, because at first I thought it was a dud. Kind of bland. Then it started to work on me and I felt like I had fallen for a twist movie ending - ok, ya got me! The main course was a filet with balsamic drizzle, asparagus with braised endive (I've never had it cooked before), and a tomato compote. It was delicious, but I think it was my least favorite dish, if only because it had the most familiar tastes. The cheese course was the highlight, because fancy cheese is hellagood. One was a three cream cheese served on a spoon, a few were wrapped in cherry leaves, one had the fasinating consistency of a marshmallow, and they were served with nuts, an apple pepper jam, and a fruity bread. The pre-dessert was vanilla ice cream on mango with a citrusy foam. It tasted just like a creamsicle, but more complex. I didn't know if I would be into the dessert - a travesty as I am a dessert person - but it was just what I needed at that moment, and it had an Asian feel, served with a plum wine, which was a nice bookend to the Asian-leaning amuse buche. It was candied cucumbers with I think orange sherbet, tiny melon balls, and sweet lime sauce with a greek yogurt and honey gelatin. My husband got a candle on his plate for his birthday. I was convinced that the last bite was my limit, but I of course ate the tiny treats that came with the check - candied guava, meringue sandwich cookies, and spiced caramel (cloves, cinnamon, etc.). The table also had pretty, big circles of butter for the bread that was delivered throughout if desired, and it had a tiny pail of sea salt with a mini scooper. Sea salt sprinkled on buttered bread is the new bruschetta. Also, fried fish skin is the new pork rind. My new goal in life is to be rich enough to only eat at Providence, and I told our waiter so, but the compliment earned me no free food.

I love Providence.  Providence is probably one of 3 or 4 restaurants in LA that, 99 time out of 100, deserves a "sixth" star. Tonight, I had a reservation for 10pm, which happens to be their final seating of the evening.  I hadn't been in awhile, so I wanted to be sure my girlfriend and I could still do a tasting menu.  I was informed that we could not, but they could offer the five course if we came at 9:30.  Hey kids...to earn that sixth star, you've gotta be better than perfect, almost all the time...that's what Michelin and Relais and Beard and the rest of the gang expect. I called Melisse, was able to get a table at their last sitting, and the woman on the phone assured me in a calm, exquisitely professional voice, that "all menus are available at all times at Melisse". So...for one day, at least...Citrin 1, Cimarusti 0.  And, don't get me wrong...if I had a week to live, and could hire either chef to cook my last 7 dinners, I'd be OK with that.  But, really guys...

This restaurant proves what I consider a downside of Yelp. Eating here was a paradigm-shift for me.  Pretentious wording aside, I'm serious.  I have never liked scallops until this meal.  I'm not even that big on seafood in general, except for salmon and fish tacos.  But everything here was outstanding.  The food was fantastic, the service was impeccable, and I finally know what "perfectly cooked" means with regards to seafood, because everything here was exactly that.  But I can probably find 30 "5-star" seedy dive restaurants and taco stands with "amazing atmosphere" as rated by Yelp, and this place suffers at a 4.5 star rating. Absurd.  And I'm part of the problem.  I've rated taco stands and laundromats as five-star.  Yelp's highest honor.  Now, I'll grant you, I try to compare places to like establishments within their range and review accordingly, but let's be honest with ourselves, collectively, we make some questionable recommendations with uncommon gusto. So for my review of Providence, let me just relate the thought that popped into my head halfway through my dinner: "Man, I constantly eat just-adequately prepared food that I enjoy just-enough."  But my wife and I plan our budget around dining opportunities like this, and experiences like this one reinforce my belief that we are making the right choice.  We had the five-course tasting menu, and Emily decided to add an extra course of the foie gras ravioli (they will add any appetizer or main course into your tasting menu, and you can even add the wine pairing with it).  Most of the courses have been discussed in other reviews, so I will just say that the true highlights for me were the scallop and the foie gras ravioli.  The ravioli absolutely defined richness.  The veal tenderloin was also fantastic, the sous-vide preparation left it incredibly tender and a nice rare in the center.  The only part of the dinner I would call less than outstanding was the dessert, but having grown up eating sweet wild blackberries from the vine and homemade pie, I just don't enjoy them any other way, and this was certainly more tart than sweet.  But I also wouldn't even think about taking away a star from this restaurant for a single misstep on an otherwise transcendent meal. I'm a little confused by the reviews who found the place overstated, I found it to be more relaxed than several other far inferior restaurants that I have eaten at.  This seemed slightly more casual than some other fine dining experiences I've had, but in the nicest sense.  The staff was at all times friendly and attentive without a hint of stuffiness.  They were casual when describing the wine and food, and happy to answer questions, but an empty plate never sat around and my water glass never hit empty.  The decor is a little whimsical with the seafood theme, there are mock barnacles on the wall and the candles on the table have beaded "kelp" wires surrounding them.  Although I prefer to wear suits to places like this, from what I saw around me the dress code is not particularly strict, and I saw several people that were relatively underdressed for the occasion.  So it seems pretty laid back to me, but I probably wouldn't recommend showing up in a t-shirt. Basically, it's going to be hard to top this experience.  We'll probably try some of the other places in the area as opposed to rushing back, but I have recommended this to everyone I know as the perfect place for a special occasion.

It's nice to write reviews again.... Everything was good.  Service was really good I think it's because we were there early on a Sunday evening.  So I would bet it's not going to be the same if I go there when they're busy.  Since I didn't really know what to order and being a just lazy dumb person, I just ordered the dinner course with wine pairing.  I really liked how they explained everything about the wine.  That was a big plus for a stupid drinker like me because I'm a typical give me anything alcohol and I'll drink type of a guy... so got little bit of edumucation there.  Anyhow, food was good can't remember what they're all called... but the risotto I just can't forget.  Too bad my wife couldn't do the wine pairing because of the pregnancy... overall, pretty good experience except this one weird lady asking a buncha stupid questions.   Oh yeah... one final thing... when the dessert came out... on mine... there was a strand of what it looked like human hair.    HM.....  but ya know... it's okay.  I'm sure I've eaten a lot worse than that from other 5 star restaurants.  I was probably too drunk to catch 'em all.  We all make mistakes.

I had very high expectations for this place and they were absolutely met. From the service to the decor to the food, everything was wonderful. The night started out with wonderful service by our attentive but unobtrusive waiter. I really like the pacing of this restaurant as it makes for a leisurely meal but if you're in a hurry, this might not be the best fit for you. The place is very elegantly lit and designed so that it would be perfect for a corporate dinner or a romantic night out. The design allowed for normal conversation without feeling as if there was noise everywhere (I'm looking at you Mozza Osteria). My Darling and I started off the night with a Vieux Carre which was a cocktail with rye, cognac, and some other stuff...refined, strong, and very tasty. We both decided to choose the five course tasting because the full nine courses seemed a little too much food. Good thing we did because five was just perfect (if not a little filling). It started with an amuse bouche that consisted of a screwdriver drink in the shape of an egg yolk and a little frozen margarita. The main problem with finishing the review some time after writing the initial paragraphs is that you can't remember the various dishes and often, they have changed from the current menu so you can't remind yourself. Anywhoo, this place was well worth the cost...expensive, not over-priced. Just finishing this review makes me want to go back... This place accepts cards and has valet parking. There does seem to be street parking but not sure if it's all permit around there (so close to Hancock Park and all).

continuing my review which exceeding the word limit yesterday. i freaked out for a good half an hour trying to figure out how to continue until i realized i had to wait until the next day =P *EDIT* THANK YOU AUSTIN S.! i looked through his many long reviews to realize how to continue :) anyway, on to dessert. I got the Un Café à Bordeaux (coffee mousse, canelé ice cream, chicory caramel and hazelnuts) so the Pastry Chef Adrian Vasquez is a-ma-zing. he made this canele ice cream... and it freakin taste JUST like the pastry. wtf! the mousse was so airy and light and covered with espresso powder. it was strong but so perfect. the bf got the "Banana Cream Pie" (compressed bananas, graham cracker ice cream) its put in quotes on the dessert menu because its NOT banana cream pie, but it definately TASTES JUST LIKE IT. its amazing. i usually think banana cream pie is just too sweet for me but this was amazing. its deconstructed so eat everything together and close your eyes... its banana cream pie! then we recieved the Petit Fours (Olive Oil Gelee, Miso and Caramel, Chocolate Rolled in Crushed Nuts) these werent too memorable except the miso and caramel. you could actually taste the miso which was interesting but overall too sweet for me with the caramel. overall an awesome experience and fantastic food. i would love to go again to have their tasting menu :) *EDIT* with two appetizers (cold and hot), two entrees and two desserts the bill came out to $135 before tip.

Mmmm Providence...I had one of the best meals of my life here.  This would be THE restaurant to bring your hot date, parents, in laws, boss, or whoever you would want to impress.  Not only is the service outstanding here but the food is to die for.  It isn't located in a snooty neighborhood, no valet parking needed, no fancy interior decorations, none of that.  Just a classic, elegant and enjoyable restaurant with exceptionally good food.  Definitely try their tasting menu with wine pairing, and if you have any room left, try their cheeses.  You'll walk out of this place feeling completely satisfied.

To celebrate our 2 years of wedded bliss, the hubs and I went to Providence... yay!!!   This restaurant is gorgeous. The architecture both inside and out is a refreshing change from other restaurants in LA. The walls are adorned with what looks like anemones that make it very ocean-esque, as do the coral-inspired votives on each table. Service started off pretty rocky but improved as the meal progressed. We got a few amuses which were a fun way to start our anniversary celebration: First was a molecular gastronomy take on a mojito and a greyhound.  The jelly-like translucent cube was like a fresh minty-lime gummy bear.  The 'greyhound' looked like a pink colored, coagulated egg yolk.  It had a delicate clear film on the outside which when eaten, burst in my mouth filling it with grapefruit tasting liquid.  I know it sounds gross, and probably kind of sexual. Very cool nonetheless. Second was a 'lollipop' of chorizo and squid.  I pretty much love all foods on sticks. This one was no exception. We were also given a chilled shot glass filled with delicious sashimi, with a savory and tasty gougere alongside. Then, the 5 course tasting began. My favorite dish of the night was the foie-gras filled ravioli which is beyond words.  Not even descriptive swear words would begin to express how good this was. Our first course, was the kanpachi and it was served with crispy rice crackers and a very subtle soy crème fraîche. I really liked that. The "chowda" was poured table side and more milk-based, so it was not as thick and creamy, but it was packed full of clams and a lot of bacony goodness. It went perfectly with the bacon brioche.  Yes, you read that right.  Bacon Brioche! We had halibut for the fish course and it was a disappointment. I thought it would be a bit more exciting and impressive, being that Chef Michael Cimarusti is known for his seafood. The veal was good, not great. For dessert, I was a little wary of how barley ice cream would taste, but it was fantastic!  It was sitting pretty on bed of Smacks, for lack of a better word (yep, like the cereal), and plated alongside banana bread pudding (also fantastic) and a sous-vide banana.  It was playful and super delicious. Finally, there were petit fours. The mascarpone macarons definitely won my taste buds over. They were perfect in every way! I'm stoked we were finally able to come in and celebrate our special day at one of LA's finest.

im not going to talk about the food. it's great. get the tasting menu. while you wait for your table, go to the bar, order the asian pear martini. wow, this is a tasty drink. not too strong (or maybe i couldnt taste it - actually, add this drink with a bottle of wine throughout dinner and...let the baby making music begin). fresh bits of pear. very clean and crisp. great pre-dinner cocktail! drink it while it's cold. once the ice melts, the flavors lose its brightness.

Fantastic experience! My boyfriend took my family out for our Birthday dinner and it was a blast. Not only was the service stellar, the food was SO yummy. The bacon muffin was the best from the bread bunches that they offer you, feel free to take more than one, its delicious. Then they gave us these funky shot glasses as a pre-appetizier and that was pretty good as well. The appetizers that we ordered were the scallops served raw which was okay but was really small portions and the spanish octopus that just melted in your mouth. I ordered my striped black bass and every bite was just orgasmic. Bf ordered his white fish and that melted in your mouth - we were both too busy devouring our dishes that we even forgot to share. The most baller of us all, my mother, ordered the lobster and the french curry it was served with even made her [one who only likes chinese food] impressed. My sister got the filet mignon and it was yummy too if you like red meat. After that, we ended up with three desserts each dedicated to our birthdays, it was the sweetest thing ever, thanks honey. And they even gave us complimentary little pastries which was good, I think, but I couldn't eat anymore because I was too stuffed. But yes, to summarize, go to this restaurant :) Thats all.

I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday and we had such a fantastic time. We ordered the Chef's tasting menu and we did not know it was a 14 course meal. When we hit the 7th course, my boyfriend said there can't be more coming out but we found out he was wrong. We were glad we didn't plan anything after dinner because the dinner took about 3 1/2 hours. I loved every course and it was perfection. However, I did not care for the nori (seaweed) focaccia. I thought it was a little too salty. I would go back again after saving all my money. Although dinner was a little pricey, I think it was well worth it. The interior was beautiful. I loved the decorations and it was minimal and modern. You should take your significant other there.

Hands down, the best place to get tasty food in LA! I am known to comment few things even if the food is great but this place, I had nothing bad to say about it. Each dish was obviously prepared with care  - right temperature, right mixture of the food, fresh ingredients, and great display. Highly recommend the Chef's special. We planned to spend about 2 hr and 1/2 there and was not able to finish the whole course (had to run for the Wicked show). So I recommend to schedule enough time for you to enjoy the whole course.  Love it!

First off - anyone who complains about Providence being "pricey" should have his/her head examined and/or travel to London, Paris, New York or Tokyo and try to purchase the same meal there for the comparative PITTANCE we are fortunate to pay at Providence. Now that this little issue has been settled - Providence is an unbelievable restaurant in terms of cuisine. Clearly, the food is 3-star Guide Michelin, although I understand why the restaurant is not awarded a third star; it's not formal enough in terms of interior design/venue or service. But let's face it - it's better than Le Bernardin in New York, better than Prunier in Paris - in fact, I have NEVER had such consistently superb seafood anywhere, and that does include Louis XV in Monaco and similar restaurants in Europe. Cimarusti is a genius, pure and simple. Go and have the tasting menu, which includes small bites of textural and gustatory perfection. No farmed fish in sight; most of the vegetables are organic; there will be seafood I can guarantee that you've never eaten or seen unless you are some kind of ichtyologist, and yes, they will substitute one item on the tasting menu [in my case it was an unforgettable piece of rouget instead of veal tenderloin, as I don't eat meat.] Drew Langley, the sommelier, has the best palate of any wine expert in Los Angeles. Remember that Providence is located in the old space of Patina and that Chris Meeske was the sommelier there? Well, Chris went on to open Mission Wines in Pasadena, and he is the only sommelier ever to hold a candle to Drew. But while Chris was all about the big first growths [maybe a sign of the times back then], Drew is all about finding Italian, Spanish or even Swiss gems for very little money. So you could do equally well with the wine pairings OR you could ask Drew to find that one perfect bottle and stick with it throughout the meal. The rest of the waitstaff is equally wonderful - low key, very professional and yet warm - you don't get that in a 3-star Guide restaurant, as they often maintain some formal distance. And that brings me back to where I started: Michael Cimarusti is a genius and eating at Providence is a sublime experience if you love modern seafood cuisine. Sorry Eric Ripert, Michael wins every time. What joy for us Angelenos to have such a treasure all to ourselves.

We parked on the street next to the restaurant. The decor is tasteful. Some of the seating is very close together but we didn't have anyone seated next to us until the end of our meal - however, you can hear every bit of the neighbors' convo whether you wanted to or not :). I saw people dressed up in jackets/ties and I also saw people in t-shirts and jeans. The staff/service was great. Some of the staff members were very warm/friendly and others seemed a tad uppity/reserved but the service was great throughout and everyone was knowledgeable. Our meal was about $450 including tax + tip. My hubs got the full tasting w/wine pairing and I got the full tasting w/a $15 cocktail (I think it was called the arsenal). Even though I came in expecting a lot considering the reviews and such, I still tried not to think too much of all that and just wanted to enjoy a fine dining experience. Have I had meals that cost $50 that I've enjoyed just as much? Probably, but in a different way, and I still loved the meal. The dishes were artistic, perfectly prepared, and just downright tasty. I won't go into details about the meal bc that would take soooo long, but my faves were the japanese kanpachi, santa barbara sea urchin, wild alaskan halibut, and the dessert. Maybe I'm weird that I love food so much but am not that much into wine, but my hubs really enjoyed the wine pairings. I really enjoyed my cocktail too. Overall it was a great experience.

Wow. This place is ridiculous good, and ridiculous expensive. You've GOT to go with the tasting or chef's menu.  Call me easy, but you had me at amuse bouche.  My wife and I went for my birthday, and our 9 course tasting menu took over 3 hours.  A veritable beatdown of food.  I don't even remember all the courses, but they were all amazing (I vaguely remember some sort of sashimi tartar, salmon, beef, ravioli, cheese plate...).  I was stuffed by the end of the night -- one of the best meals I've ever had.

Dear god, thank you for giving me Providence. I can now die happy... My meal today was so freaking delicious. I am literally out of words. For my parents anniversary dinner, we decided to go to Providence for their 5 course menu (anniversary special for only $70 pp). In addition, we ordered a foie gras terrine from the market specials. To start off the night, they gave us 2 amuse bouches: a mint mojito ice and egg yolk with some kind of alcohol in it. We then got a trio of small bites including a white jumbo prawn, pastry puff with smoked salmon and creme fraiche, and a chilled carrot puree soup with passion fruit flavoring. In between the amuse bouches and the courses, we were served different kinds of bread which were delicious as well (i personally loved the bacon bread because well..... it had bacon in it!!!). To begin our five courses, we got the kanpachi sashimi dressed with shiso, cucumber, enoki mushrooms, and tapioca. They were really generous with the sashimi (around 4-5 large pieces) and overall, the pairing of the fish with the sauces were great. We then got the foie gras terrine (not part of the 5 course meal). Our server personally came out and cut a huge slice of foie gras for the 3 of us. We each got a brioche and the foie gras was paired with a wine jelly. Being a huge fan of foie gras, I purposely chose this dish even though it wasnt in our price fixe menu (extra $29)... and I must say, this was my best decision this week!! Boy, the foie gras was great.... everything you could ask for from foie gras. Moving on..... we then got the jumbo seared scallops, which came with beets and crushed cashews. This was my dad's favorite dish of the night. Then we got the halibut.... mm so good... but not too special. Next came the veal.... and OH MY GOODNESS, this was amazing. I am a carnivore so I especially enjoy some good red meat, especially when it is medium rare. This veal was cooked perfectly and had good flavors. The veal came with braised daikon radish, which was great. My mom loved the daikon the most. So good..... Lastly, we got dessert, which was chocolate mouse, ice cream, coco puffs!!!!!, some more chocolate, and raspberry ganache. The ice cream had hints of black pepper, which was weird by itself, but delicious with the chocolate. To top off the course, we ordered coffee with brown sugar and cream. They gave us blackberry macaroons, salty caramels, and strawberry marshmellows. Overall.. a very delicious (but pricey) meal. Our total came out to be in the mid 300's.... so worth it. As an 18 yr old college student, I would have never imagined to eat at a 2 michelin star restaurant. But seriously.. thank god for this anniversary menu and for parents. :) I was extremely pleased with this menu and with this restaurant. Definitely coming back next year for their next anniversary!!!

Very much worthy of the former Michlin rating, I've read a lot of the negative reviews on here and it just confirms that so many people simply cannot be pleased, have poor palates, or are just looking for attention by saying negative things. I have no negative comments whatsoever to make. Our party had the full 14-16 course chef's menu, it is the only way to go when dining at an establishment of this quality. Every course was delightful, perfectly made, perfectly served, and bursting with flavor.

Providence was named the 2006 Best Seafood Restaurant by Los Angeles Magazine.  I went for New Year's Eve and they had a phenomenal 9- course dinner menu.  Each dish featured a variety of different flavors ranging from foie gras with a cherry mouse to ahi tuna tartar with a crisp cracker and port wine reduction sauce. The service was friendly and attentive. This restaurant was expensive, but worth it. A must for foodies everywhere.

Started off the night at their bar, with a very knowledgeable bartender who gave us some excellent fine oak single malt whiskey.  Then moved on to one of the best dining experiences you can have anywhere in the world with their $160 15-course chef's menu.  Everything that came out was prepared to perfection.  Personal highlights included the screwdriver jello amuse bouche, skewer of seared citrus albalone, Santa Barbara spotted prawn, black bass with raw matsutake mushrooms, unagi on grilled foie gras, pork belly, and the grilled salmon slices.  The cheese cart was also excellent, esp the creamy buffalo cheese with their bacon bread.  Super attentive/friendly staff.  Overall a magical experience!

There was a bacon bread roll of some sort which was oh so delicious.  The sous vide course melted in our mouths.  The cheeses at the end of the meal were def funky just the way great cheese should be!

Is sushi starting to leave you cold? Leave the raw fish for Shamu and head to famed chef Michael Cimarusti's restaurant, Providence. The modern American menu highlights fresh, simply cooked seafood with Japanese and French infusions.  While you may not know what everything on the menu is--kampachi and soy-jalapeno jelee?--trust that everything's delicious and an instant gastronomic delight. You'll also find standards like New England clam "chowda," roasted monkfish with ginger and lemongrass, and spectacular spiny lobster on the constantly changing menu. Just be sure to save room for desserts such as mango ravioli and white peach honey parfait.

One of my favorite restaurants. Came here for my husbands Birthday and service was exceptional. Normally don't eat too much meat, but ordered the Duck to try it - and LOVED it. Best thing was the starters (amoosh boosh) and the veggies even tasted unique and delicious. Bread was warm and fresh and seemed like the people there really cared about your meal. Would go back again and try other dishes.

Having done the smaller tastings, we decided on a full blown 10 course 4 hr tasting menu.  Came in at 7pm left at 1230 am first one in and last one out.  We ate so much food, finished a white and a red burgundy and had the chef de cuisine Yu Min Lin come out to see who was devouring all this food!  Foie Gras ravioli was rich over the top decent.  The Lamb sous-vide was very juicy tender and flavorful.  The vacuum really does keep all the natural juices from escaping making other worldly cut of meat. Lots to say about this restaurant.  Presentation is very avant garde however flavors are down right delicious.

I came here for the 9 course tasting. Arrived at 8:15, full party was there by 8:30, we had some drinks at the bar and were seated at 8:50pm. Our party was of 6 and we had an oval shaped table, very quaint. There was no music when we first sat, but I do remember music being played later on, I might have been hallucinating. It took a little time for the waiter to take our order and for the food to come. Our amuse bouche - gin and tonic, margarita, and a shot glass of salmon ceviche with creme fraiche and a gold leaf. Gin and tonic was clean and great. I really enjoyed it and it was a great cleanser. The margarita was a tad salty because of the salt on the spoon, but I didn't mind it; I did mind the after taste. I'd give it 3 of 5 stars. The salmon ceviche was delicious, light, clean with a creamy enough finish that put a nice feeling in my mouth. There were a crunch texture to the dish because of some little balls, but I'm not sure what it was. First course was the kampachi sashimi with crunchy crisps and soy creme fraiche. I was disappointed because I could definitely taste the fish, but I couldn't taste much of anything else. And after finishing the amuse bouche with a creamy note, I was searching for a little tart or tang. A squeeze of lemon would have been nice. Second course was sea urchin in an egg shell, brioche on the bottom and beure. It was creamy and tasty, the textures were great, it was a pleasant addition to the start of the meal. Third course was sea scallops - not a memorable course. The scallops were cooked well, but the flavorings were not good. I would not order this again. Fourth course was sea bass and I don't even remember anything about it. The sides were not great. I didn't hate it, but it wasn't what I was expecting out of this establishment. Fifth course was arctic char. I don't know what else to say, the fish was good, and i ate half of my girlfriend's portion, but again, lack of explosive character with the food, lack of wow factor, lack of flavor. Sixth course was my favorite, the veal. The flavor was so savory, the meat was so tender, so moist, and the morels...oh the morels. I closed my eyes on this dish and the pinot noir was on point. I didn't taste much game-y flavors as I thought I would and did I mention the morels? This was by far the best dish of the night and I would come back just to order this. Seventh course was the cheese course - I love cheese, I really do. I have it 4-5 times a night, but at this point, I was full and intoxicated and really tired (around 11pm). We got some black truffle cheese, bleu cheese, and this one cheese that they took out of a case from the second shelf of the cart because it was so foul. I kid you not, I thought they pureed a certain "substance", strained it through a sock, and then fermented it for 365 days and served it to us. I tried it, but I needed a glass of wine. The accompaniments were fantastic: dried figs, apricot chutney, walnuts, they were great. If I wasn't so full and exhausted, I would have enjoyed this more. Eighth course was the blood orange sorbet with tarragon creme. blood orange sorbet was great, refreshing after the cheese and wasn't overly sweet. I did not taste much of the tarragon, but my senses were shot. I enjoyed this dish Ninth course was the yuzu curd with vanilla white chocolate sorbet, mint meringues, pinapples, shortbread crumbs and a mint sauce in the middle. the presentation was great. Flavors, spot on; tangy, sweet, savory. Textures were spot on; crunch, smooth, brittle, juicy. This dessert is worthy of my monies. At the end, they brought out some candies and cookies. I ate 2 of the cookies and a caramel. That was just the food. Let's move on to the service. I didn't know it was possible, but they gave amazing attentive service without the "nose in the air" feel. I felt like they really wanted us to have a great experience. Our party was relatively young, having an average age of 26, so I felt like they might have not given us as much attention, but they were very warm. They took car of our ladies and made sure we got everything we needed. Their manner was delicate and non-intrusive. I loved the service. For our group, we did the tasting so they had a very efficient way of service: one member would lay out the flatware, 2 men would come and distribute the dish, and the 4th man would stay and wait til everyone was served. Then he would describe the dish in detail. He did go a little fast, and it would have definitely helped to have a card or a paper that would have the description down so we could read it to ourselves, but that was a minor issue. They would go through that rotation the whole night and it was really pleasant and efficient. The sommelier was sweet and gentle, she tried her best to describe the wine even though we had brought it. I would come again, but not for a course tasting, maybe a la carte. The experience was spectacular, but I don't want to ruin it with a second try.

Most of the dishes deserve more than 5 stars and a few deserve 3-4 stars hence the 5 star review. Between the 2 of us we ordered the 5 course tasting with an order of santa barbara's finest and the foie gras ravioli and one wine pairing to share. Santa Barbara's finest - raw uni and raw spot prawn on a soy milk panna cotta with caviar and 24 karat gold flakes. This dish almost made me cry it was so delicious and beautiful. It looked like an uni garden with gold flake flowers hanging off spot prawn tentacle plants! Very trippy!! I wasn't a big fan of the veal (huge portion!!) or the dessert ( too sweet). Could've done without those two courses as we were stuffed !! The wine pairings were very fun and created an activity between courses. I got home and ordered a few bottles of a chardonnay bourgogne they served with the scallop dish. It was too good!! All in all, it was very memorable and was a blast!!!

We'd been hearing about this place from our foodie friends for quite some time and decided to finally splurge on a fancy Christmas dinner --- and it was sheer five-star gluttony --- PERFECTION is the only way to describe the experience!   My boyfriend and I had the 9-course tasting menu with wine pairings. We also had very stiff martinis in advance of our meal... WOWEEE we got drunk.  We were promptly seated in a tiny gorgeous shell-encrusted dining room and within minutes, the food started rolling in... first we cleansed our palettes with a Gin & Tonic amuse bush...  absurd and I loved it. Then came the courses... Tuna Tartare, followed by an ORGASMIC Maine Lobster dish, followed by PERFECT fat juicy seared Scallops, followed by a buttery light Halibut, followed by a tender velvety Salmon, followed by mouthwatering Veal. Then came the very very decadent cheese cart... I could have died right then and there... cheeses I've never even heard of. The wine pairings with all of the above were VERY GENEROUS and perfectly paired... smooth, subtle and dreamy are the words I would use to describe the wine selctions.  For dessert we were served Braised Pear with frangipane and miso ice cream... oddly scrumptious with a hint of spice. The muscat was a beautiful way to end this surreal blurry food orgy. We were there for almost 3.5 hours and dropped around $425. I would do it again in a heartbeat but I wanna check out Bastide and Sona next.

I had their 5 course tasting menu and it was delicious till we got to the dessert.  I wasn't impressed with their plating of caramel popcorn drizzled in different flavored syrups.  REALLY disappointing.   Obviously, since it was only their tasting menu, the portion-size was SMALL but that's what I was expecting.  They also make their own macaroons which they serve to you at the end of your meal.  Their seafood courses are WONDERFUL.  If you can drop the dough, it's definitely a place worth going to.  Fine-dining at its best.  The restaurant has a Beautiful interior.  Would recommend the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing, or order an entree if you have a heartier appetite.   Great restaurant for a special occasion-especially if you're looking for a place to take that "special someone."

Go for the tasting menu (a steal at $125 for 9 courses) and return for a la carte.  My husband and his two buddies were dubious about the small quantities on the plates - they wanted to get their hands around a dish - but ended up loving every dish and were definitely satisfied.  Michael Cimarusti, the chef, came out and said hello (I acted like a groupie).  The service was unparalled - completely professional yet friendly and not an ounce of pretention.  Design is modern/coastal and the bathroom is intriguingly voyeuristic/exhibitionistic w/ its frosted glass door.   2nd time we went I ordered the squid with pig's ears - had to - wouldn't recommend but everything else was awesome.

I don't have a bad thing to say about this restaurant...it's truly 5 star, but before you go, be sure it's what you're in the mood for... We went on a Friday night just to get out of the house and have a nice dinner, not realizing that we were signing up for the full "dining experience"... It was about as "formal" as LA restaurants get... multiple waiters whisking away plates and catering to your every whim... There were three couples celebrating anniversaries in the dining room... it's really an "event" more than a casual dinner... My take: outstanding restaurant but best enjoyed on a special occasion or a corporate expense account!!

I took my mom here for her birthday last night. It was the 4 of us, and I ordered 5 course meal for everyone since the reviews were great, however it was my 1st time there, and I felt adventurous yet reserved. I must agree with the reviews that the service was great, presentation wonderful, and the food was delicious. I don't know why, but all the dishes seem to have abit of japanese flair to the seafood dishes (portion, and the sauces). My favorite was the scallop, the dessert gelee and something to enjoy per server where the soup was to die for! Overall, it brought smile to my mother's face, and she is pretty picky with restaurants, and first impression is a big deal for her, however she is coming back soon with her friends because obviously she liked it! I personally would come back to try other items on the menu! ***Added perk was the no corkage fee on Monday Nights!***

i couldn't possibly say that this was my favorite restaurant in los angeles because i have only been here once and the meal was *so* out of the ordinary that it was too unusual to possibly have a realistic review of this place but GOOD LORD, it was amazing.  it was spectacular.  it was heaven.  it was a four hour dining experience that i will never forget. ok.  so, this is the fanciest, the most indulgent meal i have ever, EVER eaten.  it was a nine course, wine paired tasting menu.  that's right.  nine courses.  all paired with wine.  plus there were all these extras that came between the nine courses so technically, it was more.  i couldn't come close to finishing the wine that we were given. and i can drink.  the food wsa just spectacular.  i purposely did not ask what anything was because i'm a pretty picky eater so i didn't want to know what it all was.  i just wanted to just eat and enjoy.  and i did.  i'm sure i tried things i never would have otherwise and i'm so glad i did because every single course was just delicious.  and all of the wines were amazing.  i tried so many different types of wine that i'm still buying today because i tried them during this dinner.   the service was great, too.  and not just b/c i was there for this extravegant meal but i'm sure that was part of it.  but, before the dinner, i sat at the bar, which was a great place for a drink, and three different people (the bar tender, a manager, and a third person on staff) all came over and were attentive and tried to help me pick out drinks and were just very helpful and nice.  the wait staff and somalier were all really well informed and helpful, also.  the service was just top notch all around.   the setting was very nice.  i sat in an indoor/outdoor area.  it was dim and romantic and minimal and it all came together really nicely to be a cozy and unintrusive setting that really let the meal take center stage.   parking - there's valet but there's also lots of street parking on the cross street that it's on.   i would say my evening at providence was one of the best dining experiences of my life.  everything about the meal and setting and restaurant was absolute perfection.  while it was an out of the ordinary dining experience, i wouldn't hesitate to return for a "normal" meal here as i'm sure it would be fantastic!

this place must get tired.  tired of being AWESOME! there's a reason this restaurant is ranked in the top 50 restaurants of america.  i just ate here this past weekend with Pillbug and did the 12 course meal.  service was excellent.  food came out quick.  people were friendly and eager to help.  atmosphere was nice.  very romantic if you're trying to woo the special someone. the food itself was great.  flavor was great.  not too strong but not too light either.  the only downside was the cheese plate.  flavor was like a sock in the face by a fist of cheese but i didnt do the wine pairing so that might have been why.  overall it was great and well worth the money.

providence was offering special prices for their tasting menus to celebrate their 3rd anniversary a couple weeks ago. it was the bf's birthday, so we went for their full tasting menu which consisted of 9 courses. i love this place. the interior design is modest but refined, and the service has always been excellent. the whole meal was well orchestrated with the preparation of the silverware and prompt removal of courses staggered in timely succession. i wouldn't suggest dining here if you're in a hurry. it's all about savoring. compared to other high-end restaurants, the prices are reasonable, and what makes this place great is the food is consistently good. on this visit, we started with fancy cocktails. mine--the ruby slipper--was concocted from herradura silver, lychee liquer and grapefruit and lime juices. amuse bouche: i look forward to seeing what special surprise and inspired delicacy the chef starts our meal with. ours consisted of three small pieces. the first, a creamy fennel soup and saffron oil fused hot & cold. the second was a small, white cube--a gin & tonic gelee--lightly dusted with sugar which fizzed when i squeezed lime juice on it. the last and most unusual was a mojito ravioli, translucent skin filled with mojito liquid and a small sprig of mint. japanese kanpachi: i've had hints of the components of this dish at various japanese restaurants, but the combinations of flavors here was amazing and delightful. the fish was fresh, perfectly moist and delicious. the cucumbers were slightly salty and light. the flavored ice was an interesting juxtaposition of temperature with the tangy sweetness and salty, concentrated plum dabbed across the plate. this was one of my favorites of the evening. bobby's block island sea scallops: i love scallops & this one was  perfectly seared and accented with a sweet glaze from a sherry reduction. combined with smoky, roasted asparagus and tasty shiitakes, it was another favorite. the almonds added a crunchy texture, while the almond milk added a bit of delicious fat. point judith calamari: the calamari was the best i have ever tasted. it was so perfectly tender and slightly crunchy. not at all chewy. served in two different preparations, some tendrils were coated and fried while others sat naked and tender like freshly cooked noodles. there was a zing to the tomato-based marinara-like sauce. simple and oh so good. lobster risotto: instead of the veal, we requested all seafood and were not disappointed. the chef was very accommodating to substitute a lobster risotto. little slivers of meyer lemon added not only zest but a nice texture to the creamy risotto. a bit of lobster foam sat atop, while a reduced balsamic vinegar rounded out the dish. wild day-boat halibut (nova scotia): the tangy sauce that glazed this white fish was a nice contrast & complement to the herbaceous squash puree. meyer lemon slivers and delicate chive blossoms accented the fish. wild king salmon: by the time we made it to this course, i was beginning to get full. it came with shimeji mushrooms, crunchy radish and cinnamon espuma, which reminded me of cappuccino foam. as a whole, the dish was reminiscent of the icelandic char we had on a previous visit. tasty, but not a favorite. i really liked what they did with the crispy, curled skin, where the flavor of the fish was concentrated. market cheeses: we were filling up fast when the cheese steward brought out his cart, prompting us both to drool over the feast of dairy before us. he asked what we liked. i'm more of a hard cheeser, while mike likes the soft. our cheese guy picked out a goat cheese from spain (gurocha?), a sallie jackson cow's milk with walnut leaves and a sheep's milk nutty basque. predictably, i initially liked the basque best, but the sallie jackson grew on me. with the cheese, we also had dried figs, candied walnuts, apple compote, black olive preserve, & small slices of some dense bread with nuts. persian cucmber, orange flower water, mint: a perfect follow up to the entrees, it was a light, refreshing, cool and fragrant way to cleanse the palate. blackberries & corn tortilla: they are creative with the desserts. imagine pairing corn tortilla flavors with ice cream. though i would not seek it out, i really enjoyed the concept and the experience, and was amazed by how well the flavor was incorporated into the ice cream. and how curious were the bits of jalapeno that added zing? petits fours: chocolate hazelnut truffles, five spice caramel, olive oil gelee -- yum! the olive oil gelee left this nice coat of oil on the inside of my mouth that was comforting. we partook of a work of art. some of it was heady. some of it was pure visceral pleasure. i highly recommend one of the tasting menus to truly experience the depth and breadth of the food.

I came here with my boyfriend in 2008 and have never really forgotten the experience... neither, for that matter, has my bank account ever fully forgiven me. We had the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings and an extra dessert each (because really... who can have just 1 dessert after a meal like that). To be honest, this meal was probably the highlight of that relationship and I have nothing but rave reviews for the restaurant. One of the things I remember most fondly was the "ravioli". I have no idea how they made it but it certainly amused my bouche. Something about that initial texture and then BAM! It explodes in your mouth and like Vesuvius, it leaves a lasting impression. Though the rest of the meal was flawless and everything I ate was phenomenal... I couldn't help longing for just one more go at that ravioli. All in all I dropped $450 for 2 people (it was his birthday and way beyond his means so my special treat) and I have ZERO regrets about the experience. 2 years later and my parents still don't know about this extravagant meal or about the subsequent 3 weeks I spent eating canned corn and tuna... Accordingly, I have one suggestion: wait until after college before dropping a months worth of scholarship in one go but either way, drop it at Providence

Providence is a pretty nice spot on a Melrose corner. I live about walking distance from the location and so I had to try it out. I didn't even know it was a two star Michelin rated restaurant. In my honest opinion, although the food is pretty good, it does not deserve to be two Michelin stars (maybe one Michelin star)... I've been here twice and I can say that each dining experience has been good but not fantastic. Based on the price, it's so-so hence the three stars. I think Aqua up in the bay area is much much better. Service is good as you expect but there's just something about the food here that really isn't in par with any seafood specialt restaurant or any of Michael Mina's restaurants..

Ambiance/Service: You certainly can not judge a book by its cover.  Providence is situated in a seemingly sketch neighborhood but as soon as you enter, the restaurant is beautiful.  We were greeted by one of many hosts and immediately given cocktail menus upon sitting in the waiting lounge.  My gf and I both ordered cocktails that were delicious and strong.  The decor was beautiful and the setting was perfect for a romantic night out with the significant other.  The service was excellent.  Our server went above and beyond while waiting on us and made sure that we were enjoying our dinner at every juncture.  He made informed and knowledgeable suggestions and was always polite and accommodating.  We were brought several complimentary courses and at the conclusion of our meal, he even wrapped some desserts for my gf because she mentioned that she liked them (for free!).  The service was out of this world.  It is rare that I feel that a server has literally earned every cent of his/her tip.  I usually always tip out of principle anyway but this service was so good I was pleased to handsomely compensate the service.  Really, really excellent service. Food: The review just gets better from this point.  We had several cocktails with our meal, all of which were delicious.  For a starter we chose to share the freshly made fois gras and truffle ravioli.  I have to say I have not stopped thinking about this ravioli since I had it.  It was possibly the single best tasting morsel of food I have eaten.  If you go, you must order this, you will not regret it.  I could taste the freshness of the pasta and could taste that it was made literally minutes before it was in my mouth.  The server then brought us a complimentary dish that consisted of a mojito jelly and an artificial egg yolk that was actually a screwdriver inside.  Presentation was phenomenal and the mojito jelly was actually a mojito as was the screwdriver egg yolk.  I have never seen anything like it.  As an entree I had the John Dory.  The fish was cooked perfectly and was accompanied by a nice bed of greens and vegetables.  The seasoning was spot on and absolutely delicious.   The portion was also nice and certainly satisfying.  My gf chose the sea bass, which I found to be slightly salty but good.  She enjoyed it very much.  It too came with a nice mix of greens and vegetables.  The sauce was much richer and more flavorful but quite assertive.  I would recommend this dish for those who like bold flavors, whereas the John Dory is more conducive to a palate that enjoys subtle and refined tastes.  This was followed by our dessert which was a deconstructed banana bread pudding.  This was also delicious, the nuts that come with it are crunchy and delicious and really serve to enhance the flavors of the dessert.  This was followed by another complimentary dessert comprised of 3 miniature bites.  1 was a chocolate sandwich which was delicious and the other two I really did not care for.  The food overall is excellent and deserves the highest praise.  The flavors are well balanced, food is well seasoned and everything tasted great! Wrap-Up: Everything about Providence is excellent, the ambiance, the service, and the food are all top notch.  The price is expensive but well worth it.  Few restaurants merit such a price tag but Providence has the goods.  If this seems out of your price range, stop getting that coffee every morning and save up and go!  You won't regret it.  That fois gras ravioli haunts my dreams, in a good way of course.  Mmmm...I need to go eat.

The five course preset menu I'll admit is delicious.  I would not recommend getting the full course tasting menu unless you are a wine drinker.  That menu choice includes courses that go well with wine such as cheese etc.  My g/f and I stuck to the 5 course menu because we don't enjoy wines or cheeses.   The food is good, however the service here sucks.  The host John( Forgot his last name) is the most rude snooty man I've ever met.  We had issues with our reservations.  First off, I called in to serve 2 people at 8pm.  When we arrived I was accused of reserving 8 guest at 8pm.  Obviously, this was his error and not mine.  8 guests could have been mistakenly jotted down for 8pm.  Even if it was my mistake, whatever happened to the good ol saying "customer is always right"?    Anyways, I felt very unwelcomed and received improper treatment.  Dinner was great but what ruined the whole experience was that I received an email shortly after from John stating this "I would appreciate it if next time you could let us know that you are changing your reservations from 8 guests to 2 guests."  What the heck!  What nerve this guy has!

I went to Providence 3 years ago, and remember it being a great restaurant. I loved the food then. That's why for our first anniversary, Providence was a clear choice. Seeing great reviews on Yelp gave me assurance that the place is still as good as I remember it to be. We got the 9 course tasting menu: 4 dishes were excellent, 3 good, and 2 not good. I understand that the tasting menu's serving size is usually small, but ones that I had at other restaurants often include one dish with a slightly bigger serving. My husband got a good size piece of meat, but since I don't eat meat, they brought me fish instead. The piece was very small!! The dish before last was a cheese plate, which I thought was a waste of a serving. Yes, we ate LOTS of bread while waiting for our dishes to come out. The sourdough was good, but the other kind (forgot what it was) was very oily. I think if it weren't for the bread, we wouldn't have felt as full as we did, esperically that we spent 3 hours there. The main area was VERY loud. If you happen to go on a night when there's a big group, then expect the place to be noisy. There was a group of 10 in the middle of the room, and they were very loud. One person was laughing so loud the entire restaurant could hear him. Also, one waiter was loud. And one smelled like cigarette smoke (like he smoked one just before coming to our table). It seems that the room does not absorb noise well. We sat very close to another couple and we could hear their entire conversation. For $350 for two (no alcohol!), I really don't think it was all the special.

Providence on Melrose just E of Highland is an experience (the act of directly perceiving events or reality with all the senses). You'll be greeted by a host who seems to know what the word means.  Be careful not to enjoy the generous, unique bar fare too much, for the evening's true feature is in the adjacent room - a modern, simply ornamented room (though I found wall reflections distracting).  Comfortably padded, open back chairs - a good thing because you will sit awhile: not for lack of service but for the pleasure of it.  Linen on the tables that is crisp and utensils that feel right in your paw.  Light: you can actually see your dining companion's eyes, the colors of the wine and what you're eating.  As other yelpers have noted, so much beige: that can distort colors, but I'm guessing the intent was a neutral room in which the color of guests and offerings stand out.  Enough space on the floor so your intimate whisper won't be answered by someone at the next table. Knowledgeable, personable, and ready-to-please are servers and sommeliers who do not merely bring what you request but anticipate your wants.  The celebrities here include you!  The staff will treat you like one (unusual for this part of town). Providence is not for the faint of heart (or palate or wallet), from the wasabe garnish on your appetizer to the bill that is sweetened with decorated candies.  Heavily slanted towards Chef Cimarusti's beloved bounties of the sea, the range of menu to tempt includes:  ocean crawlers (scallops, lobster, crab, etc), deep swimmers (tuna, halibut, squid, etc), escapees (salmon), growing in earth (carrots, beets, radishes, 'shrooms, spices, etc), roaming over earth (steak, veal), to flying the skies above earth (duck).  Blends such as foie gras (though I'm not a fan), are some of the richest/best I've ever had.  You won't find a happier collection anywhere.  Many yelpers have detailed the menu and you can find it on the internet so I won't repeat.  Note that even many who say they did not like an offering's taste for one reason or another say it was perfectly cooked.  Can you find a piece of fish cooked as well elsewhere for half the price?  Perhaps.  Other comments suggest the edible bits and spices do not complement the main selection.  That may be true on the plate but once in the mouth they delight me.  Most do not meld into a single taste but evoke a range of flavors and scents to explode in your mouth.  Sometimes they evolve to tell a story - even in one bite! Providence.  Webster's says that's foresight, guardianship and control exercised by a deity.  Not a deity (sorry, Michael) but Chef Cimarusti may stop by your table. Not humble in any way are meal menu options that include: a la carte, several choices of n-course tasting meals, or chef's choice.  Adding (generous pour) wine pairings easily gets you to $200 (and more, with extras you're likely to try plus taxes & gratuities). Desert flights are also available. After leaving Providence - it's then that it hits you.  No, I'm not talking about the bill.  The experience, remember?  It wasn't that you occupied a space at a table or feasted or drank.  You were PART of the experience.  The interaction with your server, ALL the senses taking in the ambiance of the room from the soft buzz to occasional boisterousness, and of course the meal itself.  Like any performing art (and in the European way, eating is an art form, after all), your mind is called to put away what it knows to be real and accept another reality:  theater's suspension of disbelief.  In Providence you connect.  The play opens with hors douvres action and presses toward the final course, each course an act, each morsel a character.  You are drawn in to anticipate each new morsel that appears on the table-stage with you, dressed in color and style to delight the eye and the nose long before it hits the palette.  If acting is about taking in the action and reacting in character then consider - you wind up listening to your companion(s), you talk about color and texture and taste, things new and interesting.  Why, even the food may talk to you, popping or crunching in your mouth.  Providence can leave you conflicted: satisfied yet wanting more.  You vow to return the next time you're celebrating.  In my book, when it's more than a meal - when it's art -- THAT'S what the fifth star is for. . . Mangare!

Best fine dining experience I've had... you have to get the prefix dinner with wine pairing! The waiter was wonderful at explaining how each wine compliments each dish. I really enjoyed the cheese sampler as well... Great ambiance... although on the pricey side, perfect place to take your date for a nice & romantic dinner.

I'm PRO for PROvidence!  The area doesn't seem too infested with trendiness, which means that Providence isn't just HYPE.  The food is excellent and so are their drinks!  I was eyeing the desserts all night but after a 5 course meals and drinks, I couldn't even stand up. When I wanted to try another dish instead of the one included, they happily made that happen for me.   It's quiet and pretty low key with excellent service.  A great date place, or an anniversary place.  I hate when you go to a decent restaurant and see other people dressed like they're at Dennis!  Okay, maybe not Dennis but you get the picture.  Well Providence isn't like that at all.  I believe other customers make up the ambiance and this place is great.  I like the combination of young couples as well as older groups.  It's definitely a great dinning experience where you can truly enjoy food the way it's meant to be enjoyed.   Can't wait to go there again.  Last time, I made a reservation just a few hours prior but with all this Yelpers, I hope it doesn't become impossible.  I hate waiting!!!

I randomly picked this place online and boy, was I lucky. What a great restaurant. The service matched the food for perfection. Went with friends and sat at the bar on a Thursday night. The female bartender was knowledgeable and very professional. We all ordered different specialty drinks and she took her time and made them as only a pro would know how. We had heard about the prawns cooked in salt that is served tableside. They were as good as we had heard, in fact so good we ordered another round of them. Each creative delight came with an explanation... our waiter would come out and explain to us what the dish was and some other fun little facts. The waiter also talked about the wine that came with it. They all give you so much attention if you ask for this particular meal. It was clear to see that they viewed it all as an art and truly enjoyed serving the dishes. Unlike other Tapas places I've been to, the food actually filled me up because it wasn't just one or two dishes, it must have been like 12 dishes! The wine selection is amazing too! Don't confuse this place with some fufu frilly restaurant because the proportions are small and the menu is expensive, it is absolutely worth every dollar. The food left such an impression on us, we made reservations to bring our friends the next night.  A perfect 10 in my book.

My husband took me here for my birthday this year for the first time ever and we both thought the food was Amazing .  He made the reservations on http://opentable.com  which i am convinced they shove you in the back corner of the restaurant when you book thru them.  The portions were a normal portion size that allowed us to get Amuse Bouche, 2 appetizers, an entree each ,& one big fat whiskey milk chocolate desert that was like eating a plate of heaven + coffee service and candies from the chef.   The sommelier recommended a wine from sean thackery that was made from 6 different grapes that had to be the 2nd best glass of wine i've ever had in my life...smooothooth. I had a halibut with fava beans (amazing) , my husband had the scallops from the tasting menu...amazing..just perfectly cooked i CAN NOT wait to go again. my mouth is watering just writing this...

This place brought back memories of fine dining in New York.  Providence provided a relaxing and quite enjoyable dining experience.  It's pricey but that's what you should expect before you walk in the door for this level of dining.  I was a bit suspect since I had dined here when it was Patina.  I hated the space then but this restaurant has created wonderful tiny rooms where one can relax.  Top notch staff, inventive dishes (even the non-seafood ones) and the casual fine dining vibe made the evening perfect.  Excellent wine choices for every budget and wonderful suggestions from staff. (Thanks Diana!)  Foodies, Providence should be on your list!  I will definitely be back to celebrate special occasions and dinners when I can indulge.  Special shout out for the duck!

I was drawn by the 2 Michelin star rating. People, it doesn't get much better than this. They pulled all the tricks out of the hat and had top quality service.

So, I've done the whole "white table cloth" fine dining thing several times before this. Every time I leave a fine dining restaurant, I have that feeling of, "wow, that was an expensive meal for what I ate." At Providence, for the first time, I actually felt that I got my money's worth.  The experience together with the taste was almost like a great movie, that just keeps you wanting more, and makes you wonder what's in store next.  I'm not a fish eater, so I cannot fully judge the majority of their menu, but I found the one of very few meat dishes on their menu and savored every bite.  I don't know how they do it, but you have to experience it for yourself. Would definitely go back!

Providence was an amazing experience. I had the 9 course tasting menu and it was delicious. My favorite was the scallop, it was cooked to perfection! And the corn tortilla ice cream was delicious! The interior of the restaurant was beautiful. The atmosphere was very calm and dim. The next time I come here I will definitely do a la carte. Be prepared to spend alot of money for the tasting menu. If I remember, my friend and I spent $360 + tax and tip including cocktails.

Oh my god... ridiculously amazing!  The experience, the food, the service... The 15-course chef's menu was worth every penny.  Every dish was amazing - every THING in every dish was amazing, all prepared to perfection.  Light flavors were balanced in each dish, as were heavy flavors. Here's what I think we had (I'll do my best to get all the details): Bread - Bacon Brioche, Nori Foccaccia, and regular white 1. Mojito Gelée and Screwdriver jell-o (?) with liquid filling 2. Skewer of grilled abalone and skewer of grilled Japanese sword squid with chorizo 3. Slices of kanpachi around pieces of apple and mini shiso leaf (?) with a smoked soy sauce 4. Slices of geoduck clam and abalone in a citrus broth 5. Uni in poached egg topped with California(?) caviar and croissant croutons 6. Santa Barbara spotted prawn (with its own eggs) in a sauce vierge (tomato and basil salsa type thing) and a celery leaf 7.  Black bass with raw matsutake mushrooms and a cooked matsutake mushroom and sake sauce. 8. Grilled unagi on grilled foie gras in a (something) emulsion 9.  Roasted(?) pork belly on a slice of tahitian squash with a saffron sitrus sauce served with mustard greens and tahitian squash puree 10. Slices of grilled salmon with quince and aspoulet(?) 11.  Lamb with ... some sort of beans(?), (fried?) olives, garlic breadcrumbs(?), some type of cranberry sauce(?) 12. Plate of some crazy cheeses from a huge cheese cart served with apricot-black pepper chutney, apple jam, candied walnuts, and a fig 13. Mango gelée topped with lychee sorbet, coconut, and granola in a white chocolate sauce filled with tapioca 14. Miso panna cotta topped with huckleberries, toffee(?) and a berry foam (?) 15. Rooibos tea and chocolate ice cream covered in cocoa powder, served with mini eggless creme brulees and some type of alcohol-soaked cherries on top of some shredded red stuff (chocolate?) 16. Chocolate macaroons, salted caramel and the gummy cube things My friend and I, who are both very big eaters, were already sooo full around the time of the salmon, but the food kept coming.  And then three desserts?  Everytime they cleared our dessert plate, we thought we were done, but the waitress would place new set of silverware - we were so confused. Also, the table next to us ordered a red truffle pasta - looked pretty good.  The truffle was shaved on the plate at their table.  And several tables got the little birthday treat, which was a banana bread pudding with some other stuff on it. So, again, amazing!  I'm trying to think of an occasion - an excuse - to go back again...  birthday?  work promotion?  just 'cause?

Nice restaurant, classy place.  Food was great including two amuse bouche courses.  Valet is not free but relatively cheap.  Did the 9 course tasting, was stuffed afterward.  It was excellent but compared to many other establishments of fine dining, I am a little hard-pressed to find anything that stuck out (good or bad) except perhaps the egg-sea urchin course which was very tasty.  Maybe I should have gone the a la carte route.

I joke with my girlfriend that we have a bit of unspoken competition among each other to one up one another when taking each other out to nice restaurants. This place definitely makes it hard to beat! Our server went out of his way to make us feel just at home. Offered to take multiple photos of us  with my camera throughout the night. Explained every single detail and was genuinely just a nice person. I have nothing but great things to say about Providence.

It's as good as it gets.  I'll first off throw in the caveat that price was no object at this dinner.  That being said... I've had other meals like this and this was by far the BEST.  We ordered ala carte but Chef Cimarusti turned into the tasting menu plus. Chef Cimarusti really knows how to throw down infusing multiple cultures and new age techniques without being annoying.  We had a five hour meal at the Chef's Table.  The entire party was in heaven. See my pictures from this incredible dinner http://richmarphotograph… Highlights Foie Gras Ravioli... out of this world, skin was not your typical ravioli and flavor was intense!! Foie Gras Saute - can't say i've foie gras that was crispy on the outside Harlan Estate 2005 - wow... it lives up to the hype. I may have had better japanese wagyu at Cut.  But the overall gastronomical experience at Providence blows everyone out of the water

Chef Cimarusti has the cleanest flavors I have ever tasted. This restaurant is sooo amazing!! I can't wait to go again! We did a 5 course tasting menu and the progression of the meal was absolutely perfect! The start of the amuse bouche to the sweet treats at the end of the meal was perfect! I added these salted roasted Santa Barbra spot prawns to our tasting menu and it was, without a doubt. the most unique flavorful prawns I have ever tasted. If you go there you'll understand why it was a place of michelin status! We started with a this 3 tastings of amuse bouche. One was a mojito in a gel form, a greyhound that was a bubble and it would pop in your mouth and the last one was this trout, I believe. I forget what it was but it was the best of the 3. To start off the tasting menu we had kanpanchi which was a nice clean type of fish. Second, was the spot prawns, which was added by choice. Third course, a lovely scallop dish. Forth course was wild halibut. Fifth course was this amazing, most tender piece of veal tenderloin I've ever had. Finally, the sixth course was dessert. It was this yuzu curd with these meringue hersey looking clouds that was so "fluffy" and light in taste. It was a nice clean dessert to end the meal. Lastly, they gave us these treats. All I can remember was this salted caramel and I wish I could have purchased a whole bag of this stuff. It was YUMMY! Service there was amazing as well! I forgot to add that the bread there is SO GOOD! There was this bacon brioche and nori bread which is a MUST TRY!

I see this restaurant on almost every top 10 list for LA and rightly so.  I went here for New Yera's Eve which was a 9 (that's right 9) course meal prix fix.  It was super posh and very romantic.  The tables are not jammed together so you're not forced to listen to other people's conversations and the staff was extremely attentive and friendly. Now, the food!  WOW!  Every single dish was delectible and exotic and so flavorful that I wanted to savor each bite as long as possible.  At first, the dishes seemed small but by the 6th course which was prime rib I could barely finish - there were still 3 desert courses to go! The last course arrived around 11:30 and then they passed out hats and noise makers and we rang in the new year with the whole restaurant. I feel guilty that I live so close by and it took me 4 years to finally try this place.  I cannot wait to go back and sample the regular menu!!!

This restaurant has a very romantic setting and the food is excellent.  I've been here quite a few times and the only time i was disappointed was they overcooked my scallops.  Other than that, I love this restaurant.  Oh, I really like their cheese selection.  Most restaurants would not have that much variety as they do at Providence.

Amazing!  The food is absolutely delicious and the dining experience is phenomenal.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the cuisine and was great on recommending perfect combinations pleasing to the most refined palate.  The chef, Michael Cimarusti is the Executive Chef and goes over the top in the food presentation, experience and taste. He's also in the back putting together your favorite dishes a la carte or off the tasting menu.  He enjoys it so much you it shows in the brillance of his work through the amazing quality of each and every dish. I recommend this to all my friends.  And if you haven't been to this restaurant yet, reserve your table now! I promise you won't regret it.

I brought my Mom to Providence tonight, it was her 50th birthday and I wanted to go all out.  We both had an AMAZING experience tonight.  WE got the Chef's tasting Menu, 160 a person.  It was 12 courses of incredible food.  My favorites were the amuse bouche, cocktails, tofu marshmallow, seasoned trout, and the UNI EGGS! So delicious!! Everything to a T was perfect, the service at Providence is top notch.  I wish I had more money to eat here more often.   The sommelier was so genuine, I did not have wine pairings, but I asked her for a recommendation for a glass that would go well with all foods.  She brought me this delicious Riesling, and when I asked for another recommendation for a dessert wine, she brought another delicious glass of white wine as well.  I was expecting these wines to be really expensive, especially because I did not ask for the price or anything, but when the bill came, I was so happy to see that the wines were very reasonably priced, I really appreciated that!   The dishes, desserts, BREADS, everything was incredible.  They even brought out another dessert course for us with a candle to celebrate my mom's birthday!   I would love to come back here someday, maybe after I get a good job hehe.  Thank you Chef Michael!

My friend and I ordered the full tasting menu and we were not disappointed.  The seafood dishes were the best; better than my favorite chef eric rippert in le bernardin (nyc).  I can go on and on with the caviar/sea urchin, scallops, kanpachi, halibut, trout  - all were wonderfully presented and tasted incredibly awesome.  The only two dishes that were okay were the tenderloin and cheeses (next time, I will ask for better subs). Desserts were good but not great. The best fine dining restaurant in LA.  As for drinks, stay away from the lyondale, tasted like gasoline (disclaimer: i am weak sauce when it comes to drinks).  My friend had the wonderland (or wonder something) and it was very good.

I havent been this impressed in a long time. Went on a monday night (no corkage fee) and brought 2 bottles of wine. That saved us about $100. Amuse Bouche: gin and tonic ice thingy, nitrogen mojito and a puree of somthing as a shot mixed with yuzu. Who would ever think of having this as an amuse bouche. I seriously wanted seconds, and thirds.. I couldve had this as my main. It was that good! So we decided to do one 9 course and one a la carte since we share everything and getting two of the same course would be boring. For the a la carte we got foie gras and Lobster Risotto. The foie gras was the best Ive had so far right. Second would be Jiraffe and then Gordon Ramseys. The risotto was alright but nothing outstanding. I wanted to have the amuse again! For the 9 course the dishes that stand out the most were: Hog point oysters cooked in its own juice. How can cooking something in its own juice make it a million times better. Should we cook meat in its blood??? I have never had anything like this before and it made me sad that there were only about 4 or 5 pieces in there. Its ok because there was a lot more food to come. A ll the fishes in between (scallops, artic char, etc) were good and nicely executed ) Veal Tenderloin: perfectly cooked Cheese platter: They have this amazing cheese cart that they stroll around and cut right there. I wanted it all but we had a choice of three. They were all good and they gave us the accompaniments such as figs, nuts. There was so much we had to take it togo since we had desserts to work on. We actually didnt care so much for the desserts cause we were so full but when it came out we scarfed it down. The description didnt sound too apealing but the taste YUM! no wonder theyre known for their desserts. The last one was something with a foam on top with crunchy soba and tapioca on the bottom. Overall this dinner was memorable from beginning till end. Cant wait to go back. Forget saving this for a special occasion.. go on Monday and save on the booze.

If you in any remote fashion enjoy seafood, do yourself a favor and book a 9-course tasting menu at Providence.  Presentation, flavor, and creativity shined throughout our meal.  Take into account the liberal pours with the wine pairings, and both myself and my girl were sitting cozy with gleeful grins spread out on our faces.  A great night.

the food here is excellent. the service people are extremely knowledgeable but not pretentious or cold like a lot of other restaurants of this caliber. the tasting menus are extraordinary. the focus is on seafood and the chef seems to have an affection for little gastro chemical tricks but he doesn't use them in a way that makes you wonder whether or not the stuff that you are consuming is actually food or not. everything is delicious. your mouth will experience new flavors and new textures and you will see new techniques and better quality than at almost any other restaurant. i once had veal here that was cooked in a 100 percent humidity oven or something crazy that i had never heard of before and still have not heard of anywhere else. i don't even know what that is but it was the best veal i have ever had. i do not question the reasons for these things i just eatttt and enjoyyy. with all of that said--- the pastry chef here TRULY shines. i want to hug him. like the yelper below me-- if i was rich i would eat here ALL of the time. i have been to Providence maybe 5 times now. it never disappoints. tasting menu is the way to go. follow that with cheese and follow that with dessert. the desserts are unrivaled by any other restaurant that i have been to in the world and i have been to some epic ones with famous chefs in bazillion dollar locations. i believe that you can even come to Providence to do an entire tasting menu devoted just to desserts. that how serious this pastry man is and how amazing their desserts are here. the restaurant itself has subdued decor which is reflective of the food. the walls are covered in barnacle inspired sculpture. the lighting is lovely. everything down to the container that the salt is served in is beautiful and serene and simple. enjoy the chef's menu, opt for wine pairing and expect a visit from the chef.

Went for my friend's Birthday and decided on doing the full eight course dessert tasting menu.....seeing that we're both fans of sweets.  Arrived and was instantly greeted by a number of people...definitely the beginning of great service that lasted the entire night.  The 8 courses are small but could still be considered a meal itself....but for those of you who are big eaters, you might want to consider getting a light snack before or after to really fill you up.  Since I didn't see too many reviews on the dessert tasting menu, I'll do a in-depth review for you curious ones out there....  =) 1st - Mojito:  Basically a dumpling/raviolo filled with mojito.  Definitely interesting...presentation was nice, texture was awesome, and there's nothing like biting into it and having that burst of flavor explode in your mouth.  great palate cleanser.... 2nd - Kalamansi Gelee w/ white chocolate coconut soy milk soup and litchi sorbet:  Kalamansi was sour, but the litchi sorbet and soup balanced it out very well. 3rd - Jonalicious Apple w/ barley ice cream, pine nut puree, and north star dried cherries:  Barley ice cream is to die for...I wanted to ask them if they sold it by the pint.  the sous-vide apples were awesome.....cooked very well....slight crunch, very sweet, and so flavorful. 4th - Fig Newton w/ mastic ice cream and cherry foam:  great concept gone bad.  this was one dessert that i could definitely do without and was the only one that i did not finish during the meal.  the mastic ice cream (what the heck is mastic) had a gross licorice flavor and the cherry form tasted like robutussin.  the actual fig newton part tasted okay....but this dish just didn't add up. 5th - pumpkin "pie" w/ curry ice cream and pecan streussel:  one of my favorites of the night.  this is basically a pumpkin pie deconstructed.  Eating all of the elements on the plate by themselves tasted very awkward and at times disgusting (curry ice cream?!).....but when eaten all together at the same time....it somehow creates the perfect pumpkin pie in your mouth.  Would definitely order this if I went again....YUM! 6th - milk chocolate-whisky panna cotta w/ bailey's ice cream and coconut raviolo:  BEST dessert ever.  Panna cotta was amazinggggg, the coconut raviolo was out of this world!.....and the ice cream complemented everything so well.  I wouldn't mind having 8 courses of this dessert! 7th - Burnt Caramel Ice Cream w/ chocolate, ginger bread, and pears:  The chocolate, ginger bread, and pears tasted amazing together....but what really stuck out was the ice cream and how it tasted EXACTY like caramel. 8th - White Chocolate/lemon thyme lollipop:  amazing looking dessert....you're suppose to put the lollipop in your mouth, slide it off the stick, then bite it.  The lollipop was hard to bite once it was in your mouth since it was big, but the burst of lemon/thyme flavor was wayyyy too much for me, almost causing me to cough from the sourness, but the chocolate was delicious.  A lil more chocolate and this would have been a winner. Overall.....6 hits and 2 misses.  I told them it was my friend's birthday when i called and made the reservation, so they stuck a candle on one of the dishes.....so that was a nice touch.  Service was great, the desserts were delicious (at least 6 out of 8)....and the food at the tables next to us smelled amazing.  I'll definitely be coming back.....

NOM NOM NOM! My boyfriend and I came here for an early Valentine's day dinner, and I was impressed from the second that I stepped into the restaurant. Dimly light (as it seems all classy restaurants are) and simply decorated with some barnacle-like shells, the ambiance was definitely first-rate. We ordered the Valentine's Day 7 course meal, which consisted for a full 3 more courses than I have ever had in one sitting. First we started off with some bread, with my favorite easily being the bacon brioche, which was fluffy and dotted with bacon bits on the inside. Next came the amuse bouche, which came with a icy mojito jelly, screwdriver in a delicate yolk-like sac, cheese puff, and parsnip soup shot (topped with Parmesan foam). I loved the texture of everything, and especially liked the screwdriver and how the flavors danced in my mouth when it exploded upon my tongue. The courses that followed consisted of a kanpachi sashimi, lightly smoked salmon (with the most delicious fingerling potato I have ever had), seared scallops, sea bass, succulent wagyu beef. This was followed by a palette cleanser and a chocolate mousse dessert. The meal ended with a plate of chocolate marshmallows, vanilla macaroons, and cinnamon jellies. Everything was extremely fresh, beautifully plated, and well portioned. Each dish had enough that I got a good taste, but was not overly full by the end of the meal. The unique mix of flavors with each dish was very welcome, and was definitely the most gourmet meal I have ever had in my life. Although it cost a pretty penny, the meal was definitely a unique experience that I would recommend to anyone celebrating a very special night, or looking to impress a date. There's a reason they have TWO Michelin Stars! However, would I go again for that price? Probably not. Would I gobble down another plate of those fingerling potatoes without a second thought? HELL YES.

All the food is of high quality and delicious!  The price seems fair for the quality and amount of food you get in the combo deal (at the end of the menu). The service was also exceptional. The place was full and they were hustling with whatever we asked for.   I will return!

The only decent building in a very shady neighborhood of Hollywood, Providence is a gem of a find. Once entering the restaurant, the atmosphere changes completely from the outside world. The staff were impressively courteous and definitely knew how to take care of you. Although I went with a group of co-workers so our menu selection was mostly set, I was still sufficiently amazed by the quality and selection of their food to be obliged to create this entry. Truly, it is a blessing to have eaten at this restaurant. Their scallops (sea scallops from Hokkaido Japan) were absolutely delicious. The waiter stated that the scallops would be the best that I have ever eaten. He was right. To this day, I can still taste the freshness and flavor. The only disheartening drawback was the serving only contained one piece. For the main dish, I had the halibut (from British Columbia) - not as great as the scallops, but still very yummy. Oh, and who could forget the dessert? I ordered the kalamansi gelee - oh so divine!!! It was a white chocolate coconut soy milk soup with litchi-shiso sorbet - the ingredients don't sound like they should mix together, but until you have actually had the concoction, don't knock it. You would wish you hadn't. And then ask the waiter for seconds, because it is THAT good. However, if you are not looking to spend $$$$, Providence is not the right place to go. On that note, if you are a cute single guy looking to take a lovely girl out to dinner here, I suppose I could subject myself to your company :D

My girlfriend and I ate here back in October of 2009 for our anniversary. The experience was a pretty good one. This is one of those restaurants where you can't judge it by looking at the outside. When I first saw it I was like really? This place is a fine dine? But when I walked in I immediately felt out of place because of how nice it was. Was greeted by the friendly staff and was seated pretty much right away. About 10 mins after we ordered our food, our waiter came out with a few samples of the chef's special. It was a pretty tasty surprise. The food was excellent. I got their soup to start off, their steak for entree, and had one of their desserts. I have absolutely no complaints about their food, it was all very good. My girlfriend had something similar but I can't remember what. All I remember is that she had no complaints either. And we both had a glass of wine. The bill came out to be about $230. Its a bit pricey but it was pretty good.

dinner at providence is lovely. even in the company of a wretched woman who thought it was ok to spoon feed and flirt with my then-boyfriend throughout the entire meal (in front of me and her own boyfriend), i still give an emphatic 5-star rating to my experience at this fine restaurant. that's how good it was. providence has a wonderful ambiance and the service is outstanding. the sommelier was especially impressive. we had a lot of food and wine and cocktails, all of which were far above average. the standouts: loved the veal. kanpachi carpaccio was excellent. the foie gras was out. of. this. world. i'd give the restaurant a 5-star rating for this dish alone. this is one of the fancier restaurants i've been to. dress your best, mind your manners and come hungry.

my first good experience with molecular gastronomy. the only other time was at clio in boston, who basically j/turned everything into bubbles. anyway, below is my play by play of the 5-course tasting menu. nori focaccia/bacon brioche - not usually a fan, but i tried them and found both a little too oily amuse bouche - mojito gelee (delightful), screwdriver bubble (tasty, but oddly shaped like an egg yolk), gorgonzola cheese puff (standard), parsnip soup with port reduction (absolute fav!) (1) kampachi - good. really liked the crispy rice crackers sprinkled on top. (2) scallop - very well-made. scallop was cooked to perfection and was real meaty (almost steak-like!) (3) sea bass - thought it could've been a bit more tender. also not that big a fan of aerated butter. (4) veal - delicious! gobbled up all the chanterelle mushrooms and sweet little onions even though i was pretty satiated by this point. (5) banana bread pudding/barley ice cream - never had bread pudding like this before. literally tasted like banana bread, but had the consistency of pudding. barley ice cream went well with the pudding, but i would say is not meant to be eaten alone. it also came with a compressed banana. the compression gave it a jello-like texture, but i think i prefer the real thing. complimentary 'candies' - cinnamon gelee, chocolate marshmallow, and almond macaron. all tasty, but not as good as the banana bread pudding. should've just stopped there. all in all, too pricey for me to be a regular diner, but very glad i tried it! oh, also a fan of the no corkage mondays.

Providence was one of the best dining experiences of my life! Where do I even begin? We had the chef's menu I believe. I wasn't really sure since I didn't do the ordering but we had so many courses come to us, I lost track. First off, the decor is lovely. It's very classy and there's a bar and private dining rooms. Since there were so many dishes I'm only going to talk about my favorites but all of them were heavenly. The presentation of all the food took my breath away. My favorites were the amuse bouche (specifically the mini bun with the trout), the egg with the uni and scrambled egg, the fois gras, the hamachi dish, the prawns (I love how they prepare it in front of you), the raw oysters (that shallot sauce is amazing), the cheese cart, veal, and dessert with the green tea/chocolate cake. We also had wine pairings and I don't know much about wine but I really liked the wine they served with the oysters. It was clean and delightful. The service was great and I loved how they explain each and every dish and how it's prepared and cooked. Thank you Providence for an unforgettable dining experience!   Note: Dinner for us was about 4 hours because we had so many courses and it was worth it! :)

FYI...this was the place that gave me the jumpstart to continue to review on Yelp. Thanks guys. I'll just start by saying if you are hesitant about going, just GO! And if you think you will spend a good amount of money, you WILL! What can I say, we had the 9-course tasting menu with wine pairings and it was the best food I have ever had by far, wines were wonderful, and it was the most expensive meal I've ever had. You seriously must try it once, although it will have you craving for more I'm sure. Besides what was already said let me try to tell you some lesser said comments: 1) make reservation ahead of time, preferably atleast a couple weeks, and if you are doing a tasting menu expect to be there for 3-4 hrs. We were there for 3 hrs 45 mins. 6pm time was perfect on Saturday night. 2) the wines are generously poured, we had a cocktail there before plus the 9 wines & aperitif, so you do have a nice buzz when leaving....I may admit the only error on the restaurants behalf was they forgot to bring a course with a wine,oops! I wasn't fazed, laughed, and they poured us another whole glass of wine to make up for it, made 10 glasses! 3) It seems they generally don't change the menu around too often. Most of the reviews I've seen contain all similar or the same items. Just reference which tasting you are doing to get an idea 4) You will feel extremely full after the 9 courses. Not like a too many refills on Thanksgiving Day full, but more of a bliss, wonderful, I just want to lie down and my life is complete kind of full. Go check it out

One of the best restaurants I've ever been to. One of the best restaurants in LA. One of the best restaurants ever. I loved this place. Clearly I'm not the only one. It also got voted Best Restaurant in LA on chowhound in addition to all of the formal food critic awards they've won. Ok, I usually try to write with specific details about what I ordered, how much it was, but I'm going to keep this short because I've just read through what feels like hundreds of reviews for this place and a lot of them say the same thing so clearly that info is easy to find. (Obviously the food and service were phenomenal) A few other random things I wanted to add: -If someone at the table orders the tasting meal, then the whole party has to get it... which is why we didn't get the tasting menu, but the table next to us did and it looked great! -Monday night = no corkage fee -I signed up for their mailing list after our dinner because we were still glowing from the food. I get emails every now and then about cooking classes they offer with some famous chefs. I've gotten a sushi one, a prep skills, dessert one, and so on. I haven't been to one yet, but I have every intention of going to one in the future. They're kind of pricey, usually around $150. You can find the info on their website under "Special Events". -Our dinner for two ended up being around $120 total because we ordered a la carte and BYOB. -Our waiter would bring out fancy little bites of food for us to try throughout our meal and would explain what it was to us. I believe he said the chef was trying things out or something. Yummy! Definitely worth the hype. If you have a special occasion coming up or just a lot of money to eat out... come here!!!

The place looks unimpressive from the outside the food more than makes up. The chef specializes in Gastroenterology, which is a very unique and fun way of eating. For starters we had a gin and tonic  gelatin like mojito flavored ball that dissolved in your mouth and and a shot of carrot ginger soup, mind you these were all food items with an alcohol theme, SUPER COOL! I had the best seafood and veal followed by two courses of dessert - miso cheesecake and cucumber sorbet was unlike anything I've ever had. So if you're a cheese lover like I am you have arrived in cheese heaven when they wheel out the cheese cart. Literally its like having a whole cheese store at your table. Oh and their drink and wine menu is impressive, I highly suggest the RUBY SLIPPER super fresh and sweet. And one last thing the bathroom (which is ultra modern and doesn't fit the overall decor of the restaurant) is amazing, my dream bathroom with a  swiveling magnifying face mirror, sink which lights up from underneath and a full length mirror.

This restaurant is top notch.  My friend and I both tried the 5 course tasting menu with the wine pairing and it was absolutely amazing.  The presentation, along with the uniqueness of the dishes and the amazing flavors had me very impressed.  This same week I tried Jose Andres "Bazaar" which was also excellent but I can honestly say Providence was even better.  I will definitely come back.

Most expensive meal of my life... but honestly, also one of the very best.  On the parents dime, my wife and I went here for our first anniversary.  We had the tasting menu.  It was spectacular.  It's totally off the wall but also really good at the same time.  The chef somehow managed to make the good experimental and arty (which made the meal a very cool experience) but also just really tasty (which made the meal very satisfying).   We went last August and at that time the six course tasting menu was: course 1:  melon soup (served in a cute little glass) and on the side a soy marshmallow with wasabi pea crumbles on top. course 2:  tuna sashimi with citrus foam, chorizo powder, chorizo jelly, and chorizo bits. course 3: lobster pieces with parsnip puree and parsnip chip. course 4: sea bass (from Massachusetts!) on a bed of heirloom butternut squash with a soy reduction. course 5: duck breast + duck confit, with chanterelles, pearl onion, baby carrot, cocoa nib powder, and sriracha sauce. course 6: dessert!  corn tortilla flavored ice cream (yes, corn tortilla - it was GREAT) on top of warm black berries with a polenta corn crumble.  followed by some petit-fours and tea. We loved it all.

I've been to one other Michelin rated restaurant and this one did not compare. We have the 5-course meal - it was good but nothing to write about. Not a knock on the restaurant but it was a bit too casual. For the price and Michelin rating you'd think people would dress better. I especially didn't like that I was served cocoa puffs as part of my dessert. I expected this place to have a wow factor but there was none.

The restaurant is certainly high class.  You feel like a princess arriving there.  The food looks amazing and worth going there for the visual.  However, I do have to say that the flavors are weak.  The food does taste bland and certainly not as good as it looks.   However, my cousin did say that it was the best chocolate dessert he had ever experienced.

My wife and I came here to celebrate our anniversary - we mentioned this to one of our waiters and he said "You came to the right place".  Well, he was not wrong... To sum it up - "wow, wow, wow !"  The experience was everything we had expected - the food, the service, the ambience - everything is absolutely on-point.   Prior to seating us, we were invited to wait in the lounge/bar area.  We sat at the bar and each had a very nicely prepared cocktail.  My wife had the Pisco Sour and I had a drink that the bartender prepared for me on the spot, based on my preferences for an aromatic drink featuring Mezcal.  Wonderful way to kick things off ! We ordered the 5-course tasting menu, with the wine pairings ($95 / $45) and it was perfect for us.  Not too much, not too little.  The wines that were served with the courses were all very interesting, out-of-the-ordinary and well-chosen - things like a Nebbiolo rose, for example, that you don't generally find elsewhere.  Intriguing, just like the food. BTW, there was actually more than just the 5 (or however many) courses, because they also served us two rounds of Amuse Bouche (small tastes) before the actual courses arrived.  Each of these consisted of multiple elements, each were amazingly good and made us more eagerly anticipate the actual dishes.  Oh, and the bread - the bread is really really good, as well ! Waitstaff are plentiful, friendly yet highly professional - they know when to be there, when not to, are friendly in just the right way, highly knowledgeable and eager to share if they sense that you want to engage, and not in the least snobby or patronizing. We loved this restaurant and highly recommend it.

We came here early and upon entering, the host did not greet us immediately.  When he finally did, we inquired whether or not if our table was possibly ready, so we didn't have to wait until our reservation time.  He told us it wasn't and said it in a way that made us feel like we were weird and stupid for asking.  Needless to say, at a restaurant like this, we expected outstanding customer service and to feel welcomed.  So anyway, we left for awhile and came back, and this time around, the host seemed more pleasant and brought us to our table right away. We did the full tasting, which consists of 9 courses, amuse bouche, and complimentary dessert.  The amuse bouche consisted of gin and tonic gelee, membrane bound screwdriver, and fish with creme fraiche.  They were all very impressive in terms of taste and technique.  Someone also comes around offering you a bunch of different breads.  There was one with bacon, but my favorite was the focaccia.  I'm not going to list out every course because I don't remember everything in its complexity.  I will say however, it was my first time having uni and I thought it was good.  Very rich and heavy though, so it's a good thing it was just in an egg shell.  I'm also not a raw fish person, but there was no way I was going to waste a course.  And to my surprise, I enjoyed the tuna a lot.  We both agreed the best dish was the veal (for me, turbot was substituted in its place).  I enjoyed every single component of that dish.  The rest of the courses, were still good, but they didn't stand out.  At the very end, the complimentary dessert tray came with macarons and 2 kinds of chews.  These were okay as well.  We left feeling extremely full! The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice.  It's roomy, tables were nicely spread out, and it didn't feel super stuffy as other high end places can be.  The overall service was good, but not the best I've experienced.  Same goes for the food.

My cousin recommended we dine here for my mothers birthday celebration. Truly a fine experience all the way around. We had the 5 course tasting with wine pairing.  The servers were attentive, very experienced and knowledgeable about anything we asked regarding the 5 courses and how each wine pairing was selected to bring out the best in each course. The large prawns buried in sea salt and baked in 600 degrees then cleaned and served for us at the table was exceptional. in An interesting aspect of dinning here was that each course had such unique ingredients and flavors unlike anything I've tasted while dinning.  I showed unusual facial expressions of sheer joy that my guests were intrigued by. The detailed reviews by the other reviewers describe each course well. We look forward to returning someday

I've always heard of and referenced Michelin stars, but I never truly knew what that meant.  I mean I've read that there are only like 81 restaurants in the world that have 3 michelin stars (none in LA that I know of) and 3 is the most you can get.  Being a picky foodie can be challenging when you read a menu and are "scared" of certain ingredients.  When I went to Providence I promised myself not to be and boy was I so happy I did. We were sat right away (even though we were 10 min late for our reservation) in a smaller room with 4 other tables.  The first sign that we were in a high-end establishment?  I was asked if I would like a black napkin for my lap since my dress was black.  I mean, that is class!  I loved that we were not rushed.  We were given the wine list and cocktail menu first and after we ordered those we were asked if we'd like to see the menu while our drinks were being made or if we wanted to enjoy the cocktail for a bit first.  I think we were both eager so we took a look at the menu so we could make a smart decision for dinner.  I didn't realize that it was a seafood restaurant, I know - you'd think I'd do my extensive research on the place, but at the same time I wanted to really experience it w/o trying to meet expectations I'd make by reading up on it.  We both started with a cocktail, mine was called Lyone and I can't remember exactly what was in it, but it was citrus-y and had ginger beer in it (of course.)  Dan picked a cocktail that was made with egg whites and some kind of alcohol that I already forgot.  Both were made very well and at least for me, gave me a nice holiday buzz. After we placed our order, we were given a selection of breads, regular sourdough, bacon flavored and an herb foccacia.  You can guess what I picked and Dan took a sample of the other two.  I was too busy telling a story to even take a bite, but Dan stopped in his tracks when he bit into the bacon flavored roll.  You'll have to take his word, but from the look on his face and uncontrollable "mmmm" that came out of his mouth, for all you bacon lovers, I think this bread was a winner.  We were also treated with a plate of 4 amuse bouches... they were even placed to be eaten in a certain order.  The wasabi marshmallow was interesting, but all of the rest were really good.  I even got over my fear of raw fish for a second and ate some deliciousness on a spoon!  (Sorry, I can't remember what kind of fish, but it was raw!)  I ordered the Maine Lobster Salad to start and Dan had the Matsutake Soup... both absolutely amazing.  I loved how the soup was served... he was given a bowl with the ingredients in it and the broth was poured at the table from a small kettle, adorable.  For our main courses, since it is a seafood restaurant I had the John Dory while Dan enjoyed the wild striped bass.  Even though we passed on the dessert, we got another nice treat - a small plate with 3 different bites of sugar.  A coconut sugar cookie, a salted caramel that tasted like a soft werther's original and a sassafras candy.  There was not one thing to complain about - it definitely is obvious what sets a 2 star michelin restaurant apart from the rest. http://notomatoesplease.…

I've been to Providence three times.  Three exceptional meals.   My last trip to Providence was over the holidays with my family -- a table of six.  I'd mentioned a couple of issues when making the reservation: my mother uses a walker, and one member of our family has celiac disease and can't eat anything with wheat.  They handled these restrictions with complete ease and elegance.  As for the meal itself, starting with the cocktails (which do take a wee bit longer than in most restaurants, since the bartender is squeezing juice and meticulously balancing your cocktail), moving on to the amuse bouche and bread (with gluten-free choices presented), wines (the sommelier offered excellent advice and choices at several price points), appetizers, entrees, and desserts (I actually prefer the a la carte menu to the tasting meal) -- there was not a single missed step.  We loved our food and the entire experience.  And while a lot of people mention the seafood, my father had the NY Strip, and it was exceptional as well. Providence really is at a different level from other restaurants in Los Angeles.  The quality of the food and service is unparalleled.  One of my family members, who lives in San Francisco, was particularly impressed with how professional and knowledgeable all of the servers were while still being personable and down to earth; that's a hard balance to strike.  I'm already looking forward to my next family visit, because everyone wants to go back to Providence. Honestly, the only negative thing I have to say about Providence is that it's kind of ruined other L.A. restaurants for me.  I have to manage my expectations going anywhere else.

Nothing really to say that hasn't already been said.  The chef's tasting menu with wine pairings ranks as one of, if not the best, dining experiences of my life.

I dined at Providence on Sunday, July 7, 2008 with my girlfriend and step-father after having heard about it in the Michelin guide. The ambience: Simply delightful.  We sat on the wonderfully temperate patio, with just the right amount of light.  The inside decor was beautiful; darkly painted beams with what looked like mushrooms or sand dollars stuck to them.   The service: Attentive, lighthearted, and pleasant.  Everyone was very nice, even helping to ensure a meatless and shelfishless special tasting menu was possible.  My girlfriend even received compliments on her shoes from the Maitre d'.  Silverware and napkins were constantly reset, and a hot cover was put on a plate while one of us was away from the table. The food: Apparently we were there during the night  that the Chef's appearance on Iron Chef debuted on TV (yes, he won).  We got the 5 course tasting menu, with fish.  The food was very good.  It was so refreshing to taste such quality food that also paid great attention to emphasizing textures, mouth feel, and temperature with every dish as well as taste.  Not only does your tongue say, "this tangy sauce compliments the turbot's light flavor so well!" it also says, "the lightly crunchy outside of the turbot is a wonderful compliment to the plump, round, smooth corn!".  The amuse bouche was also ingenious: 3 individual miniature plays on bar drinks.  A mini beer mug with saffron bottom base (I forgot what was on top, but it looked like the foam of a beer) that looked like beer, a lime mojito gellatin raviolo, and a gin and tonic gellee.  They do also cater to the meat lover as well.  The big eye tuna was so hearty and meat-like, seared perfectly, and the halibut was so perfectly slow cooked it had the appearance and juiciness of raw fish, and was so delicate and tender.  Dessert was also splendid! 5 course tasting menu: $85 pp I would go back no question!

Full review and photos in blog Providence represents for us what fine dining is all about - very creative cuisine using the best possible ingredients, extensive multi-course tasting menus, impeccable execution in the kitchen, knowledgeable and good service without being stuffy, and a relaxing ambience. For us Providence is a restaurant for special occasions but we always make sure to "find" enough opportunities so that we can visit it more than once each year. Providence has several different menu options - you can of course also order à la carte. They also offer a five course tasting menu, a full tasting menu, but every time we go to Providence we prefer to order the best way to fully experience this restaurant - the chef's tasting menu. After ordering it you simply sit back, relax and wait for good things to come. It will be a long and exciting culinary trip. Providence is located on Melrose Ave, a little but further east of Hatfield's and both Mozza restaurants. It occupies the old Patina building and has some interesting architectural features outside using wood which makes it easily recognizable. The restaurant has two dining rooms. This time we got our table in the main one. This room has mainly brown/beige colors and is a wide open space. Since we favor more private tables we often try to get one of the booth-like tables at one side of the room. The walls are decorated with barnacles and fit nicely to the seafood focus of the restaurant. We also like the lights on the tables which resemble corals. We started the night with two cocktails: Cyanide Kiss - Remy VSOP, ginger infused sake, white peach puree, licor 43, savory herb. Asian Pear Martini - Stolichnaya vanilla vodka, sake, passion fruit, monin vanilla syrup, organic pear juice. We always enjoy the cocktails at Providence which are creative and well executed. Both cocktails had a nice balance between fruitiness and alcohol. The Asian pear martini was one of the first cocktails we tried here and it is still our favorite. It's good to know that you can also get it at Copa d'Oro, the cocktail bar of former Providence mixologist Vincenzo Marianella. Providence has a very good bread selection with the bacon brioche as our highlight. Cute little scoop for the salt. 1st Amuse Bouche: Greyhound, Margarita One of the well known amuse bouche of Providence and an interesting play on spherification. Both "cocktails" tasted very much like their real versions. 2nd Amuse Bouche: Squid and chorizo Nice presentation of this simple but tasty course - very tender grilled squid and slightly salty chorizo eaten together give a good combination. 1st Course: Kanpachi, lemon, olive oil, black truffle Firm but tender/buttery kanpachi was accompanied by cucumber, some lemon and black truffle but not overpowered. The olive oil gave it an additional fruity note and the crispy rice cracker some textural counterbalance. 2nd Course: Big eye tuna, basil seeds, pickled ginger Relatively fatty but very tender, slightly seared tuna with a texture not unlike very good beef in steak tartar. We liked the slightly sour combination of pickled ginger and the crème fraiche based sauce. Similar to the first course, a cracker provided some textural variety. We also enjoyed the presentation of this dish in the earthen bowl and the wooden spoon. Pairing: Junmai dai ginjyo, kanchiku - we rarely drink sake but we thought it paired nicely to this course with its light rice taste at the beginning and some floral/fruity notes at the end. 3rd Course: Santa Barbara sea urchin served in a farm fresh egg, champagne beurre blanc, fines herbes, caviar This was one of the two courses we already had in previous tasting menus but it was a welcome repeat. The sea urchin, yolk and beurre blanc were mixed to a creamy and rich mixture whereas the salty caviar helped to cut through this richness. We wished that the taste of uni could have been a bit more pronounced. Pairing: crémant de bourgogne "blanc de blancs," domaine parigot & richard m.v. - Champagne blend which was not too dry or sweet with some apple aroma. 4th Course : Grilled Santa Barbara spot prawn, lemon, olive oil This course was the second dish we already had previously,but again we weren't sad to have it again. It was prepared by Donato Poto tableside. Many dishes at Providence are often fairly complex with many ingredients but this dish shows that simplicity can be equally satisfying. The prawns are roasted in salt and rosemary and just served with olive oil and lemon. The perfect way to eat this sweet and flavorful prawns. Pairing: Sauvignon blanc new zealand, te muna road vineyard, craggy range 2008 - Appropriate acidity for the prawns with fruit at the finish. 5th Course: Unagi and abalone, daikon, dashi, scallions Very nice combination of flavorful freshwater eel, which wasn't overly fatty, and tender

At Providence you definitely pay for what you get. We arrived early before the dinner rush, and were ushered to a nice quiet spot in the back of the restaurant, and we decided on the 5 course tasting menu. I would definitely recommend this, as it gives you some interesting options, all of which taste amazing. This is definitely a spot for big-time special occasions, and I will definitely go back, sorry can't afford $300 for 2 people every night of the week!

One of the rare restaurants in LA where the food actually justifies the cost.  The restaurant is elegant and cozy at the same time. The service is top notch. They earn their fifth star by serving filtered tap water, rather than snooty bottled water that other "fancy" restaurants coerce you into ordering.   We were in a rush to go see "Wicked" so our dinner was a bit rushed.  I would love to go back there sometime when we can actually savor our meal at leisure.

This is one of the best meals me and my fiance has ever had the privilege of having. The meal started with two amuse bouches from the chef- a screwdriver infused into a bubble, which looked like an egg yolk, and a mint julep "ice cube". Yum! We were served a metal bird's nest with an egg filled with sea urchin and egg foam, kimpachi with sea grasses, beef and fish perfectly cooked every time. We had perfectly paired glasses of wine to each course, and an amazing dessert- fudge with salt and pepper ice cream and Captain Crunch covered in chocolate. The only downside was the noise from the road, which did get pretty loud. This is an experience not just food. Completely worth the expense, and truly a night to remember.

Bf and I celebrated here.  I don't think I need to say more about the food because everyone here has said it's great, it really is.  I will talk about something else, how much I liked the spacing of the tables.  You don't sit too close to the next restaurant patron like you would at Cobras Y Matadores or like at AOC.  I hate it when we have to pay a pretty penny for a great meal and we can hear the next party's conversation.  Little things like this makes it far more enjoyable to celebrate with the significant other!

It was my brother's birthday last night and some sort of tradition has developed where we take each other out too way too expensive dinners for birthdays and this time we went to Providence.  This may have won our all time best birthday dinner contest, or at least tied a sushi place we went to on his birthday in Tokyo two years ago.  We went in with the plan to get the full tasting menu at $120 a head, but when the time came to tell the waiter we decided, money and economy be damned, my credit card is here for a reason and we let it ride and did the Chef's Tasting Menu at $160 a head (even though Chef Cimarusti isn't there on Sunday and we were in the capable hands of his sous chefs and it was Sunday and I've learned that you shouldn't get seafood on Sunday.)  We made the right decision and we embarked on a 4 hour dinner and, counting all the amouse bouches and bread course (which you have to count as a course because it had bacon in it) we had 19 things.  My brother never gets full but my stomach was buckling by the end. All of our courses have pretty much been discussed in other reviews I've seen on here, so I'll just highlight the uni on a cauliflower panna cotta with a truffle which was about the best thing I've eaten in my life.  The halibut with a sake foam was apparently sprinkled with delicious fairy dust.  The eel, foi gras, summer truffle, quail egg and mushroom gave me the sensation of swimming in a pool of gold coins and lighting a cigar with a hundred dollar bill.  The pork belly was perfect.  The desert that involved lychee sorbet, a gelee of some kind and a white chocolate soup with boba was extraordinary. The service was excellent.  Our waiter(s) were with us for the long haul and answered every bizarre question we had (yes, the building used to be an apartment building upstairs and some of the upstairs rooms are still set up like apartments.)  He complimented us at the end of the night for eating all of the food and still being wide-eyed at the end.  That wasn't hard for us, but I appreciated the compliment. The price may be high but this is the sort of meal worth saving up for.  I don't imagine I will need another meal for a few days so it all evens out.

Parking: It's easy to drive past this place so just park on Cole St. as close to Melrose as possible. You'll probably use the valet which is also on Cole since this seems like a special occasion type of place. Money: Basically, you're not spending less than $50/person here. I'd say more like $100+/person. Went for Mothers Day. Had one 5 course meal w/ wine pairing ($75 + $35) and the Dorey fish ($40 and delicious) + wine for me ($12-$20/glass). Service: The service was mediocre for the prices... well, the hostess and bread guy did their part. The waiters were really good about looking at your plates to see if you were ready for the next course, but I had to ask other servers when I wanted more water/wine and the check. My mom made a joke saying that it was "European style... you're suppose to lounge around." And somehow we were there for 2.5 hours. Summary: try the 5, 7 or 12 course dinner w/ wine pairing... you'll pay for it dearly, but it will definitely impress most and it is an experience. There are also little "extras" like the 3 shot starter and a small dessert box that they provide in addition to what you order. Though the food was prepared excellently and was easy to eat, it was generally lacking in some way. Also, the desert was mouth puckering sour... but I still ate it all. In the end, even though I had a great time, it wasn't because of the warm feeling from this place... but I'll probably be back if I want to impress someone again.

I brought my girlfriend here for her birthday and I think I scored some major points with her! We both loved the food.  We had the 9 course tasting menu and it was good!!! We had his signature dish that he beat the Iron Chef with on the show awhile back. The restaurant is definitely one of the best seafood places in LA. It is expensive but I can see why it has 2 star michelin rating. Met the chef Cimarusi after dinner and got a tour of his kitchen, he definitely takes his cooking personally.  This is why his restaurant is doing so well, because he actually cares about the food, and serving his customers excellent food. The service is great, the people working their are good.  Don't ask too many questions but they will try their best to make your dining experience great.  Also note to Chef Cimarusi, your restaurant is better than Lucques.

Where to start... from the amuse-bouche to the final petit fours the flavors in every bite were screaming. I opted NOT to do the tasting menu - everyone around us seemed to be enjoying it though - because I prefer to have a bit more control over my dining choices. The server was excellent with answers to all of our questions and a great ability to read us and personalize our service. One small hiccup was that after we arrived, we were told to have a seat at the bar for a cocktail as our table would be just a few minutes... Of course, no problem... we sat and waited patiently for the bartender to acknowledge us. and waited and waited. Now granted, she was the only one there preparing these work intensive drinks but at least eye contact or a smile - nothing. She finally took our drink orders when my boyfriend had to speak up and ask if we can order, she still didn't even look at him (or me) and said "i'll be with you in just a moment". Fine, you're busy, I get it. She mentally registered our drink orders and then we wait and waited. After a few minutes we thought she was finally preparing our drinks only to see them be carted off by a server to a table. The maitre'd finally came by to seat us and she hadn't even begun making our drinks yet... in my head I debated cancelling the order but my boyfriend graciously told her we'd take them at the table. But what's the point of a pre-dinner cocktail if we're not even gonna have it until dinner?? Now, the cocktail was VERY TASTY - I could absolutely taste her blood, sweat and tears in it. But we ordered a bottle of wine for our meal and the food began arriving and I couldn't finish my cocktail because it just took a bit too long. ho hum. The experience in general, though, phenomenal. There's a reason it's a two michelin starred restaurant!

Providence is in the highest echelons of dining in Los Angeles, or anywhere, for that matter. It is one of a handful of restaurants that has been awarded with four stars by Los Angeles and a variety of other local publications, and it is one of only four restaurants in Los Angeles that was awarded with two Michelin stars -- the highest rating given locally. But screw the ratings! You don't sit down to one of the most taste-bud blowing and memorable meals of your life to reflect on the awards your meal has received: the food speaks louder than words! The restaurant has been around a while and so the atmosphere, while lovely, did feel slightly dated. The entry and bar felt hip and modern, while the two dining rooms and outdoor dining room were more refined, with sea-inspired wall fixtures. The ceramic crustaceans that crept along the walls were stunning though the greyish-cream color of the walls and wait-staff uniforms were a little of-the-90's. Fortunately, that is where the bulk of my criticism ends -- the substance of the restaurant, the food, and the service didn't feel dated in the slightest, and with good reason: the menu changes fairly often. We entered the unassuming building, located on an isolated stretch of Melrose, to be immediately greeted by a warm host. He indicated that our table would be ready in a moment and led us to the bar. We sat down on a sofa that wasn't near the bar and I don't doubt that they rushed to prepare the table when they saw we wouldn't be engaging in a pre-dinner libation. They were quick to seat us at a prime table in the main dining room where we could gleefully people watch without notice. The restaurant was comfortable with a gentle, hushed hum of busy workers and happy clientele. Toward the end of the evening, when we were one of the few remaining groups, they allowed a little pleasant music to creep into what might have been an otherwise uncomfortably quiet dining room. I was amazed at how every detail, down to the presence of sound, was thought out in the establishment. The wait staff was impeccable, comfortably and professionally explaining the menu, every dish that was brought to our table, and regularly ensuring we were well taken care of -- without being too nosy. There was the full gamut of waitstaff that a high-end restaurant usually has -- there were probably about ninety different people that felt the need to check in with us at some point during the evening and ensure we were having the time of our lives. That number may be closer to ten, but still! You get my drift. All of this leads me to what really make this restaurant the amazing experience that it is. The food. And, actually, not just the food, but the exquisite skill of the chef, in general. We ordered the five-course tasting menu which I highly recommend. It is well worth the money and you end up spending about the same amount that you would on a regular appetizer and entree. Apparently they also have ten and 15 course tasting menus which completely boggles my mind. My stomach was sagging lower that the Queen's arms after we finished off our seemingly endless meal and that was just the five course! You would have to be Takeru Kobayashi to finish that madness. In any case, we sampled the Rubarberella which is a take on a Martini, and another cocktail that was a take on a Mint Julep. Both were delicious aperitifs though I thought the Julip was really phenomenal -- a must try for anyone who likes Bourbon. After a few minutes, a gentleman arrives and explains their bread options -- we tried a kind of nori encrusted foccacia and a bacon brioche. Both were great but the brioche was mind blowing. I'll probably get flak for comparing it to a McDonald's breakfast sandwich but that's what it tasted like! I'm probably committing some kind of heresy here but I dare you to find someone who doesn't adore McDonald's breakfast sandwiches -- and the presence of such a sinfully delightful treat as mere pre-meal bread was definitely a good omen. So I know I said that this is where the madness begins before but this is where it really begins. I'm getting out of control here but I was just astounded at the generosity of the chef -- we had a THREE COURSE AMUSE BOUCHE (?!?!?!?)! In all my years of dining, I haven't ever seen such an unbridled display of food love on behalf of the unbelieved generosity of the chef! It pains me to curtail my review because (and I haven't ever done this before) but apparently I reached Yelp's maximum number of words! Briefly: after the cocktails, the three amuse bouches, four courses, a delicious and unexpected cucumber gelato palate cleanser, and the final dessert course, we were even brought out another trio of little desserts just to finish off the evening. I can say that, without reservation, this was one of the best meals of my life. It would take Leonardo DiCaprio to do a little Inception-style espionage in order to get me to forget how amazing this experience was!

Wow. There are times when I get taken away. Transported? No. I never left my seat. Glued to it. Transfixed. Well, not entirely true, but I did have a really wonderful experience. My friend Mollie texted me out of the blue yesterday to see if I wanted to have a dinner adventure. You never really know what that will entail with Mollie- Could be Ghetto tacos, or Ethiopian Gelato, or Afghani Froyo. After a brief discussion, we decided on one of the three, Two Michelin Star restos in LA, Providence. I'd never eaten there, and have been really wanting to go for a long time. Free corkage Monday nights made it a necessity. Mollie brought a Champagne Rose, and a Slutty Australian Viognier. We went with the Champagne. And I brought an '02 Meursault-Charmes "Les Dessus" from Antonin Guyon. Both of 'em, STUNNING. The Champagne was light on it's feet, but substantial, and the Meusault was an inspiration, a learning experience. The Guyon was almost restrained at first, not showing too much on the intro, even a bit coy, but then, wow did it open up on the finish, maybe one of the best White Burg finishes I've ever experienced. Mollie and I both did the tasting menu, in fact, we did one five course menu, and one full tasting menu, which overlapped perfectly. Really have to hand it to these guys, the service was perfect from start to finish, and I have to definitely put this down as the best restaurant experience I've had in LA to date...

Went for my girl's milestone b-day (she won't let me say which). Won't repeat everyone else's praise/issues but we got the 5 course tasting plus added one more - with wine pairing. We got: - 2 gougere (sp?) - excellent - Kanpachi - very good - Divers scallop - this and the sweet riesling were the favorite of the night - Halibut - this had a tiny side of purred sunchoke, which I had never had before but was good - Salmon w/pork belly wrapper - pretty tasty! - Veal tenderloin - was prepared by sous-vide method - I liked it but it was strange (Sous vide is a type of vacuum cooking - basically putting the food in a sealed bag to cook in heated water for extended periods - my first time trying it!) - Chocolate cremaux - the salt & pepper ice cream was interesting but the mousse part looked like (my 6 year old cousin would say) doody rolls. And not that good either. The port that came with this round was also not my cup of tea. Excellent service, excellent bread, premium prices ($400 total). But totally worth it!

Fantastic place. The food, the decor, everything. We got the tasting menu. I thought it was a bargain (hard to believe given how expensive it was, and how often I use the words "pricey" and "spendy" in my other reviews). I've easily paid 2-3x as much for inferior food in NYC.

came in on valentine's day,  wife and i went with the 7 course + premium wine pairing. arrived 15 minutes late and the manager offered my wife and I the opportunity to sit at the chef's table...of course we jumped on it with hesitation. its soundproof, intimate, and an experience. you get to see how in unison the staff are when it comes to arranging their masterpieces- professional, clean, and efficient. i won't comment on the flawless execution on the food or the pairings because enough has been said. i will comment though, on how down to earth exec chef, Michael Cimarusti is. He dropped in to visit our (his) table and talk about the inspiration behind the food, heavily influenced from his experiences during his frequent trips to Japan. We talked about whiskies, beer, and fish lol...it was an honor to pick apart his brain for the 10-15 minutes he spent with us. my wife teased me because i acted like a 2001 teenybopper at a nsync concert when i got mr cimarusti's autograph along with a picture with us.

We went here for my birthday.  I was hoping to find a solid occasion restaurant.  We had the 5 course (or maybe 9?)  tasting menu with wine pairings.  The food was okay, not memorable, nothing to write home about, you get the point. The restaurant is right on the street.  You can hear cars drive by while you eat.  Also they allowed a baby to sit right next to us.  Some European tourists thought it would be okay to bring their kid.  Service was decent, but not top-notch.  I would try it again, if forced.

EVER. TASTED. all i could say was omg after every bite.  asian pear martini was a little too vanilla-y. lobster risotto was very very good. sea bass was delicious. sigh. and we didn't even try the tasting menu. yet.

I'm giving a 3 for now.  I'd like to go again to raise my rating but for now, I can't give a 4, here's why.  Service, excellent,  although a high end restaurant, the servers didn't make us feel out of place, although I kinda was.  I had the 'Chowda' and Prime New York Steak with Asparagus.  I'll be honest, presentation, fantastic, but I'm not a foo foo kinda diner, I'm a results kinda diner.  If I'm going to pay for a Prime cut of beef, and although NY is not my favorite choice, Ribeye or Filet are, it was all they had on the menu, I'm expecting more.  Well they had Wagyu but I wasn't about that, maybe next time!  Right.  Anyway, The NY was cooked perfect but it sure didn't seem like a Prime grade, it seemed more like a lower grade!  Tough, chewy, just didn't seem right for a Prime cut.  Now, I know this was NY steak, not filet or ribeye, but for Prime, I'm expecting top billing!  The Asparagus, overcooked, almost mushy, 2 pieces and I didn't even care to finish it, and I love asparagus.  The 'Chowda' however, was fantastic, I'd go back just for that, and order 2 servings!  Dessert, excellent.   So, although I can't go 4 stars, I have to go 3.  Bottom line, I've made better steaks and asparagus at home.  I can't pay that kinda $$$ if I've made better.  I'll go again, when the wallet is full again and give it a go again!

You get what you pay for. Yes it's spendy, but from the moment you enter the drinks, food, service and ambiance... it's all worth it. I usually take pics of my food to share, but I felt a bit lame busting out my phone in this place. They sat us in the middle of the room and there was definitely an older crowd that night. I felt them starring at us "young people" and thinking, "Oh how sweet they saved up their allowance to come here on a date...". Maybe just my paranoia. Anyways, you leave feeling full and talking about all the amazing things this place has to offer. It's an experience you can't miss.

This place is everything you could want and more if you are a serious foodie. It is definitely 5 stars plus. The setting is relaxing with earth tones, the service is impeccable without being snooty, and the food...oh my! Be sure and get something with the black truffles...to die for! :) Definitely recommend, but it is not cheap, that's for sure. If you want a spectacular dinner in LA and don't mind paying for, this is your place.

Providence is one of only three restaurants in Los Angeles that received a two star Michelin rating in 2009 so I was very excited to try it out (too bad they discontinued the LA guide). We started with the foie gras sauté and foie gras ravioli - both were excellent! I'm already looking forward to going back just to indulge in the foie gras. Yum. For my entrée, I ordered the  wild black bass which I thoroughly enjoyed. A nice touch was the amuse-bouche they presented which were really fun and creative although I forget what they were exactly. I can't wait to go back.

Amazing food - perfect preparation and beautiful plating.  Off the charts cheese cart. We did the chef's tasting menu.  It took us 4+ hours to get through it which is too long for me.  I have to notch this place due to the spotty service.  There were several long gaps where we didn't see a server for 20 minutes or more.  At this level such a thing should not happen.

Am I the only one in town who hasn't done the tasting menu here?  I did have the uni in an eggshell treat off the tasting menu, but then moved on to the turbot for two.  Very nice tableside presentation and very rich, perfectly cooked, yummy fish.  The mumbai cocktail is also a definite winner.  However, I was surprised that they have two michelin stars.  I have to believe that the standards are simply different here, than in Europe.  Don't get me wrong, I had a wonderful time - the food was delicious, the service attentive, and the room beautiful.  Its just not quite what I expected - more casual, I guess.  All-in-all, a great time was had, and I'd do it again in a heart beat.

Based on two visits - The first visit was awesome.   it was in January.  Seafood being my favorite food, I had been wanting to go to this restaurant.  I invited a friend, and we had the scallops (Providence is one of 20 restaurants in the country to get these scallops), spaghetti a la chitarra (they make spaghetti of the best consistency) with fresh black truffles, and a John Dory dish.  I normally don't like scallops but these babies were perfect.  And the spaghetti was exquisite, a beautiful blend of truffles and parmesan.  Simple in ingredients, complex in aroma, all-in-all evocative.  The fish was cooked well and the pairings were done well - nothing mind-blowing but solid.   I think the server's name was Joshua - he was attentive without being disruptive and was very polite.  The manager that night was Matthew, I think - jolly guy, came out and shaved the truffle himself, made conversation and said hello to everyone - we had a lovely time.   5 stars. The second visit was below expectations and far below even the precedence. This was in May.  My mentor took me out to dinner for my birthday - to the restaurant I had raved about, of course.  We went in a group of three and started with a Japanese sweet fish (Ayu) and had the black bass and spaghetti a la chitarra with lobster and Santa Barbara uni.  The ayu was solid although nothing spectacular, the black bass was cooked perfectly and the spaghetti, also, but something was missing from that latter dish.  It needed a kick or a bite or something memorable of some sort.   But what was really unfortunate this time was that the service wasn't there.  The server not only didn't pay attention but had this snooty air about him.  Really?  Thanks, guy.  For my birthday dinner, too.   One thing to note - cake cutting fee is $6 pp. Apparently our waiter told my friend this and she had said she'd wait to cut the cake - but he later confused me with her and said in front of the manager that he had told me about the cake cutting fee but I had declined.  This created a rather awkward situation for my friends and me.  And what are you saying, we all look alike?  And the manager that night, too - or who seemed to be the manager - I guess I expected a little more class and generosity from someone at the face of a restaurant claiming such caliber, especially after it was pretty clear that we were not happy with how the waiter had communicated (or didn't) with us. So 3 stars for the food that night minus 1 star for the experience: 2 stars. Which results in 3.5 stars on average. I do have to say that their amuse bouche is really yummy (at least what they've been doing this year thus far) - a ceviche-esque concoction with house-cured fish, a soy marshmallow (not a fan of this one) and a cheese puff of gruyere.  The cocktail I tried was good, too.  Surprised that the amuse bouche hadn't changed over the quarters though (it had been 4 months since my last viisit!). So I liked my first experience and didn't like my second.  That makes me sad because I had proudly called it my favorite restaurant in LA for four months.  Alas, the search continues :(

This restaurant has provided me with the most decadent and innovative tastings I have ever experienced. I am a dessert junkie and have come here for two dessert tastings. The menu is always changing and getting better. One of my favorite dishes from my most recent dessert tasting was the tangerine sorbet tube which was filled with a creme anglais type sauce. This was topped with an olive brittle, a tangerine reduction and sectioned tangerine slices. All of the desserts are provocative and push boundaries. The wine pairings are DEVINE, it is totally worth it to spend the extra cash if you have it. A mainstay on the dessert tasking menu is the mojito. The mojito is an orb of jelly which is filled with a tangy mojito juice. When you bite down on it, it explodes and fills your mouth with its delicious juice. Also, the decor is beautiful, the walls are a really soft grey and it looks like there are white mushrooms growing up into the upper corners, very elegant. Service is beyond any I have ever received, the staff is very attentive but they do not hover. The overall experience is fabulous.

I was not blown away by Providence like I had expected to be.  Maybe it was because they sat us towards the back and the server didn't come to check up on us as often as I'm used to.  Everything was good but nothing really stood out.  I liked Water Grill so much better, and this was after the star chef left.  *shrug*  I probably won't go back; been there, done that.

My parents and I came here Saturday night to celebrate my father's 62nd birthday, and it was wonderful. We all got the 9-course tasting menu, but with wine pairings, which is something we've never done before. The food was phenomenal, and the wine pairings were great as well, because we got to taste and experience a variety of wines outside of what my father has in his wine cellar. An amuse bouche was served at the beginning which consisted of the chef's two jellied takes on mixed drinks (gin and tonic, mojito) as well as an extremely flavorful carrot soup. 1st course - Raw Japanese kanpachi, served raw with endive and rice cakes in a cream sauce. Paired with a tasty txakoli from the Basques region of Spain that we had never heard of. 2nd course - Sea urchin and egg in a beurre blanc. The acidity of the wine (cremant de Bourgogne) cut the creaminess of the food, providing a nice contrast. 3rd - Hokkaido sea scallop, served in in a very acidic bacon sauce. In this case, the effect of the wine pairing was exactly the opposite, and the acidity of the food really brought out the sweetness of the wine. 4th course - Halibut served with burdock root, and a crispy anchovy for salt and texture. 5th course - Salmon served with turnips, peas, lemon/ginger sauce. This was the one wine pairing that didn't really work in this meal. The rosé that was served had a nice smoky taste that echoed the smokiness of the crisp salmon skin that was served, but overall, wasn't strong enough to stand up to the bold salmon flavor. A big red wine would have worked much better. 6th course - Veal tenderloin. A great cut of meat, very tender. 7th course - Market cheeses. There are some delicious cheeses on their cart (a blue from Oregon was my favorite), and they're served with fruit jellies, figs, nuts, and bread. The gewurtztraminer that was paired with it was great. 8th course - Cucumber sherbert, with kaffir and juniper berries. 9th course - Miso cheesecake with peaches, sesame, and a cassis sauce. It was a little salty for my taste, and a little odd. I'm not sure if I really liked this dessert. Paired with a muscato d'asti. This did turn out to be the most expensive meal my parents and I have ever had, but I will say that it was well worth it. The food was delicious, and featured many unusual flavor pairings, as well as good use of texture. My favorite course was the sea scallop - it was probably the best scallop I've ever had (seared, almost crispy on the outside, but cooked perfectly on the inside), and the sauce was delicious. I almost wish I'd had a spoon for the sauce! The wine pairings were great as well, and you could tell the sommelier had spent a lot of time finding wines that would complement or contrast the dishes. I don't have the money for it, but if someone else were paying for it, I would come back here in a heartbeat! No hesitation.

It was rated as "Best Seafood" in LA last year and I think it's way over-rated.  The decor and the service are top notch but the food is just ok.  I think their seafood is decent and I like their Foie Gras but i don't think it lives up to the hype at all.

I'm most definitely in the minority here and i really wish i wasn't.  I have been dying to try Providence for a long time and finally made it thanks to our friends Lisa and Robert.  I'll cut to the chase in the beginning here and then give some more descriptions.   I contemplated 3 or 4 stars is because i was expecting 5 and it didn't deliver to the high expectations.  5 stars for service, 5 stars for decor, but really only 3 for the food because it wasn't blow-me-out-of-the water amazing.  And really, the overall 3 stars is because I'm slightly disappointed and won't really go back to spend the money on something i wasn't completely obsessed with. The decor and lighting take you to sandy cave complete with "barnacle" covered walls and ceiling.  It feels as though you should be in an aquarium with water glimmering above your head. Our service was impeccable as each waiter was well versed in the preparation of our courses, ingredients and wine pairings. We chose the 5 course tasting menu with wine.  The wines delivered scored probably 4 out of  5 in my book.  One white i didn't care too much for, but don't worry, i drank it!  The best items on our menu were the last courses of veal and dessert with stone fruit.  I wanted to like all the seafood dishes more, as seafood is "my thing".  As perfectly prepared and presented as the dishes were, i wanted more flavor or layers of flavor.  Maybe it is just my palette, always wanting something crazy.  Most of the dishes were very delicate with light, creamy sauces, mushrooms, greens, etc. You definitely tasted the flavor of the scallop, hamachi, and halibut, but i wanted to taste something a little more in the dish.  I have to compare to Hatfields as that tasting menu is amazing.  So all in all, it was good, but not up to par with Hatfields.

What can i say about Providence that hasn't already been said?  Michael Cimarusti is an absolute genius.  I had the best meal of my life here when I had the 9 course tasting menu with wine pairing.  The food is mostly seafood, but even if you're not a big fan of seafood, I would encourage everyone to try it at least once.  It might change the way you view and eat seafood forever.  Thanks for the great meal and I can't wait to go back.

So last night we ventured out to West LA to try this great restaurant called Providence.  We were really excited since it had received such rave reviews by fellow yelpers plus it was Michelin rated.  We were somewhat disappointed. We too ordered the 9 course tasting menu.  The food was good, but not AMAZING.  The service was good, but NOT impeccable.  Please note that we are basing this review against other restaurants that we have tried that are similar to Providence such as Bouley or Cielo.   For a 4 $$$$ plus 2 Michelin star rated restaurant, the service I expected was let down.  Maybe it's because I'm a New Yorker or maybe it's because Providence is New American and Bouley is French; therefore the mannerisms of the staff is bit more casual than I expected.  We sat in the smaller dining room with 2 bigger tables of 4 and 6 and 2 tables of 2.  These caliber restaurants should have impeccable service and the service in the smaller dining rooms are usually even more micromanaged, but overall the experience was below par.   However, for LA, I would say it's alright and prolly a dining experience for many Angelenos.  I'm not a SNOB, just honest in my opinion and from my experience.  I would recommend GRACE or Cielo or AOC instead. BTW:  unless you like to drink diesel, stay away from the drink ARSENAL!!!

One of four restaurants in Los Angeles with two (well deserved) michelin stars. All the seafood at Providence is amazingly good. I've never had anything less than a stellar meal here. I had the john dory on the waiter's recommendation last visit, which was predictably awesome. The fois gras ravioli is excellent, and makes a nice counterpoint to a fish main course. Great service, helpful and informative without being condescending. Top notch all around.

It's been all said in the other reviews - the tasting menu is exactly the same for awhile I guess. Really underwhelmed with the whole place from the bizarre decor to the bad neighborhood it's in to the unnecessary charge for the valet. The food ranged from good to just OK. They even tried to give us a really bad table in a side room until we said something - the place wasn't even full. It wasn't too expensive I guess ($315 for two) and the coffee was awesome. Michelin 2 stars? Never trust the French.

This place is expensive!! But every penny is worth it! Dinner for 2, course meal paired with wine will come out to about $400-500. My husband took me here on my birthday and the night we proposed.

If you're a food snob who loves good wine, this place is an absolute must!! :)

Faultless! I had high hopes for Providence and it didn't disappoint! My husband and I arrived 30 minutes late and they were very accommodating. We chose the full 9-course tasting menu, not including an amuse bouche and after dessert coffee pairings. Everything was absolutely delicious, specifically the baked egg yolk uni in eggshell, the perfectly seared veal, and of course, the jaw-dropping cheese cart. At $110pp, it's definitely a splurge, but absolutely worth it! I normally never go to an American ("New" or not) restaurant and order seafood because they rarely get it right but Cimarusti knows his fish, inside and out. I will absolutely return!

This review is long overdue. I hate to give Providence 3 stars but on my second visit to Providence we spent 4 hours waiting for 5 courses. There were 6 of us. My guests are steak kinda people, they had never been to a restaurant like Providence.  I really hyped this place up for them. My friends don't eat pork so we had to change some of the ingredients in the tasting menu. It took forever for each dish. I was so embarrassed and ashamed. There was a 25 minute gap between courses. I visited the night before with my boyfriend. We had the greatest dinner, but I don't think I will bring a big party again to Providence. I will definitely be back but I will be back for the new tasting menu. I didn't enjoy the tasting menu the second time around. I was to worried about my guests. The waiter was excellent. He did the best he could to keep us happy between courses.

I really hate reading reviews of other people's dining experiences when they had amazing service at this restaurant.  The jealousy of missing out on a great dining experience haunts me.  I am willing to give them a second try. What I experienced was, a relatively cold ambiance and average overall service.  The food was good but not amazingly, earth-shatteringly, great. The bartender actually knew what she was doing and was able to maintain a pleasant conversation, unlike the typical LA bartender who thinks they know it all and don't. (anyone with half a brain can pour a gin and tonic.)  The food got 2.5 stars with the bartender pushing it to a three.  Here's to their second chance!

Totally bougie, but worth every penny. J surprised me and took me out for my birthday dinner here and both of us were blown away. We were there for almost three hours to enjoy the five course tasting menu. Oh and with the wine pairing, of course. The staff were all very professional and very knowledgable about the entire menu. Seems like an obvious thing, but you'd be surprised at some places that have staff serving the food that are completely oblivious  as to what is being served.   We started out with a glass of prosecco, seaweed bread and bacon bread. Heavenly? Absolutely. (At this point I thought my boyfriend was the one that told them to put bacon in the bread.) The waiter then brought out this beautifully plated parsnip soup with Parmesan foam and bread with a frozen mojito and orange screwdriver. Brilliant. I won't go on and on about each course, but every single one was paired  so perfectly with wine and plated so nicely that I didn't even want to eat it!  Each course looked like a work of art. It's hard for me to single out what I loved most about the evening because the entire restaurant was wonderful in every sense of the word. Details, people. It's all in the details. J joked with me and said we'd probably have to hit up McDonald's afterwards just in case the portions were too small. But we were definitely so full of wine and food afterwards. All I know is that I want to eat like that every day, every meal.

I ordered the five course tasting menu and was completely satiated by evening's end. The staff was incredibly warm and inviting and I would say that the atmosphere is more laid back than Melisse. The chef was accommodating to my Wheat allergy and was quite knowledgeable about items that contained wheat and gluten. A special dessert was even prepared for my table due to the allergy. Although all the plates were utterly delicious, I wish that restaurants like Providence would serve a bit more green vegetables, as they only include a scattering of leaves per plate. My main complaint would be the slightly tacky lighting that is strung along the facade and the seashells that adorn the interior walls and ceilings.

Yes, Providence really is THAT good.  I had the Valentine's Day 7-course menu, and it was one of the best meals I've ever had.  I experienced 2.5 hours of great, attentive service and incredible food.  Most of the dishes were seafood based and phenomenally flavored and plated, but I was also blown away by the tender, well-seasoned duck breast course.  They also offer a large cheese cart (separate from the multiple course menu) which I couldn't resist, and I appreciated being able to take home whatever I wasn't able to finish during my meal.  Everything I had looked beautiful and contained layers of creative flavors, and I savored every bite from the amuse bouche all the way to the dessert.  Even the end-of-dinner macaroon was one of the best I've had.   And the bread was surprisingly excellent too (I couldn't get enough of the seaweed foccacia and bacon brioche even though I knew I was breaking the rule of not filling up on bread!).  The meal is pricey, but being able to sample multiple courses really makes the most of the Providence experience.  I'm looking forward to returning for the 15-course chef's tasting menu which I've heard takes 3+ hours and stuffs you to the gills.  The food and dining experience are definitely worth the price!

Providence.  A small on the outside, but deceptively large restaurant with elegant decorations, soft lighting and modern rock quietly playing in the background. B52's "rock lobster" was perfect for this place I thought as I was seated at the table, but somehow I still felt a bit underdressed (slacks, dress shoes, hawaiian shirt, leather blazer).  This place exudes elegance. Parking is either by valet ($5.50) or on the street.  Ample street parking east of the restaurant on Melrose after 6pm.  Just be careful opening the driver side doors because the parking is on the street and otherwise doubles as a lane of traffic.   Once in the restaurant, you walk past a nicely laid out bar, which appears to be well stocked, and are immediately seated in a cozy room, tables covered in well-placed white table cloths and padded-fabric covers the walls.   Wait staff are well dressed in shirt and ties, and serve in a traditionally classic fashion, where you are seated, and when you return from a leave of the table, your napkin is neatly folded for you.  Silverware for your next course is discreetly placed for you. Breads offered included a bacon brioche, classic roll, or Focaccia.  The focaccia was soft and cool, quite flavorful.   Wait staff traditionally started each meal with an amuse-bouche, compliments of the chef.  The amuse-bouche was exquisite.  It consisted of a puff pastry stuffed with creme fraiche and trout belly, a delectable bite; a molecular gastronomy concoction with passion fruit and carrot soup served in a shot glass, and a marinated shrimp, skewered, all served in a granite slate.   There are multiple menu options, but the most intriguing of course options are the chef's tastings with or without wine pairings. Sommelier selected, there are wonderful pairings for each of the 5, 9, or 14! course selections. Of course the a la carte dining options are superb as well. I ventured into the a la carte menu to explore different elements of the menu.  Food is creatively spiced with impeccable plating and presentation. The "chowda" is highly recommended, an elegant chowder of clams, bacon, potato, and gentle spices/vegetables.  Each bite was flavorful and rich, but not overwhelmingly so.  Next was the Maine lobster, 1.5 pound females chosen and served shelled.   Vadouvan is used to impart an exotic flavor of curry and spice, and it really works.  It is paired with baby carrots and turnips, also seasoned with the curry.  Dessert consisted of a play on the famous "Seinfeld" episode where the phrase "These pretzels are making me thirsty" was uttered throughout.  Had to try it! It consisted of more molecular gastronomy elements including a peanut butter powder, exquisite chocolate ganache and chocolate-dipped pretzel sticks. All are centered around a dollop of beer ice cream (and foam) which was very flavorful and paired well with the other elements on the plate.   More enjoyment was had watching the chef's menu, brought out in courses, being served at other tables. All members of the party must participate in this multiple-course offering as requested by the knowledgeable wait staff. One stunning course is the cheese cart, packed with numerous selections of cheeses from the mild to the stinky varieties, soft to crumbly, rich to bland. Fruit jams and crackers are offered, and the table selects which cheeses are desired which are then served by the waiter. Desserts were pairings of chocolate rice cocoa puffs, cherries and a salt and pepper ice cream. Exotically flavored ice creams are the chef's specialty. Petit fours finished the meal and consisted of a lemon/beer jelly, a rosemary caramel, and a chocolate marshmallow.  My wife, who specializes in preparing homemade gourmet marshmallows was particularly impressed. Occasionally, the room flickered with flash photography as each dish begged to be captured eternally in it's original presentation, but the dimly lit restaurant led to poorly exposed images by the standard cell/pocket camera. All in all, if you are looking for a frutti di mare culinary journey, look no further than Providence!

I totally forgot to review this place, but I came here with my boyfriend on Valentine's Day. For $150/person we got a 7 course meal. For an addition $30, we got a box of chocolates made from Providence. Every course was beautiful but small. Of course, you're paying for the ambience and presentation, but the food tasted good too. They were mainly seafood dishes. It was one of the nicest restaurants I've been to.

This is a very late post.  I went back in June.   So obviously it's so late it's probably dead...haha.   Anyway, got the 12-course chef's tasting menu.  Everything was pretty good.  The Lychee Sorbet  on Passionfruit with coconut  was very good and inventive.  Basil seeds as boba?  Who does that?  Very nice.   Service was impeccable and the waiter explained every dish thoroughly.

get the CHEF 7 course dinner! you won't regret it. Every dish has a theme and comes with wonderful presentation. If you like cheese, you'll love this place. They'll bring out at least 20 different kind of cheese for you to choose from. Yummy Seafood...in my opinion, better than Water Grill. With wine pairing, dinner came out to be $400. And you will be FULL after this. The portions are just enough to taste and want more, but you will never think you're getting too much.

The ambience, food and service are truly excellent, but this place is definitely overpriced.  We enjoyed ourselves but left hungry after the $90 five course prix fixe.  Dinner for 4 (without alcohol) was $500.  Definitely a special occasion spot, and we will most likely not return.  Still, the food here is a work of art and deserves 5 stars.

Michael Cimarusti, contestant of Top-chef Master, present well designed 16-course chef menu.  The focus in Beauty, Texture, and Flavor gave us a beautiful dinning experience.  Dessert is full of creativity.  Outstanding job done by Adrian Vasquez.  Worth just going for late-night dessert.  Restaurant manager Donato Poto skillfully recovered well from its 30 min late service.  Wine list is very small though.

Oh boy, where do I start? The BF and I dined here a week ago....we ordered the 9 course meal...other people who dined here around the same time as me will give you better explanations of the dishes so I will cover the gist of it.  No wine pairing, because I have a self imposed 1 drink limit (asian red-face/low tolerance) and BF doesn't want that much wine, plus he drove. The 9 course meal is really closer to an 11 course meal due to the amuse bouche and sweet treats at the end.  I ordered a cocktail and Ben ordered a single glass of wine.   The service was great throughout the meal.  One of the guys explaining the dishes has a bit of a low voice, but that's ok.  The decor was beautiful, not stuffy.  We were seated in the room with a window to the wine room. bread: nori bread was my fave.  bacon brioche was tasty but a little too rich for me. amuse bouche: gin+tonic, margarita, smoked trout.  the mini-cocktails were done in a molecular gastronomy way and the trout was one of my favorites of the night; the yuzu gelee really complemented the trout well.  I loved everything on the plate. kampachi: delicate, light, awesome. seared scallop: scallop slightly overcooked.  diced eggplant and sauce underneath made me want to lick the plate. uni/egg yolk(?): presented in an egg shell.  I love me some uni, but the flavors didn't stand out enough.   Halibut: don't remember what else was on the plate but the fish was perfection. Salmon w/ asparagus and some white foam (low talker explained this one): again, perfection. Woah, why is this not a 5 star review?  Hmmm, first 5 dishes were all 4.5-5 star.  Next dish was veal.  We have never eaten veal.  Veal tasted okay, kind of porky.  portion was a bit big, we are getting full.  I decided to not finish the veal and instead, gobble up the morels on the plate because I am a mushroom freak.   This is right around the time I finish my cocktail and decide to stick with the water.  Cheese cart comes out.  I LOVE CHEESE!  We let the server chose our cheese because we love all cheese.  progression from goat to sheep to cow.  The goat cheese is great, mild.  The sheepsmilk cheese is a little funky but good.  The raw cow's milk cheese is good but also funky.  I have eaten raw cheese before, no problem.  I decide I need a palate cleanser and reach for the accompaniments on the cheese plate.  One of the fruit compotes had whole peppercorns in it, causing me to drink lots of water.  Right about now, I feel weird, a feeling I have not had in quite some time.  Am I drunk?  No, just one drink.....I am full though...the room is spinning...I almost barfed!  Thankfully, I was able to regain composure.  I don't know how I did it, but I managed to taste the 2 last dishes: tarragon blood orange sorbet with yogurt (amazing, I will try to recreate this), and yuzu curd w/ a berry sorbet and meringues.  The snacks at the end were wrapped salted caramels, meringue sandwich cookies, and little nougat squares.  We ate the salted caramels the next day: delicious! I did not think I would get so full so fast.  My first 9 course menu.  Next time, I will order a la carte.  I don't blame Providence for me almost puking during dinner but I must say, I have not puked in 25 years.  My usual iron stomach was not present that day.  I will need to work overtime to afford to dine here again.

See Ann's review below. My experience (and the menu) was exactly the same. I wouldn't go back, but it was nice to have tried it. Food was solid, but I didn't gasp in delight. What was beautiful, however, was the dining room. I could have sat there for hours just taking it in. Service was excellent also, which is as it should be for such a restaurant. If you have a very special occasion (graduation, anniversary, maybe even a romantic birthday dinner), it's a good place to check out.

Fantastic!  Everything on the five course menu was delicious.  I have this thing where I prefer not to go back to a Michelin restaurant after trying it, because there's others on the list.  However, Providence is one where I'd love to come back and splurge for the full tasting or chefs menu.

What a way to start the NEW YEAR! That was the idea. Having a fabulous dinner in mind, we selected Providence. AND.. we were not disappointed. This reminds me of Commanders Palace in New Orleans. The service was top notch and the display of entrees were immaculate. The Asian pear Martini was not too strong and not too sweet. And the starch queen,  New Year's resolution was not about to cut down on the carbs, had the server put 2 bread rolls on my bread plate. Started with the Lobster appetizer, which was a nice portion lobster tail curled in a ball, with small chunks of lobster surrounding the plate, followed with the Pork Belly. Expecting a bit sweeter and savory pork belly, I still ate the whole plate. Finished with the Banana Bread pudding. Ewh!, not my favorite, but I needed something sweet to top off the meal. Providence is a place you could dine on special occasions or with special dinner guests. We were there for 2 1/2 hours, which was fine, but it's not a LA dinning place where you eat and run, especially if you have tickets to a show or an event. You really want to enjoy the whole experience from the service and the presentation it's definitely a show by itself!

The first time I came here was five years ago, and I remembered being blown away by the food and service.  It was such a memorable dining experience that I decided to dine here again with my friend a few months ago while we were visiting LA. The decor was how I remembered it, barnacle sculptures across the wall.  I didn't like them five years ago, and I still don't like them now.  I know it's keeping with the theme of the restaurant, but aesthetically speaking, they're rather unsightly.   We started off with cocktails, which we ordered from the bar while we were waiting to be seated.  I ordered the Asian Pear Martini, which was delicious.  Through the recommendation of the sommelier, my friend ordered something from the wine menu, which she also enjoyed. For the amuse bouche, we were served a lil shot glass w/ salmon topped w/ caviar, rice balls, and gold flakes.  Each taste of this was just bursting w/ unexpected flavor.  There wasn't much of it, and it made me want more.  Next we were given rum n coke and lemon drop in gelatinous form, served on some spoons.  They were such a pleasant surprise, especially the lemon drop, which just pops in your mouth.   For appetizers, the highlights were the Santa Barbara spot prawns and the uni egg.  The spot prawns came with a show...okay not really a show.  A guy rolls a table out with the prawns and scrapes the salt off the prawns while you watch.  It seemed rather tedious actually, so much so that my friend joked, "Why didn't they just give you a little brush, like the ones archaeologists use?".  The guy was like, "you know, that's a great idea!".  So note to Providence, give your servers some little brushes.  Back to the prawns, they were probably the best prawns I've ever had.  I wish there were more of them lil guys.  Next was the uni egg....AMAZING.  I shared this with my friend...man, I wish I didn't have to share it...it was that good...I wanted my own...seriously, no sharing next time.  After that, was the foie gras ravioli w/ shaved summer truffles.  The name of the dish sounds amazing, but to be honest, it was good, but nothing extraordinary.  For the main course, I had the veal, which was just perfectly tender.  The meal ended w/ complimentary desserts (macarons, some green gelatin candy, and something else I can't remember)...that were really rather unexceptional.  Maybe we should have ordered a dessert from the menu, but we were already quite full at that point. As for service, our server was attentive as a waiter should be, but was rather stiff and one might even say cold.  Not that he was unfriendly, but he wasn't friendly.  If that makes any sense.  What peeved me the most was that towards the end of the night he had disappeared and a new server started attending to us.  They should inform you when switching servers on you.  Even servers at chain restaurants tell you that they'll be off soon and that another server will be taking their place.  I would expect that a restaurant of this caliber, should do the same, out of courtesy if not for anything else.  Honestly though, our second server (his name was Hoang, I believe) was wayyy better.  What a delightful, friendly, and laid-back guy.  He was hilarious and really lightened the mood of the restaurant.  I'm glad our night ended w/ him as our server.   All in all, it was a good dining experience, although not as good as I had remembered it the first time around.  The total for the two of us came out to be about $250 (not including tip).  Would I come here a third time?  Sure, why not.  They didn't get two Michelin stars for nothing.

Because of my sleeping 2 yr old niece they put us at the Chef's Table that was a private room!! We had the 9 course tasting menu and if we had the time would have done the Chef's Tasting Menu. Our server allowed us to replace some of our desserts with other desserts from the menu. Sounds weird but all I can say is Salt & Pepper Ice Cream! Great Birthday Dinner!!

3.5 stars. i was seriously expecting an epic meal but the meal fell a bit short of my expectations :( service was quite excellent, however. we decided to go with the 9 course meal. bread- seafood foccaia was eh. the sourdough roll was tough. the bacon brioche was good. do they make this with bacon fat? cause there were no pieces of bacon. the amuse buche of mojito something and screwdriver something were quite nice. they were impressive. we were excited for what was to come. this was followed by an amuse bouche of sunchoke soup, some cheese puff and salmon something. the excitement started building. then we got the japanese konpachi with champagne geelee. this was okay. i didn't really like the fish. then we got sea urchin with scrambled eggs and brioche bread crumbs. this was delicious! probably the highlight of the meal. the next course was scallop. this was okay. then we got a piece of sea bass. this was cooked well but i dont remember what it was paired with. then we got the artic charr which was just meh for me. then we got a piece of veal with a pea puree. i pretty much hated this course. the pea puree was gross and the veal was meh. we had the server pick out the cheeses for us and they were all too mild. plus they give you only 2 pieces of candied walnuts and one piece of preserved fig. why?? then we had slices of fennel with some pieces of yogurt. this was another that i didn't like at all. then the dessert of chocolate was absolutely anticlimatic. the chocolate mousse had a bitter aftertaste, the small piece of chocolate cake was crunchy? and the garnish of coconibs and dehydrated raspberries was like wtf? it wasn't a cohesive dessert. didn't taste good either. the candy (caramel, marshmallow, jelly) served with the check were eh. also, they take Very long to bring out your next courses so after like the 4th course, i was getting restless and bored. to add to the latter, the dishes coming out kept getting more disappointing than exciting. for the amount you're paying for this course meal, you'd think it'd be "epic" but it was more meh for me. ALSO, my bf put a note on the reservation that it was my bday but they didn't acknowledge that.

This was a truly amazing fine dining experience. Being my first time there, my husband and I opted for the 5 course tasting with wine paring to get acquainted with the menu. Everything was fabulous from start to finish! The service was excellent as well. Every course (and wine) was well explained when it arrive to our table. The timing was good ... we weren't waiting too long before the next course arrived. A bread waiter served your choice of 3 kinds of breads between the meals. I had a taste of all the breads, but the bacon bread really blew me away. Who knew you could pack in the taste of bacon in bread with no grease and no chunks of bacon? And you know everything is better with BACON ... haha! At the end, the host was very kind to offer to take a picture of us to remember the night. I definitely want to go back!

Beautiful decor. Calming, warm atmosphere. Went for Valentine's day dinner and loved the timing in which each course came out. Never rushed and plenty of time to reflect on each course before the next. Was a bit confused with some of the flavor combinations, but it's probably my personal taste and, well, what would i know, but the ingredients were all top notch. Mild air of pretentiousness, but expected at such a place. I wasn't bothered by it too much.

My gf and I tried the chef tasting menu, which cost a bundle, but after three months of reflection, I'm willing to say it was worth every penny. Our meal took about 2 and a half hours to enjoy and everything was seasoned well and tasty. Some favorites were the arctic char, the uni in an egg and scallops. I'm usually not crazy about seafood, but this was a wonderful experience and the tasting menu showed a methodical approach where diners would leave satisfied. The service was excellent, the decor was lovely and nothing at this first rate restaurant even hints of being pretentious. Because of the high price tag...expect to spend about $200.00-$400.00 on a meal for two, we won't be here again for some time. But I hope to come back sooner rather than later.

The 9 course tasting menu was a valley - starting high, descending quickly, and then rising to a climax at the end. Like so many other restaurants, they reserved creative flare and experimentation for the amuse and the dessert (cheese, sweet, and palate cleanser). Service was confused and soft drinks were billed for refills. You eat at a place like this, money shouldn't be a concern - but they should at least warn you out of courtesy.

The experience and service was unbelievable. This is where you go and take your time eating and savoring every bite without feeling rushed. Def make sure you give yourself ample time to thoroughly enjoy the food and wine. If you do the chef's tasting I believe it's like 11 courses and they say it take about 4 hours!  Maybe one day. But I would love to get back there again in the near future.

This is by far my favorite restaurant in LA. It has it all: inventively prepared, superlatively fresh, top quality materials; no gimmickry (any molecular gastro elements are purposeful, not histrionic); a quiet, graceful setting where you can hear your companions; and service that's attentive and accurate without feeling intrusive. It's not cheap, but it's so very well worth it.

Providence is a lovely restaurant serving French food, most of it from the sea. We made a reservation for four late the same day with little trouble. After being seated in the covered outdoors-indoors area, three of us choose the five curse tasting menu, while the other one in our party choose to select three of her own plates. We also opted out of the wine pairing and drank two half bottles of our choosing. Dinner began with a few amuse bouche. The first one was a gin an tonic gelee. It was powdered with sodium bicarbonate. We were directed to squirts a few drops of lemon juice into top of it. The acid reacted with the baking soda to generate carbon dioxide bubbles. Clever. The second amuse bouche was a spherified (round gel membrane filled with liquid) mojito. The flavor explosion in the mouth as the gel membrane was ruptured was very interesting. The rest of the menu, while not as inventive, was solid. A couple of fish dishes where followed by a meat dish and a dessert course. At the end, several sweets where provided. The one I enjoyed the most was the small olive oil jellies. It was lightly dusted with powdered sugar and not very sweet, but with a strong oliver flavor. It was so good, I asked for some more. Finally, the price was very reasonable for four people and two half bottles at around $250 with tip.

Excellent, easily the finest restaurant in Los Angeles.  Service is stronger than that at Melisse in Santa Monica.  Still not as good as Gary Danko, though.

Great Birthday. I'm a fishatarian who has had gastric bypass surgery so I was worried the tastings and parings would be too much food.  I opted for a lobster ravioli hot app, the halibut main course, and ended with the apple dessert.  Everything was timed/paced nicely.  Coursed were nicely plated and the portions were perfect. Service was fabulous.  I walked out satisfied wondering when I could go back.  My boyfriend and I are still talking about the experience.

It was perfection from beginning to end.  From being greeted at the door, seated promptly, the amuse bouche and all the way through our seven course meal with wine and sake to match was brilliant culinary artistry. The service, the environment, the food.  Cimarusti's gem of a restaurant is as fantastic as it gets.  You pay for it, but worth it to the last penny.

Superb! outstanding. ditto to all who raved about this restaurant.  Wife and I both had the nine course tasting menu. good idea to get the tasting menu to get a nice portrait of the dishes.  presentation, flavor, and smell of each course was excellent. especially liked the cucumber sorbet and the uni dish...try this place for the unique dining experience that is seldom found in Los Angeles...as opposed to S.F/Bay Area (Gary Danko, French Laundry) and NYC (Per se, Gramercy Tavern).

Providence.....hummm. 1st off the food was great everything was cooked almost perfect. Went there this past valentines day for the prefix dinner. All the food was again cooked with big bold flavors and was real tasty except for the slightly over cooked scallop. THE SERVICE for the $$$'s was i say over serviced there were all kinds of waiters trying to serve our table...which made it a bit confusing trying to figure who was our real waiter etc.... We didn't get a  real good explanation from the sommelier ....just felt like one of the many waiters pouring the wine just gave a quick description and not really explaining how the wines paired with the food and what flavors it will bring out....WHAT WAS MOST UPSETTING ORDERING AN ADDITIONAL PLATE OF BLACK TRUFFLE RISSOTO AND NOT GETTING IT....getting foie gras instead was not satisfying. Like i stated previously for the type of restaurant i wouldn't think this kind of mistake would happen...but no ones perfect and the flavors were good. There are many other small things i would list but i don't want to waste anymore time reviewing this place. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone....try at your risk!!!!

Ambience: classy with strange white things glued tot he wall...i think they were supposed to imitate sea shells or something like that. Small but intimate. Menu: not a great deal of variety but it IS a seafood place afterall. Food: VERY creative! very unique (in a good way). Service: no complaints Extra pros: They gave us free appetizers which were amazing and strange all at once. An appetizer plate of 5 bite sized things. ridiculously good and creative. then they gave us free dessert samples. Parking: $5.50 or street parking for free. Obviously pricey but i think if you want to splurge or have a special occasion night, this is a wonderful place :) No complaints at ALL about this place.

Absolutely amazing. I'm one of those guys who loves great food and thinks that for $10 you can find some good food that is as good as spending $100+. So you really have to be good for me to want to spend the extra dough. Providence delivers. First off, hats off to the waiter who recommended to me the 9 course meal over the 15 course meal. How honest is that? He essentially told us we wouldnt finish and boy was he right. Every dish that was served was delicious. You know a restaurant is good when they serve something that you never normally would eat and you your mouth is salivating...

Hubby and I were looking for the next restaurant to try for our date night.  His only requirement was that the place serves foie gras.  We wanted to check out this 2-star rated Michelin place. Bacon brioche was wonderful with a dab of butter and sea salt. For amuse bouche: soy marshmallow with wasabi powder, cheese puff, shot glass with trout, caviar, creme fraiche, rice crisps topped with gold leaf. Like all the reviews, we got the 5-course menu: *Japanese kanpachi (crispy rice crackers, coriander, soy creme fraiche) very clean, tender and smooth with enough tanginess from the creme!  I paired this with sauvignon blanc . *Maine sea scallop (japanese eggplant, rhubarb, cashews, vadouvan) possibly the best scallop I've ever had!  Exquisite!!  The server suggested I pair this with riesling kabinett which was so nice! *Wild day boat pacific halibut (summer squash, black olive, apricot, basil) the halibut was not dry at all.  It was seared nicely. *Marcho farms veal tenderloin (bacon, almond, english peas, maitake mushrooms) okay I was on the verge of food coma at this point because we had 2 other dishes outside the tasting menu.  The veal was super tender.   *Salt roasted spot prawns (cooked in 500 degree salt wheeled to our table with olive oil and dash of lemon).  Part of the show as the server promised!  It was sweet with a hint of flower from the rosemary. *Foie gras ravioli (garnished with white truffles) this is the epitome of rich!  It was so creamy!  This was my hubby's definition of heaven. *Wagyu beef.  It was anticlimactic but I've actually threw in the white towel before this dish.  I was stuffed! *Yuzu curd meringue (blackberry sorbet) this was a welcome dessert to cleanse the palate.  It was tart, crisp and the meringue was a bonus!  But I was still looking for the usual sweet happy ending to satisfy my sugar addiction. Thank goodness they brought in mignardises of chocolate macarons, nougat (my two favorite things), and olive caramel. Little things:  the restroom had a frosted door which made me a little uncomfortable.  Biggest regret, forgot to bring my camera to take pictures of those artfully prepared dishes!!  Our dinner lasted about 4 hours.  So be prepared to savor each dish and atmosphere. Overall, the place was elegantly understated, laid back, excellent service, perfect for special occasions, and tremendous food experience.

By far, my favorite restaurant in Los Angeles. My husband and I had the 9-course meal with wine pairing and every dish, every glass of wine was absolutely perfect. The decor is surprisingly simplistic but goes perfectly with intimate dinners with top-quality dishes. Service was perfect, every dish was beautifully crafted and delicious and ambiance was special. This is one place I'd go back to over and over again on special days. If I have to spend hundreds of dollars on food, this will be that one place to do so with smiles, no regrets.

Providence is THE boom, boom, pow of LA!  There's a five course, a nine course full tasting, and a twelve course Chefs menu.  I opted for the five course tasting with wine pairing.  My favourite tasting was the kanpachi.  The sea scallop with japanese eggplant placed eggplant in a whole new dimension for me!  There was a table across the room who ordered the salt roasted prawns.  The tableside presentation was a sight to see!  Perhaps for my next visit.

I wrote about our excellent meal last week and I am taking some HK friends again this week. There were only 5 of us but the service and food quality was again excellent. First, I requested and got my favorite table again, the round table in the middle of the dining room. I don't need to repeat my ratings on the various dishes but the herb crusted halibut was different and it was really really exceptional. Life is excellent and I thank God for all His blessings. It was another memorable night at Providence. Martin, the captain, took excellent care of us again. I love Providence.

Went there several times again after my first review. Service are much better the last few times I went.   I've been sitting on the main dining area, so can't comment about the road noise anymore. The rest of the menu are the rotating 5 courses menu, which are solid and very good. The best special food in Providence has to be the Baked Santa Barbara Prawn. Hands down Providence is the best restaurant in LA if you like seafood and Japanese cuisine fusion.

four hours and 14 tastings later...i was ready to burst! i'd been wanting to try this place forever and i finally got to this past week. i've heard so many good things and it lived up to the hype! we got the chef's menu and it was definitely the way to go. you get a variety of amazing dishes that really showcase the creativity and skill of the chef. overall, we enjoyed every dish but there were a few that were meh. - bacon brioche, seaweed focaccia and white roll: the bacon brioche is loaded with bacon flavor and the seaweed focaccia is definitely very unique. the white roll is just a white roll. i definitely prefer the focaccia out of all three. - mojito and screwdriver: a fun experience. the mojito was very refreshing and the screwdriver was whatevs. - gonpachi: yellowtail served with scallions and a black sesame sauce. delicate and delicious! - kumamoto oysters: the oyster was fresh and the oyster-tasting leaf was interesting. this was a very creative, interactive concept which worked well. - monterey bay abalone and squid skewers: both were yummy and cooked perfectly. - uni w/ a truffle brioche: this was spectacular! definitely one of my fav dishes for the night. - scallop w/ cauliflower and black truffle: this was also another favorite dish. the scallop was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing - american red snapper: the fish was cooked perfectly but taste-wise, i didn't think there was anything special about it. it reminded me of steamed fish you order at chinese restaurants. - octopus w/ pickled onions and stinging needle (?): the octopus was tender and was served with yummy tomatoes and pearl onions. - unagi w/ chestnuts, parsnip puree and bone marrow: yummy - salmon wrapped in pork belly: the salmon was good but the sauce it was paired with was a little strange. it was sour which didn't go well. - australian wagyu beef w/ truffle butter sauce and porcini mushrooms: this was BOMB! great way to end the tasting. - cheese plate: definitely get the truffle one! i love truffles and this was amazing. i don't generally like blue cheese but they had one wrapped in banana leaves (?) which was really good. i can't remember the other ones we got but they were all yummy. the lady was very helpful and picked some great ones for us to try based on our preferences. - guava sorbet w/ yuzu cucumber and yogurt fruit gelee: very refreshing after the wagyu beef. - almond cake w/ creme fraiche ice cream and vanilla mousse: this was amazing! presentation was so unique the textures were so interesting. i devoured all of this even though i was already stuffed beyond belief. - milk chocolate ganache w/ japanese ginger foam and ginger ice cream: this was not very good and kind of disappointing. the three of us barely touched this dessert. - passion fruit macaroon, raspberry marshmallow and jasmine gelee: the macaroon and gelee were good, the marshmallow was whatevs. service was amazing and the ambiance is very appealing and not stuffy at all. i was blown away by the creativity and presentation and will definitely be back!

As I get close to the end of my deployment here in Afghanistan, I want to take the time to reflect on the last phenomenal meal i had before I left the country. I deliberately held off on writing this review until now because I'm sure it would have thrown me into deep depression if I knew it was going to be another year before I'd taste something other than the boiled animal product that the Army has been serving us everyday here(except thanksgiving) for the past year.  My brother Phil graciously took our small family here about a week before I was set to leave.  Let me use a fantasy football analogy here. I'd start Providence over Daniel, Per se, 11 madison park and Jean George. But it'd be a tough week if I had to choose between Le Bernardin and Providence. It's that good. We had the full course tasting menu, I won't list out every course we had since I'm sure many would find it annoying and many of the items probably have changed by now, but they were all phenomenal.  The santa barbara sea urchin did probably stand out amongst the rest.  The ambiance was sophisticated but not stuffy, the dining room won't be as grand as many of the Michelin starred places you'll find in nyc, but definitely suitable for most celebratory occasions.  Phil W has assured me that he will take me out again to celebrate the end of this deployment after I get back in a few short weeks,  I think it's going to be a hard task finding a restaurant comparable to Providence in LA. Maybe we'll just have to go back.

Wow! Worth every penny. We did the 5 course and the portions were pretty generous. We started with 2 amuse bouche and ended the night with an extra plate of dessert. Basically, it was more like an 8 course meal. The mojito granita was amazing & refreshing. I need to learn how to make that. The konpachi was my favorite. It was one of the freshest raw food I had. We also had a scallop dish with beets and that was just equally as tasty. The mediterranean fish was not my favorite & that's not the chef's fault. I'm not a big fan of mediterranean flavors. The fish was cooked perfectly though. The veal was sous-vide and that was pretty much a life changer. So tender that it melts in your mouth and it's perfectly paired with the pea puree. The dessert wasn't my favorite but I did enjoy the cocoa puffs & the pepper ice cream. I definitely want to come again because my meal was only $70 without tip & tax. Is that usually the normal price or was it a special? I don't know but I want to try the 9 course or the 15 course. Haha.

Providence provided me the opportunity to taste dishes that I never had and likely never will have the opportunity, again. We ordered the ($175/person) 15-course chef menu and are grateful for the opportunity to experience this level of fine dining. All the dishes were sumptious and tastefully presented. Given the opportunity to order them again, I'd opt for other choices. After dinner, i asked my partner, if you had already dined at both ($45) Universal Hilton (my fav) and here (which we had) and money wasn't an issue, at which would you prefer to dine again? He said Universal. Then I asked, what if both cost $45, then which would you prefer? Again, he chose Hilton. I agree with him on both counts.

Providence is currently in a tie for my favorite LA "special spot" dining - with Sona.   The tasting menu, especially with the clever wine pairings is not to be missed.   Some of my favorite tastes:  the frozen mini-mojito on a spoon, or the fennel soup served in a teeny-tiny beer stein. The service was impeccable - always attentive and well-timed without being overbearing or a nuisance. I also appreciate the atmosphere - nice without being too formal - quiet enough to have a decent conversation and enjoy a pleasurable nicely paced meal.  Not meant for the dine-and-dash or for those who feel a need to see and be seen.

It was lackluster.  Skip the lobster risotto.  It was so one dimensional, boring and not tasty.  Enjoy the brioche with egg and mushroom, which is delightful.  Providence was good, but the flavor profiles were a bit off.  Something was always missing in each dish save for the brioche, which was, sad to say, the highlight of all of our evening.  I wanted to love it. I was talking about it for the year leading up to my 30th bday.  I like pretty food, but if it it doesn't sing in my mouth, what's the point?  Service was friendly and good and not too stuffy.  A nice balance.  Reminded me of Bouley in NYC.  Lots of bravado, but not enough to back it up.  Will not be back.

My husband and I vacationed in LA area last week  and we chose this place based on the two-Michelin stars. Despite the fact that Michelin states that their rating is based on food alone, we have found after dining at Providence (three black forks, Michelin) that the ambience and the comfort of the restaurant can make or break the dining experience. For us, the food just couldn't overcome the poor atmosphere and inconsistent service. Valet parking is around the corner(!)  NOT in front of the restaurant; incredible noise from the street; the waiter's station directly in front of the table where we were seated; a 3-year-old noisy child with a loud toy two tables over; a waiter, when asked "was everything alright?" who was told the truth responded very inappropriately. It was apparent that the staff did not care whether or not we had a good experience . Also, the wine pairings, at best, were mediocore and at worst inappropriate: we left at least half of what was in the glasses. In our experience, when wine or even food is left, the staff has tried to find out why and tried to offer an alternative or a substitution. We felt the staff was happy we were finished sooner.... To quote Michelin, "When the kitchen hits it right..." when we were there, it didn't. The food was better than the service and atmosphere, but still the overall experience is what is remembered. We made a special trip for this restaurant, and were not impressed. To end on a positive note, the cheese cart was impressive and diverse. We really enjoyed that.

Came here for bf's birthday and it was amazing as all the other reviewers say. We had a 10 o'clock reservation, but still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. While we waited, the waiter came around and handed out fried crab fritters and fish crackers. The fritter was okay, but the fish cracker was good. After being seated, we ordered the 5 course tasting menu which was on special for the month of June to celebrate their 5 year anniversary. The service was attentive and professional and the food was excellent from appetizer to dessert as you can read from other yelpers. My favorites were the diver scallop and kompachi, but everything was cooked nicely. We were even greeted by Michael Cimarusti  as dinner was winding down. The maître d was gracious enough to let us into the kitchen. Definitely come here if you get the chance.

Providence is incredible! We went for my husband's birthday and enjoyed an elegant, delicious, top-notch meal.  The service is perfect (attentive but not too intrusive) and they were gracious about having to make some modifications on the tasting menu for me because I am pregnant.   Sometimes tasting menus at other restaurants, although excellent, are too much food but Providence gets it just right in terms of variety, portions and flavor pairings. We will definitely return and recommend to everyone we know!

This seafood lover cannot get enough of the high-end seafood specialties served at Providence.  Each time I have the pleasure of eating here I am utterly amazed and marveled.  The food, the wine, the atmosphere is simply divine.  I am convinced that this is by far, one of the best restuarants in LA if not the best.  Owner and chef Michael Cimarusti has created a masterpiece and you will be able to taste the intense attention and focus given to each plate.  If you have not dined here you are missing a gem of a restuarant.

I could recount my meal in detail (each item, and it's been more than a month and a half since I've dined there) and talk about how delicious and refined all the food was, but really, I think I'll err on the side of brevity and simply say that my birthday meal at Providence was the best meal I've ever had. Hands down, no hyperbole, it was simply amazing. If this is two Michelin star dining, I think 3-star might break my mind.

Took my gf there for her Birthday. We decided to try the 6 course dessert and wine pairing menu. The menu was interesting and creative and was definitely an experience. The was a wine expert that came out to present the wine served with each course. If you have any interest in wine, its history and fun facts he was definitely the perfect guy for it. We started off with "cocktails" before the 6 courses. The cocktails were edible instead of drinkable and came out in two spoons. One was like a mojito and the other was a like a tequila sunrise. Both very creative, pretty, and rather tasty. The passion fruit mango gel with white chocolate coconut soy milk and lychee sorbet was presented as a soup and was excellent. It was paired with a Ume Blanc and both were very refreshing. There was a lot of textures and was a great start to our tasting menu. I got very excited and was looking forward to the next courses. Unfortunately, the next course was a bit of a disappointment. The roasted apple with curry, honey, cherry chutney and praline ice cream. The praline ice cream was wonderful but I think the spices on the apple was a bit overpowering. I felt like it should have been on chicken instead of an apple. Although the concept was there. It was also the size of a normal one course dessert seemed very filling for a second course. The strong wine pairing with the strong spices may have made sense but I wasn't feeling it. They did make a comeback with the 3rd course, the Pumpkin polenta. It made me forget about the apple. It was nothing fancy, just a pumpkin pudding with candied pecans, mascarpone, and maple syrup. But it was like the perfect soul food. Made me feel warm in the belly and comfy all around. There wasn't much to comment as far as the wine pairing with this course. Honestly I can't remember what the dulce de leche-miso panna cotta was all about. But I do remember it came out of a shot glass and looked pretty. Not much to comment on. The last course was the peanut butter, banana, tamarind, and jalapeno mix. It was yummy!!! Very pretty, and definitely tasty. But you almost can't go wrong with peanut butter and banana together. It was very creative and the tamarind and jalapeno added a nice touch of flavor. Overall it was definitely a fun experience. We got some really good desserts but some not so great ones as well. I'm not sure it was worth the wine pairing because It didn't accentuate the desserts like I had expected except for the first course. I think the port that went with the peanut butter banana course may have paired wonderfully with chocolate but maybe I just really wanted chocolate. Its definitely worth going with friends with sweet teeth and having fun but I've been to Chikalicious in NYC and you always want more of the wine and dessert you were given. I only felt that way toward the first course. 3.4 stars for desserts four starts for the experience.

Two Michelin stars gives this place an accreditation that at a minimum, piques interest.  In a nutshell, this place is absolutely wonderful--maybe even glorious. The venue is decorated in a fashion I would call subtle and elegant.  The decor gives the sense that you'll probably be enjoying some sort of sea fare, without making you feel like you're sitting on the ocean.  I really appreciated the balance and layout of their design elements as it gives Providence a cultural richness that many other fine places simply don't have. Service here is great, the dishes were presented in sync and with wonderful fashion.  One thing I'd note is that in our large party, the course descriptions were a little difficult to hear, and that is one of my favorite parts of a dining affair.  On this topic--perhaps it was the large size of my party, but dining did not feel as intimate as it does with some of the other top-tier establishments in the area. The food is superb!  Along with wine pairings, the tasting menu was exquisite.  This isn't to read as "very nice," but "marked by flawless craftsmanship or by beautiful, ingenious, delicate, or elaborate execution" (Webster).  Presentation, feel, and flavors of the dishes are right up there with the very best dining establishments around.  I loved the stylishness with which the food was plated.  It was here that I first tried gourmet cheeses, and the experience was tons of fun. You will have a great time here, worthy of a very special occasion.

Delicious! Pricey, very creative and on the leading edge of weird/sci-fi food but with a focus on flavor, not gimmick, *most* of the time. Main courses were phenomenal - beautiful plates with lots of different parts all combining together nicely. We ordered off the menu, did not do a tasting. Pork belly was the most edible preparation I've ever had, large crispy batons with fat and pork inside. I'm not sure if it was just crisped fat on the outside or some kind of wrapper, but it made it much easier to get through the richness of the belly. And maybe it was a relatively meaty cut too ;) Dungeness crab app was also fantastic, along with the other cold/raw seafood apps. Foie gras ravioli and grilled octopus were nothing special. Lovely plates but nothing impressive or interesting in the preparation. The first amuse - parmesean foam with port wine reduction at the bottom of the shot glass - was great. The second - "cocktails" in ice/gel and "egg yolk" forms was not. This was the only dish that really fell short. The flavor of the mimicked cocktail wasn't there, and instead there were off flavor notes in a kind of gross presentation (especially the tepid egg yolk screwdriver) I was slightly annoyed by the service here. The best service experiences I've had at high-end restaurants (Cyrus is the best example that I know) are when the staff strives to understand the mood of the table and provide a matching experience. Like an actor that can play a lot of different roles. The service at Providence is more like an actor that can only play themselves. There are a lot of good, and even great, actors like this. And there was nothing technically wrong with the service here. But, with the exception of the sommelier, the attitude was very self-satisfied/self-important. A lot of "isn't this the best!" (even in cases, like the "cocktails" where it was not) which to me plays like a salesman trying to convince, instead of a host trying to entertain. I know I'm really nitpicking here, but when you pay a high premium for service it's disappointing when it's not perfect.

My husband I went to Providence last week. We wanted an early seating to take our time and avoid the busiest time. Service is always better if it's a slower time and slower day. Tuesday at 6:00 was perfect. And that started a really great meal! We started with cocktails and ordered the 5 course tasting menu, added the Tuna Tartare and Cheese Plate, paired wine all the way through the meal. Yum! The amuse bouche tray, as others have mentioned, mojito gelee, screwdriver bubble, gorgonzola cheese puff, parsnip soup with port reduction, was inventive and very tasty. The Tartare we added was also very good. Next was a sashimi course (very good), cooked fish course (can't remember what kind, just ok) and then a very good lamb course. Then the cheese course we added. You can choose from a large selection of very different cheeses. Terrific. Then came dessert, bread pudding with barley ice cream(very good). ATMOSPHERE - very comfortable, elegant but not stuffy. SERVICE - attentive but not invasive. One waitress was a bit too casual but everyone was very knowledgeable. FOOD- interesting, inventive and very tasty WINE- all very good, one very unusual, didn't understand it till the next wine and food came. The Wonderland cocktail was great. PRICE - can get pricey $130 for 5 course w/wine pairings per person, plus add ons and additional pairings, starter cocktails,tips... I bet you find it's worth it. QUITE GOOD!

Honestly, I've had better food with quality service that didn't cost over $200 per person. However, unlike most of the yelpers that gave 5 stars, I did not try the tasting menu. Will post again if I ever decide to shell out another $400 on a dinner for two. The decor however is unlike anything I've seen; mushroom replicas on wooden walls. Clean, artistic, sophisticated. I liked it very much. The food is what you would expect from a fine dining restaurant, expensive, tasty, in princess bite portions. I will definitely dine again.

As a foodie used to NYC standards, I was really looking forward to trying this place for a splurge. I ordered the 9 course tasting menu. We had reservations on a saturday night for 8:30pm and didn't get seated until 9:10pm, though they apologized profusely. The service was spotty-- since we had several waiters, some of them were excellent (friendly, informative, kept an eye on our wineglasses to make sure they were full) and some were not (had to wave to get his attn twice, didn't bring us the dinner menu for 15 minutes after we were seated.) However the restaurant made up for the 40 minute delay by comping us on our wine and cocktails, as well as providing us with a charming box of chef-made chocolates to take home, so no harm done and we left feeling well-taken care of. As for the food, most of it was wonderful. However I thought the scallop dish was overcooked, and the salmon plate was really, really mediocre. Yet the halibut dish was to die for, as well as the veal and the miso cheesecake at the end. The cheese cart is among the best I've ever experienced. Overall it was a wonderful meal.

Amazing: the service, the wine and beer list, the food, the dessert, the design, the concept and the presentation. One of my favorite meals I have ever had and very unforgettable.  The dutch white asparagus with 65 degree egg was heaven.  It's pricey, but actually worth the price.

Been here three times and it's *nearly* as good as everyone says it is. A Japanese-influenced menu (and their music rotation too).  As of December one of their hot appetizers is essentially a fancy ramen, and at least two dishes use matstutake.  Staff is very friendly and unpretentious.  Discussed food and drink with the waiters each time and they are all very knowledgeable/well-trained as one should expect from a two star michelin.  90% of the dishes I have had here were above average to good, they are very accommodating with substitutions and making slight changes if you ask nicely. A five course meal + drinks, dessert, coffee + tip will set you back about $225 a person

Providence did not live up to its reputation one bit. The modern décor is a plus but the price of the food and the portion was a major ripe off! We went there with a group of friends and most of them got the wine pairing, which I would have to agree that they did a great job pairing it. Some of the food was not very innovative, it tasted more like a three start restaurant versus a restaurant that has earned it's two Michelin stars. In the end, it cost $200 per person. Way too expensive for what we consumed.

My amazing date took me here last night. Food was beyond wonderful. We decided to somewhat design our own 5 course tasting menu with the help of our server. We had for appetizers - lobster risotto (good but subtle flavors), foie gras ravioli with shaved black truffles (excellent taste just didn't taste the actual foie gras), and the 63 degree egg w/ brioche and morels (excellent). For dinner we had salt roasted spot prawns (beautiful hints of salt and rosemary) and the octopus (so so fresh and tender)with pork belly . For dessert we went with the 3 course tasting menu and wine pairings, again awesome! The staff helped us choose a great Chardonnay for our dinner course. For someone like me who does not like Chardonnay, this a was a damn good one. Service was nice, consistent, and knowledgeable. Overall, a grand experience, looking forward to going back with my date again.

The place is beautiful, the service is stellar.  The cooking is innovative and you will taste some of the best seafood dishes on the west coast.     I enjoyed the wild striped bass  with applewood smoked bacon, fava beans and bone marrow however, I felt very slighted at the size of the piece of fish.  It was only about 1/2 pound and it did not even remotely fill me.   Considering they probably get it fresh from Santa Monica seafood which retails striped bass at $20 a pound, that would make it about $10 worth of  fish RETAIL.  It costs $48.  The fancy garnishes of bone marrow and goatsbeard or whatever you call it is great but when there isn't enough fish to satisfy my 165 pound body all that foo foo stuff is gone by the wayside.  Don't get me wrong it tasted out of this world but when I leave hungry a great rating also goes by the wayside....  I had larger fresh fillets of striped bass at Joe's Crab shack in Maryland at a quarter of the price.   I do realize this is Los Angeles and you do pay for the ambiance and exceptional culinary flavoring, but still after calculating all that in, I am still left asking myself the same question,  "Where's the meat?"

This place is great, but keep in mind the dishes are definitely under-portioned and overpriced. The oysters were fresh and great. The clam chowder was prepared on the table with fresh bacon and cream and one of the best I've ever had. The main lobster could have been bigger but the foam reduction they served over it was ridiculously good. They also brought free small dishes like wasabi marshmallows which were creative and excellent and alcohol frozen concoctions created with molecular gastronomy, such as a frozen gelatinous mai-tai which was so cool. The desserts were also killer, and the service was top notch and near perfect. Cocktails were unique and tasty.

I've eaten here probably 8 times in the last 4 or so years and continue to think that it's the best restaurant in LA.  We usually do the 5 course dinner, which is plenty for me, but various wine groups I'm a part of have done a number of wine dinners there (both in the private room and in the main room) and they've all been executed perfectly.

I loved this place sooooo much that I came back twice in 1 month.  I'm getting cravings as I reminisce on such YUMMY mouthwatering memories!!!! This is by far the BEST restaurant I've been to. However, I've yet to try French Laundry! We did the 5-Course tasting with 1 wine tasting. Amuse bouche---Definitely the BEST ever!!! ***** Japanese Kanpachi (amber jack?)---Soooo Yummy!! Awesome texture ***** Sea Scallops--Well cooked. Seasoned and garnished differently each time ***** Halibut--Great but nothing spectacular. Veal Tenderloin--These were to die for!!! These were cooked sous vide and created such a wonderfully moist texture. ***** Dessert--Yummy and not too sweet.**** Added the Foie Gras Ravioli with truffles--This is a must try! This is one of their most popular dish. This dish is Extraordinary. My only suggestion is to ease down on the salt, but overall delicious****** The quality of the herbs/garnishing and seasoning complemented each dish very very well. I will be back soon!! Damage ~$250 for two.

For a 2 star Michelin rating...average. I'm not saying the food was bad, infact with the exception of dessert the dishes were fantastic.  I just don't agree with the 2 stars.  I was expecting to be blown away. I just had a couple seafood dishes at other places and found them to be of the same caliber. We tried the 5 course tasting menu and for the price it was well worth it.  Fresh and creative.  I think my wife loved it more then me as she said OMG, this scallop is perfect. Kanpachi Sashimi was amazing. The waiter basically takes your order, someone else deliveres the food and another gentlemen explains the dish and for a few dishes advices on how to eat it...which I thought was great given that a couple chef's creative compliments were better taken they way he explained. Good food, great for special occasion, decor is simple. They charged us 5 bucks to substitute a 12 dollar dessert with another 12 dollar dessert.

I was so excited to try Providence... I saved it for my birthday dinner.  The cocktails were delicious, the wine list interesting and sommelier is lovely. The amus bush was yummy...  I think we are off to a great start.   But the four of us all had only or less than OK meals... It was mediocre... for the price NOT worth it.  It is one thing to pay whatever the price is for a fabulous meal at world class restaurant but it is totally another to over pay for "EH" food.  They brought the birthday dessert to the wrong person after 4 times being told who the person girl was and we had to send it back....It was really Gross.  As a side note i do love a leisurely meal but after 3 hours I was getting antsy to go.... I would not go back or recommend.

I was hoping this place would blow be away with the money spent and from all the good reviews  but it was not that great.  The only thing that was good was the foie gras ravioli in truffle oil. It was nice that they took our reservation an hour prior to actually arriving, I guess this place has been around for a long time so it's not that popular anymore? Food presentation: Great, exciting Taste: Ok Service: Good (all men-employed establishment) I don't think I would go back or recommend it either. Nothing beats Chef Michael Voltaggio, if you're looking for a 'tasting' menu with excellent flavor and presentation.

Providence is absolutely amazing. the bf and i were lucky enough to come for a special event during LA food and wine weekend. the tasting menu was created with the chef of Redd in Yountville, where we had dined a month before (amazing also). this event included hors d'oeuvres and champagne, a 5 course meal and a wine pairing. sensational meal! we had a virtual oyster shooter (so cool), abalone, squid, chorizo, yellowfin tuna carpaccio with baby beets, radish, lemon oil; diver scallops with sunchokes, mushrooms, and sherry vin jus; striped bass with bacon, comice pear, tahitian squash and brown butter, and a chocolate raspberry ganache with ginger meringue and graham cracker ice cream. the wine pairing was perfection, but the food was just heavenly. my bf and i both agreed that the carpaccio was the best tuna we've had. the scallops (phenomenal, and pan-seared ;) ) were just ridiculously good and was directly from chef Reddington's part of the menu collaboration. the bass was the best i've had because of the quality and the bacon...nommmm. the ganache would definitely be one of the best desserts i have ever had. i think it was the highlight of the meal ;). the presentation was absolutely gorgeous too. i LOVED this experience!

at 6:15pm, we were the first patrons of the night. with warm greetings, we were given an extensive wine menu immediately upon seating. not being a wine aficionado, i ordered an asian pear martini and the husband started the night with a japanese beer. while waiting for our 9 course tasting menu, i surveyed the room which was adorned with white flower appliques all over its brown walls and high ceilings, nicely complimenting modern and urban exterior of the restaurant, distinctively situated in less glitzy part of melrose. first, a trio of amuse bouche was brought out, and i must admit the gin & tonic cube and mojito ball were divine both in taste and presentation. in fact, the husband said this was the best "dish" of the night. kanpachi in creme fraiche with thin rice crackers followed the suite in its excellence. the next course of sea urchin in warm raw egg was a pleasant surprise as the egg did not overwhelm the smooth velvety texture of cooked uni. our third dish, seared scallop, was my favorite of the night. with aroma of earthiness coming from chanterelle mushrooms, this truly embodied chef cimarusti's masterful skills in the art of cooking. then came a piece of cod which failed to impress us in its overcooked rubbery texture, although i enjoyed the julienned burdock immensely. the night's only none seafood course was veal, other than desserts and a tray of cheese. two pieces of roasted tenderloins were rarely touched by me and regretfully consumed by the husband. it was too salty to savor the tender juicy meat...what a shame! the rest of this three hour extravaganza ended with 4 kinds of cheese paired with figs, walnuts and some fruit chutney, cucumber sorbet in yogurt and cheesecake and burnt caramel sorbet on top of ginger cookie crumbs. our head waiter also brought us panna cotta with yet another sorbet (coffee, chocolate?) as a complimentary to our dissatisfaction with the veal dish. as a lactard, the cheese course was not mind-blowing at all to me, and rather seemed a bit out of place, especially without wine pairing. the minty cucumber sorbet (very strange, yet addictive) did a nice job of cleansing that overpowering cheese flavors lingering in my mouth. we are dessert lovers, but this was way too much ice and sugar for any human being to handle in one seating. service was pretty spot on with almost robotic movements, a tag work by one head waiter/waitress explaining each dish while a server placing it on the table. there was one disorganized moment when nobody came to introduce what the course was about (and therefore, i omitted it in this review. it was another fish, probably not a superb dish, since i can't quite even remember what we ate). the sommelier was very friendly and visited every table to pour wines and to chat up a bit. i must say in their hush, quiet manner, the wait staff seemed very well trained and learned to create the most comfortable atmosphere for the diners. the highlight of the night was our dining neighbors seating next and across from us. sumner redstone (yes, i am totally cultured!), surrounded by his 5 friends and maitre d', was quite rambunctious, charming and grandeur. maybe, he was one of the few who could make up his own menu and demand it (lobster salad? at least john dory couldn't be substituted for cod!). we also saw a very sublime yet confident masi oka with a blonde who was at least a foot taller than him. he preferred to sit next to his companion, not across. right next to our table was a food critic, often seen on iron chef america as a judge whose etiquette truly impressed me. here was a man whose life wasn't ruled by his blackberry (he told his dining companion to take his phone call outside!!! hell yeah!!!). providence was an amazing experience as we were there to celebrate our marriage and future together as one unit. three hours in that beautiful setting didn't seem too long for us (the husband almost missed his plane since we lost track of our time), although we were getting a bit tired of the same cold desserts (no baked goods here except their complimentary breads which were quite good). the maitre d' came by at the end of our dinner to offer a box of house made chocolates as a congratulatory gift. the formality, creativity and presentation of food at providence are indeed impeccable, as shown by numerous awards and michelin stars. but those judges/critics probably didn't have to fork out their money to dine and wine here, unlike us. don't get me wrong...we loved every bit of our time here, but not every bite of the food. for the damage it made to the hubby's bank account, it didn't "wow" me. with that said, i'd certainly come back again and try their a la carte items.

Experience was absolutely delightful. From the bread (bacon brioche) to the mojito starer, to the fried salmon skin and the chocolate marshmallow, it was outstanding.  Ordered the foia gras ravioli, melts in your mouth and it's creamy and delicate.  Also had the scallops but found them to be one note, good but the plate was not as exciting as everything else.

providence is one of only two 5-stars restaurants on my la list.  behind every great restaurant is a great chef and michael ciramusti is one of the best.  ciramusti knows seafood like a porn star knows orifices.  he was former exec. chef at my favorite la seafood restaurant, red lobster.  just kidding, he was the chef at the watergrill in downtown.  watergrill is still at the top of my la seafood restaurant list but only because providence is not just a seafood restaurant.  they do everything well from amuse bouche to desserts.  the whole experience is completely on point.  i've had several meals at providence but have only ordered the chef's menu.  if you can afford to splurge, i suggest you do so at a place like providence or sona where they really know what they're doing.  i've even had the luxury of experiencing the 5x5 dinner where five amazing top local chefs get together to prepare your meal with each chef taking on one course.  the price was slightly higher for this dinner but it was for charity so it made it easier shelling out the extra dough.  plus the food was amazing since it was being created by not just one amazing chef but five of the best in la.  i believe they are about to do their 2nd 5x5 collaborative dinner soon if they haven't started it already.  providence also has a great e-newsletter that comes out monthly.  i've had the opportunity to meet michael in person a couple of times and he's not the most comfortable around his customers.  you get the feeling he would much rather be back of house doing what he does best but the more i find out about the guy, the more i like him.  if you want to know what i mean, check out the episode of after hours with daniel at providence on the mojo hd channel and you'll see michael's passion, his expertise, and his respect of food and his industry. side note...i had tortilla chip flavored ice cream at providence and it was amazing to have cold ice cream tasting like a tostito.

i am SO sad in writing this review...  i honestly didn't think it was worth 4-5 stars ... :( sry. but i really tried ... providence has been on my list FOREVERS AND EVERS! and i finally made it few weeks ago. the only reason i give it an extra star was simply because i was honored to have a tour of the kitchen and meet the head chef ... presentation = 5stars service = 5stars food =2.5 stars... if anything try the seafood, not the meat. my favorite part of the meal? the variety of the bread, try the bacony one! upscale fine dining? yay, but upscale fine experience? nay

Ate there last night for the first time and was blown away like a leaf in a hurricane.  Before going with the full tasting menu we both ordered cocktails, "she" the Aviation, "me" the Dark & Stormy.  Both were delicious and highly recommended (Aviation is gin based, Dark & Stormy is rum based).  That being said, our meal consisted of some of the following (I can't remember everything, there was so much food I'm undergoing a euphoric state of temporary amenisa): drinks made into food (i.e. a gin & tonic gelatin, a margarita held together in a yolk), kampachi (sorry if I've spelled it incorrectly, actually, i'm not sorry...moving on), spot prawns (i switched out the sea urchin for this special and was really happy i did), halibut (pretty great but the least interesting of the fish dishes), salmon (totally ridiculously awesome, like winning the lottery and getting to punch your worst enemy in the face all in one day), veal (my favorite part of the meal, so perfectly cooked and garnished I think I might have to retire from ever eating veal again...and don't think I don't realize the "Simpsons" level irony given that this is a seafood restaurant, I realize it god dammit!).  Following that, we were treated to a truly great assortment of cheeses (one of which was apparently the highest rated blue cheese in the world, and yes it was grrrrrrrrrreat) and ultimately a custard like desert that came with raspberry sorbet and delivered on all levels. The service was incredible.  These people hover around you like a team of White House assistants ready to spoon feed you and ply you with booze if need be (that's what they do at the White House, right?).  That beind said, the bill was hefty for two (I probably could've adopted three Russian orphans for what i paid here but, to be honest, I was expecting it and definitely think we got our three hours worth...yup, the meal was three hours long...).  One of the best meals I've ever had and one I'd recommend to just about anyone.

A lot of people compare this place to Melisse.  I've been to both and in my opinion, this place is not as good.  We had the five course tasting menu.  Everything is fresh and the menu was prepared perfectly, but nothing blows you away.

So last night this really nice hot boy treated me out to Providence for dinner. Hot boy turned out to be "SUPER Hot Boy" when upon arrival he goes let's just go for it. Next thing I know we're ordering the Chef's Menu w/ Wine Pairing, the waiter informed us that it would be a 3 hour tasting, which to we replied, "Bring it!" I was smiling the entire time, everything tasted superb and looked like a Gourmet Magazine photo spread right before my eyes which I am happy to report did not disappoint. Not to mention that the staff was really knowledgeable and informative on everything brought to the table. At one point Donato, the co-owner personally made sure we had our missing fork replaced and in doing so actually looked concerned about it - professional! By the end of the meal I was completely buzzed and in love - with the restaurant that is! Although Super Hot Boy definitely scored major points for treating me out to a wonderful night of taste bud debauchery. Super Hot Boy Rocks!

2 of us had dinner there 2 wks ago and although it was a Thursday,the restaurant was full! We got there slightly early and sat at the bar and ordered cocktails and was then immediately whisked to our table. Cocktails were brought to our table and since I asked the bartender (Zahra) to surprise me,was a little disappointed that the server could not tell me the exact "fruit juices" used in my drink. Hence why I am giving this a 4 instead of a full 5 star experience. We had the 5 course tasting menu and also had an additional order of the pan seared foie gras -all the dishes were v.g.! And we were also given 3 additional complimentary plates so effectively, we did have a 9 course meal! And the accompanying bacon brioche is so good that I couldn't resist having a few rounds of it!My last degustation menu dinner was at a GuySavoy restaurant in Paris and both experience are comparable to each other.

Ok, this place is not cheap, but then again, what would one expect?  The decor I think is up to interpretation, sort of a nautical Japanese effect.  I did notice that the noise level was surprisingly low for a full house.  The meals have been great- maybe a few dishes that don't quite work, but are still tasty; overall, everything shows tremendous cooking technique.  The fish is the star of the show, but MC and his chefs show that they know their way around land based animals as well.  As others have stated, the tasting menu is the way to go- even the wine pairings are above average.  Service is professional and unobstrusive.  An interesting new addition is the dessert tasting menu.  My favorite restaurant in LA at this moment.

We went to Providence and enjoyed every aspect of our dining experience so much that I returned just a few days later. The seafood was wonderfully created by Michael Cimarusti and team. Favorites were the melon soup with Riesling air (served in a mini beer-mug) and poached lobster with vanilla sauce, the seared sea scallop with Washington cherries and chanterelles, the duck confit, and the chocolate feuilletine desert. Service was also superb with managers Donato and Thierry both stopping by every table and sincerely engaging customers to ensure that all guests enjoyed their meals. The waiters were friendly and professional at the same time, enthusiastic and very accommodating. The space is modern with a slight seaside feel. I'm not sure I would have chosen faux barnacles for the design but the colors, textures, lighting and elegant fabrics are simple and luxurious. Providence is my new favorite restaurant.

I'm going to eat here again very soon so, therefore, only four stars as of right now. Don't run after me with pitch forks please. My boyfriend took me here for our four year anniversary. We reserved a time at exactly 5:30PM and we were the first people to get here! We actually came rather early and had to wait in our limo for 15 minutes. The service here, is amazing. Probably one of the best I've had, aside from Melisse. Since it was our anniversary, I asked for a seating where we weren't a few centimeters away from the other table. But like I said, the service was impeccable. I got here and I was feeling sick from the bumpy ride. They immediately made a drink up for me to ease my stomach. And, looking at the receipt later, it was free :) Throughout the dinner, me and my s/o were laughing and sharing jokes with our waiter/sommelier and the other three who helped. They were so nice and warming to us. They seriously make you feel like royalty here. As for the food, we got the Chefs Menu WITHOUT even looking what was on it, lol. Yes, we were that excited to eat here. We also got the wine pairings. Mind you, I was sick for the first, maybe, four courses? I was pretty upset that I couldn't fully enjoy the first four courses. And my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to leave since my stomach was feeling really upset. But we didn't because I know I was going to regret it later and feel horrible about wasting so much money on food we wouldn't be able to eat. So, for the food, I think it was.. just too much for me? A little overwhelming perhaps? I'm a big foodie and so is my boyfriend. But, we want to try it once more before I actually say how much I like/love this restaurant. And as for the dessert, just too exotic with all the flavors. Which is so surprising because I am BIG on sugar. As for the wine pairings, I drank so much I went to the restroom about six times? Very embarrassing :\ So, I don't want to go into too much depth or show off all the pictures I took as I am going to try Providence probably in June or earlier. I'll just leave with the check amount for those who wanted an idea about how much it is: Two fifteen courses with wine pairings + a cocktail priced at $14 for my boyfriend = $553 something. We gave $650 for tip. Also, being the first to get there, we weren't done until 10:30PM!! So I suggest to get there when it opens and if you want to see Chef Michael Cimarusti, go early :)

Thursday night got a table without reservation.My personal discovery was a baked salmon skin,included in the amuse buche offering.The staff is very professional and super friendly at the same time.Brioche with bacon is amazing.The lobster  in a cold appetizer was rubbery.In the house made fettucine was heavy like caulk.Tomato sauce was very strong.Unfortunately the bone marrow sauce for the New York steak had no flavor at all,so did the steak.Harry"s berries were OK.Brazilian coffee was very good as the cabernet franc with my dinner.Patrons very nice.The food at Melisse have more flavor but service is better at Providence.

Let's start from the beginning. Accidentally drove past the restaurant so I called to confirm its location and the person insinuated that I must have been blind to miss it (not cool). Found the restaurant easily after the call and waited a moment for the valet to get around to our car. Went in, got seated, and then the experience really started. I thought the service was completely spot on, attentive but not overbearing. Our waiter was extremely patient and helpful and guided us to ordering the Full Tasting. Just a note: everybody at the table needs to participate in the same tasting option. There were 9 courses in the Full Tasting ($125 per person without the wine pairing), and we definitely left completely satiated. I won't get into detail about each specific course, I just want to highlight the ones that really impressed us. The uni under the soft scramble was probably my favorite course of the evening. However, uni is an acquired taste so I can't say that it's for everyone. We also really enjoyed the salmon. The salmon had a pink center and each piece was sandwiched by two thin slices of pork belly which added a nice flavor. Last shout out goes to the cheese plate. The cheese cutter (I don't know the proper term to use) was extremely knowledgeable about all the cheeses and guided us to picking four cheeses to share amongst the two of us. The cheese came with some fig jam, apricot jam, candied walnuts, raisin bread and figs. I am a truffle lover so my favorite cheese was the Sottocenere which literally means "under ash" in Italian. It's made with cow's milk and slices of truffle and then is aged in an ash rind. Love, love, love! Overall, aside from the slight hiccup in the beginning we had a great time. However, the reason I am giving Providence four stars instead of five is because we came with really high expectations and felt that Providence fell a little short of them. While the ingredients were high quality and every dish was delicious, my father and I both agreed that some of them lacked the "wow" factor that we had hoped to taste. I just couldn't bring myself to give them a full five stars given the price that we're paying for the food. However, I would still definitely recommend this restaurant for fancy dates and intimate family gatherings.

My fiance wanted to check them out.  The decor was great, service good, food presentation was nice but the food was terrible.  The restaurant is over priced!  Even if it were 1/2 the price I still would NOT go back.  Those liquior balls or what ever it was, was gross, my fiance who loves his liquor and food, hated it as well.  Great idea and presentation but NOT worth the the time, money and palette.  You want awesome expensive food, go to SLS in Beverly Hills, Bazaar by José Andrés.  I'll do a review there!

This is a very good restaurant.  The decor is superb and the waitstaff is attentive.  I've been here twice and I enjoyed the food but I wouldn't say the food is excellent.  The chef's tasting menu was tasty and had inventive dishes but I guess I'm more of a meat and potatoe type of guy.  On another occasion we ordered from the menu and had some hits and some misses.  The caviar was good but the blinis that accompanied them were just ok.  The best part of the meal on both occasions was the cheese cart and dessert.  The cheese monger lady (don't know what the actual name is) was delightful - very engaging, knowledgeable and helpful.  They provided excellent portions along with great pairings of fruit, bread, nuts, honey and what not.  This is an absolutely beautiful restaurant and a good place for a special occasion but they specialize in seafood.  Not that there is anything wrong with that/

If you want to be treated like a star you come here. But remember you will have to pay for it. Lunch for two cost almost $200. This place was a good atmosphere, excellent service, and delicious food. Please don't come here if you are in a hurry. It is defiantly a dining experience. We came here for lunch and shared a large bottle of Pellegrino and we each got a small plate of complementary bite while waiting for our food. There was a gelatinized mojito that reminded me of a sorbet, a spoon with what looks like an egg yolk but it was a sweet that was disguised. Also a shot of some soup with foam and a sort of a cheese bread.  Then we revived our appetizer of Salt-rosted prawns and a order of foie gras a la plancha. For our entrée we had seared scallops and some Wild striped bass . Then for desert it was dulce de leche-miso panna cotta and a cup of coffee. I am not too sure which coffee they gave me. I just told our waiter that I wanted something strong and rich. With the check come 3 small bites of complementarity candy. The presentation of the food was playful yet elegant. Everything was very good. I could have lived with out the dulce de leche-miso panna cotta. I thought it was overly simple and nothing special.

its taken me some time to get around to writing this review.  i dont know words that would do it justice so i've just stopped trying to think of the proper description.  goddamn.  its basically like you think "how good can food possibly be?  its just food.  there are only so many ways to make it."  you think that taste has to plateau somewhere on the food curve.  i've been to plenty of restaurants where i thought "wow this is great."  so going into providence, i just thought that it would be another great meal.  with nine tastings of wine.  but then the food comes.  and it throws your whole food-taste curve off.  suddenly that plateau spikes and providence stands alone.

WOW!!!!  This place is as good as it gets!  Very pricey, so maybe a good suggestion for a special occasion.  This is the restaurant you come to when you're going all out to impress.  They have glasses of wine that are over $30.  Just for a glass!  Anyway, the food here is amazing.  It ranges from $48 & up for a single meal.  They also have a tasting menu, which ranges from $95 to I believe $145, depending on how many courses you want.  They also pair it with wine if you'd like.  One of the best things here was the cheese plate!  OMG, it was amazing.  They pair it with figs, candied walnuts & fruit/nut bread.  They bring the cheese cart & you can pick what cheeses you want.  I recommend the tasting menu, as although it is pricey, you get to try more things & the cheese is cheaper & you get more.  If you order a la carte, it tends to add up.  Service here is outstanding, you are really treated as highly as the money you are spending, which makes it all worth it.

Providence was a really a wonderful dining experience - and I give very few 5 stars. My husband and I had the 9 course tasting menu and I had the wine flight as well. The meal was paced over a little more than 3 hours and while not every dish was a home run, many were memorable and amazing.  The salty sea urchin served in an eggshell was wonderful. And one of the amuse brouche dishes was this tangy shot of chilled carrot soup. I must say that on a non tasting menu I would never order carrot soup or sea urchin, but then that's the fun of a tasting menu. A few other favorite dishes were the sea scallops with super crispy, toasty almond crumble and the cheese course. Cheese is my favorite food and I appreciated the generous portion and the enthusiasm and knowledge of the server. All of the staff was attentive and nice. At one point I asked a wine question which our server couldn't answer, and the wine sommelier was at the table within about a minute to help. But I love food and asked a lot of other questions about the dishes and their preparation, to which our servers were able to answer.  I loved the cucumber mint palette cleanser (it doesn't sound great but it was so refreshing) and the salt and pepper ice cream for dessert. I loved Providence and would certainly go again when in Los Angeles if budget allowed. Oh yea - it was expensive!  Our total bill with tip and pre dinner cocktails was around $450.

This place is very romantic. Been here with love of my life, had a very romantic and a wonderful time. We had a little problem finding the restaurant so we called up to let them know that we'll be late. We were told that the kitchen closes at 9 P.M and asked us to make it before 9. The lady was kind enough to give us directions. The lady at the front gave a warm welcome, the feel good kinda welcome.We were then seated at the table. The interiors are very well done, looks very classy. Person taking care of us came to our table and greeted us, gave us the menu and detailed it as we went thru. We ordered some drinks and placed an order for dinner. First We were served with the tomato soup shot and little starters kinda food, it was complimentary and was really good.Then comes our green salad which was yummy. we ordered John Dory for main course which was pretty good.The dessert was good too, i dont remember the name though. It had strawberries, mascarpone cheese and sorbet. Highly recommended if you want to take your loved one to a nice romantic dinner.

The service was great, one of the better individuals I listened to throughout the night.  Some could come off as pretentious but that goes with the venue.  The Food was great but a little over valued as others have mentioned $35-40 for a piece of fish (sometimes not even local, an old trick of the Water Grill).  We enjoyed our meal and the next time somebody else is hopefully paying.

3.5 stars to be precise, 4 for the food, and 3 for the service, it's important to note I am comparing Providence only to other Michelin two star restaurants in the U.S. and overseas, therefore the standards are high.  We visited on a Friday evening with a 6:30 reservation, the dining room was half empty around 7:00 but filled up quickly, four market specials were featured, since it's our first visit, we opted for the tasting menu; all the dishes the chef presented were prepared nicely with seasonal ingredients, good presentation, the tastes were balanced yet nothing wowed; regarding service, lots of servers ran around in the dining room, all seemed busy and deep in thoughts, no doubt they all take their job very seriously, alas when it comes to some basic services, such as refilling hot water in the teapot, it took several gentle reminders to get the task done; in addition, it became redundant to ask for permission to remove an empty plate after each course.  Overall, we enjoyed our dining experience and had a lovely evening.  Will we return again?  Maybe, but for sure not in any hurry.

easily the best seafood restaurant in LA if not the best restaurant period. Flavors are off the charts and the food is some of the prettiest you'll lay your eyes on. Service is excellent and appropriately not stuffy. We had the chef's tasting which was a revelation but ungodly pricey. The 7+ savory courses included some of the best dishes I've ever tasted. The cheese cart had some fantastic, hard to find stuff. Desserts were good but not great, creative, but I wanted something with dough or crust or something and there was none of that. Overall this place is genius, I hope they keep doin what they do.

So I went here because it was recommended by a close friend who is also a TV star. He said they have the best seafood in LA, and I can tell you now....they do!!! I went on a Tuesday night, wasn't too busy, but it was definitely full. Got seated after a drink at the bar... the drink and the bartender were amazing. She was very personable and made a great Bourbon drink up on the spot that I will not soon forget. Sat down and had the 9 course tasting, but with extra courses it came out to be about 11 courses. Everything was super tasty, and just kept getting better. I am not a fan of salmon, but this salmon dish they had has turned me into a fan. The veal at the end was the best I have ever had. Service was not stuffy at all... our servers (there were many) were all very professional but also very friendly. Not snooty at all. I will definitely recommend this place to everyone I know, and even those i don't!

I went here with a date and we both opted for the tasting menu w/ wine pairing.  We both agreed that the food, service, and ambience were exceptional.  While I'm more of a blue collar food junky, I can appreciate meals like this.  The presentation was very creative and I was pleasantly surpised by the dishes.  Chef Michael is definately thinking outside of the box.  Incidentally, he found time to come visit with us for a minute and ask us if were were enjoying everything.  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves food.

I went to Providence for a birthday with a close friend. We did a full tasting with wine pairings, and the waiter recommended that we do the market specials in a tasting format. It was excellent. The truffle risotto was beyond amazing, and the wine pairings were quite good. Although I have had more creative courses at other restaurants, this was by far the best service that I have had in LA. Every course was perfectly timed with thorough explanations of all the dishes and the wines.

This place is amazing. The service is fantastic. Food is to die for. This place has the best foie grais I have ever had. Wine pairings are great. Not sure what to take, try the 5 or 9 course menu. Craving just dessert, try the dessert pairing menu. This place is off the hook. Host at the door is a little rude but I can pass that once I am sat. Mixed drinks are great. I cannot stop thinking about the great food this place has to offer. The owner walks around making sure everything is good. The co-owner is Michael who was on Iron Chef American and actually beat Morimoto. He specializes in seafood and you can taste it.

We headed here on an expense account so I was super excited. I knew it was a pricey place so there are no boundaries on an expensed dinner. We checked out the prix fixe menu but saw so many other things that we wanted to try so we decided to just order off the menu & not do the recommended prix fixe (we ended up spending more than we would have just sticking to set courses). I can't remember everything I got but the highlight for sure was the homemade pasta with black truffle. They brought out a box to the table, opened it up & inside is a black truffle. The waiter shaved it right over my pasta at the table. Love it! So delicious. I don't think I've EVER had a better pasta dish. We sat out on the side of the restaurant which almost felt like a covered patio. I would have rather sat inside the main room but oh well. The service was great & another highlight was the nice little homemade chocolates they brought. Oh I almost forgot their dessert is also amazing. I got a banana bread pudding type dessert that I liked but my husband got the sorbets & one was a this amaaaaaazing apple flavored sorbet with little bits of caramel pieces. To die for.

Very good restaurant. Service was very professional as soon as you walk through the door. Had reservations and our table was ready to go as we arrived. Our server had the whole menu memorized...impressive. We went with the five course tasting and wine pairing since we heard 5 courses was the right amount of food and sure it was. With the "gifts from the kitchen", bread, and wine it was plenty. However, if you want pure glutinous indulgence go with the 10 course and order the wagyu starter. Of the five tastings, my faves were the scallop and the veal. Both were perfectly cooked, textured, and tasted great. The halibut and Japanese Kanpachi were very good as well. The wine pairings enhanced or unlocked the flavors of each tasting or vice versa(?). NOTE: If you or your date are a light drinker, save some $'s and get one wine pairing and try one of their famous cocktails instead :P I'd definitely go again.

This was my first two star Michelin experience and Providence lived up to my expectations.  I was lucky to get a reservation for the Chef's Table, which is in its own private room separated by a glass wall from the kitchen.  We were able to see into the kitchen and watch as the chefs prepared our food.  Unfortunately, it was Chef Cimarusti's birthday and he was off that night.  We ordered the full tasting menu ($110/pp) plus the wine pairing.  Every dish was well prepared and full of flavor and creativity.  My first sea urchin experience left me craving seconds and was my favorite dish on the menu.  The mojito raviolo was an unexpected burst of flavor as it exploded in my mouth.  The whipped potatoes that accompanied the lamb were silky smooth.  The Hokkaido scallops were super meaty and perfectly cooked.   Providence earns a place in my top 3.  It's too bad that I can't go back more often.

love love love this place!  this is my it place to go.  i've tried both tasting menus, but the 9-course may be a bit over the top as we could not finish our meal.  they start you with delicate amuse bouche.  my favorite to date is some sort of smoked trout (hey, what do you expect? there was drinking involved).  the kanpachi, veal, and wagyu beef are all AMAZING!  at the end of my meals, i have the cucumber sorbet.  so wonderful (to my surprise) and uber refreshing.  love it!

My wife and I went here on our 3 year anniversary. When it was on I was a huge fan of Daniel Boulud's show  After Hours. Providence always stood out to me. I ordered the five course meal and the spot prawns. My wife ordered the seven course meal. I was surprised and a little worried about this thinking that she was going to get more than I was. I tried everything that she ordered and she tried everything that I ordered. The "chowda", the veal, the fresh bacon bread, and the spot prawns are the things i vividly remember.  The chowda was the best that I have ever had. It was so savory and rich. The bacon bread was awesome still warm from the oven. the veal was tender and cooked perfectly. The spot prawns were a presentation at your table. They are put in a castle of 500 degree salt for a few minutes then removed and prepared by the maitre d' with a lemon infused olive oil. Each course was accompanied by excellent wine. We finished the meal with a cheese course. A meal I will never forget.

Excellent restaurant.  Large portions.  Makes the portions at Bouchon look like half orders.  I had the terrine of foie gras.  Large slice of yummy, fatty goodness.  It was hard to finish, so rich and buttery, and so much of it.  The couple who we dined with had the seared foie gras preparation, just as good.  Nice caramelization crust, melting inside.  My wife had perfect diver scallops.  For the entree I had the wild bass.  Providence is known for its seafood.  And it was superb.  Tender, nice pan seared crust.  Flavorful broth.  And once again, not stingy on the portions.  Yes, you pay, but some restaurants at this price point give you a tiny taste.  Not the case here.  My wife had the American wagu, so good.  Tender, flavorful, dissolves in your mouth.  The cocktails were great, strong and beautiful combinations.  Service was excellent.  Loved the bacon bread, and they didn't stop serving it.  All in all if you want to give up a significant portion of your pay check, this is one of those places.  Earns each of its two Michelin stars!

I can't express how much I love this restaurant. I've been here on two occasions now, and both visits have been nothing but exceptional. The first time I went,  I had the 9 course tasting with wine pairing, which was amazing and highly recommended if it's your first time. I recently returned again for a special occasion. After suffering from a major food coma the first time around, I decided to go for the 5 course tasting + an a la carte item on this visit. This was more than enough food, and I left feeling comfortably full. The 5 course tasting included 4 amuse bouches, japanese kanpachi, sea scallops in dashi butter, wild striped bass, sous vide veal tenderloin, banana bread pudding, and lastly the traditional petit fours. I also ordered the foie gras ravioli (GET THIS!!!). A lot of the same proteins were used on both visits, but prepared differently. Every single dish I had was delicious, but my favorites were the kanpachi, sea scallops, veal tenderloin and foie gras ravioli. The bacon bread is also a must!! I had to stop myself from calling the bread guy over repeatedly. This is definitely a special occasions restaurant, as the prices are on the higher side, but it is so worth it. This is my favorite restaurant in LA.

I went to Providence some months back and the details are somewhat hazy but I had to write this review to counter some of the negative reviews I've read. The waiters were attentive but not annoying. The sommelier was not a condescending SOB... In short, wonderful service. And the food, the food was divine. For $600 for two it should have been... but I have no complaints.

(star rating rounded up from an intended 3.5) the praise for this place is excessive--providence isn't one of the best/nicest/most amazingest (...) restaurants i've been to.  it's certainly very good.  apparently this is the best l.a. has to offer in the way of fine dining.  outside of that label, providence is among the better restaurants i've been to in the city.   providence's exterior is a hulking mass, a rather kitschy thing resembling a boat.  the interior isn't much better.  as far as appearance is concerned, providence is bourgie, nautically themed hell, a high-end red lobster. luckily its lacking decor isn't indicative of the quality of the food.  the trio of amuses are as whimsical and immaculate as any i've had, though the set was a bit one-note in that all three were sweet (gin and tonic, mojito, cold carrot soup).  i was a bit miffed when i heard another table's amuses being described that were not only different but seemingly more appetizing.  breads were fine; the nori foccacia stood out, disappointed by the bacon brioche.  the tasting menu is a nice, well-conceived procession of pretty great dishes.  not being a fan of halibut, i wanted to substitute that dish for the john dory but was assured by my waiter that it was the best dish on the menu, that chef cimarusti used it on iron chef.  right.  still not a fan of halibut, though this might've been the most perfectly cooked halibut i've ever had.  the pairing of young garlic confit and shiso, however, is questionable and unpleasant.  black truffle risotto was a little more aldente than i care for but who gives a shit when there's black truffle involved.  as they shaved more truffle on top of the dish, we were told that they just received them an hour prior to the beginning of service.  the veal was perfectly cooked. all very good.  little to complain about but not much to foam at the mouth for another bite of.  then it came time for dessert.  being a glutton, i ordered two.  1. a delicious coffee mousse with assorted adornments (that i can't remember) that all complimented beautifully.  2.  one of the best desserts i've ever had, a lemon curd-stuffed, cylinder-shaped meringue atop an almond cake with huckleberry-jasmine sorbet.  suffice it to say that the pastry chef at providence is a genius.   a quick note on service: average at best.  the maitre d and sommelier were very proactive and kind, while the rest of the waitstaff were awkward and stilted. fine dining isn't something l.a. does well, and while it has its own merits, providence isn't an exception.  that it has 2 michelin stars is confounding.  i'd go back though, if for nothing else the dessert tasting and to sample cimarusti's other fish preparations.  at these prices though, give me le bernardin or give me... providence, i guess.

Went last night for my bday dinner.  The market specials looked great so we opted to kind of create our own tastings off the a la carte menu, and our waiter was incredibly accommodating.  We started off with an amuse of crab over a creamy cool foam with roe and a gruyere gougere- it was the perfect prelude to our flawless meal.  I did notice that the couple next to us also had a moleculer gastronomy cocktail on their amuse plate, but I think it was part of the tasting menu they did.  We started off with the crab appetizer-- served in thick hunks pulled from the shell, over a micro slice of watermelon dotted with "seeds" made from black sea beans.. the crab meat was sweet and tender and just melted into the watermelon making a juicy bite bursting with flavor.  Next we each had three Santa Barbara spot prawns.  I'd never had them like this-- pulled from a bed of salt table side, meticulously butterflied and drizzled in olive oil with lemon slices on the side.  They needed nothing else... I pulled the meat in one sweep from the first tail, and it was incredibly sweet and meaty ...sweeter and more tender than the Maine lobsters I grew up on in New England.  Next we had the spaghetti alla chitarra-- with pea tendrils, ripe tomato, lobster and uni-- paired perfectly with a steel aged chard.  The pasta was cooked just right, and seemed hand rolled-- a thick rustic spaghetti almost square in shape and chewy in a good way-- it soaked up the uni infused sauce and the succulent lobster essence perfectly.  The meal hit it's crescendo with the foie ravioli topped with white truffles grated table side.  The ravioli was  a paper thin pocket holding a thick slice of foie that took on a delicately seared texture that just melted in the sauce and stood up to the beautifully fragrant truffles.  I would have ordered the sauteed had the waiter not suggested the ravioli, and I was so glad he did... it was the most delicate ravioli I've ever had,  and the flavor paired with the truffles and a sweet Marsanne was just divine.  We had the pastry chef pick our desserts-- a curry apple cooked sous vide with praline ice cream, pickled fennel, and soft cinnamon cake, and a tahitian squash polenta that made me feel like I was curled up by a fire in a Vermont Inn waiting for the first snowfall.  They were just autumn on a plate, and completely quenched my yearning for fall in l.a.  Chef Cimarusti came out to greet tables regularly, our waiter and sommelier were gracious, knowledgeable, and courteous.  We finished with three petit fours-- the highlight definitely a chocolate and cayenne infused marshmallow.  Go if you want an unforgettable gastronomic experience.  Yum. Yum. Yum.

How many Michelin star places are in LA?  Seriously, you can't go wrong with any of the food.  If you're eying a set course and not on a budget (since it'll break the bank at any rate), but you need to be somewhere after, be sure to ask how long the course will take.  Had to stick to the 5-course as we didn't have all night to eat, but needless to say, the food was amazing.

Well, I chose Providence for my 25th birthday celebration in my quest to hit up all the Michelin starred restaurants in Los Angeles.  My only mistake was following a trip to Melisse with a trip to Providence.  I'm not sure I'll find anything to live up to the best dining experience I've ever had (Melisse), but Providence was still amazing.   The decor is understated and there is a pretty muted atmosphere compared to the hustle and bustle of many restaurants.  The tables are spread out enough that you have a good amount of privacy.  I started with the crab appetizer which was delicious.  For my main course, I ordered the waygu beef which was probably not the smartest thing given that Providence is known for seafood, but I was stubborn in wanting something besides fish.  Waygu is sort of like americanized kobe beef which I was not aware of when I ordered it.  It was $20.00 an ounce with a three ounce minimum.  It came with potatoes in a little pot on the side, and the waiter cut it tableside which was kind of funny since it was only a four ounce piece of meet.  It did melt in my mouth, but I forgot all about the beef after tasting my friend's trout.  It was a brilliant pink color, and it was the best fish I've ever tasted.  I don't know what was done to create something so juicy and delicious, but I was absolutely blown away (and also jealous I hadn't ordered it).  My other friend ordered the sea bass which was also very good, but it was not quite on par with the trout.  Our food took a very long time to come which was fine, but the watier felt bad, so we received an amuse bouche from the chef that was an egg shell filled with soup, baby croutons and topped with truffles.  It was to die for, and the presentation was amazing.  It came in a little stand on a piece of wood.  Another amazing amuse bouche was the screwdriver and mojito combination.  Our waiter was fantastic, understated but always there when we needed something.  For dessert, we had the deconstructed bread pudding with barley ice cream.  It was interested but not really my favorite.  Overall, providence was fabulous; order seafood if you go, no question.

I went here for our 2 year anniversary, and I have to say wow!  We went for the tasting menu of 5 courses, with wine pairing.  We had 3 amuse bouches, which are complimentary from the chef:  a mojito ravioli (awesome!), a gin and tonic gelee (best jello shot ever!), and a watermelon and horseradish cold soup (average).  Our first course was tuna tartare, which I was kind of disappointed in since one can get tuna tartare anywhere.  However, the next course was seared scallops with a butternut squash puree with some kind of wild mushroom.  It was perfectly made and paired with the perfect wine (forgot what it was).  So creative and original!  Next dish was a white fish with cranberry beans (?) and a white wine vinaigrette; spectacular as well.  The next main course was veal in a soy based sauce with wild mushrooms and I think spinach.  It was the most heavenly veal I've tasted in my life!  Dessert was an almond cake with pear and a strawberry glaze.  It was new to me, but good, not spectacular; I guess I wanted chocolate that night.  We ended the night with a warm cup of coffee which they served with some candies on the side to complement it.  The bill for 2 people came out to be $300 including taxes and tip (20%). Overall, the food was phenomenal!  The atmosphere was perfect in the sense that the service was not overbearing, the waiters were so accommodating; they weren't stuckup or snobbish.  It was nice and calming for our anniversary.  I knocked off a star for the tuna tartare, dessert, and price.  But I would definitely do a tasting menu again!  It really introduced me to so many creative combinations and tastes that I wouldn't get at any regular restaurant.  One has to be cautioned with the fact that I might say course, but the amount of food served is equal to something served on a saucer, so please don't come to the restaurant starving cuz your appetite won't be satiated; only your tastebuds will be.  Or if you come starving, try the 15 course tasting menu (in which a gentleman across from us did, prolly costed him $500).  This place is definitely not the place to bring a huge group of people and get rowdy.  And last but not least, the wine sommelier and the wine pairings with the food was perfect; I couldn't imagine a better selection. P.S.  We had reservations at 6:30 but we didn't arrive until 7:50 ish bc of traffic but the receptionist was soooooo understandable.  He even told us to drive safely because he wants to see us.  I don't remember anywhere else being so courteous.

Finally got around to going here with some visiting guests, and, while I' aware that this is supposed to be one of the top three restaurants in LA, with due reverence noted in all non-5-star reviews, I was thoroughly underwhelmed. The food was good but by no means transcendent. The trio of cocktail interpretations in the amuse bouche were quite good. The rest of the tasting menu was hit and miss. The kampachi was good but unbalanced with too much fish and not enough of the other elements to stand up to its meatiness. The scallop with a watered down version of a curry sauce didn't crust sufficiently on top and was mushy. The Halibut was overcooked to the point of dry (albeit I didnt' find it too salty like the previous reviewers, and it should be noted that the Halibut itself is salt-cured). The veal tenderloin, however, was phenomenal-perfectly cooked, with each flavor, from the sweet corn to the peas to the morels to the chorizo jus fully formed and ultra concentrated. The desert was ho-hum. If you factor in the fact that we had significant wait times between courses, that dirty, finished plates sat on the table even though the restaurant was only about 2/3 full, and that the dinner started at 7:30 and ended past 10, even though there wasn't much revelry going on, and you get what could have been and off night for Providence, but certainly something that won't have this foody coming back. P.S. If you'r'e not having a cheese course with your meal, you certainly shouldn't have to smell someone else's.

Definitely as good as it gets, unless you're lucky enough to be eating at the French Laundry, Per Se or some other fine (non-Los Angeles) establishments.  Wonderful service, very knowledgable staff, fantastic sommelier, amazing cocktail menu (and wine list).  And now the food.  Their menu changes constantly, but I would highly suggest anything that lived in a large body of water.  I began my meal with the raw Kampachi appetizer and a half-dozen oysters, followed by the Foie Gras Ravioli. My entree was the Arctic Char and I have never had a fish cooked so perfectly in my life. It melted in my mouth and was seasoned beautifully. We also had the duck breast, which was cooked to perfection as well. For dessert we had a deconstructed Cheesecake and a Chocolate mousse, which were both divine.  By far the best meal of my life so far.

bf and i did the full (9) course tasting menu. we were over the top full afterwards. next time, we'd opt for the 5 course tasting. i'd also recommend sharing the wine pairing.  with the full course dinner, 9 glasses of wine b/t the 2 of us was plenty. it was so much wine, the bf stopped drinking towards the end. yes, word to the wise- save your money and have only one person get the wine pairing. you don't need me to tell you that the food is delicious and the service supremely attentive as the other reviews already say so.  just go. do the tasting, you will not be sorry. every single one of the dishes delighted my palate and surprised my senses in its flavor, texture, temperature, and combinations of thereof.  this is food elevated. i was impressed by the wide range of techniques used in the dishes, though the foam was a bit repetitive.  i've never tasted lobster so sweet, veal so tender, and truffles so generous. highlight of the evening was the chef coming out and personally going around to each table thanking us for our patronage and asking for feedback on the food. lastly, since they were 45 min behind on seating us, they sent us home with a free box of chocolates. sweet indeed!

We had the 5 course tasting w/wine paring. It was very good, as you would expect. As far as I am concerned the decor is o.k., if not somewhat dated, the barnacles crawling on the walls are cheesy to me, as well as the beaded coral candle holders, seemed cheap. The service is good, but to be expected at that caliber. The black bass was way too salty.The veal was amazing, a bit too rich, but really quite superb. Overall, It was a great dinner and solid, good ingredients, well prepared etc. but lacked creative flare. It was a bit heavy, I wished they had a couple of lighter dishes, to lighten all the seafood, and meat. A great dinner, but nothing to write home about.

A group of friends and I came here for dinner on a Sunday night. I've always wanted to go to a Michelin Star star restaurant so we decided to go since we were visiting LA. We decided to go a la carte rather than do the chef's tasting menu. We ordered the caviar, prawns, chowder, and scallops for apps. The chowder had an overwhelming amount of bacon in it, so I would not recommend that, but everything else was great. For our entrees, we ordered the lobster, low on the hog, and salmon. I had the salmon and it was a bit undercooked for my taste, but it was still pretty good. My friends enjoyed their dishes as well. My only main problem is that it took forever for our food to come out. Our dinner ended up being 2.5 hours long. I think that's just too long for one dinner when it's just a small group of 4. They did try to compensate with this alcohol gelee plate, but nonetheless, we were not all that ecstatic with the ling wait time. With that exception, everything else was great.

Hands down the best meal I've ever had! We came here for a girlfriend's 30th birthday and were pleasantly surprised and greeted with an invitation to dine at the chef's table since a party had cancelled. The staff was unbelievably kind and totally down to earth dealing with five rowdy ladies and even threw in an extra amuse bouche of those three gelatin cocktail shots since we loved it so much. The food was to die for - meticulously prepared and the combined flavors were original and delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to enjoy a fine dining experience that will dazzle your taste buds.

High class all around.  The decor, service, presentation and food were all outstanding!  Great place for a special night.  Spacious and quiet with outstanding service.  Really appreciated the surprise between courses.  They brought an amuse to the table that was dairy and when we told them that we didn't eat dairy they returned with two incredible surprises of liquor filled palate cleansers.  Everything from the chilled milk server to outstanding but not overbearing service was great.  The food was all outstanding.  Deserving of their Michelin 2 stars!

I'm not sure if it was an off night, but I have a different perspective on this restaurant. The atmosphere is very nice and we got to our table nicely.  The server we got that evening almost didn't seem as if he wanted to be there or wanted to help us.  The decor was warm and inviting enough.  We ordered the starter which took an hour to get to our table and no one let us know anything about the problem.  I had to finally ask what was the hold up and then an apology was given.  Although we had not seen any food, it seemed as if we had a buffet at our table because the other servers, although very kind, swarmed us like flies with nothing to do but fill our water up just barely inches.  The starter finally arrived and was disappointing and flimsy.  You would think for $25, the portion would have been large enough for a taste.  Not very flavorful as well.  The main course arrived.  The Artic Char was fantastic, wonderfully cooked and the high light of the evening.  The desserts were terrible!  Come prepared for a small meal.  This restaurant is about taste only.  I will say I appreciate the general manager for apologizing for the bad experience.  I'm not sure what the hype is for this place.  I have been to many restaurants.  I wasn't very impressed with Providence.  If you are wanting a dining experience with fun, laughter, great food and a fun, non pretentious atmosphere, do NOT come to Providence.

for a special evening, you cannot go wrong at providence, imho.  was it worth it?  dunno, but the dining experience equalled the special occasion. let me first say i was disappointed with the amount of money spent here.  let me now qualify this by saying that the whole experience rocked!  the service was super and friendly, and the food/wine were crackin'!! you've heard it before from other yelpers, but had to submit a review (though it's been a good 1/2 year since), to really give the restaurant props.   after a bit of fence-sitting, we opted for the 9 course tasting.  here's the line-up: amuse gin/tonic (jelly) amuse gin/tonic mojito ravioli watermelon soup japanese kanpachi/shiso leaf: cucumber base, light, fresh, and awesome bobby's block island sea scallops/palm/smoked bacon: wonderful rich melange of flavor maine lobster: again with a gelatinous accompaniement; tasty king salmon: w/ a sake infusion foam veal/morel: wonderful, with artichoke accompaniement market cheeses: great variety, but one really stood out; a Luciano-Corsica cheese, white w/ mushroom accents, was "da bomb"!! dessert The wine pairings were top notch, in my opinion.  I can't recall them all (I'm a Pinot guy myself, way before "sideways", thank you very much) except a delicious 2002. Nebiollo from Martin and Weyrich winery in Paso Robles.  I loved the Bourbon nose and finish! all in all, a wonderful explosion and melange of flavor to be had during our 3.5 hour experience!! and thanks, yelpers, for the heads up on the valet parking; found a nice spot less than 1/2 block away.

Is there any better place in Los Angeles? Maybe. Is there a place that provides a consistent, superior dining experience? Definitely not. For the first time, I tried a la carte and I wasn't disappointed. The wine pairings were excellent, the asparagus and 65 egg (If you don't know what it is, you missed it) were spot on and my business partner left happy and refreshed. I'll be back. Very soon.

By far, the best restaurant in L.A. With Donato in the dining room and Michael in the kitchen and the impeccable service from the staff in general, it is head and shoulders above Patina, Spago, Lucques, Matsuhisa and Melisse. If the latter are worth Michelin 2 stars, then Providence is worth 4. Of course, there is no such accolade, then I guess I have to settle for 3. Among the comparisons, Michael is the only true culinary artist that have not sold out to commercialism and fame and lost himself along the way. The same applies to Joel Robuchon, an even sadder example, but that is a different discussion. This is sadly the only restaurant left in L.A. that I will still try to go to once a month, even though it stresses my wife out because of the drive.

I took my fiance here for an anniversary dinner, and the experience was fantastic! We ordered the 9-course tasting menu prepared by Chef Cimarusti, who is an amazing and inventive chef. Each dish was prepared exquisitely and the order of the dishes progressed really nicely for our palates. We didn't do the wine pairing, but it was still very enjoyable. Our favorites were the scallops and the artic char, and I for one, was licking the plate clean. The combination of flavors were absolutely orgasmic in the mouth. After the main courses, the waiter brought the cheese cart out and helped us pick different cheeses to try-we picked a sheep-milk cheese and two cow-milk cheeses to add to our baguettes. The desserts were a great way to end an amazing meal. We didn't get to meet Chef Cimarusti, but the floor manager came over to talk to us during our meal (which was a very nice gesture). Apparently, he told us that Chef Cimarusti went on Iron Chef and beat Chef Morimoto in the challenge when the secret ingredient was blackfish. I think one particular dish made it to the menu..? You'll have to check that out if you go....Overall, an excellent delicious meal. We'll be going back sometime. :)

fusion cuisine with French setting.  The food is for taste and for visual but not for filling your stomach.  It is also a restaurant to see and to be seen.  It is also fun to sit in the chef's table to watch how serious the crews are in the kitchen.  Chef Michael used to work in Water Grill but he turns this restaurant into different level.  It is easy to spend several hundred dollars here, but you won't regret it.

The 12 course meal.... an excellent experience. Have traveled and lived all over the world. If you are in LA and want to spend a few hours enjoying wine and food with good friends - this is the place. The space itself reminds me as if I was living in Twin Peaks... a good thing? You can wear as you wish, though i recommend dressing up and making a night of it. A good dining.

Deeeelicious.  Definitely a gem in LA.  My first time here was for a first date and I was definitely impressed!  Decor was okay, a little expected but you're not there for the surroundings. We opted for the full tasting menu plus wine pairings.  That's really the only way to go here (at least for the first time).  Everything came out beautifully cooked and plated.  We were no foodies but our uneducated taste buds were schooled that night.  The amuse was delicately tasty, not to mention pleasing to the eye.   All courses came at the perfect time, escorted by a waiter who had a narrative for each one (farm raised this and that, truffles from so and so...).  The flaky but moist halibut was my favorite.  The wine pairings also came with waiters who spoke of their pedigrees.  Surprisingly the wine portions were pretty generous, actually almost too much so.  By the end of the night we had quite a nice warm feeling and we didn't even completely drain all our glasses!  Dessert, which is always my favorite, was creative and kept coming!  Olive oil jellies, carmels, truffles, yum!  At the end of the meal, we were literally stuffed, which was surprising because when the dishes started coming out, they were very small (think, typical fine dining portions).  However, the full tasting menu had so many courses plus wine pairings that it really was an event to go there (3 1/2 hours for us) and you definitely left satisfied.   Aside from the food, the service was superb.  I would say it was on par with 3 Michelin star restaurants.  Attentive but non-overbearing wait staff, fresh utensils for each course, napkins that magically refolded themselves whenever you excused yourself from the table... everything that you would expect.  Definitely a place for a special occassion.

Went here last month to try it out. Got the 5 course meal. Flavors were pretty bland overall and 3/5 of the dishes weren't too great. Very disappointing since I was looking forward to this place. The worst part is the fish wasn't good at all. It had some weird crumb stuff and no flavor.......

We had planned a birthday dinner night at Providence recently, and I thought overall it was a very good experience. We were given 2 amuse-bouch's - which is more than I expected. One was 2 drinks in spoons - a screwdriver and a mojito, both excellent. Then we were served a creamy broccoli soup with a kind of cheese puff bread. Very good. I did also love the bread options and butter with sea salt! Deelish! We chose three appetizers, and I was not completely wow-ed with any of them. They were good, but not phenomenal. My entree choice was the John Dory, very good, you cannot go wrong with this. So Providence is definitely a great option for a special occasion dinner, but in my experience some menu choices were great, and others not so amazing! Glad to have finally checked it out though!

My husband took me here for my birthday last year (Sept 2009) and it was amazing. It was food like any other place. We got the tasting menus, he got the small one and I got the medium one. By the time half the food came I was stuffed, even though they look like little portions! The amuse bouche was incredible, a set of three tastes on spoons, each exploding flavor in your mouth (One was mojito-like and the other gin and tonic-like). The rest of the meal was amazing. The food was prepared in such a way that the combinations made flavors you've never had before. It wasn't just food cooked well or presented beautifully (which it was). It was food tastes that you've never experienced before which is what made it so unique. The only thing is that since they were new tastes it felt like I wasn't eating my favorite foods, but like I was eating someone else's favorite foods. The cheese cart was very funny because the restaurant is so nice and the cheese cart looks like someone made it in their garage. Which is why I liked it so much. It was a touch of personality. The selection of cheeses was amazing and the cheese person knew a lot. But by the time the cheeses came I was incredibly full and couldn't enjoy it to the fullest. The dessert was the only part lacking. There was some sort of neutral/savory-ish sorbet and some kind of fancy dessert. I don't remember what it was but it was subpar considering the rest of the meal was so good. But maybe it's because I like fruity desserts and these were not. All in all, a fun and worth experience for any foodies.

i will preface this entire review with the idea that i read the menu online and there was supposedly eel risotto in my future. but alas, that was not the case. there was no eel risotto on the menu the night i went. and whether it's been forever stricken from the record or merely rotates in the nightly specials, i was not privy to it the night i went. that being said, i had to "scrounge" around for other alternatives. this brought me to ordering the salman risotto appetizer and the duck entree. the salmon risotto was good but really i was just wishing it was the eel risotto. and it wasn't. the duck entree was good as far as duck is concerned. good flavor. tender. garnished with nice veggies. but in the end, i wasn't super impressed. and when you are paying as much as they are asking, you should be impressed just a bit more. the desserts there are tasty, however. graham cracker ice cream is definitely as good as it sounds. but all in all, i doubt i'll be returning to this place. unless they can assure me i'll have a date with the eel risotto that night.

Providence is definitely pricey but that's no surprise and it's worth every penny. I took a friend here and it was fantastic. We did a tasting menu with wine pairings and I was amazed - everything was paired to perfection, I mean spot-on. From the aperitifs to the coffee - everything was fabulous. And the service was perfect. I worked in upscale bars and restaurants for several years, and the thing that irks me about some of these places is the servers act like asses. But our server was just sweet. Really personable, not elitist, and very attentive (but not overly so, which can be equally irksome). My friend is a foodie, which our server discovered throughout the evening, and so he let him into the kitchen to see everything in action and seemed happy (I'd even say enthusiastic) to accommodate such requests. Pricey, yes, but one of the best meals I've ever experienced (and it *is* an experience!)

Hands down, one of the greatest meals ever -- which is saying something as we've had some spectacular ones all over the world.  Providence is one of those five-star places where every flavor, texture, and plating is handled with extreme attention to detail, grace, and sophistication.  The elegant but low-key modernist space was pleasant, though the roar of traffic from the front covered veranda interfered a bit with our dining experience.  We had the nine-course tasting menu with wine pairings.  Our waiter was immensely knowledgeable about the wines (which were mostly perfect and atypical choices including a Basque white we had never had before), and the splendid balances of flavor compositions in each dish.  We started with two amuse-bouches: a frozen mojito cube and a molecular screwdriver somehow made in a bubble format with the booze inside an orange bubble resembling an egg yolk, served in a Chinese soup spoon.  The second amuse bouche, a marinated sweet shrimp, a puff pastry gougere with smoked fish inside, and a chilled carrot soup topped with a passion-fruit foam.  Our dishes were small but spectacular: sea urchin served in an empty eggshell, in a silver bird's nest no less, with weightless scrambled egg foam; charcoal-grilled brined halibut; cubes of smoked steelhead grilled with a back-bacon layered coating on all six sides; kampachi sashimi over sun-gold tomato puree; perfectly round roasted veal medallions; and several others - all unique and wonderful.  The cheese course, unlike basically every other cheese course in every other elegant restaurant was so generous we could not finish the five selections given us by their equally knowledgeable cheese maven.  The dessert was amazing, tubes of dense chocolate ganache with salt and pepper ice cream and a glass of plummy Banyuls.  Note: Incredibly Expensive!  Our full meal, for two, was over $500.

Providence is without doubt one of the top three restaurants Los Angeles. It is really elegant without being stuffy. The crowd is sophisticated and includes couples, business dinners, even some families with older kids.  ( The meal is on the longer side and sophisticated so not great for most younger kids.)  The service and food are top-notch.  The tasting menus are excellent, if you have any specific concerns they are flexible enough to allow a substitution.  The portions are just right for very refined but still rich food, on the lighter side.  The food is creative and the sommelier was great.  I told him I was having a hard time getting a wine that was on their menu and he actually let me purchase a few for store as opposed to restaurant prices.  You could pay as much as you pay here for so many lesser restaurants in LA so while it's pricey it feels like you are actually getting a valuable and special dining experience.

My girlfriend and I went here to celebrate our 3 year anniversary. We had the chef's menu and order two glasses of wine. The decor of this place was creative, you wouldn't expect it after walking the surrounding neighborhood. The food here is great and so is the service; everytime we used the restroom our server would come cover the food and refold our napkin. Each of the course was different and unique. I remember a couple things I really liked, one was the wasabi marshmallow and another was a dish with a giant prawn and caviar. I did have a weird desert that did not taste too great, it was in fact a bit weird how the ingredients were put together. The whole meal took over 3 hours and the whole experience was great. Please note if you order the chef's menu you can ask to be seated at the chef's table which is a private room with a view into the working kitchen! (we didn't find out about this until after our meal) Although this place was a bit pricey, the two of us spend over $460, it was worth the experience.

I had heard about the desserts (and entrees) at Providence and after a sushi dinner with my bf for his birthday Saturday night decided dessert would be great - we were craving chocolate! I called Providence at about 9:45pm to ask 1. if there was availability for us to come in for dessert and 2. if there was chocolate on the dessert menu.  There was chocolate and I was told that if I was there within the next thirty minutes, he'd look out for me and the wait would probably be about ten minutes.  We arrived in thirty minutes and the hostess knew my name (although I didn't remember giving it!) and that we were there for dessert.  She said it would only be a moment for our table and it was only a moment!  We were seated and were brought dessert menus.  The wait staff was excellent; very knowledgeable and professional.  although we only ordered two desserts and a coffee, we were attended to just as much as others with much bigger bills!  The desserts were excellent as well as the presentation.  The French pressed coffee was also terrific.  We were very impressed that from the moment we walked in the door everyone was on par with each other and knew exactly what was going on and what we were there for. I heard a woman on a date (I believe) next to me say that her dinner was "exquisite".  We looked at the dinner menu and would love to come back and try.  Although it was brief, we had a very nice experience at Providence.
