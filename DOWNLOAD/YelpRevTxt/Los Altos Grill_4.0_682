Los Altos Grill of Los Altos, CA 94022 is a great place to go for a fine dining experience. The salmon dish is one of my favorite menu items here! And nothing beats a delicious salad (topped with amazing cornbread croutons) to start off the meal. Although there is sometimes a wait to get seated (especially on Fri & Sat nights), it is well worth it. The servers are very professional, and there is always a great wine selection available. As a plus, the overall ambiance is great - there's something special about seeing what's going on in the kitchen that your food is coming out of! Note: No health hazards/violations were noted at this location.

Los Altos has a special place in my heart, because our family restaurant used to be here. But please don't let that makes me go easier on them as someone who has a discerning taste on food. I was impressed when I came here. It is warm, inviting, and surprisingly lively for Los Altos. Los Altos is sleepy, but it's also like another world. I was joking to my dinner companion that all I see here are "suede and leather blazers" and "dark rinse jeans..." Warm woods, an open kitchen, and cozy booths greet you as the door opens. I had the Bandera Style Roasted Chicken, which made it an easy choice since that's what they are known for. Two legs, a breast, and a thigh and some Spanish rice. It was perfect paired with their spicy sauce. Companion had the Macho Salad - which I have nothing to report on, because I was horrible dinner companion and swallowed my food before we got to exchange tastes. The Federalist Zinfandel I had was great and was a perfect companion to my meal. Daisy, our server told me all their wines are curated by sommelier. We also had the Deviled Eggs side which was YUMMY. The subtle hint of dill made it perfect. Also the mashed potatoes that we ordered as a side just simply melted. DIED. But, if you do come here -- you can not miss: THE HOMEMADE OREO COOKIE ICE CREAM SANDWICH. The subtle hint of espresso in the pool of chocolate sauce it is served on makes it SOOOO worth it. Service was great, warm, and welcoming -- but she did manage to forget my sauce. Great people watching and a nice warm inviting booth to boot. I'll definitely be back.

I've been here a couple times and I can say the food is good but I expected a lot more. I've had the prime rib, center cut steak, and the ribs. The ribs are by far the best thing I've had here. The prime rib was good but I didn't feel it was anything special. I was really disappointed with the filet, as I ordered it medium rare and it came out more medium well, and the outside was really charred and tasted sort of burnt. I've talked to other people I know that have gone here and they've had the same experience when ordering meat to be cooked a certain way. I expect a place that charges so much for a filet to be able to at least cook it correctly. The flavor itself was good but I didn't enjoy it. As for dessert, definitely order the Oreo ice cream sandwich dessert! Absolutely delicious and compliments any meal. Now on to the service... I was not impressed in this area either. The times I've gone our waiter or waitress hasn't been very attentive and we often found our drinks empty and waiting a long time for a refill. After our food was delivered, we usually only got checked on once, and that was when we were ready to order dessert. Overall, the only things I was very impressed with here were the ribs and the Oreo ice cream sandwich dessert. I won't be coming here very often, as the food and service isn't worth the price.

Be sure to make a reservation, and even if you have one, show up EARLY.  I arrived right on time, and had to wait another 10-15 minutes before a table was available.  However, my friend whom I was meeting arrived 15 min early, and a table was available then.  But since they needed the whole party present to be seated, we couldn't be seated until I arrived ON TIME.  I guess everyone in Los Altos eats early because they were backed between 5:45-7.  After 7:15, it seemed to clear out and you could start hearing your own conversation, rather than having to raise your voice in order to be heard. As far as service - it was good. Nothing extraordinary. Food - Pretty good. My girl friend and I shared their grilled artichoke, a salad, their fish special and an ice cream cookie sandwich for dessert. Most memorable part of the meal was the artichoke and dessert.

Well this time my review is for their happy hour. For meals see my previous review. Went there for a happy hour last week and they were not kidding about it! It is very "happening" during happy hour at the bar area! I was there on Tuesday, stopping by around 5:30 pm as I had another dinner event to go to at 6:30 pm nearby. That was  perfect timing as it was not too crowded and I was able to get a seat at the bar area and enjoyed some chatting with others also at the bar. By the time I left around 6:30 pm it was packed and you would be lucky to get a seat, although there was plenty of space in the bar area to "hang out" with a glass of wine, so even without a seat it would still have been nice. The only thing is, what kind of happy hour does not serve beers or cocktails? They only have wine by glass so this is almost like a wine bar. I am not a drinker anyway so that doesn't really bother me but I can see for some it would not be a good choice if you are looking for some "serious" drinking here. Remember this is not just a "bar" but a legit restaurant and they have solid American dishes here that are well executed and worth trying.

Sadly, the Los Altos Grill has lost a lot of its shine.  I've had three bad experiences in a row, spaced out over about six months, and so I'm done.   All of the dishes that I listed on my previous review are still here.  But now they're served cold.  The kitchen either lets things sit around too long, or they can't manage heating something up to the correct serving temperature.  Chilly prime rib isn't pleasant.  Cold ribs are nasty.  The cheeseburger, which I used to love, is now a couple of steps below a fresh double-double from In-n-Out.   Service is inconsistent.  Appetizers arrive just before or just after the main dishes now.  The bar is slow.  Even when I have every intent of drinking many many gin-and-tonics, their service can't manage to keep up with me, and I only get a couple.  And they took my favorite red wine by-the-glass (Red Ink from Sullivan Vineyards) off the menu.   I've traded in the Los Altos Grill for Scratch in Mountain View.  They don't have prime rib, but they do have gorgeous short ribs.  Their rotisserie chicken is better.  They only do burgers at lunchtime, but they're a lot better than the Los Altos Grill.  The only thing I miss from the Los Altos Grill is the free corkage.

Came here to celebrate Valetine's Day with my husband on a busy Saturday night.  Our reservation was at 7:30, and even though they were packed, we were seated right away.   The waitress can by right after we were seated and we ordered our drinks right away.  She came back within minutes, which was enough time for us to decide in what to order.  We went all out and got the following for appetizers: salmon w/ mini toast, cornbread and prawns.  These aren't the exact names on the menu by you get my point.  For the main course, hubby and I both got the prime ribs. Appetizers came out in about 7 minutes (pretty fast if u ask me), and I must admit, they were all delicious!  Prior to the main course coming out, our waitress asked if we wanted to box out appetizers up or eat it with out main course.  I was a bit surprised by this because this is the first time anyone had ever asked us this.  A very polite thing to do, so yes, we had them boxed everything up.  The prime ribs can out and oh em gee - they were HUGE!  Normally this is the part where I usually say "that's what he said" but my husband beat me to it.  Presentation was nice and the taste was even better!  I had medium rare, which was cooked just enough for me to enjoy (i dont like blood) and still juicy enough to savor. Overall, this was one of the most pleasant experience we have ever had at a restaurant.  For the $150 that we had spent, we would definitely go back again and spend some more!

The service was great, and the food was good! I went here last night for a dinner with some co-workers.  The cornbread is definitely delicious, and very well may have been the highlight of my meal.  I would suggest getting a "meat" dish if you come here.  Due to it being Ash Wednesday, I was forced to have fish, so I went with the Trout.  The waitress did warn me that it was a "healthy" dish.  Boy, was she correct!  I am actually not a big fan of seafood, but it was good, although too healthy.  It was supposed to be "cajun" flavored, but I did not taste much flavoring in it.  Everybody who got the Prime Rib, Filet, or other meat dish was very happy. I would love to go back in the near future and be able to enjoy a piece of meat.  In fact, I think I will make a reservation to return in the near future!  It is worth trying, and be sure to get the special appetizer of a steak tip noodle salad if they still have it.  We ordered it, and it vanished in about 5 minutes! Oh, and the Oreo Cookie Sunday for dessert was amazing!!!

I've been going to this family of restaurants for years, not often, but on and off. I always enjoy my experience, but I have to say, last night was beyond expectation. Greeted by a very sweet hostess. Served a random champagne cocktail by request. Waited longer than our reserved time - everyone apologized. Toddler was greeted, offered drawing implements and paper, given a cup with straw and made feel welcome. Wine was discussed and checked on in the back. Food came out quickly. And they do not hold back on the birthday candles. Huge thanks to the staff on January 8, 2013. You made my night.

Bottom line at the top: food is pretty good, but the ambiance sucks because the live jazz music is deafeningly loud and the hostesses/m'aitre d are awfully snappy and so rude. I dropped a star for those two reasons. -- Here are some suggestions: Ask the band to play quieter.    I usually listen to loud music and I really enjoy jazz, but it was SOO loud here. I occasionally need to see an ear specialist and I can only imagine how appalled he would be at the noise. Unacceptable for an restaurant like this (primary customer are probably 30+). The band would occasionally bring it down a few decibels only to bring it right back up. We were seated in the far back almost as far as possible from the band and the four of us were still in a screaming match. Replace all the girls who are hostesses and the m'aitre d.    They are all so snappy and rude, and there are way too many of them. They awkwardly cluster in the entrance which is already jam packed and too tight of a space. To continually patronize you and try to teach you a lesson because you are a little late after calling them and apologizing and warning them is just petty. Other than that out waitress was very nice and our food came out lightening quick. The jalapeno cornbread is nice and crispy on the outside but I personally didn't find it spicy and I have a negative to low spice tolerance. The artichokes were smoldering at our table which was strange so I didn't try them. I would recommend the 'Kobe' style tri-tip if its available (it's a special and comes with caesar salad), and the loup de mer (butterflied and topped with Marconi almonds). The waitresses and busgirls are very snatchy with plates so pipe up if you aren't quite done yet. :)

Great prime rib, atmosphere, and we enjoyed the no-corkage fee policy.  Service was prompt and friendly.  The place was super crowded with happy late 20s-fifties peeps on Saturday night.  The food was great, as was the people watching.   I had the rotisserie chicken, which was not phenomenal, but my boyfriend had the prime rib, which was.  We both enjoyed the spinach side, and the artichoke starter, which was served with a really delicious aioli.   He said it was the best artichoke he'd ever had, but to me the charred-ness at times overpowered the wonderfully subtle artichoke flavor. Anyway, for dessert, we had the hot fudge sundae which was a generous tureen of vanilla ice cream, whip cream, and  nuts.  On the side, there was a silver gravy boat filled with delicious slightly salty hot melted chocolate/fudge.  OMG, that was the best sundae I've had.   Super fun, can't wait to go back.  And have the prime rib.

Occasion: Dinner with family What I Had: Grilled Idaho Trout ($25) Famous Cornbread in the Skillet ($6) Food Review: The Grilled Idaho Trout was cooked well: the meat fell off the skin easily, but wasn't too dry. The famous cornbread was what we had really come for, and I was impressed, mostly because I hadn't tried a cornbread with such a crunchy, crumbly texture before at other restaurants. And the jalapeno in the cornbread gave it a nice kick. Definitely a winner! Service Review: TERRIBLE. This is what knocks this place from maybe a 3.5 to a 2 in my mind. We had a reservation for 5, and once we were seated, the restaurant servers seemed to have nothing but a singular goal to get us out of our booth and let the next party in. Orders were taken before everyone was really ready, but that happens, so I didn't mind that. But then they brought out our entrees before we'd barely taken a bite (I kid you not) of our cornbread appetizer. Then our dessert arrived. With the check. Absolutely no class. My brother, who is a student at Cornell's Hospitality school, said that it took no less than 5 interviews and an in-house trial period to earn a position at the restaurant group that Los Altos Grill is part of. With multiple servers delivering such low quality service, I can't believe that would be possible. Even our leftover appetizer was boxed at the table, and my brother was asked to move to make it easier for the server to spoon it out. Venue Review: The restaurant was smaller than we'd expected, but perhaps that was just the low ceilings. The interior is heavy in dark woods, and combined with the low ceilings, the restaurant almost seem like the dining space of a ship. Parking was readily available in the lot outside the restaurant. Overall Impression: The additional star is for the cornbread. Otherwise, with such sub par service as we experienced, this restaurant made for a disappointingly 1-star occasion.

Having been extended an invitation to interview for a summer internship with Los Altos Grill's parent company, Hillstone Restaurant Group, I was interested in visiting one of their restaurants. My family and I had dinner at the Los Altos Grill last night and it was an unpleasant experience to say the least. The Grub -- * Famous Cornbread Skillet ($6) - Jalapeño Skillet Cornbread * Barbecued Beef Back Ribs ($28) - slow-cooked with Texas Hill Country barbecue sauce, served with roasted peanut coleslaw * Sashimi Ahi Tuna ($18) - seared rare ahi tuna with cilantro ginger vinaigrette, mixed greens, mango, avocado, and ginger * Oreo Ice Cream Sandwich ($9) Venue Review -- The property itself is rectangular with booths and two person dining tables lining the perimeter. The strip down the middle of the restaurant houses a long bar and open-air kitchen at the end opposite the entrance. Wood accents and a low ceiling make for a cozy atmosphere. Food Review -- The cornbread is a staple at the restaurant, so we ordered it expecting to dig into mouthfuls of steaming and moist cornbread with a spicy kick. Served right away, it was evident that the cornbread had been baked far in advance and was lukewarm at best. There were hints of jalapeno and the flavor would have greatly benefited from being warmed up. There's not much to praise about their food, since they're definitely not worth $28... Service Review -- The motivating reason behind writing this review was the abysmal service. As Sharon F. noted below, "This restaurant has so much potential but their food and service needs major improvement.  Everyone who worked there seemed like they were all still in high school (including the manager) which might explain some of the bumps in my dining experience." Los Altos Grill's waitstaff was sub-par (a generous description) and ruined our dining experience. To begin with, we felt very rushed with our order. The waitress (who did not introduce herself by name) asked us for our order and didn't recognize that we needed a few more minutes. The fifth member of our party had just come in from parking the car and hadn't had a chance to properly scan the menu but her attitude seemed to insist that she take our order that instant. We received our appetizer quickly which was no problem for them because the cornbread tasted as if it had been sitting out. However, before we had the chance to get through our first bite, the entrees came filing out. Normally a guest would not mind speedy service, but on top of the fact that we were rushed to place our orders, our dining experience was feeling more and more like that of a fast food restaurant. We tried to brush off this hasty service and dug into our main dishes. As mentioned above, the food didn't merit any accolades. Our waitress (whose name the check revealed to be Tareh B.) came back the second I ate my last piece of ahi tuna and without a word, took my plate and utensils. The problem here is two-fold. Not only did she not ask if I was done eating, but she reached over me to take the dish AND utensils. It's common courtesy to leave a person's utensils in case they'd need them again. It was very evident that Tareh had minimal if any training when it came to the service industry. Tareh seemed to care more about the bottom line than us, her customers. This is a problem that speaks volumes about management philosophy. The fact that she was rushing us through our dinner made it clear that she wanted to increase revenue by filling as many parties as possible in the shortest amount of time. Tareh was probably more concerned about her tip at the end of the night than the long-term loyalty and continued visits of guests in the future. One of the waitresses who came by to refill our water was also very unprofessional. She had her sleeves rolled up at the cuffs revealing unsightly tattoos that ran around her wrist as she reached for our water glasses. As we were preparing to leave, a third member of the waitstaff came by to box our food which she did at the table. To make matters worse, she cleared her throat for me to move my arm so that she could box the cornbread. We did not ask for the check which arrived at our table at nearly the same time as our dessert. Furthermore, we certainly did not expect to see a 16.6% tip already included. Overall Impression -- Having interviewed with Keith Clancy, a HR Manager at Hillstone Restaurant Group, I had decently high expectations for the Los Altos Grill. The service should match the restaurant, and Los Altos Grill definitely did not have this in balance. Had this been a casual chain for a quick bite, say Denny's, such a poor level of service would have been admissible. However, when a customer dines at a restaurant like Los Altos Grill, their check should not reflect just the food, but the experience as a whole, service included.

3.5.. I would come back, but probably not soon... Came here to celebrate my MIL's bday and really enjoyed the atmosphere here.  We walked in on some live piano playing by the door, the fire burning in the rotisserie area, and a huge crowd of people at the bar area.  Who knew it would be so happening in here when it was totally DEAD outside in the nearby area? With our reservation we were seated within minutes after checking in, and got a booth seat in the very back of the restaurant.  Although we were comfortably seated as a party of 5, we found our table space a little small once our food started to arrive.  We had to play some plates tetris to fit everything.. The menu isn't very big so it's not too overwhelming yet with enough options to please everyone.  We asked the server for recommendations and I have to say his recommendations were our favorite ones from the night so he knows what he's talking about.  The dishes that stood out to us were: Sashimi Ahi Tuna Salad: excellent fish, good sauce, and fresh ingredients.   BBQ Beef Back Ribs: fall off the bone tender Today's Special Fish: I forgot the exact name of the fish, but it was some kind of sea bass.  Very well prepared with brussels sprouts. We also had the corn bread, which was good but I was never a big corn bread person so it's hard for me to judge.  It did have a nice kick to it though. The rotisserie chicken was actually a little dry and not very flavorful, but the spanish rice that it came with was excellent.  We also tried the hawaiian rib eye and while the meat is done well and tender, the taste was a little too sweet for our liking (hence the "hawaiian", i get it). We thought they would do something for us since we told them we're celebrating a bday, but they did nothing, even after us bringing it up again when they asked if we wanted to order any desserts.  I know there is no rule saying you're entitled to anything for a bday celebration but let's be honest everyone likes to feel a little special on their bday! If they brought out even a cookie or a scoop of ice cream with a candle it would have just made that little EXTRA difference and made us feel so much happier about our first visit.. learn your customers' psychology!!  There's a ton of amazing restaurants in the bay area.. don't you want to set yourself apart?

My family has been going to Los Altos Grill for years and it has become one of our favorite places to come together and bond over some great comfort food.  However, if your trying to save some money, don't come because they tend to charge higher on food because of the FREE corkage fee.  So bring as many bottles of wine as you like because Los Altos Grill will not be charging! Ambiance: Good! The lighting is dark, but provides with just enough to make the environment feel intimate although you are surrounded by people when you sit. Food: Fantastic! I have gone here countless times and I have had mostly amazing dishes, some so-so ones, but never a bad one. Recommendations: Appetizers: Smoked Salmon Platter: This salmon is amazing! They smoke in house daily and the remoulade sauce pairs perfectly with the salmon on top of the cracker that it comes provided with. Best appetizer at this establishment without a doubt. The Clams and Sausages in White Wine Sauce: This happens to be one of my father's favorites since he cannot eat red meat. But make sure you come early for this because it is not on the menu and they run out of it fast. Cornbread: House made corn bread is great! its crunchy on top and made on a pan. Great for sharing! Entrees: Prime Rib French Dip: This is the best sand which I have ever had. The au jus and sand which is extremely tender and goes perfectly with the french fries. If your a fan of horse radish it goes with the sand which also. Hawaiian Rib-eye: If you feel like spending a little extra money I would recommend the rib-eye. As this cut is one of my favorite cuts, the chefs here know how to grill it pretty well. Personally I don't like my steak too sweet so I ask them not to glaze it because it is already marinated well. But if you don't mind sweetness don't ask for my usual request. Dessert: The Oreo Ice Cream Sandwich and Banana Cream Pie are great to share, if anyone in your party still has room in their stomach to eat. If I had any complaints it would be the wait, it can range from 45 minutes to 2 hours on a busy nights, so I would recommend you make a reservation. Remember do not go here if you are on a budget because you will be disappointed. However the food is totally worth the price and there is no corkage fee, so BRING BOTTLES, EAT GREAT FOOD WITH GOOD COMPANY AND BE MERRY!

In summary: 5 star for the steak, 3 star for the service I don't feel their service is as bad as many reviewers said. Yes, they do take the plate very quick, in the fact, the moment i finished my food, the plate would be taken away. However, considering their free corkage fee, it is kind of understandable. They also did not pull you wine after first round. Other than that, it's acceptable service. At least they did not take your plate away when the food is still there :) But the food, I'm so impressed by their ribeye. IMO, it's better than Alexandra or any high end steak house I have been to so far (compare with their ribeye but not Kobe :) ). It's very juicy and tender, and I also like the sauce. I am not so crazy about their prime rib, although both of my husband and my sister-in-law love it. The dessert is also not disappointing , specially for a steak house. I will definitely come back. It's a bit pricy, but totally worth the money.

Consistently fun, good crowd and energy. Minus one star for the long wait at times...but I have been going here for nearly ten years, and we always have a solid meal and a good time. It would be great if they would highlight more healthier (non butter laced) options, and if there could be more gluten free options as well (their cornbread, if it could be made gluten free somehow, would be a reason to come here time and time again). Regardless, always a great experience.

Of the many steakhouse chains I've been to, Houston's is pretty good - I've been to the Hillstone in SF which bears many similarities to the Los Altos Grill location, in terms of atmosphere and menu. I generally only order steaks at a steakhouse, and stuck with the Hawaiian Sea Salt Rib Eye, which was still a little too sweet in my opinion, and on the chewy side, but seared to medium rare perfection. The prime rib was good but ofcourse, the best is still HOPR's thick cut and juicy cut (House of Prime Rib) - then again, prime rib I think is an easier to please dish in general. If I were to return, it would probably be for the Filet, which was a huge hit at Hillstone. For desserts, I loved the banana pudding pie (Daily Special) because it was delicate yet rich and so delicious paired with a thick graham cracker crust and caramel, and topped with a luscious thick home made whipped cream. Though I am an oreo FIEND, understatement of the year, I thought the banana pudding pie was better than the homemade oreo ice cream sandwich, which was good but nothing special. Overall, above average meal (get the filet!), incredible IMPECCABLE service, and who can beat no corkage right?! Best steakhouse in the south bay for overall pure meat quality and top tier atmosphere is probably still Alexander's, but for a good alternative with more non-steak options that is less stuffy, I would recommend Los Altos Grill.

Came here recently with the extended family for my Mom's birthday. Unfortunately the night didn't start out so great. We had a reservation for 6 but thankfully we only had 5 for dinner. I say thankfully because the size of the table was incredibly small even for a party of 5. When our dishes were on the table, I kept wondering how in the world they would fit a party of 6 since it barely fit the 5 dishes. With 6 plates, one of the plates would have to be in the center of the table for all of em to fit. You call yourself a high end restaurant and this is the service you provide? Shame on you Los Altos Grill. For diner I had the Hawaiian Rib Eye cooked medium rare. This dish is the only reason why this place is 3 stars in my book instead of lower. I ordered medium rare and I was very pleased to see that they actually cooked it medium rare. It's a rarity nowadays to find a steak house to cook meat to your preference. The dish itself was too flavorful, the hawaiian style rub was a bit much and overpowered the taste of the meat. I do prefer my meat unsalted and unflavored usually, so take my comments with a grain of salt. The wifey had the prime rib, you can't really go wrong with this dish. I'd say this one is difficult for a restaurant to screw up. It's also an unexciting dish in my book so I'm withholding my comment here since my view is based on my personal taste more than the quality of the restaurant. Would I go back, probably not due to the bad experience, small tables, and high prices.

This is  one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area and my friends and I try to go atleast once every few months and have been for many years now.  The crowd is 40-somethings + and you will see nothing but BMW's, Audi, Lexus & Mercedes in the parking lot  when you arrive and even though the atmosphere is upscale (as are the people there) it's inviting nonetheless and we have NEVER had bad service or met unfriendly people.  The staff knows excellent service and if somehow something is not right or to your expectations, then they will fix it without question.   Every dish, drink or appetizer we have ever had has been delicious.  My favorites are: Grilled Artichoke appetizer or Queso w/chips, Prime Rib dip sandwich, Filet Mignon, Grilled Veggies plate, Hawaiian Rib Eye, and a MUST for dessert is the Oreo sandwich drizzled with their homeade chocolate sauce.  (We always ask for them to bring us some on the side to enjoy with our wine at the end of the meal and its so delicious you can't resist eating it by the spoonful).   The meats they choose are tender and will melt in your mouth, the ribs will fall perfectly off the bone and the peanut coleslaw will make your mouth water.  The bartender knows his drinks - I recommend the Pomegranite martini which is crisp and clean but my friend says he makes a perfect Manhattan too. This is a place that is warm and comfortable where you go to spend time with great friends or family or to just sit at the huge bar to chill, drink, eat, or chat with your neighbor.  It is loud so if you are expecting a very quiet and intimate dining experience, you might consider another place.  The entree range is $20-40 so if there are two of you and you have drinks, appetizers and dessert, you can expect the bill to be around $100 for two, but honestly its worth every penny.  Its upscale but not pretentious and there is a sister restaurant in Napa called Rutherford Grill which is just the same.  They only recently began accepting reservations, otherwise you can expect a one hour wait with a faithful crowd at 5 pm waiting outside for them to open. No worries aout the wait though b/c its more time to drink, enjoy appetizers at the bar and meet some great people which is just as nice as sitting at a table.  Its really that good and my husky pup loves it too because she gets all the hearty meat bones I bring home to her :-)

LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT! Prime Rib - Excellent Entire staff is awesome and we will be back again. We went to a sister restaurant in Sacramento, Bandera and its the same. Its delish! Its not really kid friendly but we brought our own little high chair for our daughter. Tip: Bring your own bottle of wine b/c they don't charge corkage fee - :)

It has been a while since I'm here. Pros: Awesome corn bread... you gotta try it. Excellent steak (we ordered the Hawaiian style but it was done perfectly) Ribs were good (not extraordinary) No corkage fee!!!  That's worth 2 stars right there. Cons: Above average prices VERY busy, must have reservation Rotisserie chicken - famous but imho, barely above standard.   Noisey All in all, it's a nice family restaurant even though you see  a lot more adults and drinkers. Just for the corn bread, I'll go back there again, but not often.

The prices are high and the portions are small. But the ambiance is very upscale which makes it an exciting dining experience and somewhat worth it. The staff is also very friendly which is nice. I like to order the salmon (very nice glaze they use) and their CORNBREAD is AWESOME!!

This used to be my favorite restaurant-  I ate there twice a week religiously because they had live music 5 nights a week, very good food and no corkage fee. I used to talk the place up to everyone I met. The workers are all friendly and courteous, although the nicest ones don't seem to last under their latest GM's watch for some reason. (If they are too friendly or good-looking it's the kiss of death, as per at least 6 bartenders I've known). They literally get chastised for talk-ing to a customer too much, even when it's slow. From what I could tell in three years of going there, the management is all about money and if you're only dropping 6 or 7K a year it's not enough to get the really good treatment. They're also very much like Town in that they demand cash or your credit card up front at the bar if they haven't seen you at least a dozen times before, which is an insult when you're respectable looking and dressed nicer than the manager herself (she's worn the same drab gray-green outfit every night I've ever seen her, short of once or twice, for over a year). So without getting into the food inconsistencies, which are many, here are 3 unbelievable experiences I've had in the course of the last two years there. BTW, I was well liked by the waitstaff there.    Their former GM, Eric, was liked by most people. On the other hand, cold and pretentious would in my opinion best describe his replacement. One week into her arriving I happened to order Prime Rib "Pittsburg rare" (which is charred on the outside and medium rare on the inside). I did everything right, asking the gentleman next to me who he ordered his from, then asking the same bartender to write it up exactly the same way. When it arrived I smiled and said "this must not be mine, as it's well done and not blackened at all on the outside" (Missing the mark by four notches). The manager shows up within seconds (which is their standard protocol I might add... forcing the managers or chefs to personally address every minor complaint  even when a criticism is only mentioned after-the-fact, and only after having been solicited by a server (in the form of "was everything all right?). Now this new manager had never met me. She stares at me, puts her hands on her hips and says (verbatim) "Well I don't want to order you another one if you're going to complain about that one too"). I said "Excuse me? I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that-  I'm not the one who can't cook a piece of meat the same way twice".  That was my first experience dealing with this GM. One week went by and she came up to me out of the blue and said "Oh Hi... have any problems ordering MEAT lately?". That was the second unprofessional Zinger. Now I'm thinking this lady has some serious issues so I mention it to my best friends who I've dined with there every Sunday night for two years and they make it a point to let her know in my company that they are landlords to several other restaurants in town, and lo and behold, all of a sudden she's treating me like a King.  Now comes the sad part... and my third unbelievable experience. My friend dies and apparently my "elite" status dies as well. About two months later I'm in there and the couple next to me begins a conversation about restaurants, and credit cards vs cash. I casually mention that the Grill has made numerous mistakes on my credit card bills, but that they're usually only a dollar or two, and in my favor, forgetting to add in the tip, which is strange, given they don't run the card until you're done. I also mention that they, like many restaurants, wrongly suggest that you tip on the tax -as well as the total- when you read their "handy reference guide to tipping" on your receipt. (Restaurants with integrity would never suggest that, and it's well known in the industry). Apparently this Mother and her son (who had been arguing with each other for 45 minutes prior to engaging me) went straight to you-know-who and complained that I was talking bad about the restaurant, taking the entire discussion out of context, as I'd given high marks to the food and  workers within the same conversation. Enter ms manager again. She gets 4 or 5 inches from my face in an effort to intimidate me, and says "I would hope you'd have the decency to look me in the eyes while I'm talking to you!". She then mumbles something about me complaining too much and she falsely accuses me of having brought in "open bottles" of wine before. I did decant a $400 bottle once in 3 years, 45 minutes before arriving there, but that's not an "open" bottle). I denied her accusations, and twice again she re-accused me. I then offered to bet her $1000 to her f*&^ing $1 she was wrong, to which she demanded an apology - (God forbid I used the F word in this day and age). I won't apologize for my response to her lies, and I refuse to patronize that kind of pathetic disrespect and unproffessionalism, which BTW cost her company a $6K+ a year account.

First let me state that this is one favorite places. However, last night at 9:30pm (2/2/2013) I went in for dessert. I was told by "guards" at the door that they were very busy and I'd have to sit at the bar. I quickly told her if you seat me at the bar I'm not staying. I should have left. That attitude at the door is a buzz kill. The reason I went at 9:30pm because as a regular, I know the crowd dissipates about that time. They close at 11:00pm. I am officially putting this establishment on personal 90 day suspension list. So Hillstone, thanks to your guard\hostess staff and the persons who trained them, your numbers should be off for the 1st quarter. Prior to writing this, I saw the negative reviews. I could not understand why someone would rate you any lower than 4 stars.

This is hands down my favorite place to eat when I'm craving the MOST AMAZING FRENCH DIP SANDWICH I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! (no exaggeration!). Food- Beef-top quality,buttery,juicy,cooked to perfection goodness. French Fries-thinly sliced shoe string potatoes,but it's the way they cook them that make them so UNIQUELY  DELISH! Their eat n peel shrimp are very good also.-always very fresh and served w/ two different sauces. Prices-They are definitely pricey...but  for the quality of food they serve, it's worth it! This place is YUMMY!

I went back and had my third consecutive bad experience here.   I ordered the macho salad, which comes with "roasted chicken."  When the salad arrived, I called the waiter back over.  I poked around the whole thing, and could find just one gray piece of something . . . I asked him, "is this the chicken?," to which he replied, "I hope not."  I asked if the salad was supposed to come with artichoke (really, such was its pallor), and the waiter offered to take it back and have the problem fixed immediately.  I applaud our waiter as being the voice of reason, especially considering what happened next. About a minute later the chef came out and asked why I didn't like my salad.  I assumed she hadn't seen it, but she responded, "I saw it.  There was an entire cup of chicken in there."  I was dumbfounded, because either I was hallucinating, or she didn't know what she was doing.  I asked her twice more if she had actually seen MY salad, and she insisted her food was perfect.  To put out bad food is one thing, but to lie to a customer that the food is good?  What did she hope to accomplish?  What did I have to gain by lying?  All she had to say was, "you're right, there was an issue, I've made you a fresh one."  Coming out to the front to challenge a customer and insist a false reality is counterproductive. I switched my order--being as my salad had been "perfect"--and resolved to never return.  To the blonde chef who can't admit a mistake:  your customers are not stupid.

Family favorite!  We just moved to Los Altos Hills and one of our first dinners out as a family, we ventured over to Los Altos Grill.  The week before, my husband and I had come for a date night and had an amazing experience.  Both visits we ordered the filet, it is divine. The beautiful crust on the steak paired with the buttery inside is exquisite.  We even asked for extra bourbon cream sauce as it was just too delicious!  They absolutely can cook a steak better than most upscale steakhouses we have been to.  Both times we ordered a bottle of the Chappellet 'Cervantes' '10 and for $38 this wine is an incredible value! What was most interesting in our second visit that we were a little nervous about is bringing our toddlers.  Our toddlers are very well-behaved and we bring entertainment to keep them busy.  But, we weren't sure if this restaurant frowned upon family-dinners with small children.  It was completely the opposite!  The hostess was kind and obliging, the servers were so sweet and welcoming to the little ones- they went out of the way to make sure the children felt welcome and happy.   Everyone had a wonderful meal!  The children especially loved ice-cream sandwich dessert.  We will absolutely be back!!!!!

I was invited back to try LAG again after my last review, and I was very impressed this time around! (my fiance's version of the turn-around: my Yelp picture is on a "black list" in the kitchen so that every time I return to a restaurant, they are more wary of me because they know I'm an Elite...the same thing happened at another restaurant that I rated poorly the first time around but became excellent when I was invited back...I hope this is not true! T_T) We ordered the following: - cornbread:  I wanted to give their famous cornbread another try because my fiance totally enjoyed it the last time we were here but I was not into it at all! It was much better this time around and was made with a better balance of corn and bread...I'm still trying to get used to the jalapeno but I'm totally okay with it because I know it's one of the reasons why it's so famous! - branzini with almonds:  I was suckered into the special for that night because I wasn't enticed by any of their menu items and wanted something on the healthy side as well. The fish was VERY tender and was well de-boned so I didn't have to worry about getting stabbed in the mouth, thank goodness! It did come with A LOT of almonds...which I thought was unnecessary and ended up being a little heavy for me, but my fiance loves almond and thought it was just fine... - rib eye with pesto sauce & fries on the side:  my fiance was also suckered into the special since he wanted to get the regular rib eye on the menu anyway & he wanted to try something a little different. The steak was very delicious and well-cooked to medium rare...the fries were also a BIG improvement from our last visit! Overall, I was very impressed with the food compared to my experiences here last time. Our server (who happened to be the same guy as last time!) was very attentive throughout the night and even automatically poured more water without us asking - yes, I did the glass test! PASS! =)

We started off with the cornbread. The cornbread was dense and a little dry for me. I liked that the corn was very sweet and the jalapenos were a great addition. BF and I also shared the: Rotisserie chicken with Spanish rice and sauce - good chicken though a bit dry, was nicely flavored with the sauce. Loved the Spanish rice that complimented it nicely because it was also flavorful and had bits of peppers and stuff in it. Prime rib with horseradish and mashed potatoes - Yum! Nice prime rib. Great flavored crust. Mashed potatoes were okay, nothing to brag about. We also got a side of sauteed spinach just for some veggies. The spinach was great! Nicely sauteed with butter and salt. Overall, we had a great experience here. There is constantly a few managers (That's who they seemed like) walking around. She knew right away when I stood up and looked to her that I needed something - to find where the restroom was. Great service! I like that the ambiance here isn't too upscale, but casual. It's also lit in a romantic way, which creates that atmosphere of a more classy restaurant. I love that they had a pianist at the entrance. Awesome!

I am surprised at the high number of negative reviews-ironically they are mostly about the long wait and lively noise level-signs of a local hot spot.Make a reservation and keep in mind how popular this place is.Service here is fast and young wait staff is really competent and well trained. I have had some amazing dinners here-grilling is the name of the game and they do it so well. Bring your patience and a great bottle of wine-no corkage fee!! My boyfriend and I have met great folks at the bar-waiting a little here is a good thing!

This is one of my family's favorite restaurants. We never disappointed with the delicious food, with great service. It's always packed, so reservation is highly recommended. Everything on the menu is delicious. Some of our favorites: - corn bread in a skillet - roasted chicken with spanish rice. The sauce is sooo yummy. This is the best roasted chicken - prime rib dib..my hubby's favorite - at times they have dessert special and for fall they have pumpkin creme brulee which is very creamy and taste very pumpkin-y Best part too..you can bring your own bottle of nice wine with no cork fee. It's be even better if they are dog friendly like the Rutherford Grill (their sister place) in Napa.

Ordered the prime rib for dinner. Nothing too amazing. The mashed potatoes were pretty bland. Knowing that this was a local favorite, I had very high expectations. But finding out that it was a Hillstone restaurant which also owns Houston's, I was kind of skeptical.

Los Altos Grill is consistently good - solid menu and fun atmosphere. This place is always crowded.  The ambience is loud and busy.  So much that sometimes it is hard to hear.   The lighting is very dim and jazz / piano goes on in the back ground. The food is pricey and somewhat basic, however, the food is always good.  I love the grilled artichokes and their burgers.

We weren't sure where to eat Tuesday night, so headed on over to the grill since its close by. Its quite roomy, but if you have a large group, don't expect to be seated at one large table. The 10 of us split into 2 booths, which was cozy but wish the tables were a bit bigger. Started off with some rose, cornbread, and the dip duo. The cornbread was definitley dense, not the best I've had as I like mine fluffier. The jalapenose were a nice touch though. The dip duo was guac and a queso dip with tortilla chips. The queso dip was different. It was like sour cream mixed with shredded cheese. I enjoyed it, despite it being new and unusual. They also brought us extra chips as we ran out quickly. The whole table went with burgers, and it's nice that you have a variety choice of sides. I went with the grilled colorado lamb sirloin. It comes with mashed potatoes, but I opted for the shoestring fries. There's also spinach included as well. The lamb was divine! Absolutley delicious! Cooked perfectly, with a nice char. Shoestring fries were yummy as usual, and the side of spinach (or maybe swiss chard? had way too many roses by then) was a nice compliment to everything as well. I got the oreo dessert, and it was good, but I didn't like the strong coffee sauce it was sitting in Friends got the ice cream sundae, and it was HUGE! and your own serving tin of chocolate syrup. All in all, everyone left stuffed and happy. Our waitress was a little off though, but good prices and good food. Would definitley be back.

We started out with the smoked salmon appetizer....fabulous!  I had the Hawaiian Ribeye with Colcannon Potatoes and Escabeche, it was delicious.  My boyfriend had the Primerib cooked to perfection(make sure you ask for horseradish and au jus).... and for dessert we had the Hot Fudge Sundae which comes with a seperate little pitcher of hot fudge.... Delish.  One tip... they serve very fast so if you want to savor your dinner don't order dinner til you're done with your appetizer otherwise could feel a bit rushed.  I also recommend the Ahi Mango Avocado Salad and the Grilled Artichoke, and the cornbread is fantastic.  It's loud, it's dark, it's modern, it's cool, it's has quirky pictures with odd little nuggets if you look closely, it's woodsy, it's fun, it's firey open cooking lookie loo spectacular.  The service is great.  It's croweded on weekends and ressies are recommended.  Love it my fav.

I never had such a bad experience with a restaurant until yesterday. I made a reservation to 9pm for a party of 11 to celebrate my birthday on Sep 15, 2012. We came on time but had to wait 50 minutes to be seated. (It was 50 minutes. I Looked my watch) Finally after we were seated, we ordered the barbecue beef ribs. We got something that taste more of the barbecue sauce and not ribs. Apparently they are loved with this sauce their. When it came to deserts, we ordered pie and been told that they run out of pie. Ordered espresso and we have been told that the machine is broken. What is going on? My expectations where so high due the high rates on Yelp and I have chosen this place to celebrate my birthday with my friends and everybody got disappointed.  The only thing left for us before we left was just to laugh. Won't go there again.

First, I suggest making a reservation as this place is a local favorite. Overall the service, experience and ambiance is good. Ordered the Cornbread as an APP - it is Amazing.  In addition, it is a meal within itself.  1 order can easliy serve 4.  Last note on the corn bread you can order an individual serving (not the whole thing). Ribs with roasted peanut coleslaw and mashed potatoes. I am a big rib fan and they fell short in my book.  The peanut slaw, although a tad oily is AWESOME!  If I knew in advance I would have passed on the potatoes and asked for more slaw.  Next time I will get another item but go big on the slaw. Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich with Jus and handcut fries aka shoestring fries.  The French Dip was really good alone - and the Jus is prepared very well, so together they are a home run!  The fries - in my opinion are not amazing and worth passing given the amount of calories they have. Desert:  We ordered the Oreo style chocolate desert.  I am not a fan of oreo deserts but this was pretty darn good!

Basking in the Sun and Corona glow at the LA Wine fest, the older couple next to our table at Lulu's couldn't help but crack up at our topic of discussion (the effect of consuming too many hot peppers) when they overheard my buddy proclaim over and over excitedly, "..and then...he literally went to the bathroom *7* times!!! *SEVEN*!!!" followed by a wicked cackle/chuckle, which we'll call a "chackle" for the purposes of this review. Sigh, Los Altos Art/Wine fest. You were slow, but entertaining. So the older guy next to us, now thoroughly intrigued by how one person could pop out jalapeño rings 7 times in a day, volunteered that a strapping group of us young lads should check out "the Milfs at First & Main and Los Altos Grill." I'd driven by Los Altos Grill a few times in the past so I was curious to check it out. First thing I noticed after we parked was the Fisker Karma hybrid sports sedan. Fits the Los Altos profile. [$102K, 0-60 5.9 seconds (w/ gas), for the curious minds] Two of my boys had already gone in and the tales of trying to find a spot at the bar were true -- doors swung open wide like Billy the Kid in a Western Saloon and they shook their heads, walking straight back to my buddy's busted Civic. "What's the deal?" I asked. "There's nowhere to sit." "I bet I can find us a spot" I said. I'm no stranger to adversity. I'm also no fan of hearing that something can't be done, especially if it directly impacts my Beverage Per Hour ratio. Unacceptable. Strapped on my cowboy swagger, walked up to the adorable hostess (Kelly), and a short 3 minutes later my group is sitting outside on the patio while our server Holly takes our drink orders. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Outside, only appetizers, drinks, and uncorking of the wine/champagne you bring is available. [If I had my own wine on my immediate person, however, I wouldn't be at Los Altos Grill during the Wine Fest in the first place; ya dig?] We only wanted a light bite to supplement our BPH ratio so this worked out well. Appetizers ordered: -Duo Dip  - chips w/ guac and this amazing hot pepper jack cheese/cottage cheese mix - totally worth it, if only to make a good story for the next morning -Nice House Salad - apparently not usually available on the patio but sweet talking gets you everywhere -Deviled Eggs - creamy mustard/chive topping - friend said it was tasty -Smoked Salmon - friend loved it -A few Vodka Sodas (a low calorie food) - i loved every single one of them; wedding date set -Stella Artois - need I explain? -Waitress' phone number Cool pendant lights outside on the patio; a combination of rustic wood and contemporary drum shade styling. Like it. Overall decor is a mix of Old Money and New - just like the clientele here. On the way to the bathroom I locked eyes with a really pretty blonde as I passed her.

My fiance took me here for a birthday dinner on Tuesday.  He picked it out all by himself, not knowing that I have actually had it bookmarked on Yelp for a long time, so it was a great choice.   We really enjoyed our meal.     We started with the "cornbread in a skillet" ($6) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).   I was skeptical of this because it has jalapenos in it, and I don't like very spicy food, but it was not at all spicy.   I think I would prefer it without the jalapenos (they have a weird slimy texture) but it was still excellent.   The bread was soft and buttery and the top was perfectly crispy and crunchy.     For my entree I had the rotisserie chicken with Spanish rice ($20) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  It was really good.  Rotisserie chicken is a pretty standard thing, but they did it very well.  The chicken was not too dry and the skin was very crispy and flavorful.  The rice was ok, a little spicy for my tastes.   My fiance had the prime rib french dip sandwich ($20) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) which he enjoyed.  I was surprised that they did not ask how he wanted it cooked, and it came out bright pink (he likes steak more well done).  I told him he should send it back, but he didn't and he still enjoyed it.  The skinny fries that came with it were fantastic too.   For dessert we had the oreo cookie ice cream sandwich (I think it was around $9).  My fiance ate it before I could get a picture but there are lots of pictures on Yelp.   It was pretty good, but huge and we were unable to come close to finishing it.   Unfortunately since it was ice cream, we could not take it home.   The hot fudge sauce that came with it was phenomenal and was the best part of the dish.   It was a true hot fudge sauce that tasted like liquid chocolate as opposed to just chocolate-y syrup.   I do think the food is a bit overpriced for such standard dishes and the ambiance is also a little less classy than you would expect given the prices (its pretty loud and my fiance said it kind of feels like an Applebee's inside).   Still, the food was uniformly very, very good and I would go back. (Best ___: Best Cornbread)

They have a really great wine selection and a full service bar. I believe the drink menu was larger than the food menu but it was worth it. You definatly have to try the Grilled Jumbo Artichoke!! Def a place worth comming back to.... great for a date night!!

YUM. Had this for dinner today. We ordered the deviled eggs, cornbread, jumbo shrimp, prime rib, rib-eye, vegetable platter, sashimi ahi tuna, and the sundae. Cornbread: Sweet, loved the top of it, creamy (it was huge though) Deviled eggs: Great, loved this. there were either 4 or 5 deviled eggs Sashimi Ahi Tuna: The salad sauce was refreshing - I think the most refreshing dish out of everything we ordered Prime rib: This was okay. Nothing was too special about it but still tasty if you're in the mood for prime ribs Hawaiian Rib-eye: Really sweet. I thought it was a bit too sweet but my mom loved it. Vegetable platter: They had cous cous, more cornbread. I guess this dish was refreshing as well but I wouldn't order it again (I would rather just get a salad) Sundae: this met my sweet tooth craving. Fudge was hot (you pour it on yourself) and the vanilla ice cream was a perfect match. Not too sweet so I wasn't sick of it. One thing. The airconditioning was so strong...not sure if that was just today though. The tables were all filled by 5 PM which was ridiculous but that shows that there is probably a reason for its popularity. Service was great too! And parking was easy. Definitely coming back here again for early dinners. The French Dip looks SO GOOD.   going to get that and the macho salad next time.

Although not all of the entrees we ordered were spectacular, the few that amazed plus the no corkage fee merits Los Altos Grill a solid 4 stars. Diving in deeper...I came with a group of five and we shared most of our dishes. The highlights of the night were the jalapeno corn bread (served in a skillet!), seared ahi tuna with mango/avocado salad, and the Hawaiian rib-eye. Seared ahi tuna was perfect and the salad was so refreshing. The rib-eye was marinated with a marinade very similar to what's used in Korean BBQ bulgogi with a emphasis on pineapple. The must-try of the night is definitely the jalapeno corn bread. The crunchy crust, the soft (slightly cheesy) insides, and the slight swift kick of jalapeno was top notch. The let downs: rotisserie chicken, beef ribs. The chicken was SO DRY. I felt like I was eating chicken that had been laid out to dry in a barren desert. Completely overcooked and needs more sauce. The beef ribs were more or less fall off the bone, but I was hoping at least for some real bold southern flavor. I got none. All I tasted was a reserved underwhelming barbeque sauce. I'd stay away from these two entrees. I would definitely come back to try the prime rib sandwich!

I love this place. It is the quintessential Los Altos dinner house. You never know who you'll find having dinner or a glass of wine in the large open bar. I have walked in to find old friends from high school. I LOVE that! Friends tell me they have dinner at the bar so they can people watch. I think this sounds like a great idea, but it does get noisy and crowded. Everything I have tried is superb. The French Dip sandwich is in a class by itself. The prime rib is far and above anyplace else in the area. A great meal is to share the grilled artichoke and the sushi grade tuna (with scrumptious mango avocado salad) and a nice bottle of wine. I tried to recreate the Mucho salad with a few less ingredients. I'm not a fan of the cheese they put in the salad so it might be overkill with the delicate chicken and rich dates. We are always too full to try the desserts but they all sound delicious. Next time...

We love this restaurant, great food, great atmosphere and no corkage... Steaks and fish are usually good, their caesar salad is great and unique, ribs are ok (when not too fatty or burned), cornbread is amazing and artichokes are one of the main reasons to come here.

Really enjoyed my dinner here.  Got seated pretty immediately, and I liked the dark, semi-trendy, very clean, very 'crisp' look of the restaurant and our table.  Our server came right away and got our drink orders while we looked at the menu. We shared the ribs and the burger.  We also got the cornbread, which is kind of their specialty..It's sprinkled with cheese and jalapeno, and its big and fluffy yet flaky and crusty. The burger is supposed to be very popular, too, and it was pretty great.  Great quality meat, fresh bun, and really good toppings.  Shoestring fries were a hit as well. Ribs were fall of the bone, but the portion was pretty small for what we paid ($20+). Overall, this is a great, trendy, hip place.  Great food, and great ambiance with the right combination of new money and old money.  Fancy cars in the parking lot, tables sending other tables bottles of champagne (you don't see that often!), etc.  I loved the open kitchen as well, and the bar is pretty big.  We went on a Monday in May and this place was packed!  That says a lot.

Great experience, excellent food (got lamb sirloin and French dip), properly grilled, everything was extremely tender and juicy.   The lamb dish came with lightly seasoned mashed potatoes and spinach, again, cooked perfectly- potatoes werent loaded with sour cream like a lot of places...you can taste the potatoes in its original form and it had chives (yum), spinach sautéed well. Cornbread was better than what I had in Texas.  Nice cold beer. This is our first dining experience there...last time left after a 1+ hr wait.  Reservation is pretty much a must if dining bw 6-9p, no joke.  Saw people waiting even close to 9p. A bit loud for a date but no prob if you're married and hubby spent dinner texting/emailing anyway.

I really like this place and apparently many others do as well as the wait most nights attest to. Very reliably good prime rib. The "nice house salad" is also an incredibly yummy salad with goat cheese and corn bread croutons. Their skillet corn bread has to have a stick of butter a slice, but it's well worth it. Very sweet, cakey and rich. They used to have a poke appetizer which they haven't had for over a year now, but it was awesome. The french dip sandwich, rotisserie chicken and bbq ribs are all solid choices. The ice cream sandwich dessert is always a great way to end the meal and it's big enough for a family of 4 to all get a good taste. This is a really great restaurant, the service is solid, very busy bar scene and it's a great looking restaurant too. It's a great place to bring parents, in-laws too where you can also have kids for a real nice dinner.

There is a reason why the Los Altos Grill is always packed. Now, in my opinion there's no reason why they shouldn't take reservations, but then again their sister restaurant in Napa wine country, Rutherford Grill, has that same policy. So do yourself a favor and bring a bottle of bubbles or wine with you (or two or three) as there may be a small or quite large wait for a table. Trying to get a spot at the bar can turn into a competitive race of figuring out who is paying their tab next - if you get lucky, kudos to you! I've never minded the wait here too much since they don't charge corkage, so I just start my night out with the liquid diet. The bartenders are great about bringing you an ice bucket for your bottle of champagne and refill your glasses steadily. Once I get seated in one of their cozy booths a feeling of "it was worth it" always overcomes me. As for the food, I have tried a lot of dishes here, but have certainly figured out my favorites by now. The Prime Rib French Dip sandwich is sinfully delicious. Meat, bread and au jus sauce - sound so simple, doesn't it? Well, it tastes anything but simple! Tender slices of heaven between a crunchy fresh roll that soaks up the au jus perfectly. Roasted peanut cole slaw on the side provides some nice texture and freshness on the plate. Another winner is the Sashimi Ahi Tuna served over mixed greens with mango and avocado. It is a nice light dish with some big chunks of perfectly seared tuna. Dessert is difficult to pass up here when you hear the offerings. On my last visit we picked the banana "split" - sliced bananas, banana ice cream, crunchy chocolate bits, whipped cream and lots of other goodness meddled on that plate. After that you can comfortably roll out of the restaurant and back to your car.

My brother was in town and treated me to a nice dinner out on the town. I chose the Los Altos Grill because they do the best Prime Rib hands down. At first he thought I might be gouging him by ordering the Prime Rib, but I proved him wrong when I share ed the center cut out of my Prime Rib and told him to put it in his mouth, not to chew, and let it melt. I think he became a believer after that. NOW he wants to do that again. Prior to we ordered the Duo which is a cottage cheese, pimento, hot sauce combination and their spin on fresh guacamole with nice fresh chips which accompanied our beers. My Prime Rib was accompanied by nice freshly mashed potatoes with Italian parsley and roasted garlic. No room for the signature Oreo cookie dessert, maybe next time.... Our server Matt was very genuine and provided us a very pleasant dining experience. Amazing vibe and lots of older hotties trolling the bar area. I was intrigued by the blue steel eyed manager that kept everything flowing and the gears meshing seamlessly. Great bar, even better food, cool vibe after all these years! If you are the manager I described please message me sometime!

I'd probably rate this restaurant a 3.5, but the NO CORKAGE FEE gives it 4 stars! I've been here twice so far. Tried the artichoke appetizer, cornbread appetizer, french dip sandwich, prime rib, and the filet mignon. All were good. The filet comes with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. It's pretty tasty. The filet itself was cooked perfectly on the inside, but the outside was too charred. The service is good. We brought our own bottles of wine which were opened after we sat down. Only complaint is that the servers pour too much wine in the glasses (we were drinking high-end wine, not table wine).   Live piano music is a nice touch!

Had diner last Saturday. I ordered  "Hawaian Rib Eye  Steak" from their menu. I don't want to address the issue of serving a steak marinated in sweet pinaple that caramelizes during cooking.  The scandal is that under the sweet caramelized pinaple hides the bitter truth: a cheap piece of meat ( probably a romp cut) that has nothing in common with rib eye steak. This is not only bad taste but simply put disrespectful for customers paying good money ( $30) , and one can call it cheating.

Where to start? My husband and I have tried going here once after calling the hostess and finding out that they were not taking any more reservations, but always accept walk-ins. Before I hung up, I asked how long the walk in wait was and was told about 20 minutes. When we got there, we were stunned to find people crowding the bar, the hostess station, and outside. The hostess then let us know the walk in wait was between 1.5 and 2 hours. Ridiculous! My husband made a reservation and we went last night. It was still super crowded, but we had a table far from the front door. I ordered: Lemon drop martini, the grilled salmon, cornbread for the table, and dessert. Food was pretty good. Not great, and definitely NOT worth the dinner entree prices. What I didn't order was FOOD POISONING. . About 1 hour after returning home I began to feel really weird--my stomach was grumbling, but I also felt really pukey. Long story short, I was in the bathroom off and on between 8pm and 2am. Not sure if you have ever had food poisoning before (I don't remember ever having it) but it is so gross. In fact, they owe me a pair of underwear if you get where I'm going with this. Not a delightful experience.

My friend recommended this place as he raved about their food but what drew me in was their no corkage fee policy. Whoo! I bought a bottle of bubbly to celebrate my sister's birthday. They chilled it at the bar until our table was ready, and it was served in the cutest flute-shaped glasses adorned with fireflies. I wanted to find out where they got these glasses, they were so adorable! Oh yes, I am supposed to be writing a restaurant review. Anyway... I liked their rotisserie chicken. I know, when I hear rotisserie chicken I think of the 7.99 variety, I'm-too-lazy-to-cook-tonight so I'll grab something ready made at the market kind of chicken. This chicken was quite fancy, juicy, well flavored, and tender. It's two pieces of succulent breast meat. The Spanish rice accompanying it was overcooked and soggy, unfortunately. Solid portions. My sister's Texas-style BBQ baby back ribs were quite yummy as well, but nothing out of the ordinary. Strong BBQ flavor. Accompanied by a good helping of mashed potatoes with colcannon and veggies. Like my order, the portions were generous. Yes, the cornbread was delicious. It was also very fancy. It came in a pie form, crispy outside and sticking to the skillet, and moist, peppered with green beans and corn kernels, on the inside. I recommend. The upside? The simple menu. The downside? The simple menu. It's all but one side of a laminated sheet and with fewer entree options I expected to be blown away. It was a delicious meal, but it didn't linger on my mind. They do have an extensive wine menu, I will say that. Service was good, quick, friendly. I was a little confused about the ambiance. There were sports games broadcasted at the bar, with a lady playing a grand piano quite well. There were some dressed up people (count my sister and me in that crowd) and there were some casually dressed people. Not sure how to classify the ambiance...so I'll let you decide if you visit.

Engrossed in a totally pleasant chain of memory association, I found myself thinking about eating at the Los Altos Grill when I was writing about Godfather's Burger lounge, because the former is an old favorite, and the latter is a new one.  I decided to write an update to the review of The Grill I did back when I was a Yelpling of some two weeks tenure. A tried and true old favorite, The Los Altos Grill never disappoints - I've eaten there dozens of times in the past few years, and I've never had anything less than a great meal.  My only major complaint (that they don't take reservations) apparently was rectified quite a while back, and I simply didn't notice until 2012! Reservations not withstanding, walk-ins on almost any night after 5:30pm are tricky, but don't even think about it on the weekends - it's always packed! Last time I visited The Grill, my very special Lady and I walked in on a brisk Winter weeknight evening into the warm, invitingly romantic, dimly lit restaurant with its dark woods, cozy booths, and omnipresent buzz.  An almost palpable energy resonates from the long oval shaped bar at the heart of The Grill.  I've recently developed a renewed appreciation for cocktails, so as I'm writing this, I'm making a mental note to check out their mixologists handiwork another time. We were seated in a booth just off the bar toward the front of the restaurant.  The Grill is a very romantic place - just perfect for an intimate dinner for two.  The constant buzz from the bar and the surrounding restaurant gives all the tables an almost magical feeling of privacy in an otherwise very public place. Despite the restaurant camera compulsion that seemed to come along with my new Yelp Elite status a few months ago, I found myself so fascinated with my lovely companion, our warmly close and relaxed conversation, and her especially beautiful eyes that I took no pictures that night.  In fact, it took me quite a while to even remember what I ordered for dinner, and I'm still totally clueless about what she had... As an appetizer, we shared an ordered of Dip Duo with Warm Tortilla Chips.  The chips were fresh and deliciously salty, and the two dips were spicy and flavorful.  Our servers kept the chips coming as our hunger helped us demolish them quickly. For my entrée, I had the petite fillet mignon, with French fries substituted for their standard mashed potato side.  Nothing wrong with the mashed potatoes - I'm just a sucker for French fries.  These were thin, very salty (just the way I like 'em!) and the perfect companion to my steak, as well as the Devils Canyon Amber Ale on tap.  All the meat at The Grill is excellent, but the filet is my personal favorite.  I ordered mine medium, and when it came my beautiful lady friend commented that it was a bit on the rare side, but I was hungry enough to wrestle a Grizzly Bear (well, at least Yogi Bear) for scraps, so I didn't even THINK about sending it back, I just devoured it. I stand by what I said last time out - their Oreo Cookie Dessert will still knock your socks off!  Your meal at Los Altos Grill is not complete without it.

They use Safeway meat for the burgers, I saw it with my own eyes as the kitchen which is often in plain view on the way to the bathroom disposed of their safeway packaging for the grinder. Also, before I discovered this one time I ordered a burger medium well take out. I got home, took a few bites, and it was blood rare. I called to tell them this, the girl put me on hold to ask her supervisor what they should do (!?!?!) Finally after 10 minutes on hold got back on the phone to tell me they will remove the charge for the burger. However only for the burger..the charge for the soda i had while i waited would be left on (seriously?). This was also not the first time they messed up my order for takeout. Not only was I left to rummage through my pantry starving because by this point everything in Los Altos was closed, but that rare burger was a health hazard especially when it is from safeway, it was completely blood rare inside. Steaks near rare may be ok but not ground beef. Downgraded to 1 star for manager trying to find a loophole to get my review removed.

I've been eating here since opened as Bandera's. Little has changed since then except the name and some of the dishes. I'm a huge fan of the ribs. They are beef and the meat just falls off the bone - literally. Put that with the peanut coleslaw and mash potatoes and you have a great meal. I've eaten a variety of their dishes over time and have been very satisfied every time. If they still have the cornbread (may not be on the menu) you should try it - so good. Great selection of wine, no corkage fee, and a fun environment. It can get a bit noisy in there, but it really fits in with the atmosphere. Go early. The waiting list gets very long after 6pm.

Yep. Pretty amazing. The quality of the food is very high and fresh. The beef ribs were a touch fatty but the flavor was incredible! I also got the grilled artichokes; the smokey flavor of the tender hearts is perfection.  Last but not least, I am not a fan of bananas, but I ordered the banana cream pie knowing it would be fresh and delicious anyway. Best quality pie with a walnut crust and smooth cream filling that isn't hyper-flavored. You can see the vanilla bean specks in the filling. What can I say, sometimes you get what you pay for. PS: Deviled eggs were awesome!

Best prime rib french dip sandwich in the area, hands down!!  Nice thinly sliced prime rib, served medium rare (but I always ask for rare), rich tasting dip, and good shoestring fries.  (The fries are a bit too crispy for me -- I like mine more soft, so I'm not crunching on sticks.)  I don't usually like mayonnaise on my sandwiches, but this is the one exception -- I love the way this sandwich tastes!  They only put a little mayo on so it doesn't take over the flavor, just adds to it.   I don't usually have the patience to wait and be seated, so I get it to go.  It still tastes wonderful at home, but if you can get there early enough not to have a long wait, it's best to eat it hot from the kitchen.  :-)  My kids love this sandwich too, and it's all we get when we go there!  Table service is good and attentive when we've stayed. My only complaint is the cost of the sandwich -- so I can't do it as often as I'd like.  Wish they had a "buy 10 get 1 free" deal :-) :-)  And I'm also bummed that they don't do lunch (at a lower price, preferably!) -- many folks I'd like to introduce this place to, but they can't stay for dinner....

My brother-in-law had a gig here last week, so it was a good opportunity to give their food another try. We made a reservation, but did have to wait a bit for our table. No biggie, we sat at the bar and had a drink while we waited. I ordered the fish special, (which was a fish similar to red snapper.) I was brought out the salmon instead. The server offered to bring me the fish I ordered, but i wasn't going to eat two fish entrees. The salmon was cooked really nicely, (it's almost always overcooked when i order it in a restaurant.) I liked the rice that came with it as well. Our drinks were kept refilled, and the food came quickly. Our server ended up comping my meal, (which i repeatedly told her she didn't have to do) and she gave us a free dessert. I was pretty surprised and impressed by that. I do think that the prices here are a little high for the area. Cocktails are $12. That's more like the price in an upscale SF restaurant. Since this place is always slammed, I guess other people don't think they're overcharging. If i was in the area, and someone wanted to eat here, I would happily return. Although, on our own, we probably won't be back.

So, based on the ratings and the reviews I decided to take my valentine date here and what a DISAPOINTMENT! The food that we ordered was horrible. My bf ordered the steak and mash (bland and no flavor). The mash had no gravy and was also bland. My bf is not a picky eater and most of the time he will say that the food is good and I am always the pickier one, BUT this was an exception, even he said it was not good at all. I ordered the fish sandwich and again no flavor. The appetizers were the only good thing we had. The smoked salmon was AMAZING! The sauce that came with it was also amazing! 5 stars for that....Oh and the mac and cheese was flavorless (do not order). Dessert was nasty, we got the oreo something something and the ice cream was hard as a rock. and 5 stars to the atmosphere, they had live jazz music that night and the environment was very romantic.

Been here a few times for team dinners.  Like others mentioned, the cornbread is an excellent starter to share, the oreo ice cream sandwich is a great dessert, and you really can't beat the free corkage. As far as entrees go, I've tried both the Ahi Tuna Salad and the Ahi Tuna Burger.  While the salad was great, the burger was one of the most interesting things that I've ever eaten.  My taste buds kept telling me that I was eating a beef burger, but then the patty itself would "crumble" just as you would imagine ground ahi tuna would.  Definitely a great choice if you're craving a burger but want to be (a little bit) healthier!

This review has been a long time coming.     Since I work in and around Silicon Valley, I've eaten at Los Altos Grill something like 10 to the 3rd power times.     While it's always been consistently good, over the past 2 years or so, the quality of the food has diminished somewhat.   Additionally, the menu, which once was diverse and extensive, now seems more limited. It's still a great place for lunch or dinner, especially with business colleagues or an important client; but I probably would not eat here personally anymore.

I think the menu was one or maybe two pages long, but I only had eyes for the prime rib French dip. Here's why: the meat was piled high, and so incredibly tender; it was like eating a stick of butter, only much, MUCH less disgusting. Most of my tablemates were at least mildly jealous. "Oh well," I thought as I greedily stuffed my face. "I guess we'll just have to come back next weekend!" One item of which to be aware: we made reservations and still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. So, come hungry, but not too hungry.

Great Prime Rib anytime of the week and the only place I have been able to find Beef Ribs prepared so deliciously in all of the Bay. This is a must try steak house if you live in the South Bay. The Banana Cream Pie is a must have for dessert.

I felt like I had walked into Rutherford Grill in the Napa Valley. Had a great dinner here with husband and friends. Dim lights, upholstered booths, central bar, classy steakhouse feel. I finally could resist asking and yes, it is indeed owned by the same group.

Based on all of the positive reviews for this restaurant and the hour-plus wait for a table, we were really surprised at our experience there last weekend.  Although the staff was great and the manager tried hard to recover, the meal itself was horrible.  The two meat dishes our table ordered came out raw (no other was to describe it) even though we had ordered medium/well.  We sent the steak back but it still came back bloody.  The server apologized profusely but by then we were ready to go.   Our third order, the rotesserie chicken (signature dish) was dry and flavorless and the spinach side dish was ice cold. We loved Houstons (same chain) when we lived in Atlanta but were sorely disappointed in Los Altos Grill and won't be back.

Love this place!!! Gets crowded by 630 on a daily basis so I'd suggest making a reservation. Starter: you have to get the cornbread. It's prefect to share with 3-4 people. There's a slightly spicy jalapeno kick a sweet corn flavoring. I ordered the seared ahi tuna for my entree which was delicious. I liked the salad with mango side as well. Oh, and they don't charge a corkage fee. How amazing and rare is that??! Can't wait to go back and try other items.

Went for my bday.  We had reservations and were seated a few minutes late. I'm dinging this place a couple stars because I SENT MY RIBEYE BACK.  I have never sent food back, but it just sucked...they came back with ribs which were better, but not to the ratio of food to cost. The avocado app was amazing, and the artichoke hearts are ehhhh.  What I have learned about this place is always get the seafood plates.  They are always the tastiest on the menu.   PS, watch out for the middle aged snobs.

On a weeknight this place is pretty packed. I was immediately drawn to the long oval shaped bar. It's the heart of the place. Awesome energy radiates from the bar and having been sat close to it I feel drawn. It just so happened that I'm in my usual hungry state after a short local hike. Started with their Dip Duo and their thin, crispy salty tortilla chips. Addicitng! They can keep those chips coming too. I had the prime rib medium. It is such a simple preparation. No muss no fuss. It came with a side of awesome mashed potatoes. The ones that I like. With small chunks of potatoes as opposed to the really smooth generic ones. Ohhh..the prime rib is sublime. So tasty on its own. Melt in your mouth juicy goodness.  This might be my other choice of place for a carnivorous feed. Washed it down with Devils Canyon Amber Ale on tap. Great company, good food and live music in the background. Awesome staff. Polite, attentive and courteous. One of those nights.:)

The food here is actually pretty good, but for the price.... I'm not sure. I really enjoyed their smoked salmon appetizer. So tender and perfectly smoked and it comes with a dill spread and crispy toast. We also got the duo dip, which was pretty good, but I would have to say too many chips and not enough dip! For the actual meal itself, I ordered the Macho Salad and my friends got their Seared Ahi Tuna. The Macho Salad had really nice roasted chicken in it and corn bread croutons, but it was pretty skimpy on the avocado. The salad was $18 and it wasn't a huge portion, so if anything, they should give more avocado!! The seared ahi tuna was pretty good as well, but not breathtakingly good. This place has good food, but for the type of food and the portion given, I'm a little borderline on whether or not it's actually worth it, so 3.5 stars it is! The restaurant's also really loud, so be ready to repeat yourselves in between bites so your friends can hear you!

3.5 stars Los Altos Grill is a very good place for steak. Anything else may be a bit of a risk, but the steak is quite tasty. Their other meat selections seem to be pretty good; a friend had the English-style bangers and mash. The steak entrees are sizeable -- the prime rib is actually quite large. And the prices are reasonable for a good steakhouse (around $30). Oddly, the menu doesn't have any "official" appetizers, but we ordered a couple of the side dishes -- the cornbread in a skillet and the mac n' cheese. The mac n' cheese was a little too salty and overflavored. The cornbread in a skillet was good, and possibly the best side to order. The menu also has some interesting items such as the steak and enchilada platter, and a couple of fish entrees, but no real dessert. We were quoted 3 dessert items, all 3 of which were pretty ordinary -- a sundae, a banana cream pie, and an Oreo sandwich. Not anything special, which was a mild disappointment. If you're in the area, and want a good place for steak, Los Altos Grill isn't a bad choice. Otherwise, for anything else, you can probably find a more well-rounded place.

This is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. If you've ever been to Houston's or Rutherford Grill, then you know what to expect. I've tried just about everything on the menu over the years and I have never left unsatisfied. Appetizers, entrees, desserts, drinks... all spectacular. You can please people of all tastes here - even kids, although it's really geared towards an older crowd. Give it a try; you won't be sorry.

Came back here to celebrate my husband's birthday, and we had another enjoyable meal. I've been to Los Altos Grill a number of times, but this time was better than the rest. I wish I had learned the name of our server, because he was so polite and beyond attentive. He was on top of the wine we brought that evening, always noticed when it was time to open another, and poured secondary glasses for all even when we were still working on the first bottle. Gotta love the no corkage fee! Once again, cornbread was amazing. Came out piping hot with the perfect crunchy top. And the rib eye, unsurprisingly, was incredible! Cooked perfectly medium rare, juicy, and flavorful. The rib eye here is on the top of my list as far as steakhouses go. I love the ambiance of this restaurant. It's classy, but not pretentious. Fancy, yet relaxed. The live music is a plus as is the nice, sizable bar in the middle of the restaurant. One of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area!

The Verdict: A nice place to grab a bite to eat if you can wait long enough. This place always seems to be packed (at least during the evenings). The wait list usually takes up to 40 mins. I had tried to get into this place on a Friday night once and ended up leaving because it was too crowded and the suggested wait time was 1 hr to 1.5 hrs! The second time I came here was on a Tuesday for dinner and it was much more do-able. They seated us within 5 mins and our food came out with ease. The food was very tasty, healthy and gourmet style. I ordered a fish burger with peanut coleslaw on the side and my friend ordered the mahi mahi. We both enjoyed the food, but it is definitely on the pricey side (about $35/person - because we each had a glass of wine too). Would I Recommend It? Once in a while and with reservations.

Hillstone, you have done it again! What is it about your restaurants that makes for the most amazing dining experiences ever? I'm a huuuge fan of Houston's in Pasadena, so needless to say I was ecstatic to try the Los Altos Grill, another member of the Hillstone family of restaurants. My friend and I stopped in here on a whim on a busy Sunday night. The manager could tell that we were both starving, so she sat us promptly at a cute little booth for two-- amazing service which we will not soon forget. We ordered the Dip Duo ($10) to start, and when the chips came to the table, warm and fresh, ready for dipping, we eagerly got started. The guacamole was delicious, but we found it needed a little extra salt and lemon (both provided). The chedder-jalapeno dip was the unique one; chunkier than most queso dips, this one still packed quite the punch. The dips complemented each other nicely, and our waitress brought us more piping hot chips when we devoured the first bunch. For dinner, I ordered the Bandera Style Roasted Chicken ($18), but subbed fries for the Spanish rice. (They serve the same amazingly delicious fries as Houston's, and I couldn't pass those up!) The rotisserie chicken was out-of-this-world; the meat was so juicy, the skin so crispy, the sauce so delectable. And the portion was so generous I had to take half of it home! YUM. A must-try! My friend chose the Macho Salad ($16), which includes mixed greens, roasted chicken, avocado, corn, tomato, almonds, dates, cornbread croutons, and goat cheese drizzled in a creamy vinaigrette dressing. Phew! That's a lot of stuff! Surprisingly, there were still lots of greens in there, and the salad was very well balanced. All of the flavors played off each other well. Light and refreshing, yet savory and salty as well -- a superb salad. We were both so stuffed by the end of the meal that we had to skip out on dessert. The atmosphere is warm and inviting (very wood-and-leathery), and would make a great spot for a date, a bite to eat with a friend, or even a business meeting. There is also a huge bar in the middle of the restaurant (and two TVs), which looked like the happening place to be! Overall, service was amazing (both the manager who chose our table as well as our waitress), the food was exquisite, and the ambience was terrific. I will definitely come back!

After looking up this place on Yelp and saw their menu, I thought to myself "hmm..their menu looks familiar..." That's when I realized that it's the same company (Hillsdale) that owns Rutherford Grill in Napa Valley. Coming here, I knew I was in for something good. First of all, cheers for NO CORKAGE FEE! Their menu is very similar to the one in Napa, minus the fish and chips. Came here for a friend's birthday - party of 9. Seating wasn't too great despite the fact that we actually made reservations. They made us squeeze into a round table more suitable for a party of at the most 6 people. But thank goodness us 4 girls are skinny enough to only count as 2 people haha Atmosphere: they have a few guys playing some live music, the restaurant was full at 7:30pm and stayed full for a good few hours. Moving on to the food.. A bunch of us ordered their Roasted Prime Rib (recommended). I got the Sashimi Ahi Tuna Salad (recommended) - love the combo of avocado, mango and vinaigrette dressing. This is good if you're not feeling too hungry - make sure the others order the steak so you get to nibble some from them. One of my friends got the Prime Rib French Dip - I highly recommend this. It's not your usual burger, but kinda sorta similar and better. Based on one of the Yelp reviews, we also got the Corn Bread - this was more like a dessert to me. It's sweet, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside - delightful. One order can feed up to 6 people. Price is affordable and good for a place like this. We all went home happy, full and just tipsy enough to go for a second round of drinks.

At first I was disappointed that they no longer serve dinner on the patio and the menus is changed. Still had 2 good glasses of wine and ordered dinner. Had a DELICIOUS salad with chicken, dates, goat cheese and a mess of other good stuff. Friend got the salmon. Dessert was only 3 choices (banana cream pie and 2 ice cream dishes). Disappointed they had no tart, basic chocolate cake, pie, etc as we would have bought dessert. Corn bread is AWESOME though. Comes in a cast iron skillet and is DELICIOUS! Waiter, Dominicko, was TERRIFIC. He was super friendly, attentive to filling up water/made great suggestions/checked in on us and smiled and great serviced his way into a great tip (more that I usually leave). Hope they will start serving dinner on the patio and expand their menu but Dominicko, GREAT food and excellent jazz band? I am coming back.

Yikes! What happened? Haven't been to the grill for awhile...went last weekend and the service has gone south. Way south. The bar staff were slow, inattentive...not even the usual friendly. Food still pretty good. Wont go out of my way to come back for a while.

I was in the mood for a hearty dinner that I could take home so I could sit like a potato in front of the TV with. Saw the reviews for Los Altos Grill, did a little more looking to find that it's a Hillstone restaurant, and was instantly happy. I've always had great meals with Hillstone, and I love their ribs, mashed potatoes, and caesar salad. So... that's what I ordered for pickup. The lady was very nice, and I took my dinner home with a happy spring in my step. BUT, then I got home and started eating. The salad was decent but the Caesar salad had corn in it which I thought was odd, and I didn't like the dressing as it had an off taste to it (perhaps anchovies). I did not like it. Then I thought, that's ok, you still have the ribs and mashed potatoes. Well... Those ribs were chewy and way too crispy, very overcooked, with so much fat that I barely got a good bite in. Now, I know beef ribs traditionally have more fat in them than say, pork ribs. But this was ridiculous. Six ribs: two were completely inedible and I had to pick through the other four to find pieces that didn't feel like shards in my mouth or pieces of beef jerky. The mashed potatoes were odd with some kind of crunchy veggie in them plus maybe scallions?? Homemade mashed potatoes don't have to be chunky but I understand it's a style to have itty bitty chunky pieces. But, what I got were itty bitty chunky pieces (that I don't think were the weird crunchy veggie type things) and random massive chunks of potatoes. Plus, it was pretty tasteless. Yuck. So sad and so disappointed. Now, I need to go find something else to eat.

I have to update my previous review about the wait with reservations. I Love that reservations are available through Urbanspoon now!  Even better is that we were seated right on time! Of course the food was as good as always and Christine is the best server at The Grill! I also love that you can bring your own wine and there is NEVER a corkage charge.

This place is more popular than I would've thought, given its relatively normal food selection and less than stellar offerings. My friend and I came here once for a nice dinner, which was good, but not spectacular, considering the cost of the food. The atmosphere is very cosy. The booths are large and everything is pretty dark inside except for the center where the kitchen is. They have a hearth area where they do all their impressive cooking (think food that involves large flames, etc.) out in the open for their patrons to see. If there's one good thing here, it's definitely gotta be the cornbread. It's one of their specialties, and I have to agree with the other Yelpers. It's downright amazing; one of the best cornbread I have ever had... anywhere. The cornbread is baked in a cast iron skillet and has a crunch crust (drizzled with honey) and has a slight kick to it from the jalapeños. So good, I wish I had their recipe to make it myself! Our entrees were okay. My friend has had better experiences here, but this was not one of them. We ordered the prime rib and their sashimi ahi tuna dish (I forget what it's called, but it wasn't memorable). The prime rib was good, but I've definitely had better. The ahi tuna was definitely on the meh side... Wouldn't recommend it at all. Dessert was very good though. We had the Oreo ice cream dessert which was super tasty. Besides the cornbread and dessert, nothing really stood out. Their only saving grace was the staff. Our waitress was either new or super busy, but she kept forgetting things/orders (she royally screwed up the order of the group near us). Despite all of this, she made it up to us by being really attentive and apologetic. When we were almost done With our meal, she scooped up the remainder of our cornbread (about a quarter left) before my friend could get a word in and scurried away (we were saving it for later). She ended up tossing it... but when we mentioned we wanted it boxed up, she apologized profusely and came back with a much larger portion of cornbread in a takeout box. That's pretty much the only reason this place gets four stars... I might come back for the cornbread and maybe the dessert, but the food is definitely not as good as I thought it would be. :/

The atmosphere of this place reminds me of The Keg and Milestones back in Toronto with its dim lighting, dark wood finishes and constant buzz.  We waited for about 40 minutes on a Friday night (got there around 6) which according to my husband isn't that bad.  There's an outdoor patio where you can sit while waiting and order something to drink and an appetizer.  We ordered the duo dip tortilla chips- one was guacamole and the other was a chedder- jalapeno dip ($10).  The chips are served warm which was nice and I enjoyed the guac more than the chedder dip but I guess it's all about preference with this one. When we were seated we ordered the jumbo peel and eat shrimp which came with a seafood sauce and I think some sort of aioli.  The shrimps were large and while I know it states "peel" in its name, I would have preferred if the shrimps were deveined.  I think this was $18. I had the Bandera Style Roasted Chicken that came with Spanish rice.  The chicken was flavourful and moist but the rice was on the dry side so the sauce it came with helped.  My husband had the rib eye which was tender and juicy.  I wasn't keen on the vine ripe tomatoes that were topped with blue cheese and what I think was italian salad dressing.  Nothing special and I would opt for another side the next time. We were way too full for dessert. Service was really friendly though it took awhile for the waitress to come over initially.

My first time was last night...and it didn't disappoint.  :) My friend took me here as a "thank you" for dog and house sitting for her.  The ambiance is great, very rustic upscale.  Outdoor seating is available up front.  There was a live piano player tinkling the ivories on a Tuesday ING at 6pm when we arrived.  The place was PACKED.  If I had to guess, I'd say this place was a sister restaurant to the Rutherford Grill In Napa.  Same vibe and font and paper on their menus... Great service, great wine list, great food.  I almost never eat steak.  My friend suggested the filet, which came with colcannon potatoes and sautéed spinach.  DELICIOUS.  I asked for an add of bleu cheese on top of my steak and they happily accommodated my request. $34 A bottle of Elyse Petite SIrah was amazing...fruit, jamminess and yet heavy enough for the filets.  $45 for the bottle, good value and the server suggested it.  Nice job on his part. We ordered a side of corn bread as an app.  Covered in brown sugar and filled with jalapeños, it was yummy. ended with house made Oreo ice cream cookie desserts, in a pool of chocolate sauce.  Amazingly good.  And I don't like dessert, usually. I'm putting this on my rotation of favorite restaurants.

Where do I begin??  My experience here was a most pleasurable one from start to finish.  We were a party of six who arrived earlier than our reservation ready to commence the festivities sooner.  The seating in the restaurant was full and the bar packed in the center.  Subsequently, we made way to the small patio outside and kicked off the evening with grilled artichokes and dip duo with warm tortilla chips.  Both appetizers were so scrumptious, they gave us all great anticipation for the dinner yet to come.  The artichokes were steamed with some herbs and garlic then thrown on the grill in halves.  They were tasty right down to the stems.  The dip duo consisted of two large mounds of a cheese medley with some jalapeños and other herbs mixed in.   My culinary adventure continued once we were seated on a dais with a dropped ceiling in a corner booth   I admired the warm brown decor which consisted of brown shingled walls, excellent mood lighting throughout the restaurant, down lighting over each table and the excitement of the open kitchen in the center.   The Rutherford bone-in ribeye with house made Worchester sauce was cooked to medium rare perfection down to the bone.  The vine ripe tomatoes with bleu cheese were a tasty addition.  The artichokes were so good we ordered more.  The deviled eggs were also good but not outstanding like the mac and cheese and the coleslaw.  The mac and cheese were made with ziti, parsley on top of melted cheese and walnut cornbread crumble.  The coleslaw here was by far the best I've ever had.  It isn't your typical coleslaw with milky dressing.  It had some sort of oil and vinegar dressing with parsley and peanuts.  We ordered two plates of this too! The service here is absolutely impeccable.  Everyone smiles, and they serve with solicitous intent.  Tacking on an 18% gratuity is no problem.  They earn every bit of it and then some. Finally, I must say the NO CORKAGE FEE is most awesome and appreciated to be granted by such a swanky, upscale venue.  This place is definitely a favorite.  I look forward to returning in the near future. Just make sure to come with a fat wallet.

What's striking about this place is how fitting it feels to seek shelter here from the rain. The dim lighting, the intimate setting (the low ceiling sets that mood) and the lingering hint of smoked applewood (?) in the air attributes to a positive first impression. Another interesting thing I observed is the considerable number of staff present at opening hour. 75% of the time, we had different people serving our food or clearing our plates. That begs the question of how efficient they can be if the dinner rush is extremely busy. I suppose I shall see another visit. My company and I ordered the basics, beginning with sides: deviled eggs and mac n' cheese. The latter was very satisfying while our entrees were the cheeseburger and the ahi-tuna burger. The house-made egg bread was spot-on whilst my eating companion was very happy about his patty cooked to medium-rare perfection. If I could give my order a fair rating, I would rate 3 stars for the burgers; But, seeing as how I liked our waitress, combined with how comfortable the surroundings made me feel, I'd add another half star. 3.5 total.

I made reservations 5 days before the birthday dinner.  6 people @ 6:45P on a Sunday night. We were seated at 7:15P, at a booth that comfortably seats 5 people. When the guest of honor could not fit in the booth, they suggested maybe a chair that would put her in the isle. (I thought that was why I made reservations so far in advance) - they did have larger booths that they sat a group at while I was waiting for our table. Then they did not clear the stuff off the table that was in front of the guest of honor, we did. The food was SO mediocre. Requested medium rare came well done, the squash enchilada was so bland it was not edible.  The consensus was the same for all. I'm not quite sure how they stay in business. Here is the really bad part, 3 out of 6 of us had food poisoning after that. AWFUL!!!!!

I came here tonight with a very good friend. It was her recommendation for us to try this new place. Overall the atmosphere was nice. It may be a little loud for some. The overall audience there was definitely more mature. We originally had a reservation at 9pm, but tried our luck by coming in earlier. We got seated around 8pm, which was great! I was starving! The service was superb and is really why I am giving  this place a 5 star review. Our waitress, Michelle was very attentive and friendly, but not overbearingly so. She came by a few times to check on us and gave me my free refills without me even having to ask. We ordered a few different dishes: 1. Cornbread: The cornbread was delicious especially with some honey on top (as recommended by our waitress). It was crumbly on top and the inside felt like it would melt in your mouth. The jalapeño also gave it a nice spicy kick. I would definitely recommend this dish! 2. Prime rib french dip: The portion was decent and the overall taste was not bad. it was quite juicy. What made the sandwich tasty for me was the creamy horseradish sauce. Overall I thought the sandwich was only okay... not bad but not amazingly over the top either. 3. BBQ beef baby back ribs: My boyfriend got this dish. It look quite good, with 4 giant ribs stacked on top of each other. He loved the BBQ sauce. The pieces were a little fatty, but Michelle was so attentive that she offered another piece on the house for him. 4. Ahi tuna burger: The burger looked gigantic. Not sure of the taste, but my friend seemed to like it. It looks like your typical hamburger though from the outside. 5. Tonight special (Rib eye): The portion was quite large, but my friend's boyfriend did finish it and seemed to really enjoyed it. 6. Oreo cookie ice cream dessert: OMG loved it! But I mean honestly what girl doesn't love a good dessert. If you ever come, please save room for it. The ice cream cookie and the chocolate sauce on the side just complement each other so well. It is like an orgasm in your mouth! Overall I would give the food a 3 1/2 star. For the price and what you get and the overall taste, I definitely feel that you can do better else where. However with great staff members like Michelle, I wouldn't mind paying a little more just to have a dinner where I feel I am treated like a princess (I thought Michelle customer service surpass places like Alexander Steak House, La Fondue, Chez TJ, etc.).

Been here quite a few times now... Salmon - always tasty and their green rice is great. Bandera style roasted chicken w green rice. Roast chicken is amazing here. I don't care for the bean sauce that goes underneath the chicken though. Prime rib. tasty and it's served on the bone. great flavor. Cornbread. awesome. but worth sharing if you have 3-4 people. if there's just two of you, it's cornbread overload. Romilily Russian river pinot noir. yummy Pinot. worth trying a glass.

I really want to love everything about the Los Altos Grill.  I love the ambiance - lots of dark wood and dim lighting.  I love the gray-haired woman sitting at the piano near the front, playing songs from yesteryear.  And I love the service - friendly and attentive.  Where Los Altos Grill is mediocre is with the food.  I had the Macho Salad.  I'm sorry, but who leaves on chicken skin in a salad?  So gross!  My husband had the Bandera chicken with mashed potatoes (instead of rice).  He said it was good, but nothing to write home about.  Our small daughter had the enchilada ala carte.  (There's not much selection on the menu for a kid.)  She barely touched it, so hubby and I shared it.  Again, just ok - nothing special. I'll go back again, try a few different dishes, and hope to find some food on the menu that will live up to all the other things I love about Los Altos Grill.  If nothing else, I'll enjoy a glass of wine at the bar, sway to the live piano music, and enjoy the Los Altos scene.

On the one hand, there is a lot to like about this place.  Nice upscale decor, dark, cozy atmosphere, nice drink selection and no corkage fee.  But, there were a few miscues that prevented LAG from being a top dinning experience. The service was good, but not excellent.  The waiter seemed very casual in his manner.  He did not seem very knowledgeable about the menu and did not make very good recommendations. The lamb chop that they serve here is a blade chop.  There is a big sinew in the middle.  This should definitely be avoided.  The green beans it was served with were raw, which is ok if you like it that way.  But, I am not a fan.  The chicken, which our waiter claimed was one of the most popular dishes was bland.  It was served with this weird bean flavored sauce that was not very appetizing. What I really enjoyed was the french dip.  The meat was wonderfully succulent.  The au jus was perfectly seasoned and I could have drank it like a broth.  The bread was also very nice and fluffy and sweet with a nice toast on it.  Reallly it was the best french dip I have ever had.  (that is not saying much because I have only otherwise had Arby's.  But, I hate Arby's and I would come back to LAG just for the french dip) For the level of ambiance, $19 for the French Dip seemed very reasonable.  The priciest thing on the menu is under 40 and the cheapest about 15. I just wish the service was better and the menu was better.  This is one of those places where certain things on the menu are good and certain things are trash.  So, good luck and try the french dip.

Los Altos Grill is one of my favorite places to eat from all of the bay area. The food is top quality, as good as it gets! Do NOT MISS the corn bread, the artichoke and any cut of meat, but the prime rib is one the best I have ever had. They are very consistent in the quality and the whole dinning experience. It's quite pricey but it's worth it. Also keep in mind that if you go there without a reservation you will probably have to wait for at least 60-90 minutes... I have gone there without reserving first, but the food is so good that we are always willing to wait! Hands down a great place, solid food and great ambiance!

booked marked for the reason of the jalapeño corn bread =P  its prob one of the most tastiest corn bread i have ever had!  5 stars just for that!  its comes out fresh and hot.  extremely flavorful.  ++moist!  just give it a try...promise you won't regret. the atmosphere is dim and cozy.  can get really loud.  we came here on a whim.  it was a friday night and we did not make any reservations.  the wait was up to about an hour.   we hung out at the bar and had the bartender whip me up some yummy martinis.  he was great!  good drinks with a very upbeat personality.  the bar area was very packed and lively.   as for the entree, i would say its only mediocre at best.   i had the prime rib.  it was just ok.  best part was the outer ridges.  it has the most flavor.  other then that, every thing else was blah.  my mash was bland. the boyfriend had the hawaiian rib eye.  tasted like korean bbq!  it was just ok tough.   overall, id prob give them a 3.5 stars

Not sure I understand all the 4 and 5 star reviews here.  This was my first trip to Los Altos Grill with a friend whom also happens to be a close business associate. What happened? Ordered a gin martini dirty at the bar as our table was not going to be ready as planned.  It had two much ice in it and was not dirty as requested.  I complained because at $15 for a classic martini I expect perfect.  The bartender shrugged me off.  So I gave him zilch for a tip.  We are now even! The noise level was bad.  Was virtually impossible to hold a conversation in the restaurant.  I am a tad hoarse today from having to scream so my friend could hear me. We started with the grilled artichoke.  It was okay.  Great?  Nah.  Just okay. I had the enchillada with butternut squash.   It was fair.  Nothing I would ever consider having again.  My friend had some kind of ahi tuna salad which was also okay. I just don't get this place.  Maybe if I was 27 and wore flip flops I would get it.  But I am 54 and have higher expectations. Sorry guys!

Not such a fan of the cornbread skillet this time, either it wasn't as good, and/or I got spoilt by the cornbread at Nola's/other places. Also, it was not hot (or even warm) when it got to our table, our server was nice enough to replace it with one just out of the oven! Ordered the special of the day, loup de mer. I think it's kind of like mediterranean sea bass. It was pretty good! Broccoli that came with it was tender. But I have to say, the plate looked kind of sparse with just fish and veggies. Bf's roasted chicken was also pretty good! Yummy rice that came with it. Spanish rice? Anyhow it looked like the veggies were integrated into the rice or something. This one is a good deal for $, huge amount of food for $17. Yay for live music on Monday night! It was somewhat crowded too, had no reservation and had to wait for a while even though it was almost 7pm or so.

We've been coming here for a few years and its just fabulous, girls night out, out with couples we've never been disappointed with the food and service. We always get the cornbread as one of our appetizers. The roasted chicken is great a must try. We love coming as a big group and going family style with the entrees so everyone gets a taste of all the dishes, and yum. Our wine friends love to come because they can bring bottles and not get charged a corkage fee. Service is great, attentive but not to intrusive. Ambiance is cozy at the tables/booths and very social at the huge bar in the center, and yet it doesn't have a sports pub feel even with the tv's going. It is dark at the tables so if you have a hard time seeing, get the flash light app for your smart phone or pull the table candle closer to get a look at the menu.

What is it about this place?  It's kinda dark, the menu choices are very limited, the wait can be really long and they don't take reservations.  So why do I like it so much? Here's a few reasons: Very good food -- I have never had something I didn't like here, over quite a few visits.  I think keeping the menu short helps keep the quality high.  They don't take many risks -- you might even say it's mostly comfort food. Whatever it is, they just keep delivering. Outstanding service -- Everyone is friendly, efficient, pitch-perfect.  Never had a wrong order, a lack of attention or a bad attitude.  Not even a slightly over-talkative server.  And the bartenders are absolutely top notch. Atmosphere -- While it seems dark at first glance, the lighting is actually well done.  The beautiful bar is the centerpiece and it's usually buzzing. The comfortable booths give you some intimacy without cutting you off from the rest of the restaurant.  The whole place says, come on in and relax, get away from whatever you were doing. I toyed with the idea of giving them a fifth star, but held back since the food is not quite over-the-top superlative and it is just a bit on the pricey side.  Still, a very solid 4 - 4.5 star place.

Surprisingly packed on a Thursday night. Reviewers weren't kidding! We were able to make reservations only a few hours prior and there wasn't much of a wait once we got there. The house band as we entered was a really nice touch. We didn't even notice the wait. The Marinated Salmon was perfect to the taste, although a bit short of amazing. Next time I'll definitely order a steak...ahhh the downside of dating a vegetarian. M ordered the Squash Enchiladas, which he said was quite tasty considering it's a vegetarian dish. The bottle of Altamura accompanied our meal pretty well. I liked the hint of espresso on the Oreo ice cream dessert but overall nothing spectacular. Our server was really charming and genuine. My only complaint is that the bathrooms are sooo dark. I had to stand really close to the mirror to see myself. Hahah. Will definitely be back!

I ventured in on a Saturday evening and took a seat at the bar. I decided that the smoked salmon appetizer sounded good however I was not overly impressed with the presentation when it arrived. It was simply presented in a casual and somewhat haphazard way but once i got beyond the initial impression I am happy to say that the preparation was spectacular! Slightly warm, moist but cooked, and it has become one of my fondest food memories.

Coming to the Los Altos Grill for a Birthday dinner, I was definitely excited to try a couple of items of the menu, namely the Cornbread, Prime Rib and Oreo Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich.  After getting seated and really enjoying the vibe of the place (old school exposed timber ceiling, huge central bar, and outdoor rotisserie shack), we got down to the nitty gritty. I got to try the Corn Bread which is really dense has a really nice mix of sweetness from the corn and spice from the jalapenos; the prime rib medium rare which was pretty solid; the extremely tender and flavorful chicken bandera; and the star of the menu (drum roll please....): the barbecued beef ribs.   These ribs were fall-off-the-bone-so-tender-you-could-eat-it-with-­a-spoon tender with a delicious sweet and slightly smokey sauce, a definite must try. Sadly, I came on a night that they did not offer the oreo cookie ice cream sandwich (I cried inside).  I will have to come back one of these days for a glass of beer and the oreo cookie ice cream sandwich.

I love the smell of rotisserie and smoked wood chips here.  It doesn't get into your clothes, it's just the perfect smell for a place that looks like a warm, upscale ski lodge.   They made a very good Chambord sour with a splash of soda.  It wasn't sugary tasting.  The chicken was very good.  I've had some of their other dishes (e.g. center-cut filet, BBQ salmon), and those are decent, but the star is the Bandera Style Roasted Chicken so go with that.   Service is hit or miss.

This place is pretty much a different crowd versus the San Jose area. More of a mature audience with some good jazz and nice piano tunes. Came in and seated right on time for my reservation. Ordered Merlot to drink and had different dishes to try out. 1. Prime Rib French dip ---tasty, the prime rib is large and juicy. 2. Cornbread-- enough to feed 6 people if you plan to eat as an appetizer. Yum. 3. Salad -- Simple with tomatos and deviled egg with vinaigrettte. Flavorful 4. BBQ ribs with Mash Potatoes -- Not sure about this plate (my friend ate it) but the mash potatoes were kinda full of onion taste.. less on the onions please! But pretty sure the ribs were good too. Oreo Cookie Dessert was delicious! And the cookie was a giant piece enough to share with all. I would come back here again for the food and environment. Pretty chill and relaxing for a chill night out. Come here to the bars for a drink if you wanna relax...

I only wish I could give a review of the food. When we stopped by here in April 2012 at 5 PM for just a bite to eat before our dinner engagement later that evening, we were declined a table. Perhaps I should not have mentioned to the hostess that we only wanted to have a quick bite. But should it matter with tables available? We were offered seats on the patio or at the bar. Haha, at the bar ... it was full and no space for two. So we sat in the deserted patio area. I felt cold and went to the car for my sweater. I was surprised to find out that no server had come to the acknowledge us. After a few more minutes, still no server. I went back to the hostess and asked how can we get served. She replied "oh I can send a server out to you if you'd like." I asked how else could we get served? I went back to our table and we waited a few more minutes for a server who had to leave to get menus. After selecting an entree to share, we were told that we could only order appetizers on the patio. At that point, the appetizers were not appetizing so we left there hungry and with a bad taste in our mouths. Shame on me for trying to treat my out of town guest here after a recommendation from a local business owner. We finally shared a wonderful sandwich and fruit at La Boulanger for a fraction of the cost. Thank you Los Altos Grill for the agrivation and saving me $$$ for a snack.

Totally and completely fantastic! My family chooses to come here for virtually every special occasion and the food is absolutely phenomenal. My favorite things about coming here-- Margaritas The best any of us have ever had! My dad says he tries to recreate them but can never get it right. Apparently they use a house-recipe for the sweet&sour. Deviled Eggs I am obsessed with these. I've never had a deviled egg this good and I'm convinced I never will. Prime Rib French Dip AWESOME!! My entire family of five gets this every time we're here! Absolutely to die for. The fries are good but very skinny. I wish this sandwich didn't go up a few $ every time we come though.. lol The servers are fabulous and I like the atmosphere a lot. My only suggestion would be to ask for a table near the back, it's much quieter. FYI: Who would've known this place is actually a chain! The real name is Bandera but the yuppies--I mean, people--of Los Altos refused to let a chain move in downtown, so they changed the name to Los Altos Grill. Good to know there are more locations.. http://www.hillstone.com…

We have been to this restaurant several times and it never fails to impress.  The service and the food are both fantastic.  They have a great round bar right in the center that is full of life.  This place is always packed - I recommend a reservation - especially on Friday and Saturday nights.  The wait can easily be 90 minutes without one. I highly recommend the french dip, the ribs, and the filet.  All are fantastic!  I'm starting to sound like an employee of Hillstone restaurant group, but I always have such great experiences at their restaurants.  Sadly, I have recently moved away from the Bay Area, so I won't be visiting Los Altos Grill very often.  But I still have a local Houstons.

Wow, five years later and I'm still going to give this place 4 stars... not because the food truly deserves the high mark, rather it's because after all these years they've been fairly consistent, the restaurant is clean and THERE IS STILL NO CORKAGE FEE! Yes, I had to put that in caps for you... Food pricing is still a bit on the higher side given what you get on some of the main dishes. Yesterday I took my lady out for a celebration dinner we started with the Deviled Eggs. These were a good value at $5 getting 5 half eggs. They definitely had more of a dijon taste than mayo however a touch more paprika would've added a nicer spice flavor. After finishing this, she ordered the Grilled Colorado Lamb Sirloin with mashed potatoes and spinach. They did not ask how to cook the steak and it came out just between medium and medium/rare. The approximately 8oz sirloin is not extremely juicy but not dry either. The lamb flavor is also not very heavy, and the meat has a nice slight grilled taste. Overall a good piece of lamb steak but for $26, I can say there are better choices. I do love their mash potatoes because they add colcannon into it giving eat bite just a bit of a crunch. The spinach was sauteed and not laced with too much oil or cream. I'm always so unadventurous when I eat here and default to the same entree, the Roasted Prime Rib. This usually comes with mashed potatoes colcannon but I requested fries instead since we already have the mash included in the lamb dish. Their prime rib still has very good flavor and the meat quality that night was good. The slice I received did not have large chunks of fat peppered throughout, rather it was marbled around the edges. On occasion I've had pieces that have gigantic pieces piece of fat. The center portion was not  chewy but doesn't compare to Sundance's Prime Rib in Palo Alto. I also like their fries, it reminds me a little bit of skinnier McDonalds fries... and I'm a sucker for those. Upon request, they will give you cream horseradish. It has a nice little kick and goes perfectly with the au jus which is excellent on its own. This meal will set you back $34. Lastly, the one thing I MUST order here is their Oreo Cookie Sandwich dessert. I'm generally not a huge dessert person but these is my kryptonite. No matter how full I am or what time of day, my tummy will find room for this. I'm literally salivating just thinking about it again. The dessert is not very sweet and you get two pieces roughly 3.5" in diameter fr $7, very reasonable. I love how they somehow took oreo cookie crumbs and compressed it back into a cookie so it's easy for you to break the cookie sandwich with your spoon without deforming it. The whip cream on top is very light, virtually no flavor on it's own so scooping some with the ice cream and oreo is sensational. There is a layer of chocolate syrup surrounding the cookies so those who are looking for a mild sugar high can get their fix. This place does get busy, we stopped by on a Thursday night without reservations and the wait was over an hour so reservations are highly recommended. For the prices and how hip/trendy this place seems to be, their service is very average. The hostesses were all smiling when you arrive however on more than one occasion, the servers never really smiled. You may need to flag them down for a water refill and although the corkage is free, I felt that it's not too much effort for them to at least offer to refill our wine glasses. I wouldn't of mentioned this, but on the receipt they list out the tip amounts of 15, 18 and 20%. If you're going to list out upwards of 20%, at least try to earn it. Los Altos grill is a nice place to eat, not necessarily for the food value but coupled with free corkage, I feel very comfortable giving this place 4 stars.

The crowds are insane here on the weekends.  Be prepared to wait at least 30 mins to get seated, but I think if you can wait, do, it's well produced food, in a highly dynamic environment, you get to see the cooks in action, there are mounted televisions, and great for people watching.  They have entire rotisserie chickens roasting on spits for all to see.  This location was formerly Banderas, a chain, but the menu has remained the same, pretty limited, but every item induces salivation.   Don't miss: The cornbread in the skillet!  If you like the crust loving, muffin top eating person, you'll love the upper portion of the cornbread, it's amazing!  Like a cobbler, but the savory version!  I actually witnessed people ordering more of the cornbread and getting it 'to go'!   Try and Chip and Dip.  A wonderful appetizer for the table: GREAT tangy guacamole and a blue cheese concoction.   The sides are amazing also, from the sauteed spinach with Parmesan, and cabbage mixed in and their mash with fresh chives. Don't get me wrong, their filet mignon and snapper are fantastic, but a place that takes time to make sure their fillers are wow-worthy, are superior in my book.

This place is pretty good and busy during weeknights too.  Plenty of parking and great service!  Our waiter was really nice and asked us if we needed anything multiple times.  They could not seat large parties, so they seated us in booths near each other, which worked out.  This would be a great place for a date. The prime rib sandwich was delish (this is coming from a person that doesn't really like prime rib).  The jalapeno cornbread was so good!  You can split it with up to six people.  The people we were sitting with were too cheap to pitch in for the $6 appetizer so my friend and I were able to split it and take some home.  Yay.  Next time, I think it'd be happy sitting at the bar with one other person and order the cornbread, a salad and a cocktail.  =)

This place is AMAZING!  There's not much to not like about the place, which is probably the only negative, as it's always packed!  We made a reservation for 8:15 last night, but their reservation system just means you get to the top of the list, not that they will have a table waiting for you.  I didn't mind so much, but it would have been nice to know that ahead of time so we could have made an earlier appointment.  We ended up waiting about 30-40 minutes after our reservation to be seated.  The staff at the front were very apologetic and kept giving me updates, even though I didn't come up to them which I thought was superb of them.  The manager that night eventually came up to us to apologize and offered a free appetizer while we waited.  She gave us two orders of the artichokes and we ate them outside while we waited.  The artichokes were delicious!  The added flavor by grilling them was awesome and coupled with the dip they provided made for quite the appetizer. Once seated, the service maintained its awesomeness.  Our waitress was very friendly and was always checking on us to see if we needed anything.  One thing to note is that this place doesn't charge a corkage fee, so bring your own wine!  We ordered two more apps, deviled eggs and the cornbread.  You must get the cornbread!  It's to die for and quite possibly the best cornbread you'll ever have in your life.  The deviled eggs were also memorable. My wife and I split the Hawaiian rib-eye, which was more than enough for us after all those appetizers.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and the marinade they used was wonderful!  Mashed potatoes are just mashed potatoes, right?  WRONG!  These were so soft and fluffy and went great with the steak.  The greens were also included as a side and was prepared nicely as well.  We had a group of 6 and we got to try the prime rib and beef back ribs.  Both were wonderful and the beef back ribs were just as good as I remember them being when I came here the first time. I didn't think I would have any room left in me for dessert, but we ordered two plates for the group, the banana cream pie and Orero ice cream sandwich.  WOW!  If I didn't have any room before for dessert, I surely made some!  The Oreo was so good ,although a bit too rich for me.  Full disclosure: I'm not a huge fan of overly sweet desserts, but this one was nicely balanced out by the ice cream.  The banana cream pie was much more on the lighter side.  The cake portion was pudding-like.  The crust was made up of chocolate, which went very nicely with the cake and banana. Overall, it was a great meal.  Well worth the wait.  The only minor complaints would have to be the wait time and high level of noise.  It was definitely not enough to make it a negative experience though and we will definitely be back!

THANKS TO YELP....A SUCCESSFUL BDAY DINNER LOCATION.....SCORE!!! I'm so glad I found this place on yelp. If I drove by this place, I probably wouldn't think to come here as it look pretty normal on the outside. Once you step in its pretty SWANKY! Came here last night with my BF for dinner....Live Jazz Music playing, Dimmed lighting, Candle light at all tables...Centered bar area,Very romantic, Open kitchen, Extremely friendly staff. *Ceasar salad - GOOD *House salad with Champagne Vingerette - GOOD *Ribs - OKAY, nothing spectacular as some of the yelpers suggest, but the freshly made Coleslaw was GOOD *Slice of Jalapeno Cornbread - GOOD (and I don't even like cornbread), glad I didn't order the full serving. *Prime RIB....OMG....SO GOOD!!! Definitely reccommend this DISH as a must try! *Decent WINE list....next time must take advantage of the no corkage fee. *Oreo Cookie Sandwich Dessert...I LOVED!!!! (homemade oreo crumbs with espresso) Highly recommend this place! Very cool atmosphere. Limited menu, but food is overall pretty good. Only a bit disappointed with the ribs, everything else was DELICIOUS. Thanks to my Mr. Wonderful, for making this a wonderful night. Will be back whenever we feel splurging $$.

Ok Los Altos Grill, you asked for it. You know what you did, and you know why you did it.   You are pretentious and I can't quite figure out why given that you are what I call a "well dressed version of Chilis." Take your grilled artichoke, your overpriced and undercooked ribs, and shove them both straight up your ass.   Harsh?  Perhaps.  Whatever. Proctology.

My friend and I showed up on a Sunday night around 6:30 with no reservations.  The hostess said the wait would be 40 minutes, but we didn't mind the wait since it was still a little early.  Luckily, we were seated after only 20 minutes.   We started out with the Skillet Cornbread( http://static.px.yelp.co… ).  This is definitely a must when coming here.  It has a nice crispy/crunchy top and the inside is hot and moist.   They brought out our Á la carte Mac & Cheese next( http://static.px.yelp.co… ).  This was good, but I've had better.  I've never had mac & cheese with penne pasta before.  I prefer the traditional elbow macaroni, and I like my mac & cheese baked with a nice crispy top. My friend went with the Prime Rib French Dip( http://static.px.yelp.co… ).  I got to taste it and it was goooood!  The prime rib was thinly cut and had lots of flavor from the au jus.  I'm going to get this next time I come here. I've been to the sister restaurant, Bandera, in the OC a few times and I always got the Barbecue Beef Back Ribs.  They are really good, but I wanted to try something new this time.  I'd been craving a burger, and I saw pictures of their cheeseburger online, so I had to give it a try( http://static.px.yelp.co… ).  The burger was pretty damn good....juicy meat, and yummy house-made egg bun.  I asked for medium, and it came out just right.   Los Altos is a bit far for me to go to dinner, but I will come back one day.  That Prime Rib French Dip and Skillet Cornbread is just calling my name!

I needed a nice but not pretentious place to take my S.O. for his belated birthday dinner on the way to a concert at the Shoreline Amphitheater.  After talking to my friend, I decided to try this place out since I've heard so much about the food. Wow...this place was realllllly good!  It was a bit dark in there, but with a nice ambiance.  I checked out the surroundings and I really want to go back and hang out at the bar some time.  We had an early dinner to make the show and not deal with the later crowd at the restaurant.  Thank goodness because by the time we left every seat at the bar was full and the restaurant had a wait.   We ordered the cornbread to start things off.  Oh boy....I could totally taste the butter but it was so good I didn't care.  It was moist with nice crunchy (not burnt) edges.  It had a lot of flavor, other than just butter, and there was a LOT of it.  In fact, I still have some more downstairs.  (YAY for me!) For our entrees he ordered the Barbecued Beef Back Ribs with mashed potatoes colcannon and broccoli subbed for the coleslaw.  Wow...those were some awesome ribs.  Large, tender slabs of meaty goodness that didn't need any sauce.  They were very flavorful and cooked to perfection.  FINGER LICKIN' GOOD!  ha ha  Those potatoes were delish, too.  I'm not sure what was in them but I'd like that recipe...or maybe not because I might eat them all the time.  he he I ordered the "Hacked" Chicken Salad Arugula with Rotisserie chicken along with honey-lime vinaigrette and peanut sauce.  Note that I ordered the dressings on the side...and I'm glad I did because I only put a small amount of each on my salad, mixed it up and it was good to go.  A little really went a long way in the flavor department.  Plus that chicken was really tender and juicy.  I was so excited and think I ate everything but a few of the chip strips...since I was trying to be healthy and all...NOT!  =) Last but not least...I made a "deal" that I would take some cornbread home to allow myself permission to get a dessert.  (Funny, I know...the waiter thought so, too.)  We got the homemade Oreo dish.  WOW...that is to die for.  I really stuffed myself to an ill state because I couldn't stop eating it.  2 large oreos made with ice cream in the middle between crushed oreos to make the sandwiches...and then covered in a large mound of delicious homemade whipped cream topping on a sea of thick, rich fudge.  OOOhhh la la!  I scraped that bad boy CLEAN I tell ya!  Would have licked it if I wasn't in public.   Fun but chill place.  No one was dressed up...lots of jeans and shorts.  (Maybe that was partly because we were there on the earlier side.)  For the 2 meals, appetizer and dessert it was just under $80 with tip.  A little pricey, but definitely worth the quality of food and the service.  Note that our water was never more than half empty...and the glasses were tiny.  I also have to give props to the manager...that is one good-lookin' wait staff!  I'm looking forward to going back to try some more items.  I'm full just thinking about it...

A solid 4 stars for the food; we are also appreciative of the no corkage policy which is very nice. Service is decent for the most part; noise level is high (you have to shout) and the place is crowded (eight people in a booth was too cozy). We enjoyed all the appetizers; devil eggs - very flavorful, smoke salmon with toasts -good portion and fresh tasting, the mac n' cheese was very good; portion was small, and corn bread in skillet - crispy crust, yum. For main course, we all either had the prime rib or the rib eye steak, they were excellent. The quality and the grilling techniques definitely measured up to that of Alexandra or other high end steak houses. To nicpick a little, there were some inconsistency in the services and quality control, I ordered medium rare and got medium, server did replaced it promptly but the piece was smaller . The portion size of sides can also vary a lot from one plate to another, perhaps they are rushing it. Overall it was a great meal for meat lover / great comfort food, priced right for the quality and portion. You can feel 'rushed' and not as 'pampered' if the desire is to have a fine dining experience at leisurely pace.

Shrimp & Ahi tartar + THE Nice Little Side Salad -------------------------------------- OPEN ROOM for The Oreo Cookie Sandwich death grip dessert! I call it a death grip, because I am still fantasizing about that warm, gooey,  vanilla, chocolate smashed mess.   Service was great, options were good, portions were nice, and I like that you can order items off the menu.  Just ask Dude! I will be back for the cornbread and some artichoke-I just have to take it one step at a time.  Too many addictions can get expensive, ya know?

Solid food in my work hood! YAY! Took Eric out for his bday and we celebrated well. I ordered the following with comments: (1) GG martini - came out fast, cold, and good. Just how I like em. ($12) (2) Tuna Burger - no buns, decent fries, but flavors was too lemony and weird ($16) (3) Banana creme pie - not too good with the carmel sauce and whipped cream. The crust was crumbly and not sweet. The banana pieces were not ripe either. Very disappointed. ($8) (4) Deviled eggs - 5 halves, very good and tasty, my favorite for the night and a bargain. ($3) Eric had the Oreo ice cream dessert which was much better than my crappy banana creme pie. So there is hope with their dessert menu. Service was prompt and friendly. Next time, I will be ordering deviled eggs and a martini and calling it a day.

I was thinking about getting all creative for this review. I think I'll just tell it like it is. 2 DIVA (see Beyonce's definition) amiga's out to dinner. Both had the same thing. 1 Glass of Riesling each. delish! 1 Deviled egg appetizer (mmm..curry made them interesting!) 1 Ahi Tuna Burger, I had fries, my diva-licious friend opted for veggies. 1 Oreo cookie sandwich dessert (shared of course) Everything was super good! I really should have tried the prime rib special but alas, I am back to the Midwest for biz travel next week. I'll have my fill of red meat then. 4 stars for great food. I'll be back to award the 5th star when I try the prime rib. And yes, my bad ass diva amiga http://rolfrocks.yelp.com will be joining me on the next visit so watch OUT Los Altos!

UPDATE 3/12: Tonite my team went to dinner here. After last week's experience, the GM reached out to me via Yelp & invited me to call him. When I did, he invited us back to give them another chance. Me being the Oreo-cooking-loving-whore I am...of course I said we'd oblige. Plus, let's be really honest here. My team LOVES this place, which is why we were all so acutely disappointed when we had the bad experience last week. It's like being told by a best-friend that you're fat and ugly and by the way, you smell bad. Tonite was a surreal dining experience. In a giddy kind of way. Our waiter, David, was SO on it. And I've had him before... (that sounds so wrong?!) and he was wonderful then...but he must have gotten a note on our ressie that said 'treat these wackos with kid gloves' because he was so attentive. And we had multiple people checking in as well. We even got a visit from the Kitchen Manager, who had a fab sense of humor, & even gave us a few tips on *trying* to replicate a few of our favorite dishes. In the interest of full-disclosure, they comp'd our meal which was unexpected yet appreciated. The food tonite was spot on, though we all noticed that something was slightly different on the artichoke aioli. Tuna burger, as usual, was friggin' amazing, love that thing. And the cornbread? According to David, ours was fresh outta the oven....so it wasn't languishing unloved on some side burner. The bottom line here: props to LAG's General Manager for reaching out to me when he read about our exp...so many times biz owners lash out instead. This guy was a class act. He admitted their ressie system needs work, said they will no longer be taking ressies for parties over 6, they only have the 3 large tables, and it's too hit or miss with big parties. I can totally respect that. He also said they are going to be doing more staff training. I have faith in him, because he has worked for 14 other restaurants in the Hillstone company. Because frankly, we have been coming here for years. I want to see them succeed...if only so that I know that I never have to be without my Oreo cookie dessert!! Thanks staff of LAG, GM, KM and David for giving us a wonderful experience tonite. _______________________ UPDATE 3/6: Went here for dinner tonite. Well scratch that. TRIED to go here for dinner tonite. Party of 8. Called earlier to confirm. We all arrive, party of 8. They don't have us on the list. Talked to the manager. Got gal who made ressies on phone. To no avail. No one would fess up to making or confirming ressie. Horrible long wait, they couldn't accommodate us. Plan B...Trader Vics. Not the same, but they were fab with our party of 8, nice table, great service. We all felt acute disappointment towards LAG since it is one of our team's favorite places to grub. Special occasion, we had two out of town European team members who wanted to try it based solely on our rave reviews. What was the most disappointing was the noncholant attitude of the front gals about the 'lost' reservation. There wasn't one 'sorry' from any of them tonite...not even a 'sorry we can't accommodate you'. There was absolutely NO emotion coming from them nor did they offer any suggestions on fixing the issue...it made us sad. _________________ ORIGINAL REVIEW 11/07: Been going here for years, since it was Bandera. Had no idea it was part of the Houstons chain...but even if it is a chain restaurant, which typically I don't love, we DO love this place.One downer is..large party & no ressie, be prepared to wait...because they only have 3-4 tables that can seat more than 4, and big parties take a while. They are also no longer open for lunch. The grilled artichoke is phenom, but what makes it so is the dipping aioli that comes with. Jalapeno cornbread is yummy, but I think they churn out too many because it hardly ever actually arrives warm, downer. Side of butter if it's warm. Favorites...grilled chicken and rice. Rack of lamb. Bangers and mash. Cheeseburger. But the current love of my life is the ahi tuna burger. I don't know many places that do an ahi tuna burger...so this one is special. The bun is soft and toasted...aioli, lettuce, tomato. Get it with the side of the peanut asian coleslaw, rather than fries, the slaw is SO very tasty but seriously greasy. Got $12 to spare? Get a rotisserie chicken to go. Dessertwise...there is only one thing I love. The Oreo Cookie dessert. Sounds like something you get at a bad TGIF dinner right? Nope. Think crushed oreo crust, cookies n'cream ice cream inside and pools of dark bittersweet chocolate surrounding the cookies and real whipped cream. I think I dream about this sometimes, because I wake up and my pillow is wet. I order one for JUST me, no matter how full I am. Tried key lime and banana cream pie but no dice. This place is solid, service can be spotty, but the food really never disappoints.

Damn!  We recently came here and this place was packed at 5:30 p.m. -- F the recession!   We went with our party of eight, which included seniors and kiddies, and everyone left satisfied.  The kiddies were happy with the mac and cheese, the crispy fries that came on almost all the plates, and the oreo sundae.  The Chinese grandparents liked the hearty portions of well-seasoned charred beef.  Hubby and  I enjoyed the perfectly cooked seared salmon with asparagus and French dip sandwich. Service was friendly and efficient.  The one glitch we encountered was that there were no high chairs available when we arrived since tons of families were dining at that hour.  However, the manager came and apologized for the inconvenience and assured us that one would be brought over as soon as one was made available.   All in all, this is a nice, solid restaurant - one where you can easily take your picky eaters (e.g. my father-in-law).

We entered here with high expectations and this restaurant delivered with flying colors, from the short wait on a saturday night thanks to the petite, blonde hostess. Our waitress Claire came and conquered. We ordered the famous corn bread, and the roasted artichokes, both were great. Then came our dinner entrees. 2 orders of prime rib french dip, 1 order of ribs and 1 order of the macho salad. We all shared a taste of each others and soon dug in. None of us could finish but we all had smiles on our faces. We shared an oreo cookie dessert and from beginning till end it was a 5-star experience.

What to order? PRIME RIB BABY ($28)!!! I order mine rare and dunk it into the horseradish that comes with. The mashed potatoes that comes with this dish are heavenly *drooling just thinking about them*. They add chopped white onions and green onions into the mix of light and airy potatoes. I enjoy plopping small forkfuls into the auju sauce and gobbling each bite up. Why a small forkful? I find something heavy like mashed potatoes should be consumed in delicate bites to appreciate the flavor and it makes the delicious side last longer!!!! I only wish they offered a side salad that comes with the dish instead of charging for it separately. Our waitress was super friendly which made this visit all the better :)

I took my better half here for a small celebratory dinner.  The atmosphere is definitely perfect for business meetings, and it was obvious that everyone agreed.  We were surrounded by business men and women, wining and dining each other.  The large and crowded bar area is made for a light atmosphere despite the slightly fancy restaurant.  The restaurant was loud, which sometimes made it difficult to conversate.   The menu is minimal, with a some salads, fish, steaks, sides, and the usual American grill items.  He ordered the special, which was a ribeye.  I had their $13 cheeseburger, and we both shared the cornbread.  I must say that after hearing so much about the famous cornbread (it's actually called "Famous" on the menu), I was quite disappointed.  I loooove cornbread, but theirs was dry, dense, and cold.  We should have done what the table near us did: ask them to take it back and bring is a warmer one.  I honestly like the cornbread at Armadillo Willy's better (*gasp* yes, I went there!).  My cheeseburger was very tasty though!  Very fresh, and you could definitely enjoy the flavor in the ground meat.  His rib eye was also pretty good, and reasonably priced for a rib-eye as well. We had a reservation, and despite how crowded it was, we were in and out in less than an hour!  I was surprised about this, especially for a Friday night.  All-in-all, Los Altos Grill is a good, solid, and safe fallback place to bring people to because the atmosphere is nicer but still chill, the menu is easy for most palettes, and their prices are reasonable for a fancier restaurant.  Other than to meet people here for dinner though, I wouldn't be jumping for joy to return myself.

I've been coming here for years and years, since Bandera days (back when they didn't take reservations), and it's still one of my favorite restaurants. My personal menu standouts are the grilled artichoke, prime rib french dip, rotisserie chicken and the late, great, much lamented perma-special ribeye (yes, I'm harboring a wee grudge over its dismissal as a daily special, why do you ask?).  Others greatly enjoy the cornbread (great crust, but I don't like peppers) and I like to invite newbs to order the off-menu Cluck And Moo (chicken and ribs with cornbread and mashed potatoes) just because it's fun to say. There's never a corkage fee, service is always acceptable-to-fantastic, and LAG knows how to wrangle some meat.  If I had to offer up some negatives, it can get pretty loud inside, and I think most of the tables are fixed to the floor so they aren't able to seat large groups together easily. Go.  And please tell them to bring my ribeye back!

My dad raved on and on about the chicken and skillet jalapeno cornbread at it's sister restaurant, Bandera, in Newport Beach. Turns out there is a Bandera's in Sacramento, but if you ask me, that's too far of a drive for some chicken. But Los Altos Grill is a mighty fine substitute (according to my dad). Their menu is simple, but the flavors were not! Our table of 5 ordered the following: -Skillet cornbread -Chicken with a coleslaw substitution instead of fries -Marinated bbq salmon -Seared ahi tuna salad -Caesar salad Out comes the skillet cornbread first - ahhh, this is what my dad was talking about! Don't let the word "jalapeno" scare you away - the bread was warm, sweet, and moist with a slightly crunchy topping. I gotta figure out how they make this. The chicken, especially the breast, was incredibly juicy and packed with flavor! Not your typical seasonings here (I think I tasted a hint of cumin). My family and I aren't coleslaw lovers, but this one here we couldn't get enough of. Same goes with their Caesar salad. The dressing wasn't heavy like it normally is.   The marinated bbq salmon didn't sound appealing to me, but I was able to steal a bite from my sister. I was pleasantly surprised! Sauce wasn't too sweet, which was what I was afraid of, and the salmon was perfectly cooked. I'd ordered that next time. My seared ahi tuna was perfectly cooked and seasoned well. Several sauces were served on the side. Soo good!! Everything, from the casual environment with the pianist playing to the service, was great. I may not be coming everyday (prices are a bit hefty for that), but I'll be back again.

Finding this place was hard, even with GPS on a wet rainy day. The streets nearby weren't super well lighted. The reason why I discovered this place was because it was in the same chain as Rutherford Grill up in Napa where I had a delicious meal before. This time I ordered fish. And learned my lesson not to do that at a grill. It was alright. Nothing special about it. But the best parts of this meal was the artichoke appetizer. We were all literally fighting over it. And then I had a sample of my friend's steak and another one's prime rib. They serve absolutely delicious, moist and wonderful pieces of meat. So if you go, make sure you have reservations (because we were seated immediately with res even though the place was crowded), make sure you stay away from the seafood, and make sure you order their grill items.

One of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area hands down!! The food, the atmosphere, the consistency of the wait staff is all top notch. The BBQ beef ribs are slow cooked to perfection and they fall off the bone so easily. They are absolutely Delicious. The best part is there is no corkage fee, so you can bring your own favorite wine to share without paying a hefty price. Love this place and will remain a loyal customer!!

Sadly, I was not impressed with Los Altos Grill.  I'd been years ago when it was still named Bandera and had a really good experience but this visit was a bit disappointing.  Someone referred to it as "fine dining" in their review....wha?  Really? I definitely think that the no corkage thing is fantastic because we were able to have 2 bottles of wine and our dinner was still less than $80.  Too bad it was worth about 1/2 that....maybe.  Service was pretty sad....  our waitress had no sense of humor and would not leave us alone.... every five minutes it was "still enjoying?".  YES!  I almost asked her... "I'm sorry, are we bothering you sitting here?  Would you like us to leave?"  They definitely have some serious work to do on their service.  I was thoroughly annoyed by the time we left.  Good service is not the absence of bad service, I'm a firm believer in that.   The food came out super fast and none of it was hot.  It wasn't even warm, it was more room temp which was pretty lame.  Even good food served cold turns into bad food.  I had the chicken and mashed potatoes which I'd had recently at Bandera in Sacramento and it was super yummy.  This time it just left me wondering..."how long has this COLD food been sitting back there?".  Also tried the cornbread and mac n cheese.  Neither were great, but could have been decent if it was warm.  I was excited to try the oreo cookie dessert, but surprisingly, that was just ok too.  It was basically a de-constructed mud pie.  I might have been into it if I wasn't already feeling so disappointed.   I was excited to go to Los Altos Grill all week and to then have this experience?   I'm more likely to go back to Bandera in Sacramento because the food was hot and the service was good.  Normally I might have complained about the cold food but I was enjoying my conversation and figured our waitress would freak out since she was doing her best to get us the F out of there as fast as possible.

We made reservations a few days prior to arriving.  We all got there around the right time.  There were 9 of us, and we waited for about a hour.   8:00PM (time table was reserved) Hostess: When most of your party has arrived, we can seat you. 8:15PM most of the party had arrived Hostess: we still need to clean your table.  Once it's clean you can sit down. 8:45PM we are hungry Hostess: The party who had your table before still hasn't left yet. I watch as they clear 2 other booths closer by which fit about 9 people before and so should probably fit us too.  Those 2 booths get filled with other people. 8:55PM  We give up.  We go to Akane across the street for japanese food. What is the point of making a reservation if we have to not only wait an hour to get seated, but also watch as other people who came after us are seated first? Offering us free appetizers wasn't gonna cut it, especially when you were not honest about why we couldn't be seated until 45 mins into us waiting and repeatedly returning and asking about the status of our table.

Los Altos Grill, which used to be a Banderas and is owned by Houston's, is a meat-centric, upscale restaurant in downtown Los Altos.  There is always a wait for dinner and it is difficult to find a seat at the bar.  But the food and service are excellent.  We went here to celebrate two nights before our wedding, when all the family had finally arrived. Vegan Report: Like Houston's, this is a meaty restaurant.  They used to have a fabulous "Simple Salad" with champagne dressing.  You can also order side dishes, like the artichoke or the roasted red peppers.  The menu changes...

I guess you can officially call me a Hillstone groupie. I've now been to four of their restaurants and I've given all of them 5-stars. And I don't throw my 5's around... As soon as we realized the Los Altos Grill was a sister to Rutherford Grill, Houston's and Bandera - we were there. Tonight was a perfect occasion, National Day of the Teacher, and my wife is a Kindergarten teacher. We got to there a little earlier than our reservation, so we stopped and had a couple of drinks and an app at the bar. The Artichoke and Spinach Dip was good, but I have had better. The hostess grabbed us and we went to our table. The place was buzzing and packed. We ordered the famous Skillet Jalepeno Cornbread - the best cornbread you will ever try. Promise. I was sold on the Beef Ribs until I kept seeing the giant burgers go by. Burgers so big that they are cut in thirds. I fought with myself because it wasn't sophisticated enough. But seeing the shiny homeade egg buns go by sealed the deal. The wifey ordered the Rotisserie Pork Chop with Colcannon Patatoes and Broccoli. They arrived very quickly. The pork chop was double-cut and gigantic. Huge portion even for a dude, so my lady had no chance. The burger was big and oval so it could fit in the roll. It was topped with tomato, pickles and a peanut slaw. It was ridiculous! The fries it was served with were cut thin and shoestring style. Even though I was stuffed, no way I could turn down the Oreo Ice Cream Sandwich. Those bad boys came in a pool of hot fudge and had fresh cream on top. So rich, so pretty... Overall, a perfect spot. Hillstone knows what they are doing. Get the cornbread and pick whatever else, it's all good!!

OMG. I'm so glad I found this place!! You have to make reservations or show up early. We arrived at 5 on a Sunday and when we left at 5:47, there was already a 35 minute wait. Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich ($19) is as delicious as I remembered it at Rutherford Grill in Napa. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Side: The corn on the cob was yummy too. (There were other options, like french fries, mashed potatoes, and veggies) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The Grilled Artichokes ($10) is a must get. The sauce you dip it in is good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Also, I didn't try the cornbread, but since this restaurant is related to Rutherford, the cornbread should be on a list to try as well. The BBQ Salmon ($26) was just OK. Total dining experience: $70 Service was great - thanks Christina C. I couldn't finish my French Dip Sandwich and the waitress packed a fresh au jus sauce for me to go and helped pack my food. Thanks! I'll be coming back.

I have been a fan of the Houston's Restaurant chain for many a moon. Their restaurants are simple, the food delicious, and the execution is flawless. Service is efficient and seemless. Way back when, I was in the restaurant biz. We used to bring our Managers to Houston's and just have them watch everything. Watch how efficient they were. How clean the place was. How service was quick but invisible. We would bring our Managers there just to show them that, yes, in fact, you could be that good, and yes, you could get your staff to execute if you tought them and then held them to a standard. They were a fine example of what casual, but nicer dining could/should be. Fifteen years later, they are still doing a great job. Which leads me to my review of LAG....Since we are Houston's deprived on the Peninsula, we get the next best thing....Houston's cute little cousin..."Los Altos Grill". I've only had a couple of menu items here , because every time I go...I get sucked in......I get sucked in by the BONES.....them lip smackin, tangy, fall off the bone tender, chared on the outside, juicy on the inside RIBS........Fred Flintstone here I come...The brontoburger has nothing on these ribs....So good...so tender...so fufilling...Batman in love..... Yup...go for the ribs.....I opt for the double side of the peanut, cilantro coleslaw (cabbage is good for you)....Give me a bib...I pile of hot towels...and face down...chompfest '09. They have some other goodies of note.....Jalepeno corn bread...delcious little side salad with corn and roasted beets....great bread...and one of my favorite wines by the glass "The Prisoner". Cool atmosphere.....nice Los Alto'y type crowd.......piano player for mood...cheerful, efficient service.... Houston's little cuz scores again. Good to see that some things never change... Claire loves the leftovers too!

I went to Los Altos Grill on the recommendation for the best roast chicken in town. It was disappointing. A good roast chicken has to have crispy golden skin and juicy meat that is just cooked. Sorry, but the chicken I had at Los Altos Grill was far from it. The best roast chicken I have had so far is one of the simplest things to cook at home. Save your trip, and click on this link to the recipe for the best roast chicken: http://www.epicurious.co… Oh, remember to get a fresh organic bird for this recipe as foodies must know that the best dishes start from the ingredients!

Trio!  When I walked in this restaurant, the trio was playing beautiful sassy jazz (Oh, I miss hearing live Jazz).   This restaurant is packed with people even on a Tuesday night and it was 8:15pm.  I think the jazz is bringing all the people here. I have never gone to this restaurant before ("grill" is not my kind of food).  I was surprise that they have a vegetarian plate.  I ordered it and it was OK.  The service is good and the Jazz trio is excellent and exceptional.  I was told that live music is Monday-Thursday 6-9. This is a good place for live jazz music, with no cover charge nor entrance fee. Waidy

We've been eating at Los Altos grill for several years now when it used to be called Bandera. This is my wife's favorite restaurant. Even my daughter loves the kids meal chicken with chips and the fabulous Dove bar dessert at the end. I tried every single menu item by now and i end up licking my fingers dry after each visit. My favorite is the leg of lamb or the medallion beef with garlic mashed potatoes. Of course the roasted chicken is also delicious. We usually go early in order to avoid the 45 minutes wait. Try it around 5:30 or 6 PM and if you're lucky the wait will be only about 15 minutes. 5 stars for this place.

Always packed whenever we go, but the food I think is often worth the wait. ...usually 30 to 40 minute wait.  A bit dark on the inside, but very happening.  Decent drinks at the bar.  Lots of yuppies. I love their prime rib french dip!  The au jus is not very salty like many places. Not on the menu but you can order is "the Cluck and Moo"...basically a side of roitesserie chicken, bbq beef ribs, mash potatoes and a slice of their cornbread!  A little bit of everything. Their grilled artichoke is quite tasty with the roumulade dipping sauce. If you aren't a big coleslaw fan like myself, try their peanut slaw....very different and tasty. Their fish of the day are pretty decent as well...never had it where they overcooked it. Their cornbread is very popular served in an iron skillet.  Has bits of jalapeno peppers and bits of corn...very yummy. A must try!

This place has quite the happening bar scene.  If you're looking for someplace to pick up your next sugar daddy, look no further. It's incredibly dark in here.  I could barely see the menu and the path to the restroom takes you right by an entrance to the kitchen and I almost bumped into a couple of waiters.  I'm kind of clumsy.  We all survived so it's ok. The grilled artichoke, ono sandwich and ahi tuna burger were all tasty and the service was good.  By 7:30, the place was packed.

All of my original review still applies but now they have an additional feature which makes me love them more: wines to go! They sell any bottle on their wine menu to go for 30% off the dine-in price. Highlights for this program: - They said it was comparable with a BevMo price. I was skeptical but I saw a bottle I bought at a wine bar and wine store for about the same price so I knew it was legit. - Makes you feel good that they can't be gouging you 2xs the price it's worth even if you order it with dinner in the restaurant. - If  you do get a glass you like with dinner, no more writing it down and looking for it. Instant gratification! You can buy it right there Lowlights (my flipside to highlights): - Scares hub that there are more venues for me to go to and come home with bottles of wine to add to our ever growing collection. ;-) Love the wine exchange program of sorts: bring a bottle from home for dinner, take a bottle home to enjoy.

The dynamics of this establishment are miraculously magic and entertaining. One of our favorite places to eat, the food is outstanding; people watching - you have to see it to believe it.  The wannabe highbrows bring their bottles of wine, know the staff, and clearly get preferential treatment.  There is a degree of snobbery here, but the food is worth it.  This place is a lesson in ego, over 50's pick-up, and greeters who have just gotten their driver's licenses, you have to love it!!!   I recommend the Macho Salad and the Prime Rib French Dip sandwich.  You may wish to share these as the portion sizes are on the large side. Beware; if you don't have a reservation the wait can be up to and sometimes over an hour and they have nowhere for you to sit.  There is a bar but the etiquette of the bar crowd is lacking, no decorum.  You will need to fight for a seat and getting a drink or glass of wine while you wait is all but impossible as the bartenders serve their favorite regulars and ignore those trying to get a beverage.  Management could increase revenues thousands of dollars a week just by addressing this one issue and make a place at the bar for those waiting to walk up and order something, anything wet. The server format is to ask if you want a drink (finally someone asked), take your order and never come back to the table.  Your food is served by a bus person, and we have no idea who that was who brought our bill.  If the server had come back we might have ordered a glass of wine.  This is yet another opportunity for management to increase revenues. The Grill is taking reservations now, but you will only know this if you ask or read this review.  It is a well kept secret Grill staff appears to only share with their favorites. Not much of this matter as the whole experience can be very entertaining and the food is worth it.  Stand back, relax and take it all in.  At Disney Land the Los Altos Grill would for sure be an "E" ride. Being amused comes at a price.

No corkage fee!  I wish more restaurants offered this. It's best to make a reservation, but if you have to wait, the bar's a great place to kill the time.  They make a mean Manhattan ($10).   Prices are a little high, but they're offset by the savings we receive by bringing our own bottle of wine.  Their $3 deviled eggs (for 5 halves) are delicious, and their French dip ($19) is the best I've ever had (even beats Adamson's).  I've also enjoyed their prime rib and bangers & mash.   I like the ambiance here; it's suitable for a casual night out or a celebration.  Servers are attentive without being overbearing, and never have I felt rushed to leave, even when arriving near closing.   Currently my favorite place to dine out!

Our second dinner here was for our anniversary. This is a a great all-around place. Simple, delicious food complimented by fantastic service. We enjoyed a salad and deviled eggs, my wife had the sashimi seared tuna, I had the grilled rainbow trout, followed by the banana cream pie. I loved the rainbow trout -- so simply seasoned, but so flavorful. Of course, the lack of corkage is so nice, but the service really makes this restaurant. The staff are attentive without being cloying and are truly professional. During the course of dinner, our waitress learned that we had a dog at home and offered to box up some cooked bones they keep for customers with dogs. Our pooch was super happy and would give Los Altos Grill five stars if only she had opposable thumbs to work the keyboard. This is a great place I'm looking forward to returning.

A solid 3 for me. I have been wanting to try LAG for a long time now. Someone mentioned it to me when it was Bandera. It's the same corporate owners but with the Los Altos Grill name and same famous French Dip from what I have been told. After reading reviews and the menu I was pretty sure I wanted to try the beef ribs and the corn bread on my first visit. T. had the bangers and mash. Oh, we also ordered devil'd eggs because they were cheap and are hardly ever found on a menu. We were seated by the display kitchen which was cool watching the cooks and servers dance around each other in harmony. I also saw the microwave kind of tucked to the side and used to melt cheese. Not a huge bad but I usually think of top end restaurants never using a nuker, The devil'd eggs were good enough and always a treat usually reserved for Thanksgiving or Xmas. The corn bread was good but it came in a cast iron pot with at guard on the handle for heat. Problem was the corn bread was about room temperature. Still tasted fine but would have been perfect served hot in the pan it came in. My ribs were delicious as was the cole slaw that came with. The ribs had a great caramelized bbq sauce coating but again the ribs were tepid in the middle and not hot at all. I am sure the restaurant preps the ribs and cooks them ahead of time because it would take forever to cook them fresh. They were still incredibly tender. Not quite a let down but for the money I would expect just a little bit more. Still I told my wife that as long as Los Altos Grill is around I will not ask her to go to Claim Jumpers, ever. Weird thing is, I gave Claim Jumpers 5 stars. Mainly because I guess at Jumpers I expected less and got more and the opposite happened at Los Altos Grill but it is still better to me. Perplexing isn't it.

i loved it as bandera's and i love it as the grill... Atmosphere - dark wood, leather, circular bar in the center of the resto. lots of locals, family and singles, not sleezy. Food: everything ive had is good. steak is well cooked the rotisserie chicken i usually order and pickup for an easy meal at home. the ribs fall off the bone and the sauce is not too overpowering. The mac n cheese appetizer, is delicious and always tends to ruin my apetite for the rest of them meal cuz i cant help but finish it all. THE COLESLAW... soo good, but has a peanut sauce, so if ur allergic im sorry cuz ur missing out and unfortunately they cant change it. Their corn bread is a favorite amongst my friends i however dont like the jalapenos, but even so it is good. The french dip is really good as well as the burgers. since it is such a locals spot - the wait staff is very friendly an attentive, especially if they have seen you there before. oh and a must try : THE LEMONADE - Its fresh and not too sweet.... try it with a rasperry or cherry flavor. sooo goodd mmmmm yeah and no corkage fee- another amenity for their loyal local customers which is fantastic!

Formerly known as Bandera, the warm and woodsy Los Altos Grill is still busting at the seams and always appears to have a minimum wait of 40 minutes. And that's cool if you're in good company and can unwind with tortilla chips/guac/spicy cheese trio and a drink, but good luck scoring real estate at the U bar. The fish is good, but stick with what this open kitchen is known for: smokey rotisserie chicken, ribs with flesh that falls right off the bone, and the browned jalapeno corn bread served in a cast iron skillet. It's an obscene amount of food, but it doesn't disappoint.

Attractive restaurant that was PACKED on a Monday night... impressive since many other restaurants are ghost towns on Mondays. Had a terrific dinner experience: - Pinot Noir on their wine menu recommended by the waitress was super - just too bad I couldn't remember what it was - Cornbread appetizer was super - love the fresh baked cornbread in the mini pan with the nice crust. Yum. - Steak was perfectly cooked medium and juicy. It's no Alexander's Steakhouse, but delicious overall. Bottom line: Still remember the days when this place was Bandera. But still solid good food just as it used to be. A bit pricey, but I'll be back.

One of my favorites, this place epitomizes comfort food for me.  I love that they still let me an order a dish that has been off the menu for over 4 years now - the dish "Cluck and Moo" which is their  ribs with a 1/4  rotisserie chicken served with a slab of cornbread and out of this world mashed potatoes. Technically, it could be enough food for two but I've been known to finish off the whole plate it is so good. I forget about carb watching when I go here - the cornbread and potatoes do me in everytime.  I'm not a huge ribs fan but love them here  because you can eat them with a fork, the meat just falls off the bone. And yes, the no corkage fee is awesome.  It is always jam packed so try to make a reservation or expect to wait a while, even hard to squeeze in to order a drink at the bar. PS - My dog LOVES the rib bones I bring home for him too. :)

The food here is a treat, but be prepared to stand around among the be-Docker'ed bar crowd for an hour waiting for a table. Los Altos Grill (formerly Bandera) teems with a local after-work crowd every night of the week, which makes it impossible to sit while waiting.  The bar area in the center of the restaurant tends to attract a well-to-do thirty-something crowd, and is therefore a more mature environment than a typical sports bar, if a little stuffy at times (it's Los Altos after all).  It is a sports bar, so there are flat panel TVs in the bar area; but when in the surrounding dining area, you'll barely notice that aspect of the restaurant. When you do *finally* get seated, order the grilled artichoke (awesome), something from the rotisserie and a side of corn bread.  Don't forget the corn bread.  I repeat, don't forget the corn bread. If you come here, kiss your whole evening "adios."  We've spent many a long evening eating some delicious meals and downing a couple bottles of wine (yea, no corkage fees!).  Once you earn your table, it's hard to give it up!

My FAVORITE thing about this place is the no corkage fee! You can bring as many of your own wine bottles as you want, how awesome is that!? The definite must get entree here is the prime rib french dip sandwich. I went on yelp prior to coming, and literally 98% of the reviews were about this sandwich, and now I understand why. It's amazing in your mouth (that's what she said!), it just melts away... soo goood! Everything else on the menu is pretty good.  I've been here a couple times and have never had a bad meal. Other good entrees I've had here were the roasted chicken and lamb sirloin. For dessert, my recommendation would be the oreo cookie ice cream sandwich - yummay!

Much to my surprise, I was very impressed. Tricked into going on a date, I ended up here but left with a smile on my face, I guess the joke was on me! At first glance, Los Altos Grill seemed like a typical American restaurant with wood interior and dim lighting, but boy, was I wrong. When we stepped in, I noticed that there was a piano player and my date told me that there is a usually a jazz band on regular nights (we were there on Valentine's Day). In the middle of the restaurant is a bar and on the sides are spacious seating arrangements. Moreover, the restaurant has outside seating with heaters- how romantic! The decor was casually sleek lines melded with dark woods and metal, which flowed beautifully throughout the whole place. The staff was mostly young, attractive women who were courteous and delightful. The menu doesn't look much on paper but on the taste buds it was a whole different story. I ordered the grilled chicken which was so juicy and tender. Moreover, their cocktails are also gratifying- not too strong but not diluted with ice, either!  Lastly, we had gotten the ice cream sandwich for dessert which scrumptious to the very last bite. My surprise date and experience at Los Altos Grill was not that bad after all- actually it ended up really going well- Lol! Now, if I can just get the rest of my life to go that well too! J/k! =P

This beautiful and lively restaurant is located just off the notoriously dead downtown of Los Altos. It's full every night. If you're lucky you can find vacant bar seats and have a drink while you wait. You can also order any menu item and have it on this huge oval bar. The menu is small, and is usually accompanied by a couple of fish specials. But I've never tried them. I love their prime rib (although it's not as good as at The House of Prime Rib), and the filet is one of the best I've ever had. As a starter, the grilled artichoke makes for a light and tasty snack before a heavy meat dish. Most entrees are in the $20s.

Banderas (I refused the name change) is the most lively place in LA...which doesn't amount to much, but not bad if you're a cougar looking for some meat.  I promise you will find all the meat you desire here, along with some tasty rotisserie chicken.  I'm not a steak aficionado myself, but my 10-year old date called it, "the best steak ever!"  Most kids don't deserve street cred for steak, but my buddy just returned from Montana (need I say more?). Service was impeccable, musta been the hotties that accompanied me, ranging from 10-12 years old.  Apps came out within 5 minutes, entrees lagged slightly, but no complaints.  Too stuffed to attempt dessert, but I recommend sharing the gargantuan portions. -1 Star - Always been overpriced and took forever to get the check!

I absolutely love this restaurant. In fact, I pick up a salad from here at least once every two weeks. My favorite meal, that I generally order, is the Macho Chicken Salad. You won't find it on the menu :) But it is sooo delicious and FULL of goodies - dried dates, avocado, almonds, corn, cornbread croutons (holy foodgasm), tomatoes, roasted chicken, and of course mixed greens. The dressing is heaven as well, not that you need any with some many delectable ingredients. I would say everything on the menu is worth ordering - from the barbeque salmon to any special they have for the night. The Thai Steak Salad is one of the most interesting salads I've tried. I caution you to go early as it fills up quick. They have a great bar that people flock to for happy hour. Also, they generally under cook meat so if you like it well done make sure you speak up! Enjoy!

So, I've been trying to replicate the cheese dip at home for months.  I need to go back and have it again just to see how close I'm getting; if anyone else has figured this culinary mystery out, for God's sake enlighten me before I die of cheese & sour cream poisoning.   The tortilla chips you get with the cheese dip are awesome -- light, crispy and fresh.  Eat the dip slowly so you can keep getting more plates of chips.   So the thing about Los Altos Grill is, I wish, I wish, I wish I liked the rest of the food better.  I always want to like the rest of the food better, really I do, and sometimes some of it is rather tasty, but other times I find myself eating around something that I don't quite like.  The fact that I rather dislike colcannon potatoes makes it hard for me to cozy up to quite a bit of their menu -- I mean, I love mashed potatoes but I just don't like leeks.  Is it so wrong to want them to stay away from one another?   For mains, the broiled salmon is usually very good -- always a little rare on the inside.  The prime rib (which I have only seen ordered by males) is a huge freaking slab of meat.  I've never tried the chicken.  Come to think of it, perhaps next time I should just try the burger... The wait staff takes down your name and physical description when they put your name on the waiting list.  This amuses me.

L A G, is the place to be! Definitely not cheap, but the service and food were "Just What the Doctor Ordered"... Came here the other night, just before it got unbearably hot. It was about 7pm-ish and the place had a decent wait... however, there was a spot just for two on the patio. Hell Yeah! BF and I were immediately seated and got a chance to order the awesome Ahi Tuna Burger (damn that slaw was tasty!) with their mashed potatoes (with little bits of green onions), the mahi mahi (grilled) fish sandwich with fries, a slice of their tasty cornbread, and a side of their mac and cheese (actually made with penne pasta, so technically not macaroni). Oh, and some of their fresh squeezed lemonade (not too sweet). One word, INCREDIBLE. The portions were perfect (not wimpy at all), and the food tasted excellent, with unique spins on each dish (aside from the fish sandwich), and great quality ingredients. To top off the evening, they had a nice little jazz group playing inside, but we could hear them well enough to enjoy the music on the outside patio. The clientele seemed like upscale business types, and well off locals. Hey, what do you expect in Los Altos?

This is the only Hillstone Restaurant that I have been to, but if the others are like this one... I may have to check them out, too! This is one of my favorite spots.  I've been coming here for well over 2 years now and the food and atmosphere is always a home run. Some of my favorites here are the ribeye, the prime rib (bone-in), chopped chicken caesar salad, deviled eggs... I've even had their fish one time.  It was a seasonal fish and it was actually very good.  It is sometimes scary ordering fish at a steak restaurant, but they did a great job preparing it. Another cool thing about this place is you can bring your own bottle of wine if you like.  I always forget to do this so I grab a glass of my favorite Pinot Noir (which I found at this place) testarossa palazzio.  I am no huge wine connoisseur, but I am not alone when I say this wine is good.  I actually saw one of the waitresses from Los Altos Grill working at the Testarossa Winery in Los Gatos.  She told me that she now works at the winery on occasion because of how much she liked the '06 pinot noir!  See!!!  I'm not the only one that likes it! The atmosphere here is dark and intimate.  There is also sometimes a jazz band or pianist playing music.  the dim light, music and wine can make for a nice and intimate evening. A+++ from me... if you go here and don't like it, then bring me your left-overs because I will eat them!!!! lol

People get pretty excited about this place in their reviews.  It's really busy with all of the squarebears of Palo Alto and Los Altos on a Friday night; lots of wealthy dudes hanging out looking for vagina.  Cougars constantly on the prowl, looking for their next meal ticket and a night of dusty, dry poking. Aside from all of the overt middle-aged sexuality, the food is pretty good. Greasy but pretty good.  The service is usually top notch, and I like how they have an open kitchen.  Transparency in food service is a good thing in my opinion.  It holds the kitchen staff accountable so patrons can see them stirring the fondue with their wang, and it keeps the customer humble by not blurting out, "GOD DAMN WHAT IS THIS - CAT DICK SOUFFLE?!" when in earshot of the kitchen.   One time I ordered a dirty martini.  I had to send it back to the bar 3 times for them to please make it dirtier.  I explained, "just dump in like three ounces of olive juice," but each time it was hardly saltier than the last.  Finally it was all okay because the waitress brought me a small cup of olive juice so I could add it at my discretion.  She was a real sport about the whole thing, so I tipped her an extra dollar. Go prime rib!

I was just thinking about my cravings for comfort food and thought to myself why I don't eat here more often. I don't live that far away but I guess because I'm always looking for new place on the weekend and I cook during the week there's usually no time to squeeze it in. However for those off nights where I don't feel like cooking this is a good place to go during the early or mid week since the weekends can get pretty crazy. Monday or Tuesday at 8:45-9pm is a great time to go. Even then the place is surprisingly crowded. Large standalone wooden building with lots of dark wooden tones and accents in a rustic dimly lit space. A large oval bar in the middle is surrounded by multi level rows of dining booths. The wait staff and service are formally dressed but can also be quite friendlty. The patrons are generally your wealthy Los Altos families or single middle age executive type men who frequent the bar.  As stated earlier the place is fairly bustling even on a late Monday/Tuesday night which is somewhat nice for a town that is usually dead quiet on any given night. The food is American comfort with a slight upscale twist. To my surprise the Exec Chef is actually a Vietnamese guy, who has a definite understanding of the cuisine. The skillet cornbread is always a classic starter. Buttery with a crisp crust and textured slightly with kernels of corn and red/green bell peppers. The serving is huge and can definitely be it's own meal. Amongst the favorite entrees are the Rotisseie Roast Chicken , Leg of Lamb, and the Prime Rib Roast Beef Dip Sandwich.  A bit pricey for comfort food (hey you're in Los Altos) but to be fair the portions are pretty good size to match. Definitely a good local place that I need to go to more often.

UPDATE 3/13 Ok I came here last night for a team dinner after last week we had a problem with them losing our reservation and not being able to seat our large party.  We had to leave and take our business to Trader Vics instead which we were really bummed since we LOVE LOS ALTOS GRILL!  Mara T reached out to their manager via Yelp who was very sorry and agreed this should not have happened and please come back so we agreed to go back. We were just overwhelmed with the outstanding customer experience we experienced from the hostess, our wonderful waiter David, the chef, manager and all the staff that would acknowledge us as they came strolling by.  Every part of our meal was amazing from the artichoke, fresh cornbread from the oven, Ahi Tuna burger, pork chops, prime rib, and all the Oreo desserts!! The kitchen manager even came by to see how we were doing and to give us tips on our favorites dishes if we wanted to make at home!  Yes they did comp our meal but we did not ask for that and appreciated how they went the extra mile to make sure we would come back and have a great dining experience.  Thanks LG Staff for everything you did and I can't wait to go back. But next time I can't eat an entire Oreo dessert!! I was hurting so bad last night even if I did enjoy every bite :-) OLD REVIEW: I love this place but admit its pricey and it gets really crowded.  But I love their , moist chicken, Tuna burger, and amazing corn bread!! It's just so good!  Great American style food!

Food is still great, cocktails are tremendous and service is top notch but man, this place has gotten SO busy. Hard to get in and when you do, it's pretty loud. I still love this place but now that the secret is out, I've noticed that there are a bunch of douchey people hanging out - blech. But hey, it's not LA grills fault.

After almost coming here many times and always deterred by some of the reviews, we finally ate here last month, after Vino 100 tasting. Considering your choices in Los Altos, its really not a bad spot. Not your hippest youngest crowd, but the bar is actually pretty decent, we had good food and good service. Definately a repeat-er if in Los Altos again..

Okay, I was NOT going to write a review especially since there were 80+ who already stepped to the plate but was only investigating how on Earth this place had a four star rating on average. When I sorted the ratings worst to best my suspicions were validated... I found that all the more RECENT reviews of this place were the single star variety and all had pretty much the same tone. Yeah sure the food is good from a very limited menu. Los Altos lacks restaurant choices and so you are pretty much forced into LA Grill unless you want to drive and try to find parking in Mountain View or Palo Alto. Hey, who wants to take the risk after a couple of cocktails....aint worth it.. I have eaten at the Los Altos Grill about fourty times, I guess you could consider this masochistic but not so much as I eat out EVERY night and I like a cocktain...(remember the drive thing). So my experiences and review have a more than once or twice validity to them. As is repeated throughout the LA Grill Yelp reviews, the Hostesses and the reservation process are a JOKE. They are incompetent, RUDE and SNOTTY!! 8:30 reservations will NEVER sit at 8:30...even if you get there at 8:15 entire party in tow. Okay, so while you wait 45 minutes for your already expired reservation you can fight your way in the dark to the bar, Be sure to wear ear muffs or plugs because you are certain to have some 45+ over-processed Donna Karan bedecked too many glasses of mediocre Chardonnay http://Match.com candidate cackle loudly in your ear. If that doesn't get cha the mindless droning of some self-important  newly highlighted over-cologned freshly single hustler will make sure you share in what and whom he knows.  AUGH... Okay the drinks are decently strong, and if you can eat at the bar, its a decent diversion to watch a current sporting event. Whether you sit at the bar or a table, dont plan on feeling as though you can linger a bit and enjoy your night out. Cocktails, appetizers, entree, dessert, BAM BAM BAM. I think they must have mosta the stuff pre-made it comes out so fast. If you order a Cesear with Chicken and they forget the Chicken (which they do ALOT) they dont take the salad back and add and toss the chicken, they will simply grab a handful fom the kitchen and deliver it on a cold plate to your table...(If I wanted to cook I'd stay home).  The chicken is good, the cornbread outstanding, the oreo cookie dessert yummy....but hey after an hour wait and a coupla cocktails everything tastes great!! Service is what really kills this place for me. I am a stickler for service, especially if you are a repeat and semi-known patron. I tip VERY well for good service and make no effort at all for those who....well....make no effort. LA Grill will be around awhile. They are NOT hurting for business and that is unfortunate. I hate to see bad customer service be rewarded with success.

Okay, let me preface this by saying I grew up in Texas.  I know my barbecue...and I'm picky as hell about it.  In fact, I'm seriously considering being a BBQ cookoff judge (I'll pause for your laughter). So that little build up to tell you that Los Altos Grill has THE best ribs I have ever had.  Ever.  In the history of ever.  I could take these puppies back to Texas and confidently hold them up against any BBQ joint and know that a BBQ freak will actually admit that a California restaurant has better ribs than their hometown joint. Now, Los Altos grill is "technically" a chain.  They are part of the restaurant group that owns Houston's - which I've eaten at many times in various locations in Texas.  If you've been to Rutherford, for example, Rutherford Grill is identical to Los Altos Grill.  So we're not talking about anything original here.  But that's a minor point.  If anything, it's a plus...if you're in wine country...go to Rutherford Grill for lunch (same menu).  If you're in San Francisco, try Houston's (different menu). And the prices ARE outrageous.  But this is the one place I don't care about the prices.  They let you bring in your own bottle of wine with NO corkage fee (amazing).  The service has always been pleasant.  They have deviled eggs, for crying out loud (genius).  And their other selections are great. But...it all comes back to the ribs.  Absolutely one of the best dishes I've had in California.  They would win contests in Texas, North Carolina, Memphis...and even Kansas City.  I've hyped them to friends - who were skeptical - and now they are the ones doing the hyping.

If there was a high end Sizzler.. This place would be it.. haha.. I love this place!! Insane crowd but its justified with a down to earth menu and the no corkage fee (yup.. u heard it right.. NO CORKAGE FEE)..   No big innovations in food here, but everything was well executed from the ribs to the pork chops, and the mac n cheese.. An awesome place to bring friends and share a bottle of wine or 2.. (did i mention.. NO CORKAGE FEES? )

I love the Prime Rib French Dip and the Grilled Artichoke here but they are so expensive! I have eaten here several times and yes, the food is good but overall, not my choice of places to enjoy a meal at. The place is upscale and very clean but its not worth the price. Most of the bar patrons are in their 40's -50's looking for a yuppie to go home with at night or to at least pay for their expensive meal! Seriously, watch and listen to these people! It is very dark inside the restaurant and my 80+ year old grandmother tripped and fell on a step that the hostess did not warn her about. They did nothing about it when it happened. I just feel dirty when I leave this place and not in a good way.

This place is solid.  It has a menu that allows you to spend 40 dollars on a steak, or 17 bucks on an upscale burger.  i took the girlfriend here on Valentine's day and it was really.  This place used to be called Bandera's and is part of the Hudson's chain.   The decor is sleek elgeant dark wood and candle lit.  Romatico.. The place is basically open kitchen and they keep a limited selection on their menu.  thus allowing them to output excellent food consistently. Food - CornBread (It's got jalapenos and composed butter with anchoives sugar and some other stuff....)  Must get. Ahi Tuna Burger - here they actually chop up the tuna and serve like a beef burger.  This thing is killa here.  Absolutely loved it!  Fries are good too wink wink Prime Rib Sandwich - Good.  Just get it. Came with some really good brussel sprouts.  the waiter even hooked it up with some of those maple syrup carrots too.  Great stuff. **the best thing about this restaurant is that there is no corkage fee!!!!!!!!!** We went to Vino100 right down the street bought a bottle of wine, had a glass with some cheese, then brought the rest over for dinner at Los altos Bar and Grill. Bottom Line - BYOW and enjoy good food here!

I've been coming here for 6-7 years and I have always had a fabulous time. This is my boyfriend's, my family's, and my favorite restaurant. In fact my Yelp icon picture is me at LA Grill :)  I love that you can come in casual clothes or dress up. Apart from some other reviewers, I like the dark ambiance. It's more intimate and makes you forget about the other people in the restaurant. On the weekends it does get packed, and for good reason. But you can order drinks and appetizers while you wait. I've tried everything on the menu. The food always exceeds what I expect. What I really love is that since I became vegetarian three years ago, I'm still able to come and thoroughly enjoy LAG's amazing food. Their veggie burger is the best I've ever had. My meat-eater friends have given it a try and they got that bulged look in their eye, showing their shock at how delicious it was. Their enchilada is to die for! (I order it without the chicken, but with is just as mind-blowing.) I also love the dip duo and corn bread of course. The service is great. They do their best to stay invisible while getting everything you need. You never feel rushed. Whenever my dad takes us all out, he loves to post up a mail box and have a good long dinner (over two hours), and the servers never seem to mind. (My dad's real finicky too. A lot of the servers and bartenders know him, and have named the drink he orders the "Will-tini.") If you've had a bad experience, I implore you to give it another try. The only bad part about this restaurant I'd have to say are the hostesses. I can see how a huge party could be left with a bad taste in their mouths because of them. But I'm telling you, come back with just a couple people and really experience the food. (That's to you, Sandy and Shinny. And if you're waiting and hungry, like I said above, order an appetizer and some drinks.) As for me, I can't wait to go back.

Los Altos Grill has managed to please and successfully finds balance between an ambient environment coupled with tasty food. Although their menu isn't enamored with mile-long choices, they play it safe with well prepared grilled and smoked meats. My personal favorite dishes are the tuna & shrimp poke, cornbread skillet, and the prime rib. Expect to easily spend $40/person at this nice establishment. A warning to those who order a bottle of wine though: they brought our bottle already opened. I don't want to suspect anything, but the convention is for the bottle to be opened in front of you. Such a big no-no in my book.

I looked at the prices and figured there was some sort of "added value" thing like a view of the end times or a building made out of recycled strippers. Instead it was a whole lot of meh. The ribs are on par for your Texas Hill Country ribs for about 3x the cost. The cornbread was decent but nothing special. I decided to have a go at the rotisserie chicken and wow......where's the flavor? That's the whole point of a rotisserie chicken - hot juicy flavor so good you're sending bits of chicken corpse flying like an afternoon showing of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Instead I got a somewhat moist chicken that tasted vaguely like green chile and sorrow. I'll stick with my $6 honey-mesquite rotisserie chicken that's juicier, more tender, and infinitely more flavorful from the local market. IT COMES IN A PLASTIC BIN LOS ALTOS GRILL. SCHOOLED BY FOOD IN PLASTIC BINS. On top of all of this - plating was a big fat snore. It lacked color, composition, or really anything interesting at all. Once I saw my plate all I could hear from the waiter was "Here's your bland of blandy bland bland mcbland. Do you bland me to bland some more bland for you? I'll be bland with some refills bland your blandy" Dessert was good but nothing special....which seems to be the overarching theme of the whole restaurant. They seem to be taking hints from the politician's guide to food: aiming for the middle and hoping not to offend. I'm sorry, that's just not good enough for me.

Here's what I recommend to order: - Prime Rib French Dip sandwich - perfectly seasoned and oh, so tender.  Really, really great sandwich.  You can even skip the mayo. - Nice Little House Salad - This salad was delightful.  A little goat cheese, a deviled egg, cornbread croutons,  tomatoes, and a light vinaigrette.  Really, really good.  Way better than any other house salad I've ever had!  I could just eat this. - Skillet Cornbread - This had a really great crusty top.  The bread was moist and flavorful with jalapenos mixed in (without the seeds).  Great if you are more than 3 people. Don't bother with the rotisserie chicken, which were not very well seasoned and a little overcooked.  Or the lamb chops (which were really difficult to eat since they were very sinewy).  They ended up taking the lamb off the bill. The atmosphere of the restaurant is quite nice and there is even a piano inside.  I'll have to come again when there is somebody playing!

In a nutshell: Food - 4.5 stars P/C - 4.5 stars Service - 4.5 stars You know, I only discovered like an hour ago that Los Altos Grill is a part of this big restaurant giant that owns Houston's and other restaurants that I've been to.  Had I know that earlier, I probably would not have gone, because I'd much rather that my chowdown dollars go to places that are independently-owned and inspired.  However, since I didn't know that beforehand.  My friend and I went on our merry way to the restaurant. I know it's kinda cheesy, but one of the first things that enticed me to this restaurant was the no corkage fee policy.  Then a couple of my friends told me that their grilled meat dishes were pretty decent...so if you add the two together...it translated into...um...hell yeah! We walked in and the restaurant was crowded, but didn't look chaotic.  the crowd were chatting away, laughing, enjoying each other's company, and I could see and smell the aromatic charcoal smoke.  We were seated immediately upon the maitre d' spotting our reservation on the computer.  We started with a couple glasses of the Schramsburg sparkling wine and also ordered a thing of clams to go with our champagne.  I ordered the beef au jus  sandwich and my friend ordered the porkchop.  To get to this decision, it took some hard decision-making processes...we pondered at least twice about getting the ribeye, the rotisserie chicken and so forth.   When the food came out (and our wine was breathing away!!!) - we were singing in heaven.  The pork chop looked thick, juicy and succulent and it tasted just so.  It was accompanied by a nice side of mashed potatoes and cole slaw.  Yum.  My beef au jus sandwich was moist and the bread was crispy yet soft inside.  A little dallop of the horseradish sauce tipped me over to this grill-lover's bliss. We ended up finishing the plates (unintended) and had to forfeit the dessert, but it was such a pleasant meal. In conclusion: whenever I am in the area, I am going here for some down and low, hearty meal.

After an impromptu invite to dine at the Los Altos Grill one night after work I had no idea what to expect. When I arrived I was quickly brought a glass of Dog Point Sauvignon Blanc which I enjoyed while eying the open bottles breathing on the table. I eventually moved on and savored a 2007 Goldeneye Pinot Noir and then a 2006 Chimney Rock Cabernet Sauvignon. I was delighted about the wine selection but then was informed by my dining companion that he brought the wine and there was NO corkage fee! Yes, yes, yes! For a lush like me this is great news. Can't complain about the wine list when you are bringing your own! On that note they have a great wine list but why bother with no corkage fee? The bottles we enjoyed would have easily been over $100 with mark up. Onto the food - it was a decidedly gluttonous evening and we started off with artichokes, the cornbread, and spinach dip. Everything was good - nothing exceptional. The house salad featured goat cheese and deviled eggs. Omg, being from the Midwest I love deviled eggs. So bad for you but oh so tasty. Entree wise I enjoyed the featured blackened snapper over the salmon and even the filet. The mashed potatoes had more green onion than potato and the veggies were ho hum. Moving to desserts I swear on everything in life this was the best hot fudge sundae I have ever had. I wanted to drink that hot fudge sauce. Damn I'm so going back this week, I want to try the French Dip anyway... Besides the sundae I also tried the Oreo dessert and the banana cream pie - yes all 3. I mentioned this was a night of gluttony, I don't lie. Overall dining here was a great experience but I'm holding onto that 5th star until I go back a few more times. peace, love, and good booze ~ chase http://goodbooze.tumblr.…

I have been going here since it was called Bandera's, and their chicken and cornbread are STILL to die for.  They really know what they're good at, and usually stick with it. This is THE place to bring anyone from out of town, or even locals! Great American food, without the twang. All dishes have a little special touch that you may or may not be aware of.... their caesar salad... I wouldn't normally suggest ordering a salad at a great restaurant, but this salad is great! And the croutons are cornbread croutons, YUM! Other great dishes include the OSTRICH-- usually only on Fri/Sat special, but it is to die for. If you have never tried Ostrich, this is the place to try it. Better than any filet mignon I've ever had. Their cornbread is a must order (why not?), and believe it or not their mac n cheese is a rich, upscale steakhouse take on the dish. It's a darker/rich wood/steakhouse feel, and I think it suits L.A.G. perfectly.  Their drinks are always made perfectly, NO corkage fee, and I've never regretted ordering a dessert here, either. It can get busy at times (the only place in the area I can say that it's actually worth the wait), but if it's just two of you, try a seat at the bar-- just as classy. Thursday nights are a little rough, it looks like it's the nights that the cougars get a babysitter and take one too many drinks to the face. It's entertaining if you're into people watching!

The vibe here is kind of like Houston's, the chain with locations in SF and elsewhere. We started with the Yelp-raved-about cornbread in a skillet. It was leaden and a little flavorless. We took home the leftovers but didn't really want them. The boyfriend liked his French dip. My salmon salad was good but nowhere near amazing. For the prices they charge the food should amaze. It does not.

Really nice place, I like it! Los Altos Grill is a good hangout for friends to come together, have some good wine, get some good grub, and just catch up while chilling out in style. My friend and I were taken here one night due to the insistence of another friend who insisted that we drive all the way out to Los Altos to eat here.  So our group of 2 guys and 1 girl entered, and we found a seat at the bar while we waited our turn to be seated. The ambience was very inviting, rather intimate and a bit fancy but not pretentious at all - somehow suitable to a date night as well as to a  fun group of  friends to just enjoy the night, as well as to a business meeting.  It's the kind of place where you would look just as appropriate in jeans as you would in a nice dress or a suit.  It can cater to many types easily, and I appreciated that. The wine list was good -  lots of choices, and the bartenders seemed to know their stuff, made good recommendations.  The mood was also conducive to having the wine flow freely (read: buzzed before we got a table) and the service was  good. Once seated (we got a booth), which took about 30 minutes or so at the bar which was perfectly fine for us, we had a good view of the restaurant.  It was private, yet open, and also comfortable. The food.... This was awhile back and I can't recall exactly which dishes we ordered, specifically.  I do know we had this artichoke appetizer - - ooh la laaa.... nice.  Their cornbread was also phenomenal, which is a huge compliment as I am not a fan of cornbread in itself.  I ordered the ribeye, which was cooked exactly as requested. and the wine we were drinking complemented the meat perfectly. For the layout and atmosphere, I'd easily give Los Altos Grill a 5.  I really, really liked how one location was appropriate for almost anything you might need a restaurant for - and the service was generally polite, and welcoming.   For the food, I'd give it 4 stars for the items we ate/tasted, and scanning over the menu, I got the feeling everything here would range between at least 3 stars to 4 stars.  Portions were also generous without being overwhelming, which is nice.   Wines are good here, and while I am no wine connoisseur, the two bottles we did have were excellent.   So all in all - I'd give it a good 4.5 stars, if I could, but I am rounding down because I do not consider LAG to be amongst the "very" best -  just very good all around. They have a huge parking lot with thils building, but it was packed.  I believe it was a Wednesday night on which we were here, and even so, there were a lot of cars parked here already. Cost was reasonable - I believe the bill came to be about $160 or so, before tips - and that included 3 entrees, 1 appetizer, and 2 bottles of moderately priced wine.  Not bad. I enjoyed my night at LAG, and would happily go back again.  Good  food, great wine, and fun company.

The rotisserie chicken is good - as others have noted. But I am not really a roast chicken kind of guy. But I happened to try the french dip steak sandwich, and that was great. Unfortunately the service is consistently inconsistent, and the prices are a little high for the quality. Also, this place can get very crowded (long waits or reservations required) and very chaotic (my pre-schoolers were a little spooked). With so many other good places in the area, I probably won't choose to go again, but I also won't object if someone else suggests it.

Geez this place is great. The service is spectacular, minus the hostesses on occasion. We always get the deviled eggs or cornbread but last time we tried the grilled artichokes and they were super good. Unfortunately I've only tried two things on the menu but that's because those two things are so delicious that I just have to keep getting hem. The french dip sandwich is unlike any other on the planet I'm sure. The bread is buttery and soft, the meat is rare and theres a ton of if and the a ju is salty and beefy. Oh and french fries are just how i like them, thin and crisp. The burger is the other thing I get. It's amazing. You have to try the oreo cookie ice cream sandwiches too. I'm getting so hungry just writing this. Haha I will keep going here until it's not there anymore which I pray to god never happens. :) Oh and there's no corkage fee either so you can bring your own wine and drink it for free!

This place is PACK. but luckily enough, they were able to seat us (8) within 30 mins. The food is yummy, large portions, and kind of pricy. The only thing i dislike was that it was super dark inside. I would come and eat here on a date, or a birthday event with friend. it's an atmosphere where you want to drink and eat, and splurge on some money.

Mr Manager did hook us up! After a few calls back and forth to check if the restaurant would be having Ostrich, I left my number with Mr Alt, half heartedly expecting him to not call. A week passed, and on my way back from Pt Reyes, I get a call from Eric and sure enough letting me know they were serving ostrich that night. We were passing by Los Altos on the way home, so it was a no brainer. As I remembered from the first time I ate it, it was just as delicious! Thank you, and 5 stars to you!

If you don't know, now you know.  Los Altos Grill is a SLEEPER! Unfortunately, for me, L.A.G. is geographically undesireable, but I will visit when the opportunity presents itself... and YOU should as well.  This place is consistent with atmosphere, service and food. The atmosphere is warm, dark and Tahoe-ish.  At the time of my visit, Tuesday evening, there was a 3 piece band playing smooth, tasteful, yet hip music.  You are met immediately with a long oval bar, which is the soul of the restaurant.  I will ALWAYS sit at the bar. The service is excellent.  Our bartender/servers were very helpful and knowledgeable.  I mention servers as plural because each staff member had someone that was watching their back.  And the result is great service to it's customers. Finally, the food!!!  I saved the best for last.  The menu is simple for a reason.  Each dish is perfected and delivered consistently.  I'm a HUGE fan of cornbread.  I have NEVER, EVER tasted cornbread so good.  And for the main course, I had the French Dip sandwich.  I read the Prime Rib French Dip reviews and recommendations.  How good can it be?  If you're a fan of both Prime Rib and French Dip, it can't get better.  You will NOT have menu choice remorse.  My friend had the grilled seabass with spinach.  Honestly, the best seabass I have EVER tasted!  It tasted like an outdoor BBQ, with the touch of an experienced chef.  The seasoning was incredible! An additional point of interest was the wine list and policies.  L.A.G. has an amazing wine list, if you're into that kind of thing.  Their wines are reasonably priced and they don't charge a corkage fee.  Los Altos Grill can live by their food reputation and business and not have to rely on wine profits. I can't wait to return, and I take pride in passing the word to those who don't know.

I don't eat beef, but I've had pretty much everything else on their menu, many times over, as it's a family favorite. Their homemade veggie burgers used to be decent, but now it's pretty much all made of beets and very little else. The sides that come with it (usually more veggies) are often served cold. It's hard to get a reservation, and if you're into steakhouses, it's probably a good bet, but if you stray from that you'll likely be disappointed.

My family went here for my sister's birthday.  They told me ahead of time that it was essentially a Houston's, so I had already made up my mind that I would get my usual, the French dip. The artichoke appetizer was really good.  The dipping sauce was really tasty. We made really early reservations because we wanted to beat the crowd so my niece wouldn't get overly stimulated.  The service was really poor - that surprised me because there were hardly any customers that early in the evening.  It took forever to get refills on our sodas - we finally had to flag someone down because our waitress disappeared. This place doesn't seem very kid-friendly.  They didn't offer my niece any crayons and when I finally asked, they only had some large index cards for her to color.  They also don't offer a kids menu and when my sister asked the waitress got really dysfunctional.  She said my sister could pick something on the menu and they could make it in a smaller portion. In addition, they only have a handful of tables for parties of 6 or more.  So, if you plan on having more than 5 people, you need to call ahead.

This place was awesome.  I got the ribs and my lovely bride got the prime rib.  Both were perfect -- best ribs I've had anywhere, and I grew up in the south.  Strong wine list as well.   Huge wait so reservations recommended.  Lots of cougar watching at the bar so it is a fun wait no matter what.

I've been going to this place for years, when it was still Bandera.  The name has changed, but the Los Altos Grill menu pretty much remains the same.  It provides good comfort food; although the lines can be formidable--the wait can often approach an hour.   The jalapeno cornbread (non-spicy) in a cast iron skillet is a good way to start your meal.  The fish (usually halibut or salmon) is tasty, and the prime rib is good, but someone in the group must always order the beef ribs [so everyone can at least try one].  Beef ribs can often be fatty and tough, but these are "baby-back beef ribs".  The meat is tender and falling off the bone; the barbecue sauce and smoky flavor are just perfect.  I still haven't tried the desserts (since the portions are so big), but maybe someday. Oh... and they don't charge a corkage fee, so bring a nice bottle of red wine to enjoy with the meal.

Have never eaten a bad meal at The Grill. The cocktails and wine list are top notch, too. You should either get there early (by 5:30pm), have reservations, or prepare to wait because it's always busy. Great ambiance/decor, too.

MMMMMmmmmm.... SO DELICIOUS! Not many menu options, but everything is so delicious. They are also very attentive to food allergied customers and listen to your needs. Last time I went, I got the seasonal veggie entree and it was amazing. The veggies were cooked perfectly. Very filling! The rest of my party got steaks and burgers. All gave a thumbs up! It's nice to have a classy, family-friendly restaurant in the area. Love the jazzy ambiance too. Every time I eat here, I have to order a glass of red wine... or two :).

Anyone who knows me knows that this is my favorite spot for dinner and drinks, especially with guests from out of town. The 5 stars is because I'll readily drive from wherever I am in the Bay Area to eat here. And I do so for the BBQ Beef Back Ribs entree. I've lost track of how many times I've eaten them, and I cannot get enough. I wash them down with the house margarita, or three. It's probably some culinary sin, but it's so good, I don't care. Never have I had a bad meal here. From the ribs to chicken, enchiladas to burgers, and steaks to various fish entrees, I've loved every bite of food served to me. The appetizers are damn good. The Dip Duo (queso and guacamole with warm tortilla chips) can't disappoint anyone. The desserts will warm your heart too, if you are prescient enough to not eat your hearty dinner in its entirety. The atmosphere is intimate, especially when dining in the booths which feature low light. The bar is pretty big, and many people can sit and stand around it. You can either just drink and wait to be seated, or sit and eat dinner. My two warnings, which are not detracting factors to me: 1) You will pay dearly. The food and drinks are not cheap. 2) You will wait to be seated, maybe up to an hour on busy nights. These matter not to me. The food is worth every dime, and I'm patient. I bring good company, saddle up to the bar, enjoy a cocktail, glass of wine, or two, and enjoy the evening with friends.

I grew up in Chicago going to Bandera, so I was very pleased to find Los Altos Grill (same owners).   What is awesome:  the corn bread (warm, sweet, crispy on the outside), hacked chicken salad (great as an entree cuz it's good and the calorie count is right post-corn bread), and no corkage (cheers!).  The atmosphere is also interesting enough (housewives of Los Altos to VC types to families to 30-somethings out with friends like me) and they often have some light live music.     Warning:  One of the drawbacks is that it is REALLY REALLY busy.  We made a reservation for 8:15pm, and we were seated 20 minutes later.  That was a little bit annoying...but I'd still go back.

You find many different types of people here, from dads with their sons to high school girls all ordering $14 cheeseburgers and diet cokes to middle aged ladies with their parents who can barely walk up the ramp to their table. The menu is one sided and consists mainly of meat entrees with some additional things (like caesar salad) for those who don't want a heavy meal.  Prices for entrees range from $11-30. I usually order whatever the market fish is and usually end up paying about 30 dollars for a decent sized piece of fish and some steamed broccoli. They offer a limited selection of desserts, no menu for this because they keep changing.  Even though you don't have many to choose from, what they do have is worth getting.  My favorite is their oreo ice cream sandwich, which is eaten with a spoon. The room has mood lighting (dimly lit) and the interior has nothing but booths, meant to seat 1-5.  If you have 6 people in your party you will be getting a 5 person booth and a chair.  I find it to be on the warm side.  They also have a few tables outside with heat sources above. The food here is very good, the service is above average, and the setting is nice.

6/27/11: Last evening in our bay area trip, we met up with some friend for dinner here. Excellent choice and big thank you for making reservations (highly recommended otherwise there's a long wait)! I broke down and went for all meat, ordered the filet with vegetables and homemade mashed potatoes. Simply awesome and well seasoned. Our fourteen month old son found the love of his life when we introduced him to the mac and cheese here, he can't talk yet but clearly screamed KEEP IT COMING! One of the best secrets is the no corkage fee which of course means that we brought our own wines (chardonnayy which they kept cold for us and a cabernet sauvignon which was poured with dinner). Amazing that they weren't forcefull for requiring one to order off their wine list. Dessert was the oreo cookie ice cream that was just awesome and finsihed off our great meal.

So, to concur with Renae H response, I am the friend she was with and I was astounded with the disrespect from the bar staff and their cavalier responses.  I eat at 5 star restaurants and even the Rutherford Grill in Napa.  Also, as a sommelier in training and understanding the nature and behavior supposed to be demonstrated for the front of the house, this was an incredible experience of non-chalant treatment. Never have I received this level of service.   Butterfly cut means just that, not cut a filet mignon in half and call it that.  Even Rutherford Grill doesn't do that.  They get it and so do a number of other restaurants in the area.  Can you say Sundance in Palo Alto, they get it too. Well, I can spend my money elsewhere and know that this restaurant will never appear on my list of recommendations to my friend, family or customers. I do mimick Renae's response pertaining to the Manager, he did at least take it off the bill, but that was it. As a closing note, how in the hell do you totally burn the top of creme brulee and say that's ok.  Gross.  Never again.

4.4.08 Update I had the same experience as Mara regarding superb follow-up and customer service after I left (see original review below) because they couldn't accommodate my reservation in a timely manner and I Yelped it. I wasn't going to lay it all out, but since Mara did, I want to support her review and show that it wasn't a one-off thing and they seem to really be taking responsibility for their crummy reservation system and responding to their disgruntled clientle. Now, I just hope they're actually fixing their crummy reservation system. Of course when we arrived everyone was on high alert, so I can't say that my evening was reflective of an average night out at the Los Altos Grill. We got a visit from a manager, our waiter was uber-nice and then we got a visit from the Executive Chef. Every visitor was very apologetic and welcoming. I deeply appreciate that management is taking negative reviews seriously and constructively and reaching out to try to keep customers coming back. Not only will I come back, but I will continue to applaud their reaction and effort to anyone looking for somewhere to sup. All that said, we were a little disappointed in the size of our entrees. We both had the snapper special that night. It was cooked perfectly, and so was the accompanying broccoli. However, BFs fillet was significantly smaller than my own, and there was no starch on the plate. No rice, no potato, nuthin. I allowed this to be a silver lining moment because I knew we'd have room for dessert, when we usually don't. But really, only because I knew we were being comped. If we had been paying our own tab, I wouldn't have been so positive about it. We also each had our own serving of the oreo cookie ice cream sandwich. Sinful. Definitely enough for two to share. I hope we tipped enough. The service was really just above and beyond. We'll be back. --------------Original Review------------------ With reservations they still couldn't seat us for at least a half hour after we got there. We weren't greeted by the hostess but an irate (and possibly slightly sauced) patron that had already been waiting 30 minutes for her party's reservation. BF and I discussed and asked the hostess if it was 30 minutes wait after our reservation or after our arrival. Either way, it really didn't matter, we had movie tickets and didn't have 30 minutes to wait to be seated - did I mention - *for our reservations*! We decided to see what else Los Altos had to offer. Unfortunately for us, not much. Based on the sardine-line crowds at Los Altos Grill, it's not so unfortunate for them. They can apparently afford to treat patrons like that and still print money at the bar. Cougar says what?

My friend and I came here to eat after the Yelp elite event last night,  and had a fab time! First it didn't start out so fab, since our wait was going to be at least 35 minutes. But things started looking up after we asked to be seated outside on the patio and found out there was no wait! You also stay warm because you sit right next to a heat lamp. I found out that this is Rutherford Grill's sister restaurant, and it immediately won me over. I loved the food! Grilled artichoke!! I also had a cheeseburger with shoestring fries. My cheeseburger was more like the size of a cheesburger SUB on good bread with poppy seeds baked right in. It would earn 5 stars if it wasn't so expensive...not very often I order a $14 cheeseburger, haha.

Loved our dinner here tonight.  Nice ambiance, good food. Cornbread in skillet -- One of the BEST cornbread I've had anywhere.  Nice crisp and crunchy top, great flavor, real corn, bits of jalapeno and a hint of honey? Deviled eggs -- Good appetizer. Very yummy, chunky filling.  Not the usual processed egg filler. Hacked chicken salad -- Great salad.  Generous portion. Really fresh.  Real fresh corn (no canned stuff). Chunks of tender rotisserie chicken. Bits of dates was a nice touch. BBQ Beef Back Ribs -- Very tasty and tender.  Dry BBQ, not the overwhelming BBQ sauce variety.  However, a little pricey at $27.  If you are into a more meaty beef choice, go for... Bone-in Prime Rib -- My friend said he really enjoyed this.  Pretty reasonable for $28. Ahi Tuna Salad -- Seared ahi with a side salad.  My friend really enjoyed this.  It looked really good, and definitely something I will try myself next visit. Prime Rib French Dip -- Our other friend highly recommends this one. Orea Cookie Ice Cream Dessert -- Sweet tooth's will like this one.  Not terribly refined, but hey...good old sugar rush American dessert. We called ahead to make a reservation for a party of 6 (a good idea) but still had an almost 1/2 hr wait on Saturday at 6pm. In general, not a good place for parties of more than 5 as most seating or booths are for 2-5 people. We'll be back for sure :)

Came here with a few buddies to celebrate the end of the school year. Finally got to try the hyped prime rib and while it was well-executed, I wasn't impressed. I can make a better and more flavorful one with a blowtorch and oven.  The horseradish cream was also heavy on cream, light on horseradish which was a bit of a disappointment - but that can come down to personal preference, I suppose. Our table did get the cornbread skillet to start and that was good, albeit texture-wise it's not a traditional cornbread. My friends also ordered the roasted chicken (who was pretty good and not dry), the tuna burger (surprisingly from ground tuna and not a whole ahi steak) which was "okay", and the pork chops which were good. I suppose that sums up the entire meal -- solid meals but not amazing, and you can definitely find better prepared food elsewhere for a more appropriate price point. The interior of the restaurant is very nice and comfortable, and in keeping with the Hillstone tradition.

Maybe I was not in the mood, maybe it was just unlucky night or maybe I just missed the point. I felt like the whole concept was so obvious and formulaic, dull delivery, just another grill restaurant trying to hard to fit in with the genre. I am sure if I looked hard enough there must have been a plane propeller, an old bicycle and a gramophone stashed somewhere alongside the random quirky pictures et al... Enough of the decor, now for the food. We ordered a few lighter dishes to share. My first comment would have to be is there a salt shortage here? The reluctance to season food whether it for the super health conscious or just the lack of care in the kitchen I don't know! Starting with the Tuna Poke, beautiful tuna could have been such a great if just given a bit more life; salt, lime and wasabi would have made for a real fun dish. The "ripped" chicken salad, was reasonable but not nearly as exciting as its funky name, also dressed with the same garnish sauce as the Tuna squirted from a squeeze bottle, probably on all dishes. The Peel and eat shrimps, excellent, cannot go wrong on simplicity! Now finally the service. OMG! To start with a general lack of follow through, but the real killer for me was the champagne service! We ordered a $75 bottle of Roederer and were stunned when it arrived already open and then had it served into the nastiest "pseudo" trendy champagne/pilsner/shooter glasses without being offered a taste. Sorry, to me, just shoddy service.   It could be so much more! Oh and plastic laminate menus, should be saved for roadside diners...

My parent's chose the Los Altos Grill for my Dad's birthday dinner. The meal was good-- I had the Prime Rib french dip sandwich with veggies and the BF had the Rib platter. Both of us liked our meal. The cornbread is good too and a try at least once status in my book. The BEST part however was the dessert so SAVE ROOM!! I had the Schafenberger ice cream sundae (3 heaping scoops of ice cream and toasted sugar pecans on top). The BF had the Oreo cookie ice cream sandwich-- SO good too! Great atmosphere too-- great for a date spot because it's not too formal but still has a classy edge.

The thing I love about Hillstone is that EVERY restaurant makes the same food and its always terrific. My top picks: the spinach artichoke dip, the cornbread in a skillet, and the tri tip french dip. It's also nice that there is no corkage fee. Ever. P.S. If you come here with a posse of girls, the bartenders tend to add a little extra alcohol to your drinks!

Great appetizers.  The salmon was farmed and mushy.  The prime rib was outstanding.  The desserts weren't anything special.   Decent service, but some items were forgotten.  The decor reminds me of a Houston's.  Too loud and too crowded.   I'll only go back if it's on someone else's nickel.

If you've read some of the other reviews, this used to be called Bandera and servers somewhat standard American cuisine.  When you walk in to the place you'll notice lots of earthy, wood, and dark colors.  At night it can get pretty dim, but the track lighting above each table does a nice job of showing you what you're about to put into your mouth.  Its a completely open kitchen in the back so you can see whats going on with your food. They have a full bar and the bartenders seem polite and professional, but  I can't speak for their mixing skills since I've never ordered a drink there. The food.  The menu is not too complicated with your standard burgers, steaks, prime rib, chicken, and fish.  Its a decent selection, but I'm not sure a vegetarian would be happy here.  I've tried the French Dip and the chicken.  The French dip comes with a generous stack of very tender prime rib, fries, and au jous.  The meat stand to have more flavor, but the tenderness I feel makes up for it. Now on to the chicken.  I have eaten my share of chickens and Los Altos Grill does a good job with their "famous chicken".  But now for a quick history ... When this used to be Bandera they served their chicken essentially naked.  No sauce or gravy whatsoever, which is quite ballsy because you can hide a dry chicken by adding lots of sauce/gravy.  You would think their chicken was the bomb.  Back to today .. With the chicken you get 1/2 chicken, rice, and 1/2 tomato.  The chicken itself was very moist, but nothing special flavor wise.  What was unique was the gravy and rice.  The gravy had a hint of Cumin and the rice seemed to have some coconut milk flavor, not to mention accented with cilantro and a lime.  The head chef, who is Vietnamese, is putting a nice flair to a somewhat traditional dish. Now for the big winner at Los Alto Grill ... the cornbread.  Do  yourself a favor and order this $6 cornbread that comes in a 6-7 inch iron skillet.  Its very moist and the crusty top is the best! For dessert I and the ice cream sandwich.  Now I had visions of the traditional ice cream sandwich, you know the Neapolitan ice cream and wax paper cover.  It would get messy near the end and you have to basically eat the paper to get all the chocolate off .. yeah good times.  The best way to describe what you get here is a puck of ice cream split in half.  The crust is Oreo based, vanilla ice cream in the middle, in a plate full of bitter sweet chocolate sauce. The atmosphere is on the older side, but then again this is Los Altos.  You have sales guys and CEO's at the bar, older couples in the booths, and a few teens here and there.  We went on a Tuesday night around 8:45PM and it was packed!  No waiting for a table, but kinda surprising for a Tuesday night.  Service was very good as well. Los Altos Grill is a solid restaurant with some interesting twists.  Prices are ok.  Cornbread, French Dip, Chicken, and dessert came out to be $25 each.

I went to Los Altos Grill for the first time with a couple girlfriends last night, and I loved it! Pros: - great ambiance - friendly, attentive staff - live music - NO CORKAGE FEE - ample parking - delicious food Cons: - long wait without reservations I ordered the beef baby back ribs as my entree. All I ask for with my ribs is for the meat to fall right off the bone, and it definitely did! The 5 giant ribs were also a good portion size, and my stomach was definitely satisfied. We shared the corn bread and Oreo sandwich dessert - which were both delicious! The corn bread had some jalapenos in there, which actually worked pretty well for me, and the Oreo sandwich dessert had an expresso sauce that was absolutely mouth-watering. Definitely coming back next time with more bottles of wine! This place is a must try!

Came here with my 2 year old daughter. The hostess decided to seat us at a table that was 1 foot away from the middle of the bar and there were about 10 drunk people standing over our table. I looked around and noticed that there were plenty of empty tables away from the bar so I asked to be moved. If your sole responsibility is to seat people, you really need to think about whether a family with a little kid needs to be seated next to a bunch of drunk people or not. Started off with the artichoke dip appetizer. The chips were good, the dip was not that great but I ate it anyway. For dinner I ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. The steak was a good cut of beef and was perfectly cooked. Unfortunately it was not seasoned and they served it dry, no sauce. I asked if they had any gravy or steak sauce and all they had was barbecue sauce. You do not put barbecue sauce on a filet mignon. If the first thing you do after tasting your filet is reach for salt, someone in the kitchen has committed a serious food felony. Anyone can apply heat to a steak. I can do that at home. That's not why I go to an expensive restaurant. I EXPECT a good sauce and good seasonings on my steak. The mashed potatoes also weren't seasoned and were bland, and were mixed with green onions. The green onions were a good idea as it gave the potatoes a little crunch, but they put WAY too many green onions in it and it wasn't that good. The corn on the cob would have been OK, but they put mayonnaise on it. You heard right, mayonnaise. Overall, the steak was cooked perfectly but this was not a composed, well integrated dish. It lacked seasoning and a sauce to tie it all together. A little peppercorn sauce or wine reduction would have gone a long way towards making this dish A+ instead of C-. And who the hell puts mayonnaise on corn? For desert I had the Oreo cookie ice cream, which was fantastic. It had home made Oreo cookie, ice cream, and home made chocolate sauce. If the only thing I had tonight was the desert, I would give this place 5 stars. This is the only reason the place gets more than 1 star.

This place was super packed on a weekday, nice music. Everyone raves about the corn bread, but it was a bit greasy for my taste. Got the prime rib, was very tender, the outside parts were delish, but the center was a little bland. Texture of the grilled salmon was great, but again, a little bland.

3.5 stars. This is where my mom and I come when I visit her while dad's out of town: we can sit at the bar and scarf down some seriously delicious burgers over a few cocktails and finish up with their amazing "oreo ice cream sandwich sundae," a seriously addictive treat that haunts my dreams and my round, round, shapely behind. Sometimes we even bring dad, when he's around. Artichoke is stellar too...only draw back is that we've suffered some seriously horrendous service here on occasion, when it wasn't even very busy. Typically they're pretty organized even though there is often a wait, but man, those couple of times were totally inexcusable.

This is such a fantabulous restaurant! Go with your SO or a bunch of friends, this place has really great apps and entrees. I went there last night with a bunch of friends and just had a great dinner. The place is dim, with nice mellow yellow lighting here and there. It was a bit dark where we sat but not too bad. We had a booth towards the back area which was good since we were kind of a loud crowd. One of the best things of this place? NO CORKAGE FEE!! So we had 6 bottles of wine with us. For apps: 2 orders of roasted artichoke (the dip is peeeerty gooooood) 1 order of the ahi tuna with shrimp and avocado and mango (MY FAVE!) 1 order of clams (mmmmm.... good with bread) 1 order of cornbread (OMG it was to DIE FOR) Entrees: 4 orders of prime rib w/mashed potatoes 1 order smoked salmon 1 order spinach and chicken enchilada Dessert: 2 espressos 1 cappuccino banana cream pie Total $260ish. our waiter was a pretty cool guy. we got to know him pretty well by the end of the night. Each time he came by one of our friends kept asking him something. Overall, excellent food, great service and nice ambiance.

Oh my god, this is now one of my favorite restaurants in the South bay! What we loved: Prime Rib: juicy, tender, cooked to perfection.  The creamed horseradish is delish too. Filet-cut Steak: loved this too! It's outer crust is seasoned well and very tasty. Ahi Tuna Burger: Probably the best ahi burger I've ever had.  The tuna had good flavor. Skilled Cornbread: THIS IS A MUST!  The best cornbread in history!!  It has a cheesy topping, similar to what you get when you do a grilled cheese sandwich, but better!  There's real corn chunks and spicy peppers in it too. Ice Cream Sunday with Candied Pecans:  Pecans were great, but the sunday itself wasn't too spectactular.  I think its awesome that their dessert is a secret menu and only the servers know it.  I plan to try the key lime pie next time, which is supposed to be their specialty. Their service was extremely professional, very courteous, friendly and shockingly quick.  I loved the traditional bar and grill atmosphere, but also appreciate that everything is renovated and well kept.  Another great thing is that they have live music on some nights, great piano on the night we went!   Cant wait to go back!

I have two words for you. NO CORKAGE. So bring your favorite bottle of wine and enjoy!   That being said, the wait is ridiculas... but if you can manage to amuse yourself with a good martini in the meantime.. (and they do make a great martini) ....it's a great place to people watch and get hit on.   Yes, it amuses me to get hit on.  And if meat markets (haw haw haw!) amuse you too... this place will not fail ya.   I even had a "drive by" hit upon there.  Some guy walked past our table and dropped a handwritten note on a napkin.   This wasn't like.. some punk kid either ...   No no...  a grown man didn't have the balls to talk to my friend and I, both grown women!  It was awesome.   And the food is good too.   They have the best house salad ever.   Most "house salad" is a pathetic mix of iceberg and mealy tomatoes.   Not here.  Oh no.  This is spring mix with tomato, cucumber, chevre, roasted corn kernals, jalapeno cornbread croutons and a half a deviled egg. ..tossed in a citrus vinaigrette.  Now THAT is a house salad to be reckoned with. The roast chicken... great... the colcannon...great...  the simple grilled fish dishes...great... enchiladas...great...prime rib, great too.  The wait sucks and the service is hit or miss but the food is solid here. Bring back the macho salad, damnit.   That was my favorite.   Salad with shreddy roast chicken, goat cheese, dates and almonds (I think).  They'll still make it for you if you ask.   Go later on a weeknight for less of a wait.   Can get very loud. Long live Bandera.

Los Altos looks very upscale, but I thought the price was very reasonable. Most of the items $15-22. Anyway, I ordered the center-cut filet. The steak was flavored a little too much, and the broccoli was seasoned with garlic salt. Some may find that too salty, but since it was my birthday, I call that a perfect meal. Mmm... tasty. They're infamous for their chicken, and my dad loved it! Service was great, but the wait was 45 minutes. That was the only drawback. ps--no corkage fee.

I agree with the other Yelpers that the service could be improved--they're late on reservations consistently. However, the food is so fabulous, that I go back on a regular basis. Los Altos Grill makes me like food that I hate, i.e. their Banana Cream Pie is bomb, the cabbage isn't my fave, but I still eat it, etc. Love: - Filet mignon (it isn't saucy. It's seasoned very well) - Prime Rib - Potatoes Colcannon - Fries (thin & delish) - Artichoke appetizer (salty...yum!) - Mac n Cheese - Banana Cream Pie - Oreo dessert - Sundae Strongly Dislike: - Hosts: they just don't give proper expectations for wait time. Don't tell me it'll be half an hour when it turns into an hour and 15 min.!

I've only been here a couple of times, but each time I'm always surprised by how expensive the food.  The quality is decent, but it's not fantastic.  I had some okay chicken for my meal, but the appetizers were good. The bartenders here are fairly young and *hot*, which is odd given the older clientele.

Upgrading rating to 5 stars!  In my first review, I mentioned that we weren't thrilled with the attention we got from our waitress and they more than made up for it this time!   Our waiter was awesome - perfectly attentive, friendly and professional.  The head chef Vy Diep came out to say hello at the beginning of the meal and to apologize for our past experience. As usual, we ordered the prime rib and oreo cookie ice cream, but we did manage to sneak in a few new dishes: Steamed clams with sausage & grilled bread - The broth was to die for! Heirloom tomato salad with blue cheese and champagne vinegarette dressing - Fresh, light and delicious. At the end of our meal, Vy came out again to tell us that they would take care of our bill.  It was SUCH a nice surprise. We were already huge fans of this place before and now will forever be loyal customers.

Overview: What a great restaurant! They serve great food and great wine in a lively environment. It is a tad on the noisy side, but still really enjoyable. Sometimes its nice to not whisper through dinner :-) Must Try: Artichokes: These were so yummy. They were served right off the wood fired grill - still smoking in fact! They come with a mayo dipping sauce that was so tasty. If you like artichokes, you'll love these! Grilled Pork Chop: This was my hubby's order... he loved it! Beware, the thing is HUGE! He woke up this morning saying, "I can't believe I ate half a pig!" Too funny. Mashed Potatoes: I don't even like mashed potatoes and these were so good! They have other stuff mixed in, so they're not your run-of-the-mill taters. Stay Away: Everything is great! Wine List: Short, sweet and to the point. We ordered a medium priced bottle of wine and I was so incredibly thrilled with it. We even wrote down what it was, I liked it so much. Bread: No bread is served with your dinner, but the servings are so big it's actually a blessing! Service: Really attentive, but not in your face. We were right under the AC and they even turned the fan down so we weren't so cold. I love that!

In an otherwise empty downtown Los Altos, this place is unusually busy almost every night. Filled with regulars and live music, you get the feeling that the economy is doing just fine when you dine here. The food isn't particularly remarkable. The quality is just slightly below the price, which is to be expected given that the total lack of corkage fee no doubt eats into their profits. Of course, no corkage fee makes this place an awesome place to enjoy a bottle or three of wine with a decent meal and excellent ambiance. I would recommend the cornbread, the center-cut filet, the cheeseburger, and for dessert the Oreo cookie and ice cream thing. The cornbread is a little greasy, but served warm and moist with a sugar glazed crust and jalapeños. The center-cut filet is their best steak, a tender and juicy slab of meat that otherwise redeemed their entrées for me. The cheeseburger is tasty, but ironically Houston's, one of their sister restaurants, still holds the top place in my heart for a gourmet burger. As for dessert, there's enough sugar in the ice cream/Oreo cookie thing to make a diabetic go into shock. Other items on the menu I've tried and haven't been impressed with include their mac and cheese, grilled jumbo artichoke, roasted prime rib, and barbecued beef back ribs. The wait staff was very friendly and if you don't like brussels sprouts (which is quite possibly the only vegetable I don't like), make sure it's not the seasonal vegetable served on the side. They are usually willing to substitute a different side if you ask.

I have found people watching in Los Altos Grill to be almost half the fun of eating at this place. There really is so much to see. Watch the bartenders muddle mint leaves for the killer mojitos served here. Observe as parties of different sizes dig into succulent looking prime ribs or rare tuna steaks Stare in awe as a few cooks bring in truckloads of ribs to char on the grill. Salivate as other cooks hang cast iron pans teeming with Yankee corn bread on specially made cooling racks Lastly, count the average number of wine bottles per table. Since Los Altos Grill does not charge corkage, people tend to bring a lot of their private stash to pair with the food The only downside about this place is both the beer (!?) and the dessert selection seem to be afterthoughts. This place seems to always be busy so do get reservations before you go.

Best friggin salmon ever!! Barbequed salmon that must have been marinated for-ev-er! didn't even really taste barbequed - which is awesome b/c I don't care for that "charred" flavor. It was really THAT good. We started with the cornbread, which everyone had recommended. I haven't had much cornbread in my life but this was pretty friggin' tasty. My cosmo was perfect, the booth was a nice size and there was live music. This place was packed and it was a Tuesday night only!

Love the cosmos! Like the service and adore the Ahi Tuna sandwich. The atmosphere is in this place is cool.  I dug the live piano music through out dinner --- had there been a Nordstrom nearby, I would have hit the shoe department!  Yes, that is what piano music means to me. I do think the place needs a kids menu for crying out loud.  The staff did scare up some crayons for my kids, after multiple requests. Classy joint altogether, perhaps they don't want the ankle bitters there.

They are opened late and there always seems to be a line no matter how late. I guess this is the late night spot in town. Since I am in training for a triathlon, I have been eat more vegetables and protein. Their grilled mixed vegetables hits the spot. The selection is fresh and grown locally, so, it always changes; but, you always get a corn and their cornbread.   The atmosphere is energetic and there is usually a live band. It tends to get now in there with the bar in the middle.

Had dinner a couple weeks ago and the food was great. I have been to Rutherford Grill and loved it, so I was really excited about Los Altos Grill. We got artichokes to start and a side of cornbread with our meal. The cornbread was barley warm but we took most of it home and it was great warmed up for leftovers. Husband got the short ribs which he liked and I got the prime rib sandwich that was so delicious, I would go back in a second for it, I ate it all I cleaned my plate! So delicious. We got the oreo dessert which was just as mind blowing as when I had it at Rutherford Grill and we brought our own wine since there is no corkage fee! Plus service was fast and friendly, can't beat it!

This is without a doubt, one of my go-to dinner spots in the South Bay.  To sum it up: NO CORKAGE!  Which is awesome in an of itself.   But the reason I really love it?  It appeals to boys and girls alike.  My love can get steak (or chicken, or a burger, or any of their delicious meaty meats) and I can get salad or tuna.  Together we are happy happy.   I also love that their service is really really really spot-on.  You need something, they are there before you even ask.   And you walk in, you really feel the electricity in the air.  This place is buzzing with people drinking wine and the 3 piece band turning out the tunes. The only downfall is its own success ... it doesn't matter if its a weeknight or a weekend, this place is SLAMMED.  So do yourself a favor and call ahead.  If you do not call ahead, make sure you bring an extra bottle of wine!  They will uncork it while you wait.  The last time we were there, we saw a group of 50-somethings drinking a bottle in the parking lot (I kid you not).

Los Altos Grill is a pretty nice restaurant that offers a nice setting and a great place for groups to get together for a decent meal. Their cornbread was awesome; it was crispy, full of texture, and pretty moist.  There was a good mix of flavors between slightly sweet, a little spicy, and occasionally creamy.  Their prime rib was served in a reasonably large portion with plenty of creamy horseradish and au jus.  It had great flavor and a good balance of fat (not too much and not too little).  My center-cut filet was cooked exactly to order.  My only complaint is that the top was charred a little too much -- while I understand that the intention was to seal in flavor, they sealed in a few too many carcinogens.  I was surprisingly Impressed by their mashed potatoes as they were tastefully sprinkled with green onions and other garnishes. The service here is good for a restaurant, but mediocre for the ambiance that it offers and the price that it charges.  Regardless, I would still recommend it as a great, semi-fancy pants place for a social dinner with friends or dates.

Awesome, bouche-like place but with relatively moderate pricing in my opinion.  So is this where the old-rich ballers go??  I saw some quite, fancy cars out there... Environment Dark old school, dark wood veneer finish, kitchen front and center, bar front and center.  Comfortable seating booths.  The bar seemed happening as well which created a great vibe, not it was still isolated enough to where our dinner was not disturbed by the bar. Service Super fantastic.  NO questions asked about our freshly bought wine, no corkage fee, just a pleasure to be served. Food Beef Ribs - when the meat falls off effortlessly without much gnawing from me you know it is going to be juicy, succulent beef.  Well-marinated and bbqed.  Not too charred at all.  Perfection. Rotisserie Chicken - excellent.  Healthy, not burned at all.  Not dry, perfect juiciness and portions were rather generous. Mac n Cheese - creamy, crunchy.  Just right.  It's been a while, but I believe it either had some bread crumbs on it or minced bacon.  Don't quote me on that, I ain't say nothing yet. Orea cookie sandwich - delicious.  Perfect combo, perfect creaminess.  The texture, the taste when it hits your mouth..salivate!!!!! Only thing that really irked me during my visit here was the old lady that I opened the door with for her 2 grandchildren.  I'm all up for being courteous, chivalrous and always helping the elders.  But really, bouche-old lady...you clearly saw me open the door 10 feet ahead of you and even looked at you to smile and your grand kids....and you deliberately look the under way as if I was a door opener or something.  People need to learn some manners...setting a bad example for the future.

This is the perfect place to go when you are avoiding carbs. The pilsner beer on tap was wonderful.  I had a pint. I had a dinner salad with bleu cheese and champagne vinaigrette (on the side,) followed by an end-cut slab of fantastic prime rib with broccoli instead of mashed potatoes.   The broccoli was steamed to perfection and had bits of crumpled parmesan cheese on top.  The horseradish sauce was perfect, not to hot, but not at all mild.  I am not an au jus fan, but another party at our table had the French Dip sandwich and he sopped up all his au jus, so it must have been good.  There was such a huge cut of beef, I had to take most of it home in a box.  The waiter was such a doll, he gave me fresh au jus and horseradish.  There is enough prime rib to make a dinner for two tomorrow. My husband had bangers and mash and just loved it. After dinner I had a cappuccino that rivals any coffee shop's in the entire bay area. Lastly, our waiter (Darren?) never bugged us, but I never had to ask for water or anything .... We are all avoiding carbs and sugar, so no one had dessert - but there is an Oreo ice cream concoction that sounded wonderful. If you want prime rib - you will never eat prime rib better than this.

Four wonderful words... PRIME RIB FRENCH DIP! It is soooo good.  It is the only entree I have ever ordered because I just can't bring myself to try something new.. nothing compares!  I know this review sounds a little obsessive but it's that delicious.  The beef is cooked a beautiful medium rare served on a hoagi roll with a spicy horseradish sauce and of course the au jus.   This is a great place to go for cocktails, there is a large bar in the center of the restaurant.  The service was good, maybe a little slow on the drinks but it was a busy Friday night.  I also really like the open kitchen atmosphere.  It can get a little loud at times but I didn't mind.  Every experience I've had at the Los Altos Grill has been great.

Just went there for dinner last night. As always food was super delicious. They just updated their menu to show case seasonal items. I ended up ordering their Butternut & White Cheddar Enchilada and my hubby ordered their T-Bone Steak. Both were satisfyingly scrumptious. My husband and I end up eating at LA Grill once a week. That's how much we love this restaurant. On my original review I gave them 4 stars but I'm bumping it up to 5. I have seriously tried 90% of their menu and have not once been disappointed with the food.

We love this place. So much so, that when we are thinking about going out to eat we say "shall we go to The Place?" Seriously, we don't even need to say its name, we know. And why? Meat. Serious meat. Real meat. And garlic mashed potatoes. And grilled artichokes. And broccolini. And other seasonal dishes. And real horseradish sauce. And no corkage fee. And the French Dip Au Jus that I could just drink as a soup. Also just a nice atmosphere and comfortable. Never had a bad night any time we're gone. Friends that go say the same. First-timers always thank us for the recommendation.

Their menu is only one page in length, but flavorful. I tried their artichoke hearts, cornbread, seared ahi tuna, steak, and two thirst quenching lemon drop martinis. The artichoke hearts was grilled and seasoned perfectly. The cornbread came fresh and warm out of the oven, with the sides just crisp enough and the center soft. The ahi tuna was seared evenly and beautifully on all sides. It came with a side salad mixed with lettuce, avocados, mangoes, and cherry tomatoes. Our waiter was professional, polite, and courteous. The service and food both won me over.

For the past 10 years (before when it was Banderas) i have been going here for my birthday dinners. it is the prime rib they serve in mass that keeps me coming back for more! paired with beautiful garlic mashed potatoes and an au jus i refuse to order anything else (although i have yet to taste anything i do not like here) Their grilled artichokes as appetizers are to die for. along with their infamous corn bread. Pricey but worth every penny for a nice meal out. We were accompanied by live jazz band which was quite pleasant last time :)

A solid choice if you're looking for a down to earth yet sophisticated restaurant that serves great food.   Pros-  The food is great.  I've had the beef back ribs (delicious), the  sashimi ahi tuna, the dip duo (seriously awesome), the bangers and mash, and the chicken enchiladas.  They are all above average in my opinion.  No corkage fee!  The service is great and unpretentious.  I like the atmosphere and the fact that you can see the open kitchen.  The waiters/waitresses are all really friendly. Cons- It can get crowded and some of the menu items are slightly overpriced. I try to visit this place every couple of months.

I so badly wanted this place to be amazing. J$ and I went here for our anniversary dinner. I'd read some glowing reviews and the menu online looked great. Our reservation was at 815, but we got there at 730 hoping we could get in early. We couldn't, so we waited at the bar. The place was packed and so loud. Everyone is right about the cornbread, it was crunchy on top and had a faint jalapeno flavor...delicious. For my entrée I had the halibut and broccoli...broccoli was perfect but the halibut was bland and dry. J$ had one of the steaks, I forget which, and was really happy with it. He shared his mashed potatoes, which were full of chives and other herbs. We finished with the house-made Oreo, awesome chocolate cookies with vanilla ice cream in the center and caramel sauce. I should have started with that, it was tasty. Based on the food alone I probably would have said two stars, but ultimately I gave it three for the nice bartenders, attentive servers, and lodge-like ambiance.

One of my favorites now.  Bangers and mash, ahi poke (still available as appetizer even though it's not listed), warm tortilla chip with fresh avo + queso/jalepeno dip, ahi burger, prime rib french dip, salads, cole slaw are all favorites.   Great bar and atmosphere.   Although this is my go-to spot when it's my turn to pick, my one complaint is that the menu is a little too restrictive: - Fresh oysters would be the next thing I'd add to the menu - Dessert menu could use some warm option in the Winter and portions are too large

Phenomenal service and delicious food... they are known for their chicken and it was very succulent.  I had the "Macho Salad" which I enjoyed... it is a satisfying combo of nuts, goat cheese and proteins.  On a side note: I have been there two times on weekdays and they were very crowded, so prepare for a long wait... we usually soften the blow with a glass of wine, or two, at the bar or out on the patio.

I'm updating my review because my boyfriend and I went back this weekend and I tried a couple of new things... I finally had the ever-famous cornbread.  GOOD!  I slather it with butter, of course, but it really is very good. I also tried the French dip.  Whoa...I would imagine that the French dip sort of gets looked over, but it was the best one I've ever tasted.  The meat melts in your mouth (it's really piled on there too), and the au jus is perfect!

I was very impressed with this place! AMBIANCE: The atmosphere was very alive yet cozy. The dim lighting made the place feel more intimate. I really loved and enjoyed the live music! FOOD: To start, we ordered the cornbread skillet. This is definitely the fanciest and tastiest cornbread I've ever had. Between 3 people, we decided to share the center-cut fillet, roasted prime rib, and the ahi tuna burger. The center-cut fillet was very tender and flavorful. The roasted prime rib was my favorite. It was delicious with au jus sauce and horseradish! The ahi tuna burger was also very tasty, but a bit spicy for me. For dessert, we had the hot fudge sundae topped with candied walnuts! PRICE: Fairly priced! I'm actually surprised they are not overpriced! SERVICE: The service here was surprisingly pretty fast! I was impressed with how fast our appetizer, entrees, and dessert came! Our server was also friendly and attentive. PARKING: Their parking lot has plenty of parking!

I started coming here when it was formerly, Bandera.  I have never had anything but great service and great food... Some of my favorites are the Beef Ribs, super yummy and super MESSY.  The prime rib sandwich it one of the best I've had.  Cheeseburger, and I've had a LOT of cheeseburgers... are awesome.  Just please don't get them "well done"... what a waste.  As a matter of fact... don't get ANY of their meats well done.  Save that for the piece of leather you can buy from Safeway down the street. The artichoke appetizer is a great way to start. Last night I had the Thai Steak Salad.  It was good, not my favorite order by any stretch, but I enjoyed it.  It would have been better with a little less dressing I think. If I get it again I'll get the dressing on the side. I'd say go for a fish or meat dish here... they do them so well.

I would give zero stars but it's not an option.  For the first time in three years, my sisters, parents, and I are all together so my parents decided to take us to Los Altos Grill because it's one of my sister's favorite restaurants.  The experience starts off fine.  The restaurant doesn't charge a corkage fee which is great and our waiter appeared very knowledgeable.  After we ordered, everything went downhill.  We ordered a salad but it comes AFTER the main entrees arrive.  OK...whatever.  My sisters and parents have their prime rib and start eating.  After 15 minutes, I'm still sitting there waiting for my entree.  Our waiter comes by a couple times and doesn't notice that I'm sitting there with NOTHING in front of me and I chose not to say anything to see if he notices anything wrong.  After my sisters and parents finish eating, our waiter comes by and still notices nothing wrong.  When we tell him that my entree never came, he half-heartedly apologizes and walks away.  Fine...I wasn't expecting him to grovel for forgiveness but I was expecting a little more.  With our party of 11, he was getting 18% tip anyways so he could care less.  Afterwards, he disappears and we have to wait 15 minutes before getting our check.  Before leaving, I go to the restroom and our waiter happens to be in there as well.  When he was done doing what he needed to do, he walked out WITHOUT washing his hands.  This is beyond nasty.  I eat out almost every day of the year and this has to be one of my worst experiences in recent memory.  So my rating... Service - Pathetic Food - Wouldn't know considering I never got my entree Dessert - I guess it was good because my nephews scarfed it down My sister will probably go back because she lives nearby but I'll never go back.  Considering how many other good restaurants are out there, I won't waste my time with this place again.

I wasn't too impressed with this place. The people I was with raved about it. In fact, one said that it was the best French Dip around. So, I had to try the French Dip.The meat was a bit flavorless and the bun it was a tad stale. For a sandwich that consists of meat, a bun, and a little bit of mayo, I'd say that there were some serious flaws.  The fries that accompanied the sandwich were nice and fresh. Yet, they did taste like In n' Out fries.  So, nothing new there. Yes, the cornbread was good. But, it wasn't a selling point for my trip to this restaurant. Plus, the beer selection was quite limiting. In my opinion, this place was nothing more than a step up from Outback Steakhouse. At least there wasn't any boomerangs and Foster's advertisements.

This place has a nice atmosphere, but seems like a locals hang out.  It's kinda in the middle of nowhere. It looks like it'd be a fancy place considering the employee attire and mood lighting however, it seemed like an slightly up scaled Applebees.  The food is somewhat overpriced for the quality of food. It's nice to try if you're in the area, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to visit again.

I have to say that I usually go this restaurant with fairly high expectations. However, I have been disappointed the lat two times I have gone. After experiencing many high quality meals here in the south bay, the LAG simply does not stack up. The Salmon dish is a perfect example. It is nicely grilled, but then over-slathered with a thick, powerful sauce that completely ruins any salmon flavor. I might as well be eating bread with sauce. Also, the presentation of this dish is awful - just the piece of fish and and a side of veggies - no garnish, no rice or other side to balance the flavor of the main dish. My latest visit was with a group of friends (not my choice to go there) and I thought I'd play it safe with their $13 cheeseburger. Once again, the meat was nicely grilled, but waaaay over seasoned. It was in fact almost too salty to eat. C'mon guys, you are a supposedly fancy grill and you can't even get a burger right? If you have to go here, I recommend you do NOT get the salmon or the cheeseburger, and go with low expectations.

Went here two times after work and it was pretty darn good. Before I start, the drinks here were awesome. But you have to order it from Eddie. He's the best. I came in last time and ordered it from this lady bartender and it was pretty disappointing. The mussels were excellent - sauce was to die for Calamari - very crispy and good Halibut entre - the fresh was really fresh, just melts in my mouth I would definitely come back, but it's pretty pricey.

I ate ostrich here last night and it was awesome. I don't know about the other food, but that ostrich was a fine piece of meat. Also come for the no corkage fee, although they do have a really extensive wine selection if you don't bring your own. We had to wait awhile, but it was Saturday night. The service was excellent in the beginning, but then when we wanted to order dessert, our waiter was no where to be found. But definitely thanks to the waiter for convincing me to try ostrich.

Ah...if I could only count all the good memories and food I have had at Los Altos Grill. This is a charming neighborhood restaurant where it's very common to see the same group of people on a nightly basis. The food is wonderful and there isn't really anything you could go wrong with on the menu. It's a great place to bring a date or a group of friends. The prime rib is cut thick and comes with divine garlic mashed potatoes. If you are in a rush they are great with TO GO orders as well. Try the half roasted chicken and artichoke hearts (they heat up well in the microwave). Although, my all time favorite is the Ostrich. This is the only I have tried it at, but I have to say it truly melts in your mouth. The bar gets really busy early and if you get there after 7pm its highly unlikely that you will find a seat. Be prepared to wait standing up and make sure you come here on an empty stomach!

Filled with Silver Foxes... so luckily we were meeting my parents there to balance out our (young) age.  Great mature, but relaxed ambiance.  Most people brought their own bottle of wine b/c THERE IS NO CORKAGE FEE!  YES! Everything I had was delicious: cornbread (obviously), ribs (tender and sweet), the mashed potatoes (I added some horseradish from the BF's prime rib - even better) and the coleslaw. My dad claims this is his favorite restaurant and if he had to go on Check Please, this is where he would go.  It's a lot like Houstons.

Bordering 1.5 stars... ... What is up with places not living up to the hype? Argh.  This place was just ordinary for us. It's worth a try, perhaps we just came on a bad night.... Here's the breakdown @ our table: 2 ribs - one of the the better dishes though not anything special 2 rotisserie pork chops - it was huge BUT so bland/flavorless, dry, boring like chicken, totally disappointing seabass special - meh, boring oreo cookie dessert - prob the best item we had tonight.  it's sad when the best item @ a grill is the dessert. sad. Overall: The service really brought the stars down here. Service: SUCKED :( slow with everything, did NOT deserve the required 18% tip. Food: ~$30/plate Portions: On the larger side but if it's no good, are you going to finish it? Would I return: No

Yummy yummy yummy in my tummy!  I have gone to Los Altos Grill at least once a month for over six years and have never had a bad experience.  The food is delicious - from the Sashimi Tuna salad with mango, French Dip sandwich, Tuna sandwich, BBQ Salmon, and Bangers and Mash.  Any seafood ordered is super fresh, moist, and grilled to perfection.  Anything I have ever brought has been worth it. I definitely recommend the seasonal salads too, especially the escabeche.  It is so refreshing and the champagne vinaigrette is good with anything! As far as cocktails go, I recommend the Crushed Velvet - chambord with a lemon drop.   There are generally 2-3 desserts which are good but not a necessity if you want something unique and want to save the calories for something really worth it. Overall, it's a great restaurant for a group no longer than 6 people.  Any more than that and the restaurant doesn't have much capacity to accommodate.

A decent place if you're looking to spend some money on dinner.   I'd highly recommend the appetizers; my favorites being the grilled artichoke and the delicious cornbread.  You MUST have the cornbread...I usually buy an extra order and take it home.   For the main course, I've always enjoyed the prime rib french dip.  OMG it's soooo yummpy!  The best restaurant sandwich ever!  Delicious with the horseradish sauce! The atmosphere is really good and cozy, but can be really really loud at times.  The only bad part was that I felt rushed with the food.  They immediately brought out both appetizers right after we ordered them.  Normally it would be ok, but this was soooo quick.  Just slow down on the service next time guys! Check it out if you're looking for a nice place to eat...but mind the wait.  This place is always busy.  Hey, you can always watch the chickens cook or walk around downtown Los Altos!

If some one were to order a steak butterflied, medium to medium well what would that mean to you?  In every other steak house I've ever been to it means "cut it through the middle, lay it open (kinda like a butterfly with its wings spread) and cook it, apparently here it means chop it in half length wise, take the resulting steak medallions and cook them until they are about medium rare.  Oooook.  When our steaks arrived my "rare" steak was noticeably less pink than my friend's "medium" one, not to mention the whole issue with the butterfly cut.  My friend politely pointed out that her steak had not been prepared to her specifications she was brushed off "oh, that's just how we do it here".  WTF?   Now, the manager was very nice, they sent her steak back and then when it came out again still not to her liking he took it off the bill, so that was good, but there were several little things over the course of the evening that were just a tad...off.  Perhaps I'm spoiled, but next time I'm in the mood for steak I'm heading off to Harris's.

This is  a great place for dinner! The cornbread is the best I have ever had in a restaurant. I always order the Chicken Sandwich and they always honor my order perfect (back from the Bandera days). If you like cocktails and beer, this isn't the place. Order a glass of wine. If you are in gold country, I would recommend Rutherford Grill (which is similar to Los Altos Grill. When I'm back in the bay area, I go here. It's my special birthday dinner and special occasions because it is pricey. I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups because it takes a long time to get seated. Reservations are recommended as I have waited 2 hours for a table. Oreo dessert is a must (though sometimes too frozen-  but the chocolate syrup is amazing, hint of coffee flavor).

Took my parents here for a birthday and this place has a pretty good reputation from diners and workers(knew a waitress who used to work there) and I have to say that it's worth the wait!  They do take reservations from what I'm told but if you don't have one, expect to wait at least 35-45 mins for a table from the hours of 5:30 to 7:30pm.  Why so early?  Probably because the place starts to fill up at the stroke of 5 at the bar and tables.   The menu is pretty straightforward, no appetizers on the list but sides that can be eaten as appetizers.  We had the Hawaiian poke, the deviled eggs, and the cornbread.  The poke was the best as it was sweet fruit and veggies mixed together with tuna.  The cornbread and the eggs came out quickly...esp the cornbread since it seemed drier than usual.  I think it was pre-made in advance. We all tried the prime rib, the seared ahi tuna, the lamb sirloin, the roasted chicken, and the prime rib french dip.  Thumbs up on everything except the chicken.  I'm not exactly sure why the chicken stands out so much in reputation but it was cooked through and it wasn't dry...so yes it was good chicken but is it a must try?  I don't think so. The service was great despite the environment being 1) loud and 2) frenzied but our server was patient and very prompt.  We got the Oreo Cookie and Ice Cream dessert and left with a feeling of satisfaction! PS: The place starts to empty out by 8pm so if you don't mind eating late, you may skip the wait.

I had no idea this place was so popular.  They don't have seating for very large parties, but they accommodated our party cozily in one of their large booths.  We had reservations at 6pm and I found it odd that the hostess on the phone kept saying although we have reservations, we might have to wait when we get there.  When I arrived, I found out why - the place is packed. Our server was very friendly and attentive.  The grilled artichokes were yummy as were the deviled eggs - that was a first for me on a menu.  There is not a huge variety of selection in the menu or the wine list, but most items were prepared very well and were tasty.  I had the fish special which was grilled perfectly, but I'd go back just for the hot fudge sundae.  Half the table shared one of each of the desserts, but half of us got our own sundaes.  Very good decision on my part. The only thing I don't really care for is there is no real bar and I say that because they have a HUGE bar, but most people sit and eat there because the place is so busy.  I really don't like when a restaurant doesn't have an area where you can meet your party early and have a cocktail or glass of wine before dinner.  When waiting you always feel like you are hovering over people who are trying to enjoy their meal. That being said, overall they get a 3.5.

Possibly the most popular place in town.   Come to LA Grill for nice ambience, dim cozy lighting and people watching.  Being inside reminded me of being in a large cabin with a warm fireplace on a snowy night or perhaps more like an upscale food hall in a ski resort. The bar area is happenin' on a Saturday night; expect tight spaces and to stand.  But if you stalk people enough, you'll manage to sit in 20-30 min as most people are waiting for a table. My two vodka tonics with lime were outstanding and generous.  Got tipsy and ordered a grilled artichoke which wasn't bad.  I"d probably order it again.  The bar area has 2 flat screen tvs;  it's not really the type of a place you come to watch a game. It's the place you come to chat with friends and family. With a packed house, be prepared to be patient with service but i had a good experience.  I'd def come back.

ATMOSPHERE: Rich. But not in a huge, bug-eyed sunglasses, Fendi bag sort of way. It was more old money - business casual, dinner with family, half a dozen wine glasses littering the table. A gentleman passed time with a piano as people gathered and chattered over Sunday dinner. It was dark and made of wood, and their rotisserie chicken scented the air - nothing wrong with that. Service was polite, but somewhat unavailable. We had to use other waiters to go find our waiter. We got seated in this intimate booth by the kitchen and I loved watching the busy, efficient chefs make plate after plate - including our plates. FOOD: Solid. The place was packed (35 minute wait) and my guess is - if the food wasn't good, the old money could have been spent elsewhere so, the food just had to be good. We ordered the deviled eggs as an appetizer and I liked them! I don't remember liking deviled eggs, but I did enjoy these (probably made with mustard, relish, and fresh-ground pepper). I ordered the Grill's caesar salad + rotisserie chicken. The bf ordered the "hacked" chicken salad made with arugula. My caesar salad was really wonderful (anything with fresh shucked corn is great, IMO). The croutons were made out of their "famous" cornbread and were really something unique. The dressing was classic and authentic and I needed lemon to mute the anchovy taste. And the rotisserie chicken was really quite moist and perfect. The "hacked" salad had an asian twist... with dates. And the key lime pie we had for dessert was refreshing. The whip cream was real and the graham cracker crust was crumbly and well made. IN A MOUTHFUL: Everything about the Los Altos Grill is polite - the food, the blue blood, the atmsophere, even the rotisserie chicken. I'm only giving this place a 3 (a 3 1/2 if I could) because even though it's a great place for a date or with a group (no corkage fee!), nothing really stood out as spectacular.

I liked the decor: lots of wood, dimly lit, simple, and the best part - an open kitchen.  The smell of smoky meats could be smelled from outside and definitely got my appetite going.   And FREE CORKAGE any night?  That's definitely a plus!  Their regular wine list is decently priced, too, with markups from 2-3 times.  They have a good variety, ranging from $30 bottles to opus one. It was crazy busy, even on a rainy Sunday night.  They were booked for reservations, but luckily they took us for walk in, but it still took about an hour to be seated. There's not much space to wait near the door; however, once seated, service was pretty quick, and we had a very charming server. We started with the cornbread in a skillet - extremely butter, with parts of it melting in your mouth, and a slight kick from jalapenos scattered throughout.  It's a bit greasy for me, but I loved the crust on the top.  It's one of the best cornbreads I've had. They featured some specials for the evening, including a seabass topped with crab, which my friend enjoyed.  It was a decently sized portion.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad, which was a nice balance between the sweetness of the mango, the smooth creaminess of avocado, and the savory seared tuna, which was fresh.  The french dip was not spectacular, but it was definitely boosted by extra au jus, horseradish, and some avocado from the salad.  The roast chicken was moist, but the sauce was a little too much like an enchilada sauce for me, and it masked the subtle rotisserie taste, thus completely changing the flavor profile of the dish. We were too full for dessert, as portions are generous but not excessive.  18% gratuity was included for our party of 5, but I can't complain because service was prompt and courteous (even though my friend didn't get his napkin until halfway through the meal).  We lingered at the end and didn't feel pressured to leave. I would say the main perk is the free corkage.  Food wise, I felt like things were better executed at Houston's and Rutherford Grill (same restaurant company).  If you're coming during peak times, make sure to call ahead!

I don't know if this place and gone downhill in the last few years or my tastes have changed or we got there on a bad night. I used to love the ribs here but I moved out of town for a while and had not been back in three years. I had my long awaited ribs and... they were OK. Not as flavorful as I remembered. Our server was OK, but not great. They were so packed (as they often are) she might have been overworked. I think the drinks are a bit overpriced too...

Used to be (and frequently still referred to as) Bandera. Good American style food.  Delicious spit roasted chicken, glorious succulent pork back ribs, hacked chicken salad is to die for, and you are a fool if you don't try the corn bread.   Also a great buzzing bar atmosphere.  Los Altos Grill is just about the only bar scene available in Los Altos, but youths be wary, the average age is much closer to 40 than 25.   You really can't go wrong here.  Rich basic flavors, a limited but potent menu, no corkage fee, and a guaranteed crowd are all trademarks of this delicious restaurant. A great place to take visitors!

I've been coming to this restaurant (as many other reviewers have) since it was Banderas. Even with the name change, they have not lost their touch.  I believe this used to be or might still be part of the Houston's chain and related to Rutherford Grill in Rutherford, CA (wine country!) Skillet of corn bread rocks here. If you fear butter... stay away... far far away from that dish. But it is oooooh so good! :)  Actually, I love all their sides, the colcannon potatoes are chucky mashed potatoes with sauteed leeks and green onions.  Hearty! The red cabbage with goat cheese is just tart enough with a sweet base. Other outstanding dishes, the beef ribs are so good the meat just literally falls off the bones. The prime rib and the prime rib sandwiches have never disappointed me. On a slightly lighter note, the chopped salad is HUGE and half of it will make a great meal! Fish is always fresh too.   Downside: it can get reallly really really busy over the weekends and might result in a hour long wait for a table... but try the bar area as well.

This is the place to be seen in Los Altos I guess. That alone would make me skip over this restaurant, but I keep coming back for more. For me its all about the food anyways.  Never tried their rotisserie chicken yet as they are apparently famous for but ...(acc. to their rest. group website) Pros: Fast waitstaff (at least the times Ive been there -maybe b/c a smile goes a long way) A friend loves their dipped prime rib sandwich. I enjoyed their Manila Clams and cornbread. Cons: Young confused hostess contributes to a long wait time. Enjoying your clams so much you forget to share with your friend who's giving you the "look" to feed them...then paying for it later. hehe

Where do I start? This place along with their sister restaurants are consistant with their dishes. I look forward to going to LA Grill often because I do not feel limited to my time there or having to order an extra glass to keep the conversation going. This place can get a little noisy but that only means people are being able to enjoy themselves and having a great time. The staff are very knowledgeable of the menu and wine offerings (if you don't bring your own bottle as they have their infamous no corckage fee). I must say that I enjoy their Rib Eye often, but it's not offered on the menu and varies by location. I usually ask for a medium rare and yet it always comes out near perfect. The steak comes out tender, juicy, and can easily tantalize all your senses. I had steaks at other places, near $50+ for an aged rib eye and it cannot be compared to LA Grills - I can easily say, they know what they are doing. Cheers.

Not sure if I had an average visit or the five star reviewers here are easily fooled. The no corkage fee is a Bandara thing. The salad with the fancy dressing was too bitter for my pallet. The prime rib was undercooked and full of gristle. The sundae desert with a gravy boat of watered down hot fudge was very good nonetheless. The server was excellent. The place was so noisy I had to speak like I was at a concert or Mr Goodbar. Speaking of which I got the sensation of being in a pick up bar. I am not used to having so many cougars and other women smile at me. Maybe I will give it one more try.:0)

I came for dinner on a Sunday night and was surprised to see the place fill up so fast.  I think it might have been full by around 5:30 PM!  My dish for the evening was the "Bandera style roasted chicken" ($17).  It comes with a Spanish rice served on a sliced tomato.  Can anyone explain why it's on a tomato?  That really didn't do anything for me.  In any case, the main course is what counts.  The bird was a very moist half chicken.  I would hope for a little more roasted flavor seeing that huge oven outside, but it was still good.  Ultimately, the food was not worth the price (Sonoma Chicken Coop will get you the same thing plus bigger sides for $10), but it's all about the atmosphere and service here. The service is excellent.  The staff is there to help with everything.  I'm sure I witnessed a record of some kind in number of times someone stopped to refill a drink or ask if everything was okay.  Part of that may have to do with their tiny water glasses.  They come out chilled, and they leave a jar of water at your table, but what's with the tiny glasses? The decor?  It's gorgeous in here!  The sides have raised seating with the bar right in the middle of it all.  I was towards the front, but I could see the cooking area exposed for all to see in the rear.  Seats, tables, railings, even the ceiling looks very hip.  This place is connected for sound. I had a great experience here.  The food was disappointing size-wise, but tasted fine.  I will probably just come to hang out at the bar next time for some live music.

I'll keep it brief, as I think it might be  a bit redundant from reading the other posts... The grilled artichokes are a must, and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. A few  things I would recommend to folks who haven't been here: 1.  Be prepared to wait 2.  Bring your own favorite wine 3.  If you order cocktails, you might not need the extra water on the table (they were all on the weaker side)

My husband and I are huge fans of 2 other Hillstone owned restaurants in So Cal - Houston's in Santa Monica and Bandera in West LA. Los Altos Grill has the same look and feel - cozy, upscale Americana with attentive, friendly service, That's what the 2 stars are for. But when it comes to the actual food, we were disappointed. We started dinner with two dips and chips - jalepeno cheese dip and quac with oversize chips. This was the most flavorful part of the meal, but sadly the dip quantity was small. For the mail course I had one of the specials - grilled swordfish with ginger lemon butter and broccoli and my husband had the pork chop with broccoli and mashed potatoes. Now I know from the other Hillstone restaurants that the grilled fish is pretty plain without the butter, so that was ok with me. It was a large, fresh fillet as I expected. My disappointment came from the broccoli. Houston's has some of the most delicious, well seasoned vegetable dishes I've ever had. Again, it was fresh, but very plain. It needed salt and not just the butter that was on it. In fact, butter was generally the taste of the whole dish, which was just not that interesting. My husband's port chop suffered from the same, though it was impressively huge, In fact, I've never seen a thicker pork chop served anywhere. It looked close to 3 inches thick. This was our second time for dinner here on a Saturday night. The first time I had the Ahi burger and my husband had the bangers (sausage) and mash. He thought his meal was just ok, while I had a few margaritas and don't remember what I thought of my Ahi burger, other than it was large. In general, quantity is not an issue at Los Altos Grill. Ultimately, we left Los Altos Grill longing for a more satisfying food experience. We won't be back. For something similar but with better flavor, consider John Bentley's in Redwood City. I'm sure we'll try that again and if we like it a second time, I'll write a review.

This place is okay; not bad.  Not wonderful ... As Los Altans we were anxious to try our "grill" (used to be Bandera).  It is still Bandera-like.  Not an extensive menu, a bit noisy inside, reservations are almost a 'must' (even on a Tuesday when we went).  My 9 year old daughter's $32 filet mignon (OUCH) was delicious, my rib-eye was just okay. What's with only 2 dessert choices?  And the banana creme "pie" was more banana creme 'blob' ... We will go back, I just can't rave about it. Howzat?

The cornbread in a skillet was like a sweet dessert. What did they put on the top to make it look and taste like a strudel? Wow. Bangers and Mash were great. The bangers were slightly spicy and home-made. Routine side of mustard.  The side of coleslaw had a hint of peanuts and could of used a subtle poke. The mashed potatoes were adequate. My wife had Bandera  Chicken that was in a sauce that had a zip of jalapeño and Mexican taste. The waitress didn't consider the sauce as spicy or Mexican. My wife liked the sauce. Me, eh maybe. Same potatoes. The coffee and water service lagged. The waitress almost aired a sincere smile as we left. I'd still go back as the menu and wine list peeked our interest.

Great place to eat! Great place to be seen! It's always a packed house here. Huge bar area and great dining. I thought the menu was a little limited, BUT the food is excellent. MAKE RESERVATIONS, or you are going to be waiting. The staff is very professional and will try to do whatever they can to make your experience the best it can be. I love this whole chain of restaurants from the Hillstone group. They know how to run a restaurant! You even get live music! Probably not the best place for kids...but more suited for the 20-40 year olds. You have to try the cornbread!!!

This place is owned by the same folks who own Bandera, Houston's and Rutherford Grill. It's also one of the better places to eat in downtown Los Altos. The food is standard American fare - prime rib, burger, rotisserie chicken, grilled veggies, salad, fish...you get the idea. Everything I've had has been pretty solid. My fav is the grilled artichoke. LOVE it. Their cornbread is yummy too. In the fall/winter, their seasonal veggie is braised red cabbage which comes with a dollop of goat cheese. Very tasty! Desserts are shabby either. The Oreo cookie is a go-to dessert for me. However they also added a sundae to the menu, which I like as well.  It comes with the fudge on the side so you can add it as you eat. The only problem is that there isn't enough fudge. It needs more fudge! Or maybe I ate it all too fast in the beginning. Their wine list isn't too bad either. But what is even better is that there isn't a corkage fee. What my friends and I usually do is put our names down for dinner, hop over to Vino 100 (sorta behind the Grill), taste a few wines and grab a bottle for dinner. If you don't care for wine, their cocktails are great too. I am a fan of their margaritas on the rocks. Additionally the bar is a great place to people watch!

Two words: PRIME RIB! I always get the prime rib here and am never disappointed. Huge cut of meat, always seasoned and cooked perfectly, you can't go wrong if you love prime rib. The ribs are really good as well, we always get an order and split it as an appetizer. It's not even 9 AM right now, and I'm starting to drool. This is definitely the most happening place in downtown Los Altos, so the wait is always long. I don't think they take reservations, so go early or expect to wait at least 45 minutes. You can get a drink at the bar and order an appetizer while you wait. Speaking of drinks, they make huge cocktails and they make them strong! No corkage if you bring your own wine--this is a great plus and I hope they don't change this policy. Everything here is so good, but my go-to menu is always: get a cocktail from the bar, start with their basic green salad, split the ribs as an appetizer, sometimes we get the artichoke appetizer, prime rib with au jus and horseradish, paired with our own cabernet. YUM!

LA grill is great...I love the food...great service and free corkage is fantastic.  They do grilled dishes really well and the staples of corn bread, grilled chicken or French dip sandwiches will keep you going back for more.  It is a bit loud no matter where they seat you. The one thing I am disappointed of though is their lack of fresh or new ingredients.  They have had the ribeye as the daily special for a year and a half now?  Served along with a fresh tomato cut in half with blue cheese on top.  That's fine, but if the tomato is a hard almost green thing with no flavor resembling a tomato...I think it's time to serve a new side dish and see what's available seasonally.  If they learn to branch out from the chain set recipes, I think this place has the potential to be 4 or 5 stars.

I'm salivating just thinking about how I'll be eating here in a few weeks for my birthday. I LOVE THIS PLACE. My family and I are basically obsessed with it, as my parents live in Los Altos and this is hands down the best place to eat in the area. The hostesses know my Mom by name (they get take-out a lot), and we also know a number of the servers just from how often we frequent the restaurant. They are all extremely nice, and it's painstakingly apparent when someone is slightly under par service-wise. The food is fabulous. I think there are only a couple items on the menu that we've given an "eh" rating to (the enchiladas and the bangers and mash), but for the most part everything else is worth a try. The specials are always great, so make sure you listen to them, and the ribs are my brother-in-law's absolute favorite to which he compares every other ribs he has (it's official, none have yet to live up to them). No corkage makes it so easy to save money on alcohol, and we generally tend to get pretty tipsy because of this :) Love the piano/live music on certain nights, but just beware if you walk in without a reservation at prime dinner hour - it gets PACKED because it's so ridiculously good here. They finally take reservations, so unless you want to fight for a spot at the bar (which I've done), you may want to jump on the planning-ahead bandwagon. It's definitely on the pricey side (for those of you that are broke like me), but SO worth the money if you're looking for amazing food and willing to pay for it. Now I need to decide what I'm going to have when we go...

I like Los Altos Grill a lot, but have the following comments. Best to stick with the most popular plates - specifically ribs and especially the prime rib.  People seem disappointed with the other dishes offered (for the price) The ambience isn't bad, but it is really just too dark in the restaurant to be comfortable.  Usually there is a very weak light over each table - but it has more of the feeling of being an alien-autopsy victim than anything cosy/romantic. Also, while I love the meat served here, the kitchen needs to do a better job with the sides they are preparing - the mashed potatoes for example taste good, but they are always stone-cold.

This was Bandera years ago, but switched to Los Altos Grill. I believe it is still owned by the same people, as they have a few other concepts as well. Houston's, Gulfstream, Rutherford Grill, R+D, Hillstone Manhattan, Palm Beach Grill, Woodmont Grill, and Cherry Creek Gill. Having a job that allows me to travel the US, I have had the pleasure of eating at 6 of their 9 concepts, and all of them are great! We just went to Los Altos Grill a couple of weeks ago and we got the following: * Deviled Eggs * Famous Cornbread in the skillet * Bangers and Mash * Roasted Prime Rib It was all amazing and delicious, the food deserves a 5 star, but I gave it a 4 star as our service was a bit disappointing. We had to continually ask for our refills on our soda / Ice Tea, and that is a big turn off for me going to a sit down place.

I have only eaten here once, and while my experience wasn't the best, since my wife really enjoyed her dinner, we'll try this place again in the future. My wife ordered a steak and was in love with it at first bite.  Very tender, juicy, and just perfect according to her. I had the fish special that evening which consisted of a very small piece of salmon, some brussel sprouts, and half a lemon served on a large plate.  I felt like something was missing, like a baked potato, fries...there was so much plate and so little food.  Also, I was annoyed to pay $22 for such a small amount  compared to what my wife received.

Comfort food. Very good comfort food. I go a lot and am never disappointed. It's all good. Plus, no corkage fee, which i take advantage of a lot. The French Dip is the best I've ever had. Great Prime Rib. The pork chop is excellent. The side dishes are all very good too. The best coleslaw I've can remember, and a solid tabouli. Excellent corn bread. The service is friendly. The place is always busy, but I can usually get a spot at the bar within 15 minutes or a table in 30. Not cheap but fairly priced.

We arrived at 8 & we sat to eat at 9:45. LAG is a perfect acronym for this joint - so appropriate. I've been here midweek and I suppose got spoiled by not ever being there when it was slammed.   The food on Saturday night was nothing special.  His fillet was done perfectly but the sides sucked.  My snapper & tiny prawns were unfortunately lacking flavor &  the small amount of butter garlic sauce wasn't sufficient for the huge plate it was placed in.  Chefs must have been blinded by business that night.  The sides were mediocre. Nothing you'd crave.  Standout: the jalapeno famous cornbread in a skillet, which you can just order at the bar with your overpriced martini :) At least our server was friendly and the company was great. I can't see this place worth returning to.  As part of Hillstone Restaurant group, you'd expect more but this place will always be busy because there's nowhere else remotely lively in Los Altos so they win by default.

I like the food here, but this place is too noisy, and you have to wait for ever! Every time I go there, there is at least 45 minutes wait. They won't accept reservation for small parties -- so, you have to make a choice : wait 45-50 minutes by the parking lot or go somewhere else. We went to another restaurant instead of waiting!

I had the best prime rib sandwich ever, paired with a delicious Asian style peanut spinach salad. Everyone else also seemed to enjoy their meals-- my husband said the steak was amazing. But Los Altos Grill has the most horrendous service anywhere.  We went with a large group of people--9.  The restaurant was really crowded.  We showed up, but decided to leave because the wait would be 1 hour (they don't take reservations).  The hostess changed her mind and said that they'd seat us.  They then proceeded to rush us through dinner.  They even took our glasses from us before we finished our drinks.  I asked for my glass back and the waitress mumbled that they ran out of glasses in the restaurant and they needed ours!!!! I think they had bumped another group who had also been waiting for the largest table and they wanted us to eat our meal quickly and then vacate for the other group.

One of my favorite places to go.  Yes, the wait can be a little frustrating, but we've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes - and even then there was a piano player that we got to listen to. Making reservations for next week, the hostess informed me that they don't have a "reservation" policy so much as a priority seating policy. When your party is all assembled then you are seated at the next available table. The food is fantastic, although I've only ever gotten the filet. I thought it was wonderfully seasoned and I liked that it wasn't covered in sauce. The vegetables aren't noteable, but not bad either. For my birthday they brought out the sundae for dessert - it was delightful and delicious. We dress up when we go, just because, but you don't really have to. I've seen plenty of people in jeans and sweaters.

Not a lot of great options in downtown Los Altos, unfortunately, but there are lots of things to love about this place: 1. No Corkage Fee 2. Grilled Artichoke 3. Great Atmosphere 4. a la carte Enchilada 5. Kids menu Grilled Cheese 6. Macho Salad w Chicken (not on menu but they'll make it for you and it's a killer LOADED salad) 7. They also do takeout Highly recommended.

I've only been to this place on Friday nights and this place is PACKED.  1 hour wait for a party of 2.  Pheesh, we never sit at tables, we are bar people, we are bound to find 2 seats at the huge bar.  Negative, waited an hour for seats at the bar.  This restaurant also gets LOUD, meaning, if you come with a group, it gets tricky talking to folks not sitting directly next to you.  Service is decent, food is just mediocre.  Last time  we ordered prime rib ($34), it was chewy, fatty, and ahi tuna ($18) which was what you would imagine ahi tuna to taste like.  Previous trip here I got the "famous" corn bread.  Taste like normal corn bread to me, why is it famous?  Perhaps I don't have the palette for good corn bread.   My favorite thing about this restaurant is the free corkage.  For that reason, and the lovely big bar, I am likely to return.

I hadn't eaten here for a long time, and I remembered the French Dip being out of this world.  I ordered it and right off the bat I could see it was not as "piled high" as it used to be.  And the pile of shoe-string fries that came with it were cold and dry.  My cup of au jus was not warm either.  ??  And I paid $19 for this sandwich.  Crazy.  The reason I gave 2 stars instead of one is because the corn bread IS to die for.  Ridiculously expensive for what you get. Maybe my meal was a fluke.  Doubt I'll be going back to find out.

Tremendously good food and a really nice, vibrant atmosphere.  When the place is packed and there's live music coming from the front the feeling is warm and inclusive, like you're all there enjoying something together. Los Altos Grill is owned by the same company that owns Houston's, which is perhaps the best chain restaurant I've ever been to, and if you've ever been to a Houston's you'll recognize the restaurant's design as soon as you walk in.  They've done a great job making the place feel old and established, even though you know damn well it's all brand new.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that it all feels solid.  The wood, the leather, the lighting... it all works together to make the place feel solid.  Nothing about it feels flimsy.  Solid. The food is uniformly good, if maybe slightly overpriced.  I had the freshly made veggie burger ($13), which was gorgeous, and my friend had the filet ($31), which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. As others have noted, the restaurant's no-corkage policy is FANTASTIC and certainly helps bring the cost of the meal back down to something sensible.  Gratuity of 18% was added to our party of five and when we went on a busy Thursday, we were seated about 15-20 minutes after our reservation time.

When you feel the need for meat.... Consistent food.  my favorite place are the ribs they just fall off the bone.  Have not had much of the other dishes on the menu since I just love the ribs. I have tried the steak (huge portion) and it was good also the corn bread a must.  Best thing tho is that they don't have a corkage fee so if you're a wine person you can bring you favorite wine to pair with their food.  Oh by the way did I mention the RIBS..

I have to upgrade my review for LAG to five stars because of their prime rib french dip. OMG so good, and tremendous value (~$17). Really tender and juicy prime rib is sliced thin and piled high on a french roll and served with a cup of au jus just large enough to soak up every bite. I recommend the REAL horseradish for a nice kick. The hand-cut thin fries are also very good. Of course, you must order their cornbread skillet as an appetizer to share. Almost as good as this cornbread a friend from the gym makes. :P The menu seems to have changed a little in the past year as I didn't see the lamb I had ordered last time. Beer selection on draft was not too great. They had Sierra Nevada, a hef, and a pilsner. In the middle of winter!!! geez. Definitely make a reservation, or you will be waiting. There's a nice little patio area to the left of the front entrance. We had drinks there since we arrived a bit early for our 7pm reservation.

Ok... I have to really watch what I say on this review, mainly because this is one of the S.O.'s fave places to eat. Then again, he doesn't have a Yelp account and this is all solely based on my opinion... so here I go. First time he wanted to take me here... they didn't honor our reservation for 8:30 PM. By 9:30, it seemed like they could care less about our so-called reservation and so we left because we were both shaking. First strike: why bother having people make reservations if you're not going to honor it in the first place. Great that you guys are busy but in terms of handling your patrons and your future patrons like me, you suck. You're not by any means, Gary Danko or Michael Mina or even the French Laundry. Please... check yourself. Anyway, this review is for this past Monday. It was the first time meeting S.O.'s friends. Yup, it was a milestone in his book so he chose this place. Since I knew we were going here, I made sure to eat a little bit before hand. Thankfully I did! They apparently got seated ON TIME - hooray! But that's about where it ends for me. I don't get why it's so busy. Why it's so packed. Why it didn't deliver any punch or what not in my book. I guess I do have a stick up behind but really, if you're going to portray the image of "high-end" restaurant, back it up. The menu was limited... when I say limited... really it is. I think the Golden Arch has more of a variety than this spot. I ended up getting their Rotisserie Pork Chop with mashed potatoes colcannon for $26 = yikes. It was huge... yes portion was huge but you know what they say... size usually doesn't matter... well it does in this case! I tried my best to eat it... really I did. But I just couldn't it. It was bland, dry and definitely doesn't compare to Nopa's pork chops! Yes they have free corkage... I guess that's why they're busy but really, if they do offer that... folks just drink at the convenience of your own place! I ordered Hanger One with 7-Up and it came half through our meal. I think they had to drive back up to Alameda to get it for me. Ok...ok I'll stop. Food: eck... Overpriced... that's an under statement! Service: friendly but slow. Ambiance: get a mirror and check yourself before you portray something that you're definitely not in the category for! Future: definitely not coming back...

Tempted to give an additional star because of their famous no corkage fee policy. This helps defray the cost of the meal. It's at the high end but compares favorably to more expensive steakhouses. The corn bread is always a must have as well as their grilled artichoke.  The grilled chicken and beef ribs have been on the menu forever and deservedly so. It's upscale casual if that makes sense.  People are certainly reasonably well dressed but it's comfort food and the staff are young and well kept, but it's not an overly serious place. My own personal favorites are whenever they have a New York Strip, the Filet, and the French Dip sandwich. Bring your own wine and you'll get out of there for ~$40/person on most nights.

I've been going here since it was called Bandera.  And I heart it still. Meal:  Artichokes or hallapenyo corn bread, tall glass of Iced Tea, grilled chicken (you watch it rotisserie itself to deliciousness right in the front window) or sometimes the ribs, homemade mashed potatoes with lots of freshly ground pepper from the pepper mill right on the table...and if i'm lucky.... creme brulee on the weekends. *drool* and i had the opportunity to see one of my friends slip one of the waiters his number.  awesome.

Our 60-70 minute wait turned out to be twice that long.  That put me in a really bad mood so hopefully the rest of this is objective.  We were comp'ed an appie for our troubles. Ordered the cornbread and it came out ice cold.  Assume it was supposed to be hot cuz of the heating glove on the skillet!  My ceaser salad was average.  Ordered the Hawaiin Rib Eye but I don't think it was a rib eye cut?  Very strange looking piece of meat...very thin and a bit grizzled.  What was it?  There were many apologies and explanations for the lonnnnngggg wait, I appreciate that ,but by then I had pretty much written the place off.  It's unfortunate because the bar scene and energy level are good but the poor time management and average (at best) food is very disappointing.  I think I'm done with this restaurant and will go to Mtn View next time I'm in the area!

The crowds are insane here on the weekends.  Be prepared to wait at least 30 mins to get seated, but I think if you can wait, do, it's well produced food, in a highly dynamic environment, you get to see the cooks in action, there are mounted televisions, and great for people watching.  They have entire rotisserie chickens roasting on spits for all to see.  This location was formerly Banderas, a chain, but the menu has remained the same, pretty limited, but every item induces salivation.   Don't miss: The cornbread in the skillet!  If you like the crust loving, muffin top eating person, you'll love the upper portion of the cornbread, it's amazing!  Like a cobbler, but the savory version!  I actually witnessed people ordering more of the cornbread and getting it 'to go'!   Try and Chip and Dip.  A wonderful appetizer for the table: GREAT tangy guacamole and a blue cheese concoction.   The sides are amazing also, from the sauteed spinach with Parmesan, and cabbage mixed in and their mash with fresh chives. Don't get me wrong, their filet mignon and snapper are fantastic, but a place that takes time to make sure their fillers are wow-worthy, are superior in my book.

Possibly the best French Dip sandwich I've ever had. The food is tasty and presented well. This place also exudes a very classy vibe. Not enough can be said about the free corkage! On a side note, I thought it was pretty funny that after our entire table ordered the French Dip sandwich and they brought it out to our table, the waitress told us that we should order it with Jack cheese next time because it's really good and that's how everyone that works there eats it. That's all fine and dandy, but that info would've been useful while we were ordering. It wasn't even an option on the menu.

Service: Excellent. Server was nice, and recommended all of the right appetizers and entrees. Appetizers: We had the corn bread, mac n cheese, and artichoke, all of which was good. The corn bread was ok - not as great as everyone describes. You can just get a slice instead of a full order, which is what I would recommend. The mac n cheese was delicious. Artichoke I usually don't like, but I like how they gave the artichoke a slightly charcoal flavor, and the sauce that came prepared with it was just perfect. Entree: Now onto the most important part. I was very conflicted between the fillet tenderloin and lamb. The lamb, is not a rack of lamb style type of lamb. It is more like a thick slice of sirloin. That said, if you are a rack of lamb freak (like me), I think you will enjoy the lamb very much. To me, it tasted like a rack of lamb without the bone. Very juicy, very flavorful, and done just right. I cannot stand over cooked lamb, so I made a point to my server that I wanted it medium rare and please do not overcook it. It was perfect! My dining partner had the prime rib french dip, which was delicious as well. As a final perk, you can bring your own bottle of wine and there is no bottling service fee. To me, right off the bat you save like a good $35 - $40 right there depending on your taste in wine! I had a great dining experience at Los Altos grill, and I will be back again. Can't wait to try the chicken next time.

Came here for dinner last night. Right off the bat I noticed the entire place was filled with people over the age of 60. It's a very romantic atmosphere, they have live jazz music, and if you squint closely you can almost see the score of the hockey game on the tvs at the bar. Speaking of the bar, they have a large wine selection and the cosmopolitan my friend ordered was delicious. On a strange note, the waitress asked if she could scan our IDs... The restaurant is very nice but looks just like Houston's but with a different name. The menu is surprisingly similar also (minus 1 for originality). Noticeably absent were appetizers...They have a dip duo with tortilla chips but that's pretty much it. I ordered the ahi tuna burger, my friend ordered the veggie burger. My ahi burger was fried, which it did not mention on the menu, and also came with thousand island dressing on it, which the waitress might have mentioned, after I asked if there was mayo on the burger... I also ordered my burger with a side of broccoli instead of fries (diet anyone?) which might have been a good time to tell me that the broccoli came with Parmesan cheese on top.. Kind of defeats the point of ordering healthy. The veggie burger definitely needs some work. It did not stay together at all so she had a hard time eating it, and when I tasted it I was not impressed. She tried my ahi burger and we both agreed that was much better. Service was attentive until we paid at which point a waiter took my credit card and presumably went shopping with it since it took them about 15 minutes to bring it back. Overall I thought it was way overpriced ($65 for 2 people), the food wasn't outstanding, and there just wasn't anything special about it.

I'm not sure how to describe this place, other than to say that it has a little bit of something for everyone.  This place was packed at the dinner hour on a Wednesday night.  Whoa.  I didn't quite expect this type of a crowd in the 'burbs on a weeknight. :) We had a fairly large crowd occupying two booths for a team dinner.  Unless you sit at the bar, all the tables are booths.  Please note that they won't seat you until most or all of your party has arrived.   My table started with a couple of bottles of Pinot Noir and their cornbread in a skillet.  OMG.  I had seen it earlier while walking by and thought it was a cobbler or apple pie.  Oh my.  Warm, slightly sweet and moist with a crispy crumb topping.  Not dry at all and it did not fall apart at when lifted out of the cast iron pan.  The cornbread was really good and I highly recommend it as a starter.   We all ordered salads.  The "Nice LIttle House Salad" was a simple plate of field greens, or so I thought.  Hidden within all those greens was a deviled egg.  Yes!  What a nice surprise!   The salad comes dressed with a well balanced champagne vinaigrette.   For the entree, most of us had the Bandera Roast Chicken.  Given all the options on the menu why did we order the ever-so-humble chicken?  It's their specialty and one glance at all the chickens turning on the spit at the front of the restaurant will convince you too!  A portion means half of a chicken and a side of their Spanish rice.  I believe substitutions are allowed.  The chicken was moist, flavorful and well seasoned.  I'm thinking brining must have played a role at some point in the preparation.  Absolutely delicious! Unfortunately we all skipped dessert so I cannot comment on them. Service was great.  Our server was friendly, efficient, unobtrusive and anticipated our every need.  A few of us were dawdling after they cleared the table and they never once pressured us to leave (no one was waiting for our table), which was nice. In the early part of the evening the crowded mostly consisted of families and business groups.  Towards the end, there seemed to be more of the local crowd.  The bar stayed crowded the entire time I was there. There is trio playing live music near the front entrance. Although it was very pleasant and added to the overall ambiance, I have to say that the noise level here is very high.....like really LOUD....with all the chatting and music and whatnot.  Be prepared.   A nice place to entertain or be entertained in Los Altos.  Plenty of parking, good food, great service.  Try the cornbread, people!

My last visit wasn't a fluke. This time everything was just as good and it was just as fun a night. Our waitress was personable and very helpful. The food was, of course, great. AND. AND! They don't charge corkage, so we brought a few 90+ point Malbecs to go with our food. $200 for 5 people? I'm coming here every night from now on ...

This place is way cool. We realized it was a R+D restaurant after sitting down and getting a very familiar feeling. The place was packed on Thursday evening after 5:30. We had the jalapeño cornbread which was a nice surprise. It had just the right amount of sweet and spicy. I had the chicken salad and it was great. Huge chunks of chicken with tortilla strips and other goodies. It was a big too. The rotisserie chicken was amazing and will try that by itself next time. Steve had the Macho salad, an off-menu item that he raved about. We split the banana cream pie for dessert and were not disappointed. I am so going back.

Although I absolutely love the food here (my husband and I can't help but order the cheeseburgers because they are that good), what I love even more are the servers.  They are so friendly, professional, and hard-working. My husband and I have had a variety of servers, but one stand-out is Dominico. He is ridiculously friendly and best of all, he is sure to make you laugh at least once, but probably a lot more than that.  He took our dining experience from a good one to a great one.   Another great feature of the Grill is that there is no corkage fee.  Great ambiance, great servers, great food.  Win, win, win.

If you are a serious meat eater, then Los Altos Grill is your place. Get their prime rib or their awesome burger. For the sides, get the smoked salmon or cornbread. Best of all, bring your own wine. No corkage fee and no limit.

So, it's Houstons.  With a different name.  And a band. They still have the sierra nevada in chilled glasses, they still have the good fries, they still have most of the good stuff you're used to.  They have a few interesting dishes that are different from other locations, but all in the same general theme.  This is good. On one hand, it would be nice if they were all just Houstons, because it would be easy to find them.  On the other hand, if there were too many Houstons, it would turn into some lame chain.  So they vaguely fool us, but it works well enough.  More houstons in more cities is good, regardless of the name. This has become my standard go-to place for a business dinner when I'm in the bay area, and my fondness for it seems to have waned over time.  The "Dip Duo" is a poor substitute for the standard houstons spinach dip, the band is too loud, the bar area is too small, and the wait for a table is almost always horrendous.

I live in San Francisco, and I've only been to Los Altos twice before.  That's my excuse.  Why my navigation system couldn't find the restaurant on the first try is beyond me.  It got me close, but not quite there.  We were 2 minutes late for our 8:30 reservation, and I blame it all on my car. We walked past the bar which seemed to occupy a good 2/3 of the restaurant.  A flat screen TV, far too small for the enormous bar, was awkwardly positioned somewhere in the middle.  As the hostess walked us to our table, I took a peek at the score of the Sharks game - 0-0 late in the first period. The decor of the restaurant reminded me of a ski lodge that just received a new shipment of faux wood siding.  Is it a ski chalet?  A remodeled Applebee's, sans fake metal signs?  An old chiropractor's office with a bar?  Who knows? We were seated in a booth with red vinyl couches.  Strange photos adorned the walls, and the perfectly positioned track lights completed the look.  This would be an ideal place for a date if the noise level weren't so high.  What are all those people talking about, and do they have to be so loud? Then the food came, and I forgot all about the noise, the faux wood and the Sharks game.   The cornbread appetizer, served in a skillet, was huge and absolutely amazing.  If you get nothing else at Los Altos Grill, at least do yourself a favor and try the cornbread.  I was surprised they didn't serve it with butter, but it was perfect in and of itself.   For my entree, I ordered pork chops with mashed potatoes and red cabbage.  The mouth watering pork chops served on a bone were juicy and perfectly cooked.  ACME Chophouse, are you listening?  "Juicy and perfectly cooked."  That's what pork chops should taste like. The food was hearty, rich and filling.  There was a lot of it, too.  Our server was very nice, but forgot to refill our water and iced tea. I'd say Los Altos Grill deserves a solid 4.5-star rating.  5 stars for the food, less 1/2 a star for decor, noise level and not refilling my iced tea.  I am still thirsty.

Does it mean i'm verging on yuppie if i admit to liking this place? I want to tell you its for all the right reasons.. but why apologize? This place has a great, if pricey, wine list, a fabulous grilled artichoke and salad selection, delicious grilled meat and a comfortable outdoor patio for hanging out. You will overhear some classic Los Altos conversations here: Last visit-- "My daughter feels safest in her Hummer and that's what's important to Bob and me..." and other wealth/suburban infused blabbermouth, but hey, who am i to judge? Conversations such as these make me feel like I'm reading a chapter out of a John Cheever story, were he west-coast transplanted and 21st century. Something here for everyone.

Fantastic place, love the warm local atmosphere, the friendly and social clientele... that is how classy this place is and generous portions of food. Two people can come here and order for one and leave full. No corkage so we brought a nice bottle of wine and jockeyed for a bar seat. The cluck and moo, chicken and ribs, even though not on the menu is still a great way to go. The guy next too me was a regular and he was comped a GIANT portion pork chop because they forgot to place his order but he was happy to sit there and chat up the girls next to him. Just love this place. We also had the oreo cookie dessert and duo appetizer and a caeser salad. All very lick your plate clean good. Coming here is like coming home. They really need to expand again.

Los Altos Grill is my go-to place when I want high quality American comfort food. The only con is this place is really loud. It's an older set (50s, 60s, some 40s) who go to the bar and hang out. They have a lot of table seating as well. The pros are: the service is excellent - attentive and polite and friendly. The food is excellent. It is expensive ($19 for a sandwich) - but the French Dip is amazing and so are the salads and Oreo cookie ice cream dessert. It's not a place I go often because it is so expensive. But when I spend money there I think it is well worth it. I imagine that is why they are so busy literally every night of the week - great service and high quality food.

OMG, someone dropped Houston's in the rich burbs! Same exact look feel, probably even wine list as Houston's in the city.  Not much to complain about except the popularity and the prices really.  The grilled artichoke was yummy as were the pan fried clams.  They put a big piece of Texas toast in the bottom of the clam dish which made it look like there were more clams than there really were.  The bread soaked up all the butter and cream and sausage fat (oh yeah, they had sausages in there to fatten up the clam broth) and clam juice.  A most unhealthy finish, but I bet it is popular!!!  And don't get me wrong, there were plenty of clams.  Plenty of everything actually, this place is not a portion jipper. For wine, we liked the Testerosa Pinot Noir and the Cab Franc.

Right off the bat, they get a higher than average rating for not charging a corkage fee... love that!  Why can't they spread that ideal to more restaurants... On to the food... have had just about everything on the menu here... had fantasies of the jalapeno cornbread (almost as good as town hall's), that is a must try. They do a great job with their lamb, as well as with most of their steak preparations.. definitely cooked to appropriate doneness, seasoned very well. The bad... It can be deafening at times, not quite blowfish sushi loud, but loud nonetheless.  Sometimes i felt like i needed one of those little miner hats with the lights in them to see in there, it is really dark.  and perhaps the worst of all, the reason I docked a star, is the "chainy" kind of feel you get here....  it feels like a houston's or whatever other restaurant they're linked to in management.  It's not an overwhelming feel of chain restaurant, but you can tell for sure. overall... definitely worth a visit... bring a good bottle of wine and MAKE RESERVATIONS... it get super-packed!

This place is awesome. Best French Dip EVER. Adamsons is really good too for French Dip, but this one is three times as big and comes with fries at 2x the price. The Ambiance is great here. The ahi tuna poke is phenomenal when available. Corn bread is great. Chicken is really nice being roasted on a spit. Also the Beef short ribs are the best ribs I have had anywhere and the oreo cookie dessert should be illegal its so good. Great Decor, Great Food, only people that do not like this place I imagine are butt hurt over the price. Also no joo corkage fee is awesome.

Formerly Bandera Restaurant, Los Altos Grill is a Peninsula favorite and one of the best spots for American cuisine in all of the SF Bay Area.   My list of favorites is extensive, but I definitely recommend trying the Hacked Chicken Salad (do yourself a favor and ask them to make it like the old "Bandera Macho Salad").  I also recommend the Poke Tuna appetizer and Grilled Artichoke appetizer.  For main courses, you cannot go wrong with the Ostrich (when offered) or their Prime Rib, a signature dish.  And always compliment your meal with a slice or skillet of the famous and delicious cornbread.  There is nothing else like it around... I promise you.   With food and service as good as this, it should come as no surprise there are 1 hour waits on weekend nights.  Los Altos Grill does not take reservations so plan ahead, or just wait at the center bar over a nice glass of wine or cocktail.  Enjoy!

My husband and I went to the Los Altos Grill for the first time on Sat. night with some friends, and we were really impressed with the place. It was absolutely packed, from the bar, to the dining area, it was wall to wall people. After eating there, we now understand why. Their fare is California grill, with a rather small menu. Although I have to say, I like places like that because I'd rather someone do a few things really well than a bunch of things mediocre. Menu items include prime rib french dip, sliced leg of lamb, rotisserie chicken, and a few other choice items. We had the cornbread for an appetizer and I can say this really wasn't to our liking, but our friends really enjoyed it. We also ordered the guacamole, cheese dip and chips and it was out of this world. Fresh, tasty, and the waiter refilled our chips when they were low. My prime rib french dip was great, and my husband said his lamb was really delicious. He didn't like the cold vegetable salad mixture that came with it and wished it came with a side of potato or something. Of course you can order these things extra on the side, which we felt wasn't right. I have to say my french fries were perfect, probably close to the best I've ever had. They were thin, crispy on the outside, not greasy, and just really really good. For dessert, we had the oreo ice cream sandwich, which is made there. It came in a pool of warm ganache, and was SO good. I highly recommend this. Although I think their prices are a little high, and the charging extra for sides is stupid, I would definitely go back to the Los Altos Grill.

We had dinner here last night and wanted to compare this restaurant with our experience at Birk's last week.  We brought our son who had a great time but was so restless during dinner!  Our waitress was excellent though and provided great service to all of us (including our son)! We loved the Duo Dip appetizer and the Oreo dessert!  However,  the ribeye special and prime rib we had for our entrees were just okay... in fact, if compared to Birk's, they were below average.  Since the price is about the same, we probably won't be going back here soon.   My 4 star rating is due to the service we received.  I'll have to say the service we received here was one of the best ever (from the hostesses, bar server, to waitress).

Great food but highly priced.  It's a perfect fit for the rich Los Altos crowd.  The service is great, the food is AMAZING, and the atmosphere is calming.  Great place to go with family or just the adults. I LOVE the tri tip and caesar salad combo.  I don't know if it was a special or not but it was delicious!  The soft corn bread croutons in the salad are to die for and every meat I have tasted at this place has made my toes curl with pleasure. I would DEFINITELY recommend this place to everyone with some money in the bank. (Personally, I think that all of these people who have reviewed this place negatively have a stick up their bum.  I've never found a negative feature about this restaurant.)

I always have a good meal and a good time here. The same set of tasty appetizers and entrees always attracts my attention.  For entrees, I love the grilled artichoke and enjoy both the corn bread and the spinach dip, both of which are filling.  Try the corn bread with honey once.  MMMmmmm.  For entrees, I was a devout consumer of the beef short ribs until I discovered the French dip sandwich, which is tender and flavorful.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.  For dessert, the oreo ice cream cookie thing is a must order.  And, the wines -- while not cheap -- are all decent. The atmosphere is dark and comfortable, the service good.  It's the perfect place for a dinner among friends.  I think for a date it might be a bit too noisy.

I have reserved a group of people 1 day in advance for a 7:30pm dinner before arriving last November 1.   Though, they do accept phone call to "reserve", you will really have to wait for at least more than 30 minutes to 1 hour.  Maybe it's because, it was weekend when we went to this restaurant.  Before they can give you the seat, at least there must be an evidence that all the guests have arrived or to some maximum percentage.  It was a full house when we arrived so it can be considerably acceptable.  You will have to test your patience for sometime.   Other than the waiting time, the food was above average.  There were a lot of choices.  The manila clams with a hot Italian sausage as an appetizer was a hit.  I liked the steak and ribs, the main reason for coming here.   I don't normally finish the steak due to size.  Unsurprisingly, the size is too much for my small appetite.  Therefore, it was something that I needed to share with my friends.  But it does not mean that it was not good.  For the beef ribs though, if you happen to request it as well-done it might lead to a burned piece of meat.  I think it is safer to go for a not so well-done or remind upon ordering not to burn the meat but just cook it that you can say "Well done" as in good job.  But it was not that bad though just a little precaution.  Please make room for desert in this restaurant especially the corn-bread which turned out to be a favorite. As for the price that time, it was considered on the expensive side. The ambience was great with really good looking and courteous waiters.  They seemed to be exceptionally caring, bothered about what table I was seated or whether I was seated comfortably.  The assigned one made our food experience a good one.  I'll give 5 stars for the Service!

3 1/2 stars. Called a few days before, and got a 6:15 pm reservation for the coming Saturday. We arrived at 5:50 pm hoping to be able to get seated early, but were not seated until close to 6:30 pm. It was a relief..given that the place was packed, and many reviews complained about being seated way past their reservation time. What puzzled me was the fact that they didn't give you a pager, but they just came up to you when your table was ready. How the heck do they identify who is who? Our luck from getting a reservation, to being seated relatively promptly continued to receiving a quick, friendly service. It was yet another relief as "rude" was thrown one too many in the reviews. We got pan roasted clams, cornbread, roasted prime rib, and ribeye. They were all good, while the prime rib excelled. We brought a bottle of pinot to take advantage of no corkage fee.  It is such a sweet deal!

How much can I say I LOVE the French Dip sandwich and the corn bread. The prices are a bit high and the wait time can be frustrating on weekends, so I don't go to the grill that often. But when I have an urge for some hot, thin sliced beef with horseradish, this is the place to go. Previously, they didn't take any reservations, supposedly now, they do take reservations for a certain number of guests. That helps a bit with the wait.

Came here on a Sunday night around 8:15pm after most of the crowd has left.  Given the place is nearly empty, we were surprised that we were shown to a tiny table.  E requested that we be seated at a bigger table and our request was granted. I wasn't all that hungry so I chose to skip the main entree and went with appetizers. We shared a Caesar salad which was prepared differently than most places.  The romaine lettuce was chopped up; although I would've preferred the more traditional Caesar salad, the dressing was tasty enough that I finished my half. We also had the cornbread in the skillet.  OMG.  Delicious.  It is prepared with corn and jalapeno pepper and the top layer is chunky and crunchy.  YUMMY and a must have. I love deviled eggs so he got some for us to share. E did have the seared ahi tuna for dinner which he really enjoyed. All in all, a nice atmosphere, good food and fantastic company - an excellent way to end the week.

How can a vegan give a bar/grill 5 stars? They don't charge a corkage fee, that's how. The ambiance is lively yet allows for intimate conversation. The service is very good. The drinks are delicious and strong. I've only had their grilled artichoke, seasonal vegetable platter, fries, and their peanut cole slaw; however, all are delicious. The people I have eaten with loved their food as well. I would insist on ordering the peanut cole slaw - it isn't the traditional, creamy kind. It is made with a peanut oil and is outstanding.

Applebee's for the upper middle class - it's part of the Hillstone chain. *Low quality food: chopped salad was pre-fab, salmon special for the evening at $25 a rip-off (6 oz. low quality fish with a little steamed broccoli). *Wine prices about 20% higher than surrounding restaurants. Servers mediocre. *Very lame - not worth a visit at any price.

This spot is easily one of my favorites.  Here's why (in random order): 1. No corkage fee! 2. Grilled Jumbo Artichoke 3. maple glazed carrots 4. Sashimi Ahi Tuna Salad 5. Famous Cornbread in a Skillet 6. Oreo Cookie Ice Cream Sandwiches 7. awesome service 8. nice ambiance 9. napkin with a button hole on it   (I think it's cute!) 10. can dress up or dress down, whatever your mood I've never, ever had a bad meal here.  The service is impeccable and the food is downright awesome.  I love french fries (which are really good here), but I'll trade those in for the carrots.  Carrots over french fries?!  Only at this place.  My husband and I order the artichoke every single time and he often has the Prime Rib French Dip.  I like to try something new, but I often go back to the Sashimi Ahi Tuna Salad.  The kicker though is the Oreo Cookie Dessert.  Your meal at Los Altos Grill is not complete without it!  Forget your diet for this one item.  It's fantastic! Los Altos Grill is great for a date night, or just to have a nice meal with friends.  Maybe we should go there tonight...

This place is our standby nice restaurant to go to locally.  Everything we've had here has been tasty and the menu is diverse enough that you can make it a big spender night with several courses or keep it more low key and just have a burger.  The best thing about this place?  NO CORKAGE!!!!!

Best feature of this place is the interior, a beautiful bar and nice seating on both sides. The live music is also a great touch. Food is simple, as you would expect it. The filet mignon is good, with broccoli and mashed potatoes on the side. The dip duo is rich with guac and cheddar dips--good with a drink. The caesar salad has cornbread croutons. Their featured roasted chicken is weak -- dry and salty... :( Drinks--it's the simple stuff as well. No fancy mixed drinks, though, I wish they did have those. Service is generally good, but the bartenders could get moody, especially if you eat at the bar.   An older crowd, too, but not too stuffy. Expect to spend about $100 including a few drinks.

We went here for xmas eve dinner. The food and service were both EXCELLENT, and the prices weren't awful, either. My only issues are with the menu itself. There are not many vegetable side dish options that aren't over the top loaded with extras. One dish is cabbage with some kind of goat cheese, I think. Why would I even want cabbage? But with cheese? Really? It would be nice if they just had a steamed vegetable that didn't have a condiment of some sort on it. I had peas and carrots but they had a maple glaze. I actually enjoy the taste of veggies- I don't need to drown them in some other flavor. I am not four. Also, and this is my biggest problem- why no baked potatoes? The server told us the can make mashed potatoes or fries, but no baked potatoes. My husband jokingly tried to ask our waiter if the potatoes came pre-mashed but it went right over the guy's head. Seriously, how hard is it to bake a potato. I can do it in my microwave in 8 minutes.

Renamed from Bandera's to the Los Altos Grill....fantastic atmosphere, service, and American grill/bbq food. They specialize in roasted chicken--cooked outside on a slow moving spit--lamb and seafood. They undoubtedly have the best Prime Rib sandwich on the planet. I also love the BBQ Beef ribs, Martini's, Margaritas, and Oreo sandwich dessert. This place has great service, amazing ambiance, and clearly good management.

I love this place. The best best lemon drops ever. I would recommend this pace over and over again. Try: Appetizers Smoked Salmon Corn Bread Grilled Artichoke Dinner: Salmon Chicken Drinks: Lemon Drop That should be plenty to enjoy at dinner for two. You won't be disappointed. The bar scene there is fun too, you will get a kick of the Asian chicks trying to pick up rich older guys. Don't forget to say Hi to the cute hostess  Molly, she was the beginning of a great evening at Los Altos Grill.   Enjoy!

So there IS a reason why this is rated lower than Rutherford Grill (under the same chain). I was wondering if it was due to location but, having been to both, I'd say it's due to the food and atmosphere. The ceiling is really low in Los Altos Grill and the ambience is not as nice as that in Rutherford. Food-wise, it's decent but not as good as that at Rutherford. Seasonings are less strong than at Rutherford and food can be a little on the bland side as a result. The lamb that was our favourite at Rutherford was disappointing at Los Altos. It was barely seasoned and the sauce was different and did not complement the meat as well. The vegetables were not as sweet either. The beef rib and the accompanying mashed potatoes were good. The banana cream pie was decent but the crust seemed not buttery enough (or overbaked). A decent meal but not as outstanding as the one at Rutherford Grill, sadly.

Had I not ordered the Poke, I think I would rate this place 4 stars.  The french dip I had was tasty, and the fries were good too.  You have to eat the fries fast because they are pretty gross when they get cold, and they get cold fast. Back to the poke.  For $16, I would expect it to have a bit more tuna in it than it did.  We probably had about 10 small squares total.  In reality, there were more mangoes and shrimp than tuna.  What a disappointment....I felt so ripped off. This place gets crowded, so be sure to make a reservation.   Would come back, but would never order the poke again.

Fresh food it key and you can just taste it in everything you eat here. I ordered the cesar salad and their poke.....it was SO good! Definitely try the Poke...I like the mangos they put into it but didnt understand why they gave me tortilla chips with it...being asian I just eat the poke straight, dont need chips for it! I had a small allergic reaction to something I ate but I really cant figure out what it was because I normally eat this kind of stuff all the time...that reduced my star-ratings but on the menu it does say to notify them of any food allergies [but then again, I didnt know I had any]....it was also really busy and dark but the service was still good. Would go there again if i could figure out what gave me the reaction...that way I could stay away from it and enjoy my dinner!

I had high expectations for this place after reading all the reviews and was quite disappointed. This place is overrated. We ordered the cornbread, prime rib, and beef ribs. The beef ribs were good - tender, meat fell off the bones, lathered in BBQ sauce. The cornbread was lukewarm...like it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while. The prime rib was very mediocre. I can't believe other reviewers thought it was better than Lawry's. I've never had Lawry's but I thought House of Prime Rib and Forbes Mill (in Los Gatos) are WAYY better. Ambiance was good, but food is still the most important.

i have to be honest that i love the food here BUT...I made a reservation and was still kept waiting 45 minutes.  Don't bother making a reservation because it is not a reservation in the typical sense.  The don't "hold" a table for you at said time.  They just put you on the list for the next table.  It is their desire to keep all the tables filled and not empty while waiting for a reservation. So don't go with the expectation that you will be seated at your reservation time.  Just go without one because you'll still end up waiting. They knew we were unhappy and offered to make amends.  At least they tried to fix the situation, but we're all busy these days and there was no way they could give us our 45 minutes back.

3 stars because the prime rib entree didn't come with veggies only potatoes. It is good and I will have it over and over again and the corn bread is super Delicious order can feed a family for 2 days (or 2 gluttons for 2 days).. The prime rib was made well and well-seasoned. It should come with veggies, this is California after all not the mid west..;)

I have never had a pleasant experience here.  The food and the service are both terrible, and asking your customers to wait for over an hour is reprehensible.   The last time I visited (and there will surely be no return visits) I got to watch several of the waiters go on breaks to eat dinner, and have a food fight right next to our table.  Its kind of hard to even pretend to enjoy a meal when there are pieces of bread flying around your head. As far as our own meal goes, I dont remember what anyone had.  For $30 and upwards for an entree, thats not a good sign.  What I do remember was that there was far too much sauce on everything.  I dont know about anyone else, but I get suspicious when I can't taste the food under the sauce, are they hiding something under there? low quality, old "food" perhaps?  We also weren't given time to enjoy our appetizers.  After trying to clear our plates when we were half way finished, our server decided to just bring out our entrees and set them to the side "until we were finished".  Maybe he just wanted to go join the food fight??  Regardless, I was less than impressed. I would honestly rather take my vegetarian butt to In N Out and get a grilled cheese than come here again.

Right?  For starter, the smoked salmon, and grilled artichoke is to die for....  The cornbread is a MUST!!!! We always stuff ourselves, and never get around to the dessert parts.    They all look great though....   If you are up for some good, huge portion, American food.  Banderas, I mean Los Altos Grill is the place....   Infect...

If someone asked me right now, you can go anywhere for dinner tonight, where would you like to go? I would say Los Altos Grill in one millisecond. I heart this place. I always feel so happy when I'm there. I actually aim to show up when it's busy and bustling, knowing I will have a good 30-45 minutes to wait for a table just so I can hang around the bar, drink a martini, people watch, stand out front and watch the chickens roasting on the spit. Its a fun atmosphere. I like to draw out the experience. I ALWAYS order the filet. Always. I sometimes play these games with myself, saying: "Self: you're going to order something new and fantastic tonight, like the ribs, or the chicken enchiladas." And I never do. The filet never disappoints, and  why ruin a good thing, right? Another noteworthy menu item is the artichoke appetizer. This thing is amazing. I continually try to re-create this delicious little veggie at home and it never, ever works out. I could eat 2 of these and some cornbread for dinner and be the happiest camper there ever was. I think one of the main reasons I love this place is that you can show up wearing a classy little getup like you just came from a regatta gala or some flip flops and a tank top and feel just as comfy and welcomed. The crowd is very relaxed but the atmosphere is very cool, loud and bustling, dark and steak-house-esque. Circular bar in the middle, open kitchen, classy class. Perk: NO CORKAGE. Yippee!

3.5 is what I am giving it. if you're coming to Los Altos Grill for dinner on a Friday or Saturday night,  making a reservations is highly recommend. I had one for 8:30 and still waited for about 20 minutes until we got our table. A must try are the fries. Fresh and finely cut. The steak and prime rib are done just right.

Yum!! I came to Los Altos Grill with the intention of a reverse-order dinner: dessert, entree, appetizer - in that order. The waitress was totally cool and accommodating. Why was this place pretty darn good? 1. No corkage fee 2. Oreo cookie sandwich and key lime pie. delicious. 3. Great service - stayed until closing and they didn't try to kick us out! The chicken was pretty good, but I must be honest. I think Costco rotisserie chicken is slightly better. But the atmosphere, service, dessert, corkage fee - add it up and its worth a visit!

My favorite old standby.  This place is always consistent with great food:  healthy options and not-so-healthy options that are so good you just don't care.  Great appetizers - I like the artichoke and chip duo.  The chicken salad is good but I usually get the ahi salad - perfectly seared.  The side of mac and cheese is simply awesome.   The look of the place is casually elegant.  You can go in dressed in a suit or jeans and feel comfortable.  There is a big horseshoe-shaped booth that makes for good conversation for a small group.  Service is consistently good.

A nice little place to go for a snack or chat it up with some friends. The venue is very relaxed and is not overly loud or quiet. On certain nights they have live musicians which is a nice addition to your meal. I had the prime rib and the corn bread which was very delicious. The server was pretty helpful and knowledgeable. It wasn't the greatest food I've ever had but it's at least worth a try if you're in the area. The only gripe I have is that their beverage selection is very limited even for wines. But it's nothing that would stop you from enjoying yourself at this establishment.

Woe unto anyone who gets to Los Altos Grill hungry on a weekend evening. The wait can get silly. But like spawning salmon, we keep coming back here. Some of the food is fantastic. The BBQ beef ribs are sublime. The prime rib is pretty good. The rotisserie chicken was a little underwhelming. The corn bread is kick ass, as is the artichoke. I feel like I'm hobnobbing with the rich and famous (in a VC & start up CEO sort of way) whenever I come here.

I'm drafting this review as I sit and wait for a table with my family. Granted, my dad didn't pick the best day to come for dinner (Saturday), but the wait here is just ridiculous. We met some other family members at 7 and they had already been waiting for an hour. It is now 8pm. Apparently the reason why the wait for our party of 7 is so long is that they only have 3 tables in this whole restaurant that can accommodate this many people. Lame. The table that we have been waiting for has been occupied by the same party for over 2.5 hours. I bet the gd waiter told them to take their time after paying their bill. I know it's annoying to be told that you're being rushed out of your table but dammit. (I drafted those previous paragraphs back in November and am now completing my review :) ) The food was good, but I'm not sure if the wait was worth it. I had a prime rib sandwich, and while it was tasty, the fact that we had to wait so long just tainted the whole experience. I think one of the main reasons my dad likes it so much here is that they don't charge a corkage fee. But I would rather pay a corkage fee than eat 2.5 hrs later than I anticipated.

Since we were going on a Thursday night at 9:00 pm, we were not expecting a long wait. We were wrong! The place was packed (Full of rich looking Los Altos folks), and we ended up waiting half an hour for a table of two. The waitress later told us that it was the only "happening" place in the whole town, so they're crowded every night.  :) The food was really good: Grilled Artichokes - 5/5 stars.  A huge jumbo artichoke, thrown on the grill, cut into three pieces and served with a tangy, creamy sauce.  I couldn't get enough of this stuff! Prime rib - 5/5 stars.  A obscenely thick cut served on the bone with a cup of au jus and a size of horse radish cream.  I can't complain... You can also ask for some complementary sour dough french bread to have with your food.

I have been coming here for 10 years (when the restaurant was called Bandera). Over the last year, the food and service has become simply marginal. Although I dream of good french dips past, this restaurant's heyday has passed- there is an attention to detail lacking from the plates, and it seems like the staff and management have become plain lazy because they are the only "hotspot" in Los Altos for the local cougars and alcoholics. I will not be returning until the restaurant revives its sloppy food and service.

Like many other reviewers, I've been coming here since it was Bandera. Years later and I still love it all the same. My favorites are the dip duo, vegetable platter, center cut filet, and their yummy mashed potatoes. Also, on the rare occasion I'm not drinking, their raspberry lemonade is great! Get it with vodka if you're looking for a refreshing, easy-to-drink yet not-too-sweet cocktail. While I'm on the topic of alcohol, you really can't beat the no corkage fee. I've always found the service to be friendly and efficient. My only gripe? I wish there were more variations on their dessert menu!

A solid performer. Wife and I got there a little early for our 8:00 Sat. night reservation and were seated promptly at 8:00 even though the crowds were off the chain. Apps (clams, Caesar salad) and mains (lamb, salmon) were right on the mark and timely. Prices were a wee bit on the high side for what you get, but that's prob. to be expected, what with the location, popularity, and the celebrated and much-appreciated no-corkage fee which made it feasible for us to enjoy a nice bottle of Veuve Cliquot from home. Also, at least on a busy Sat. night, I would classify the noise level as medium-high, bordering on loud (not average), if that's a factor for you. Service was impeccable.

From Banderas to Los Altos Bar and Grill, my family has been a loyal customer of the establishment. Nothing can beat their cornbread. This is literally the best cornbread I have eaten in my life. The inside has a little pop with peppers and the top has a corn crumble. There are little corn pieces inside. It always comes out piping hot and moist in the skillet. Perfection. That is not the only staple. As a vegetarian, I can't comment on the ribs, but it is very easy for me to find something delicious here. Their cornbread croutons are also one of a kind adding a delicious sweetness and uniqueness to even their house salad. We also order the grilled artichoke which is always grilled to perfection with a delicious dipping sauce that I have never been able to recreate. Finally, my dad is actually the person who convinced them to start serving fries on their menu. Los Altos Grill is part of a larger chain of restaurants and they used to say that they didn't serve them to be "unique" in their chain. I am sure glad they started. Their thin cut fries are perfectly crispy and salty. They are absolutely delicious. There is no need for the steak at Los Altos Grill because they have so many other specialties.

If you call it Los Altos Grill, you're new to town.  It's Bandera.  It has a simple menu of great options. The tuna burger is great, thanks Mariah for the recommendation!  The chicken and prime rib are awesome. Cornbread is good. You have to try the Oreo Cookie desert!

This place has quality food. The mark of a good restaurant IMO is one that consistently changes the menu but can maintain the quality from item to item. This place does that perfectly. The server was extremely attentive. The beer and wine selection was decent. The prices were as expected for Los Altos. This is a place to take someone on a date. Nice atmosphere, you're not going to be run off by obnoxious patrons. I suggest getting both of the following items in addition to your main dish: Skillet Corn Bread Grilled Artichokes You will not be sorry.

Los Altos Grill is always chock full of ppl.  Definitely an older crowd, married couples.. botoxy wives and jolly husbands. The decor is woody and rustic, it's loud and bustling inside. It's ALWAYS packed, so make reservations if you can. If you have to wait, grab a glass of wine from the bar and people watch. My friend and I always share the ribs and baked mac n cheese. It's the perfect amount of food and comfort food at that! I've also had the chicken enchiladas, very decent. But the RIBS man..... yummy tender meat that falls off the bone... comes with mashed potatoes and Asian cole slaw. Perfect everytime. The corn bread was not amazing, kind of dry and bland. Definitely get the RIBS!!!!!

Love this place!  Husband and I visit at least once per month.  It is a fairly pretentious sort of place, but that's part of the fun!  It really is the best place  to be in downtown Los Altos after dark.  Otherwise, that town is SO dead!   Start with a grilled artichoke.  So good!  I have to give praises to the salads:  The hacked chicken salad is a whole dinner or you can ask for the Macho Salad, which is similar, but with cornbread croutons and goat cheese.  It's not on the menu, but if you're familiar with their other restaurants,  (Houston, Bandera, Rutherford Grill) you can order something off one of these sister places.  I've also asked for the grilled fish sandwich, again, not on the menu, and they served it.  It's excellent:  The fresh fish of the day, grilled, with their famous cole slaw and skinny fries. The beef ribs are also great and are my husband's favorite choice! One last tip, if you come before 5:30, you won't have a problem getting a table.  Then again, we have 3 small children, so early dining is a given for us...

Part of a chain of restaurants that includes Houston's in LA which is also good. Really great for a mid-range meal. Top attractions are the caesar salad and the french dip. People love the Oreo dessert, but personally I love the banana split. The wait for a table here especially given the poor ability to make reservations is definitely the big downside, but the food is reliable, service is good once seated, and the ambiance is excellent -- avoid nights of major sporting events as it can get out of hand with the bar/TV area in the middle. In the end, I have always found the wait worthwhile and the food very good especially for the price.

Best french dip sandwich ever.   Roasted artichokes and jalapeno cornbread are nice sides.  They are constantly being made and sometimes sit under heat lamps so make sure you get yours hot.   Extremely crowded, all the time.  "Reservations" = preferred waiting list.     Service is almost always working towards the turnover which is annoying but forgivable given that the entire town of Los Altos eats and gets shit faced here on the daily.

This is a long time favorite restaurant so it pains me to have to write this. Tonight nothing could go right with the meal: The vodka martini ordered up with a twist was delivered with an olive.   Now that might not sounds like a crime worthy of a two star edit but (1) keep reading and (2) understand that when you want a hint of citrus in your martini it's not so tasty to have olive. I did ask to have this fixed and was brought two slivers of lemon peel  - so now I have olivey-citrusy martinis.  Good thing vodka tends to win against most flavors. For dinner I had the normally awesome french dip sandwich.  Normally it is savory, juicy, warm and flavorful.  Tonight the sandwich was cold or cool, depending on the section, the au jus served in a small demitasse cup - making it hard to dip.  It's called French Dip !  you are supposed to dip it and need more than a thimble.   The sandwich arrives split in halves,  I ate half of the first half and asked for it to be warmed -  it was returned but without the remainder of the first half.  So I was only served a 3/4 meal for the full price i paid.   Overall - the service was spotty with items that were asked for not delivered unless we asked a second time,  the food wasn't hot or as tasty as it usually is,  and the drinks weren't made right.  But at least I did get a good parking space.... Edit:  Eric (manager) contacted me through Yelp.  He assured me that the points in my review were addressed.  A group of 4 dined here again and have to agree that he got things back in shape.  Yay Eric!

My friends have been telling me how they love this place and how the food is really good. I definitely agree! I've been here twice now ( I know...not going for about 15 years and then twice in 2 1/2 months) and both times the food was great =) The first time I tried their rotisserie chicken which was really moist and tender. My worst fear is overcooked chicken and it was definitely not the case.The bf tried the prime rib which I had a piece of and it was great! Juicy and cooked just right. I was surprised though about how small the menu is and wish they had more to offer. During my second visit, I tried their lamb sirloin medium rare and holy molys...it was GOOD. It didn't have that weird lamb taste and it was cooked just right, tender, and juicy. The side of mashed potatoes and broccoli combined well with the lamb. My brother had the BBQ back ribs that looked heavenly. Heard that's one of their main specialties here. Their cornbread is pretty good too! It's served on a mini skillet. It isn't your typical cornbread and has an interesting twist to it. The service was decent both times, not the greatest and most attentive or friendly but it wasn't bad. A must try if you're in the area!

I have been a big fan of this restaurant since it was Banderas.  I love that corn bread.  For those that aren't a fan of corn bread, you just have to try this one. The meals are excellent.  Of course I always go for something grilled which tends to be juicy and delicious. Highly recommended.

The atmosphere is vibrant, cozy, romantic and chic!  Love the atmosphere!  Although, my husband teases that it's a cougar bar! The staff is very attentive, helpful and cool.  We've always had fabulous service! The food is yummy!  This is one of my favorite restaurants around.  The prime rib is my favorite; the creamy horse-radish sauce is the reason I order it!  It is really good!  The artichoke appitizer is my husband's favorite.  The "nice little house salad" is the best little salad ever!  I thought the crem brulee was the best one I've had, but my husband worships the oreo cookie ice cream!  We take all our out-of-town guests here for a memorable dinner! Great restaurant, great food, great service!!

Probably the best grill place from San Jose  to San Mateo!!! Try the smoked salmon as a starters... Nothing like that I believe it can hold up to 10 people.

This is an old stand by. I have been eating at this place for almost ten years. Food is always the best. Now, the menu does not change too often so I pretty much have the menu memorized. The french dip sandwich is the best I have had anywhere. The NY Strip is awesome, and my personal favorite which is only available on special. For the quality the price is fair. Wine list is good enough.

My husband and I decided to have a rare date night and left the kidlet at a friends house.  We arrived just past 6pm on a Friday night.  We were told the wait would be about an hour and 10 minutes.  Eh - not too bad so we found seats on the piano bench and waited...and waited...and waited.  After an hour and a half, I asked the hostess how much longer it would be.  She apologized for the delay, assure me it would be about another 15 minutes and sent out the delicious grilled artichoke appetizer for us to munch on while we waited...and waited...and waited some more.  When I saw the clock hit 8:05, I told my husband if it gets to 8:10, we are leaving.  Luckily, the hostess came over to us at 8:07. I was happy we were seated towards the back of the restaurant where it is a bit quieter than it is closer to the bar.  Our server greeted us and asked how we were doing.  I mentioned I was kinda tired and she asked about the wait.  When I told her it was two hours, She apologized and brought us complimentary cornbread with our drinks.  I'm not a huge cornbread fan, it was pretty good.   We ordered the fillet for me (medium rare) and my husband went for the french dip.  Our food came very quickly - almost too quick!  We were both extremely happy with our meals.  My fillet was delicious and I loved the potatoes and sauteed spinach.  My husband said his sandwich was very good as well.  I ordered the Oreo ice cream dessert and it was heavenly.   Overall, we had a decent experience.  Has I known I was going to wait two hours, I probably would have gone somewhere else, but my food was delicious and we will go back again...maybe for lunch when we shouldn't have such a long wait.

I came across Los Altos Grill as I was looking a good upscale restaurant that doesn't try to rip you off on Valentines day.  There is no corkage fee so feel free to bring your own bottle.  I have been to Houston's many times for business lunches and dinners and Hill Stone retaurant group serves high quality food.   For those of you who are familar with Houston's menu, Los Altos Grill has some of Houston's favorites and then some.  You will want to try their famous cornbread at least once.  The combination of sweet cornbread and spicy jalenopeno is surprisingly good.  The rotissare pork chop is tender and succulent but lacks in taste as you move off the herbed crust.  I stayed away from the rotissare chicken because it's rotissare chicken.  The pork chop can be enhanced with some prime rib aju.  The prime rib sandwhich is superb as always and I almost prefer it over the prime rib they offer.  Last but not least, make sure to save some room for the oreo cookie ice cream as it is a wonderful treat to end the dinner.

I visited this place for first time in several years.  The last time I was here, it was called Banderas.  Still under the same ownership, only the name had changed. For the most part this place hasn't changed much, neither has the menu.  I was always a fan of the Bangers-n-Mash, but on this evening I tried the special, The Hawaiian Rib-Eye.  Wow, a rib-eye marinated in pineapple juice and cinnamon, absolutely fantastic.  Just too bad not on the regular menu. Oh and don't get me started on the cornbread...the best! The place itself, if you've never been here before, has nice quaint atmosphere, with live music and great wait staff.

Free corkage and seriously good eats here. Cornbread - Jalapenos inside give some heat, which I found to be pleasantly delicious. Has a nice crunchy outer crust. Best cornbread I have ever had. Grilled Artichoke - Mmm! delicious! But definitely the cornbread is a better choice if you are picking one appetizer. Barbecued Beef Back Ribs - Please get this, you will not regret it. Huge portions, the sauce is not overbearing whatsoever, and the ribs just melts off the bones. Comes with a roasted peanut coleslaw which is a perfect earthy and fresh (never thought I'd say that) complement to the ribs. Also comes with mash potatoes that are delicious by itself. Pair this with a Ridge 'Lytton Springs' (Dry Creek) '07 Zinfandel for extra deliciousness. The wine is very full bodied, tastes almost like a full bodied Cabernet, except that it is very moist. Irish Coffee - Served with real whip cream. The bartender brewed some fresh coffee for me, well worth the wait. If you like Irish Coffee's, get them at the bar. Service - Top of the line, no complaints here. Server was very courteous and resourceful in picking wines.

Great place to grab dinner! Made reservations a week prior to eating here. Amazingly, once we got there, we didn't have to wait. Service was great! I had the filet with mashed potatoes colcannon and seasoned vegetables, and my friend had the sashimi ahi tuna with cilantro ginger vinaigrette, mixed greens, mango, avocado and pickled ginger. The filet and the ahi tuna came out perfect. She especially loved the ahi. The service throughout the night was great. Midway through our dinner, we realized how busy they got. Definitely recommend you guys to call in and make a reservation. Try the filet, ahi tuna, or the prime rib french dip. These three will blow your socks off!

Consistently good food, the Los Altos Grill has become one of my favorite restaurants in the South Bay/Peninsula.  Great good, service, and atmosphere; have easily eaten there 100 times in the past 10 years and haven't ever had a bad meal.  If you've ever eaten at Bandara or Houstons you'll recognize the decor and menu themes; operated by the same company, the Los Altos Grill (and it's sister the Rutherford Grill up in Napa Valley) are the slightly more upscale versions of those restaurants. We've eaten most everything on the menu at one point or another.  The menu has only seemed to have changed 1 (or maybe 2) times in the past 10 years -- and there aren't really any daily specials -- but the catch of the day does vary and provide some variety.  Our favorites: - Grilled artichoke appetizer - Prime rib dinner - Seared Ahi salad dinner - Oreo Cookie Ice Cream dessert The only downside is how popular it is -- without a reservation, expect to wait a looooong time if you come during typical dinner hours.  More often than not, we end up finding seats at the bar and eating there (a fair amount of seats seem to turnover there every 45-60 minutes).

Upscale location but not pretentious, dark interior is classy enough for a date and all the framed posters, pictures adds loads of charm.  I came here with a large group and they accomodated the extra people in our group by adding a couple of chairs to the booth, even though it might have made maneuvering the isle harder for the servers.  We got the artichoke dip, the artichoke was baked/roasted to perfection.  I got the $16 bangers and mash, reminded me of my trip to Cambridge a few years back, so tasty, and filled me up even for dinner.  I'd definitely be back, although it's on the other side of the valley from me...

USed to be great...now its OK - service seems to have gone down...its a whole new crew when we went recently and the center cut filet has gone up about $11 from $32 to $43...they say its no longer 10 oz but 8 oz, its no longer flame seared but cut, and the reason is that its supposedly Prime USDA...we were fine with the previous cut...the rest of the menu is in the $20s so this does not make any sense....

LAG has been our "go to" for many years. Although crowded, the food is great, service is consistently good and the drinks are the best around. The "no corkage" policy is always handy too and makes it fun to bring a bottle to share with friends. My "downgrade" however is due to recent menu changes that have us bummed! Many of our favorites have changed or disappeared. Gone are...the poke, the ono sandwich, the chicken enchiladas and the bbq salmon. Gasp! How could they remove that?! There is a new salmon without the delicious marinade that is plain blah. Major bummer. The enchiladas now have winter veggies rather than the delicious smoked chicken. Major downgrade. The nice little house salad and ahi tuna salad have lost their tender mixed greens in favor of chopped crunchy and flavorless greens reminiscent of 'bag" lettuce The filet mignon is now $43. Yes the meat is now "prime" but the former filet was quite delicious when cooked properly. It is well known however that LAG simply cannot cook a steak to order. For this price I expect more. Don't get me wrong, LAG is still the best spot in town for a lovely meal but with prices up, and quality and selection down a bit I'll go there less frequently. Since there is a line out the door every night perhaps its not putting a dent in their business!

This place definitely reminded me of Cheesecake Factory style portions but with a classy twist. Came here on a Monday night and the place was packed. There was live jazz music going on and the atmosphere was really relaxing and nice. At our waiter's recommendation we tried the jalapeno cornbread appetizers and I quite liked the unique flavor of sweet cornbread with a slight fiery kick. My salad was a typical salad, nothing too out of the ordinary. Service was great as well. Will be back to try more main courses !

Los Altos Grill is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in the Bay Area. I've been eating here at least twice a month for about seven years. Though I've enjoyed some fantastic 5 star meals at other establishments, LA Grill has delivered the most consistent dining experience at reasonable prices for an extended period of time. Here are some pointers for a beginner: 1. If you don't have a reservation, expect a wait. 90 minutes plus is pretty standard for a walk-in on the weekend. 2. If you are seated by the bar, it will be somewhat noisy. It never bothers me, but out of town guests are often surprised by the commotion. It's a popular spot, and people like to chat while they enjoy drinks so just think twice about bringing grandma if she doesn't like that vibe. 3. If they have the NY Strip, order it. Don't hesitate. They recently took this off their standard specials rotation, but it is the best  sub $100 steak I've found in the Bay Area. Beats the hell out of Sundance and I live a few blocks away from there (but if you want great prime rib go to Sundance). 4. The cornbread, clams (when they have it), and artichoke apps are great choices. 5. The beef ribs, ribeye, petite filet, and french dip are all fantastic entrees. 6. A side of the remoulade is delicious with french fries. 7. No corkage! Seriously, this is a huge deal. Bring your own bottle of vino and enjoy. 8. If you're in SF, you can go to Houstons or Hillstone, whatever they call it now - it's the same thing. In SoCal I think it's called Bandera.

Made a reservation for two on the Los Altos Grill website which uses the Urban Spoon reservation system.  We were there at opening at 4:30pm on a Tuesday and the place filled up quickly.  My Veggie Burger was very flavorful & my wife thought her Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich was the best she has ever tasted.  Great atmosphere with a dark rustic feel.  The only negative was that our waitress was a bit apathetic.

I've been here a few times with some friends, and I've really liked it. Their food is great and so is the ambiance. It's sort of an upscale, trendy place with a casual feel. I've also had drinks at the bar, and they were pretty yummy as well. The place does get pretty packed so reservations are recommended. I never knew a little gem like this existed in this area.

This place is really amazing.  The staff are always friendly, eager to advise on menu items.   The menu itself is simple and short but everything I've tried was excellent.  My personal favorites are; Prime Rib Sandwich, Burger and Bangers and Mash.  If you're looking for something lighter than fries on the side of your prime rib sandwich ask for the vegetables or if they have them asparagus. Be prepared to muscle your way to the bar to get a drink while you wait over 30 minutes for a table on Friday or Saturday nights.  The drink are very expensive and not that large but the food makes up for it.

Los Altos has a sleepy downtown when it comes to night life, with one exception--the Los Altos Grill. I've eaten at the Grill no fewer than a half dozen times and the place is always packed. The crowd isn't quite as bohemian as you'll find at Palo Alto or Mountain View hot spots, but it's pretty hip by Los Altos standards. The food is quite good (the ribs are world class), and the atmosphere is up scale, vibrant, and fun. They have a good selection of wines and a good number of quality beers on tap. If you're planning to attend on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, the wait can be long (up to an hour) if you don't make a reservation.

the bar here is pretty sweet- while one girl ignored me because she had NO interest in serving me since i look underaged (though i'm not) and so I had to patiently wait for the male bartender to come over and ask for my ID. my long island was the bombb!! its SO hard to find a good long island anywhere in the bay- sorry, but its true. my boyfriend and i sat at the bar for an hour and a half because there was such a long wait. our food was delicious, my boyfriend had been there before and he had the prime rib sandwich. i had bangers and mash. i wasn't as keen on my food as his, but as a daughter of a brit i have to order bangers and mash anytime i see it on a menu! :) all in all, i really enjoyed the service and the food, and alcohol at los altos grill and i will definitely go back!

They truly take care of your every need and keep you coming back. I come to this place regularly and have never had a bad experience. Everything is always delicious. I recommend the cornbread. OMG it is amazing. First of all it is huge so be prepared to scarf down like 7k calories. Second of all, it is crispy and perfectly fluffy. I also love the fried artichoke, it is amazing.

Our first two times we really liked this place but our past experience was not as good. The restaurant is nice and one of the few places open late in the area but the food is not as good as it used to be and the place is now really crowded.  My husband's steak was overcooked and when we complained it took a really long time for them to bring out a new one which was also overcooked! While we waited for his food, the rest of our entrees became cold....I'm no longer as impressed as I used to be.

Talk about a busy place, our reservation was at 8:00 and it was packed! Our waitress was really nice and there is no corkage fee, which was a huge plus. I ordered the grilled artichoke, which was awesome! Then our party shared the cornbread, which was more delicious than I thought cornbread could ever be. I then ordered the prime rib sandwich and as my side I chose brussel sprouts. For dessert we all shared an Oreo sandwich coffee plate. Everything was excellent!!!  We will be back!

As a grill, this place emphasizes having an excellent roasted chicken and lamb.  They even have a special oven thing to roast it on, and explains the process in their menu.   Seeing as it is Father's Day and my father is definitely a carnivore, this is where we chose to spend our evening.   Dark warm inviting place, with large booths and tables.  There is also an outside patio with seating, as in the Los Altos area it tends to be warm alot of the time.  We made a reservation which was the smart thing to do as when we got there there was about 30 people waiting outside the restaurant, probably due to it being Father's Day.   Our waiter, David was excellent.  He catered to all the quirks my funny drunk father had and kept his glass filled with champagne all night.  He also humored his requests for extra meat on his entree, and my sister's explanation of how they make their Oreo cookie sandwich, and why the Oreo name isn't in the title (trademark reasons).  He also humored my mother's specific requests for no garlics or onions in any of her vegetarian food( religious reasons) and double checked twice for her on everything she ordered. We had the tuna poke, pan roasted clams and grilled artichokes to start off with. All of it was good.  The tuna poke had tuna squares, avocados, shrimp, and mango all mixed in with huge chips.  Flavor was good, but I felt like it needed a little kick to make it stand out more.  All in all though, it was refreshing and exactly what I needed.  The pan roasted clams came served in a broth, and on top a pile of bread soaking up the broth, and also with some bread not soaked in broth on the side of the plate.  Good flavor, not overly strong.  The grilled artichokes were perfectly grilled and seasoned with salt, pepper and butter and accompanied by a mayonnaise based dipping sauce.   For entrees we ordered the roasted lamb (a specialty) ( this is where my dad asked if they could put extra meat, to which our waiter responded  to by serving us and letting my father know that the kitchen put 2 extra ounces of lamb on the plate for him), tomato and beet salad and grilled ostrich.  All were delightful.  The roasted lamb came in a Chile sauce, and was sliced thinly so that you could eat it without the stress of cutting it up.  On the side of it was a medley of vegetables, with cucumber being the center of the medley.  The grilled ostrich had the best flavor of the night, it was delicious!  It was accompanied by a side of broccoli sprinkled with cheese, and some mashed potatoes.  The tomato and beet salad was also very refreshing: bright and tasteful and light with a handful of greens and walnuts accompanying it with some cheese and vinaigrette to highlight the taste of the tomatoes and beets.  Great presentation of the salad, it was just beautiful. For dessert we tried the strawberries and cream, simple yet very sweet and refreshing.  In addition we had the banana cream pie which was divine, esp since I normally am not a fan of banana cream pie as I feel the banana overwhelms the pie oftentimes.  This time it was a layer of crust, covered with the banana creme, whipped cream, slices of bananas, a sprinkle of nuts and a drizzle of caramel.  The banana creme had the slightest hint of banana and for once did not take over the whole dish.       Great dinner, everyone in our picky family left happy especially my drunky father.  I regret not having the chance to try the rib-eye as our server did rave about it but will have to do that next time we come here.   The server, David really helped make this a great experience, he was thorough and very on top of it.  Our glasses were never empty and he checked on us at least 5 times during the course of dinner.  If you have a party of 5 or more they automatically add in an 18% gratuity, but I was so pleased with his patience with my father that I tacked on another 10%.   Great warm atmosphere, and good food and service to go along with it.

I totally love this restaurant! The food here is so good. I can actually say I would feel comfortable ordering anything off the menu here and I'm a really picky eater.  I love the salad (caesar) and will go here just to order that alone.  I like the atmosphere inside with the dim lighting. Nice comfy booths that are more private than a lot of places. It does get way crowded though and noisy. I always call ahead of time to make reservations even on a weeknight and I have never had to wait more than 5 min. or so to be seated. It's also noisy and hard to hear even the person you are sitting with across the table.  No corkage fee which is nice.  Service is always great. Waiters are friendly and food is served quickly.  Los Altos Grill is a great place to celebrate a special occasion or just to have a dinner out with a friend.  I don't think the prices here are too much, great food and great service so totally worth it anyway.   Lots of parking, not always front door but not too far. Location is great.    One of my favorite restaurants in the south bay.

To the tune by the Steve Miller Band... Well, I know why we came here tonight The four star Yelps made the decision seem right But my experience didn't knock me off my chair And I'm wonderin' how giving 4 stars is fair 5 star cornbread to left of me, all the other food to the right Here am I stuck in the middle with you....(3 stars seems like the right thing to do...) Came here last night with great friends for great laughs and great food...well color me disappointed b/c while the company was divine, this place was just okay for me.   While I loved loved loved the cornbread and really liked our super patient and nice waiter, I just didn't dig the rest of the food.  I had an ahi burger which was ahi (ground) and then supposed to be pan-seared...I say "supposed to" because there was no "searing going on", that puppy was cooked all the way through.  It was accompanied by this very bland sauce that I equate to thousand island dressing.  Our server brought me mustard, but that just didn't seem to complement the sandwich at all.  I still ate it, b/c food has to be really bad for me to turn it down, but I wasn't really happy about it.  Further, I walked out wheezing a little bit.  You see, I'm allergic to cilantro and this restaurant LOVES cilantro. According to our server, there is cilantro in most everything, and while I really thought the food I had was safe, I must have received a little dose as I could feel it in my lungs. So yelp summary song is, "Won't you take me to...Cilantro town?  Won't you take me to...average bound?  Won't you like me to...feed you cornbread?  Los Altos Grill is....okay in my head"

What a cool place!  I finally decided to eat here tonight. I had  the rotisserie chicken with lime and parsley rice.  From other reviews that I had read, that seemed to be the most popular.  It was definitely pretty good.  My husband got their French dip sandwich ( no mayo so I would try it).  It was delish!  Since it was our first visit we also got a side of their mac and cheese.  It was not your traditional mac and cheese but it was awesome.  I love how cozy the seating was.  I can't wait to go back and try some of their other entrees.

I've been here twice now, and both times were sub par.  I really wanted to like this place, because they have no corkage fee bd a good reputation.  But the cuts of meat are extremely fatty (I sent my food back once, the second piece was just as bad but I won't send food back twice) and my girlfriend's salmon was very undercooked.  And the ahi tuna poke appetizer was horribly bland.   After waiting an hour for a table, I expected better.  I was hoping the first time was a fluke, but will not come back a third time.

On my last visit to Los Altos Grill, I was very satisfied with the food and service, as usual. The salad appetizer was delicious. It was cool, crisp, fresh and seasoned perfectly. It was definitely not "just a salad". Next time I may just order a salad for my entree, based on the level of the appetizer. For my entree I ordered the special; swordfish with ginger butter and a side of brussel sprouts. The swordfish was excellent; very juicy, tender, and meaty. It was perfectly cooked, and the portion was huge, as usual. The brussel sprouts were a nice substitution of the broccoli. Another great dining experience, as was expected.

I couldn't decide what restaurant I wanted to go to so my friend looked online and brought me to this restaurant . I'm not going to lie ... the restaurant is kind of nice . You walk in and there's a guy there playing piano .  The service is good , the food is somewhere between mediocre and good . The macaroni and cheese is very good ... too bad the proportion is so small ! The ribeye was alright ... there was a lot of fat in the piece I got . The mashed potatoes also tasted alright . The proportions were big ... couldn't finish the ribeye or mashed potatoes . 3 stars for the food but bumping it up to 4 stars because of the mac and cheese and because of the piano which certainly added a little bit to the ambiance .

i don't think the food deserves the long wait and the prices.  the little bottles of soda are ridiculous, no refills? the chicken is pretty good as are the fish and ribs but i have had just as good food in less pricey and less precious surroundings.   i do love that cornbread, except for the one time when something was off and i nearly threw up in the parking lot as my boyfriend and i were leaving.  being that he was a fairly new boyfriend at the time (it was still Bandera, not Los Altos Grill), i really didn't want to puke up my guts in front of him, but he was sweet and eventually married me so i guess i didn't put him off.  he drinks lots of soda, though, and the prices for the bitty soda bottles have put him off.

I love LAG and at one point was eating here almost once a week with my boyfriend.  Blackened rib eye, ahi tuna or chopped chicken salad, rotisserie chicken and fresh fish are excellent choices here, and the mashed potatoes and braised red cabbage sides are also delicious.  Dining at the bar is always an option when the wait is 40 minutes--just hang by the wall without being an obvious seat stalker and enjoy your 007 Martini (three olives, one filled with blue cheese make this the tastiest drink!)   House-smoked salmon and bucket of shrimp (when available) are the appetizers of choice.  And the creme brulee dessert is super-sized and therefore perfect for two to share.  The must-have dessert (when it makes its rare appearance) is the banana cream pie...just heavenly.  I LOVE this place, but am a bit sad now that my favorite bartender Jen is no longer there :(

We just moved to the area and are looking for a place to be our "regular go-to" when we're hungry.  This won't be it.  I think this might be another one of those restaurants that is outgrowing itself.  They are so busy they are not maintaining what made them earn all the good reviews.   We read those reviews and were excited to go, especially with the no-corkage thing.  I guess maybe I envisioned us sipping an excellent wine and enjoying a leisurely dinner of fabulous food, but that's not what happened.  It's Thursday and the place was hopping.  We had no reservation, (big mistake--make one!) and at 6:30 pm were told it would be 20-30 minutes.   There was absolutely nowhere to wait, the bar was packed, so we kind of stood off to the side trying to stay out of the way. Didn't really want to drink more on top of the bottle of wine we brought, anyway.  We were seated 45 minutes later.   Someone came by immediately, saw the lovingly chosen Stag's Leap cab that my husband was looking forward to, and took it away to the bar!  She said our waitress would be right with us.  We had watched others get uncorked at the table, so this change in protocol seemed weird.  My husband was not pleased!  It was a fairly pricey red that needed to breathe a bit.  We watched the wine being opened at the bar (?),  but the cork was shoved back in, and it got left there.  About 10 minutes.  No waitress came to our table, but the person who took the wine  to the bar finally noticed us craning our necks to see what was happening with the bottle.  She said they had run out of wine glasses.  Not sure why that meant taking the bottle from the table and setting it at the bar.  My husband was worried they would end up serving it to somebody else, it was so busy.  It finally showed up at our table, about 15 minutes later, during which time we just sat there, wondering what in the world was happening. Of course, we ordered immediately.  They are so busy, the feeling is that you need to order while your waitress has time to deal with you.  The food is OK, not spectacular, certainly no better than I would have expected after all the fabulous reviews.  I didn't see that they had done anything unique to the food. He had prime rib, I had a New York that was their special.  We had to ask for water twice, finally got it, but no ice, another thing that seems weird to me.  No bread was served, either.  The "Nice Little House Salad" was good--mixed greens with a little goat cheese, corn and tomatoes.  The deviled egg on the side was a nice touch.   Both entrees came with "potatoes colcannon" which turned out to be mashed potatoes (lukewarm) with raw scallions diced into them.  No explanation of this on the menu.  In fact, the menu is very unhelpful, and the waiters were so crazy busy I felt like there was no time to ask questions. I really would have liked to know something about their "escabeche" (like, what's in it) and a few other things, but again, for time's sake, it seems like they want you to hurry up and order. Overall, I don't think this place has anything more going for it than any other very popular spot.  It's crowded and noisy, the decor is unimaginative, and although the food is tasty and plentiful, it is not exceptional.  The no-corkage fee is a nice idea that we love, but it's not enough to get us to go back regularly.  Next time we want a steak, we will go to Sundance in downtown Palo Alto.

While my perception of Los Altos Grill might change when I eventually visit and sample their offerings, one star is considered very fitting for their reservation policy. Here is the summary of their reservation policy (in sequential order): 1) Take down customer's name, be sure to ask the customer to spell out his or her name (B-O-B or T-O-M, even) 2) Obtain information about the party size 3) Obtain information about the time and date 4) IF: party size is in excess of 4, THEN proceed to advise the customer that the table will not be guaranteed as there are only 3 tables in the restaurant that can accommodate a party that size, and tables will be given on a first-come-first-serve basis, ELSE confirm reservation. We'll take our business elsewhere, thank you very much.   And I would love to pop my head in on the day that we originally wanted our reservation to be (yes it is a weekday), and witness the 3 lonely tables, one of which could have been graced by our presence, and a couple of bored waiters, one of which could have been benefiting from the 20% tip. On second thought, my perception of Los Altos Grill would never change.  Because it is on the caveat that I would eventually visit the restaurant.  Which, in this case, seems highly unlikely. UPDATE 3/15 - received a message from the restaurant manager, who, after spending 10 minutes on the phone, still insists that their reservation policy is appropriate.  I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  And I am entitled to mine.  Conclusion: refer the above paragraph.

I went here a few weeks ago for a friends birthday. It was a Friday night and the place was packed! We've made reservations for 4 in advance, but still had to wait 15 minutes before being seated. It wasn't too bad given how busy they were. Based on yelp's recommendations, we ordered the cornbread and artichoke as appetizers. The cornbread was AMAZING. It's not traditional cornbread, there were little bits of jalepenos to give it a kick! A must try for this place. The artichokes were good, but not special. I wouldn't order that again. My girlfriend and another friend ordered the prime rib french dip, the birthday girl ordered the pork chop, and I ordered the prime rib. The prime rib french dip was the highlight of the meal. The meat was very tender and the au jus was just amazing (my girlfriend only shared half with me, I'll definitely order a full order next time I visit). This dish came with thinly cut fries, not great, but it was pretty good. I don't remember much about the pork chop, so no comment on that. The prime rib came with mashed potatoes. This dish was very good as well. The prime rib had the right amount of seasoning and the au jus was perfect. The mashed potatoes are not traditional mashed potatoes, however, I liked it a lot. Do remember to bring your favorite wine. There is no corkage fee here. How awesome is that?!?!

Upon arrival, I thought, I was in for another restaurant where the food could not get any more corporate...you know big plates, big food and little flavor.  Luckily I was pleasantly surprised.  Los Altos Grill definitely has big plates and big portions but the flavors are just as big.  My favorite appetizers were the grilled artichoke and jalapeo cornbread (I'm a TX girl).  The smoked salmon appetizer was good but I didn't like the presentation and there are too many other great things on the menu. The ribs are outstanding and truly fall off the bone.  The chicken enchiladas were yummy too but you've got to be a fan of texmex cuisine, which I am and without a doubt will order these yummy, not to cheesy enchiladas again.   In short, I can't wait for my next visit.  Tip, make a reservation otherwise you will have a long wait, but if you are not a planner, it's worth the wait!   The ribs are outstanding and truly fall off the bone.  The chicken enchiladas were yummy too but you've got to be a fan of texmex cuisine, which i am and without a doubt will order these yummy, not to cheesey enchiladas again.   In short, i can't wait for my next visit.  Tip, make a reservation otherwise you will have a long wait, but if you are not a pllaner, it's  worh the wait!

Whether I'm enjoying a martini at the bar with the "goldie's" or eating dinner with friends or family, this place always hits the spot! Atmosphere, service, drinks and food are excellent. Not super  fancy but perfectly nice for a date, drinks w/ colleagues or family dinner. I am a fan of Bandara but this place is more special for some reason and I suspect it is the location in Los Altos - nice, happy folks frequent here.

As a more "fancy" (although still fairly casual) restaurant with higher prices and MUCH higher wait times, you should expect more. The food: within the relatively small selection, it's very good. SMALL menu though. Same for the wine selection which, for a restaurant like this, is just a tragedy. I am NOT a wine-buff and I run out of ideas when I go here. If you are a wine buff you very well might walk out after seeing the lack of selection. The service is pretty good and I've had no problems. This is probably NOT a very good place for kids although I've never tried it myself. The ambiance is LOUD so be prepared for that.

This place appears to be the most happening spot in an otherwise desolate downtown Los Altos. The rotisserie broiled leg of lamb I had was quite excellent! My so had the seared ahi which also turned out quite well. Service was unremarkable (neither bad nor good) and the decor was cozy. Prices run a bit higher than you might expect (maybe 10-15% higher), but overall not a bad value. I'd go back just for some more of that yummy lamb :)

I have never been disappointed here. I have tried almost everything on the menu. My favorites include, the salmon with dill spread and toast, the dip duo, the salad with champagne vinaigrette & the cornbread.

This place is not cheap, but my wife and I have our favorites which can get us out of there for around $60 including tax and tip.  We share the Smoked Salmon appetizer, the Cornbread Skillet, and the Prime Rib.  That is plenty of food for a big (me) and small (wife) eater.

I want to give the Grill 5 stars, because it is one of my favorite places. I have taken an average: 5 stars for the food, and 3 stars for service. First the food  and beverages -- the BBQ grilled salmon is delicious! I get it every time.  The grilled artichoke appetizer is very tasty (oh, and just tried the deviled eggs for the first time -- excellent, and I don't even really like deviled eggs.) Cosmos are very good and no corkage fee is a nice option to have. My husband and I always have to order the Oreo cookie dessert -- ice cream, oreos, chocolate sauce -- it is amazing. HOWEVER -- unfortunately, I have yet to encounter a professional and courteous hostess.  More times than not they have been curt (shall I say rude?) when I have called for a reservation.  The servers are hit or miss. I have had pleasant experiences, and very disappointing ones. Our last time, the server did not check on us once between taking our order and bringing the check (another server brought the food, and no else checked in with us either.) She didn't smile when taking our order, or seem particuarly interested in talking to us at all. The tips are better here than other places -- I would expect the service to be above average as well. That is not always the case. But in the end, I will go back again and again because the food is just too good.

Very solid four star establishment.  Tuna Poke is a star.  We had two orders.  Drinks are flammable (Cosmo's and Mai Tai's) and the water is fine in the old milk container but get some larger glasses!  Main reason for the downgrade from five stars is the Caesar salad.  It was just not good.  The lettuce cut they use is awful.  I don't like the cornbread croutons either...give me something solid with my Caesar.  Entrees were good but lay off the cheese on the spinach.  Put it on the side.  Blackened Snapper was very large cut.  Banana cream pie was just ok.  Overall a solid four star.  Could not believe how crowded it was on a Wed. night.  No recession in Los Altos I guess.

Ehhh, relatively speaking I guess with the lack of actually good rests in the PA area, this place is good.  However, I was actually somewhat dissapointed with the food here.  Chicken I got was not bad but also not spectacular for its price.  The one entree that is really what makes this place worthy of trying is its Ahi Tuna Burger.  Its probably one of the best I have tasted anywhere.  Ambiance of the place is also really nice.  Crowd is a little older than expected as well.  Expect to be surrounded by families and older business men.

The outside architecture is rustic, reminiscent of a craftsmen bungalow. The interior is very rich and sophisticated. I loved the smell of the wood fire in the rotisserie. However, the smell of the smoke permeated the whole restaurant. By the end of the night I had a sore throat and headache from the smoke-not good. At our table we had the burger, french dip and the Thai noodle salad. My friends loved their meals. Mine, the Thai noodle salad was not so great. Too heavy on the sauce and the meat was VERY rare. I would have liked to have been asked about how I like my meat. I prefer my meat not mooing. We shared desserts. The Oreo ice cream sandwich was YUMMY. However, the banana cream pie was terrible. It was a deconstructed banana cream pie. It didn't work. Over all-I would come back ONLY if the smoke "issue" is resolved.

I really thought about whether the Grill should be rated with just one star, but I suppose certain dishes here deserve more recognition than that. Here's the thing: you probably won't mind being in this restaurant if you enjoy being surrounded by people who obviously feel that you don't deserve to breathe the same air as them. You also probably won't mind being in this restaurant if you are one of the aforementioned snobs. However, to the rest of you lowly commoners, the experience will probably be one marked by extreme amounts of pretension; the waiters obviously feel as though they are serving the aristocracy, though this manner is never actually applied to you, only to others. The people who frequent this place hold an air about them as though they're really the most important people in America; I often want to say, "Look, Los Altos Grill is not the ritziest place on the Earth to eat dinner. I don't quite understand why you feel so self-important while dining here; it's basically an upscale Chili's." That being said, the food really is generally good, but I've been several times, and the bill regularly climbs into the $50-$60 price range, not counting the tip. This is pretty outrageous; I would expect an extremely delicious meal in a nice restaurant for such a price. However, when I dine at the Grill, it's easy for me to imagine that I'm dining in a smoky log cabin full of people of declining wealth and status who are making one last stand for snobbery. The food is alright, but it's not impossible to have just-as-good food from, say, Chili's or (gasp) Applebee's, while in a more fun atmosphere, to boot. Truthfully, I feel a little bad for the servers and hostesses. I came here for a Valentines dinner with my boyfriend, and expected that we may have to wait, even with a reservation. After all, it's the evening of Valentine's Day, and as I don't have an inflated view of my importance, I understand how restaurants work, and that my reservation does not  entail the staff kicking people out just so that I can have a table. As we stood waiting that evening, though, I witnessed several astonishing displays of ignorance and viciousness toward the hostesses that were simply infuriating. One elder woman said to a hostess (who had apologetically said that the wait about about 20 minutes to half an hour, and that they were welcome to wait at the bar) "Half an hour?! What are our reservations even for!", which was followed by a snort. Dear god, woman, drag yourself home and practice your own cooking if you can't wait half an hour. It's Valentine's Day and you're some nameless face in the crowd, not the Queen of England. I also saw a couple hostesses that night become visibly upset with the way they were being treated (and rightfully so). This is totally ridiculous; if someone is serving you in a restaurant, that doesn't mean that they are no longer a human being. That's just one example of the people you'll find here, though. Moving on, the French Dip is (as everyone says) actually good, and the Oreo dessert is a touch of amazing. But the atmosphere of the restaurant ruins the food for me every time, and the price certainly doesn't help, either. Occasionally you may get a waiter with an attitude problem, as well; I've experienced several dinners where the server has completely ignored us while standing at our table, talking over our heads to others working. I mean, I don't want them to be fired or anything, but for the tips that I give, I'd like to have a little connection going on.

We went here for an early dinner last night because we heard how crowded it gets.  It definitely gets crowded but for good reason.  The food and service here were outstanding.  I had the Prime Rib and my wife had the Ribs and they were both great.  We also had the Corn Bread and it was the best corn bread, I've ever had!  It was made with corn, corn mix, jalapenos and honey....while cornbread is usually dry, this was pretty moist.  To top it off, we had great seats to view the open kitchen and marvel at how efficient the chefs and staff are.  I can't wait until we come back here again.

As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I felt I was transported to Banderas in Corona Del Mar.  Having relocated to the peninsula area I wasn't aware of the history behind Los Altos Grill.  Of course, I asked for the Macho Salad that isn't listed on the menu.  What's a macho salad you ask?  Well, you'll just have to return to the restaurant to find out.   There were four of us and we had the bbq salmon, macho salad and prime rib. The staff is great. Our waiter, Amir was attentive  and knew the menu well.  The wine list is is heavy California wine which I prefer so that's a plus. All in all, a great environment and a feeling of being in a southern california  restaurant with a lively buzz.  Oh yes, I'm from Orange County so I like restaurants that have a buzz in the bar and dining room and this restaurant fits the bill quite nicely.  My wife and I plan on becoming regulars to Los Altos Grill.  You will as well so we'll see you there soon.

Banderas (uhhem I mean Los Altos Grill) is as excellent as ever.  The food is incredibly good and consistent.  Service is impeccable.  Here's to all the staff!  Must tries include the cornbread, deviled eggs, and my current favorite is the sashimi ahi tuna.  I've been going here ever since they opened and I've never had a bad experience.  I don't live in Los Altos anymore but I have to say the bar scene seems to have picked up over the past couple years.

ok so i give everyone five stars. i eat good. all people eat good at los altos grill. loud steakhouse around a central bar. Beautiful dark woods. Booths a level up. Classy. Packed like a texas appleby's that just came to town. and they serve a upscale version of that. It's good and it's high. Los Altos means the highs, mostly. but we're eating good tonight at home. So it's a take-out treat. Settled on the sandwiches as value, príme ríb and tuna. double jalapeño cornbread. frítés style fries. Neighbors are getting ribs, one rack per. trying the tabouleh just to know. plus i ve been big on costco's prepacked.  these neighbors took us there when we came to town. classy neighbors.

November 29th was the second time I visited Los Altos Grill. I was dying to eat there again after I had this beet and cheese salad last June. Sadly, beets are seasonal so this wasn't on the menu this time. The mac and cheese is so good and cheesy, with plenty of real cheddar cheese grease. The appetizer deviled eggs are nice, but they serve 5 half-eggs. Why not serve 6 halves for 3 people? That's one of the few off things. The cornbread in the skillet is to die for. We always fight for the crunchy bits that hang off the side and on the handle. Without the beet and cheese salad, I opted for the Los Altos Grill caesar salad. You could taste the anchovies in the dressing, the only significance between a bottled dressing and a REAL caesar dressing. Not too fishy, but foodies can taste the difference. The rustic croutons, you guessed it, were small cubes of the skillet cornbread. From the booth I could see a bowl of halved artichokes, so I ordered the grilled jumbo artichoke. Expecting 2 halves to make one, we received 3 halves with aioli. The char was delish! I couldn't stop eating it but i stopped to have leftovers, which i ate immediately when I came home that night. Lastly, the oreo pie. Made with cookie crumbs on the top, vanilla ice cream, fresh unsweetened whipped cream, and chocolate fudge sauce surrounding the 2 pies. Yummy! The only other drawbacks is the crowd on a busy night, and the clanging of the dishes. The grill is the center of the restaurant so you hear the waiters and the chefs giving orders and plating loudly. I will be back. Hopefully with the beet salad in my tummy.

Unbelievably consistent! I have been frequenting The Grill(more affectionately known forever as Bandera) since it opened and I have yet to find a more consistently delicious, hearty meal with impeccable service. The staff is trained to fear complaints for their lives! You can ask any passing staff be it bus, wait, bar, management (ANYONE) for help and you will get it. None of this, "I'll get your server."   Can be loud and constantly packed but that's all part of the charm. Highly recommend.

After looking at the menu all week before eating here, I couldn't wait to try this place out!!  Even though we made reservations, it took a while for us to get seated.  It's very dim in the restaurant but the service is good.  Most of us got the prime rib and cornbread, which was soooo good!  It is a little pricey, but having no corkage fee was a major plus in our book!!!

Fantastic. A bottle of chilled white wine and the ahi tuna appetizer (with avocado, mango, and ... macademia nuts?) outside on the patio ... fantastic. Moved inside for the lamb sirloin with mashed potatoes and some sort of delicious sauteed spinach, prime rib with mashed potatoes, and chocolate ice cream sandwich thing (with a chocolate malt syrup mix) for dessert - fantastic.  Live piano/bass/drum ... on a Thursday night?  Terrific.  Place filled up quickly, terrific atmosphere, way friendly staff.  About $125 without tip, well worth it. As good as it gets.

Although always incredibly busy, the Los Altos Grill has a fun atmosphere and the food is good.  My father always complains that the dishes tend to be sweet (which they do) but they are very nice about substitutions and special requests, and some of the dishes are fantastic.  The chip duo is my favorite appetizer, and I also enjoy the grilled artichoke.  My favorite dish is the snapper with crab.  The pork is also quite good.  There is no corkage fee with is a huge plus for me.

This place is AMAZING! The French Dip sandwich was Phenomenal! The bread was so good, the prime rib was so juicy, tender and flavorful and the Au Ju sauce was soooo yummy! I've never been a fan of guac but this place definitely changed my mind! They have the BEST CORNBREAD I've ever tasted in my life, seriously! It comes out all fancy in a cute little skillet and its so moist and packed full FLAVOR! Last but not least, their hot fudge sundae!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is the best hot fudge I've ever had! They bring it our in this pretty little silver gravy boat and they even sprinkle on top some candied walnuts and it is to die for! I love this place and can't wait to go again, again, again and AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best to make a reservation tho =)

While the food may be good, the service at Los Altos Grill is atrocious. I made reservations 1 1/2 months in advance and yet we still waited for one hour past our reservation time to be seated.  The hostess even had the nerve to imply that another group was seated ahead of us because "they insisted".  Does "insist" mean sliding the hostess $20 to get seated first?? What is the point of a reservation?? Being a Los Altos residence, this is a complete put-off. While I try to support local businesses as much as possible, this type of arrogant service and lack of customer focus made the experience so negative that it really turns me off from supporting them in the future. It's quite a shame given there are so few fine dining options in Los Altos. They're lucky to have survived for as long as they have. Perhaps only time will tell how their horrendous customer service will impact their success.

Oh my... Best Prime Rib in South Bay...Hands Down. No corkage fee? Hands Up! Hooray! I came here once. My friend and I are smart enough to avoid busy days and time. When I plan on getting good food, I take my time eating, drinking, and socializing. I love the lively atmosphere + piano playing in the background. I don't even remember the service because I was just having so much fun. Damn...I'm drooling again thinking about the Prime Rib.

This is one of my fav. bbq places in the bay area. Even my friends from Texas love this place.  The best dishes are the ribs and prime rib - those will surely not let you down. Usually the corn bread with jalapeno is good...but sometimes the batter is not mixed well enough. If you like sweet BBQ, this is your place. Otherwise, if you like the more vinegary kind - go elsewhere. But if you do happen to stop on by, bring a bib and your appetite. This place is sure to fill you up.

A huge disappointment!! This is when I wish I could've given ZERO stars, or even better NEGATIVE stars. Yes, I know I used caps, it was that horrible. I've never heard of the place, but one of our friends said it received rave reviews and the food was delicious. So we came here for a birthday gathering with a party of 14. I guess the place doesn't take reservations, but they told my friend that they'll hold the tables or put her name at the top of the list for 7:30. This was agreed upon a week before. She calls on the day of and they said our reservations or whatever was for 7:00pm instead. Okay that's fine so we walk in at 7:02 I remember this because I sent out a text right as we walked in. So my friend walks up to the hostess and lets her know we're here and she tells us to wait. Great we're all happy, excited to be here, ready to eat. A very stern lady walks up to us and informs us that she is the manager and that she has been waiting for us to get there since 7:00pm which was what time we needed at least half our party there to be seated. We only had 5 with us, when we checked it. She proceeds to tell us that she had a house full of people waiting that couldn't be seated because they were saving the tables for us. Also tells us that they normally don't take reservations and that since we were late she had to give one of the tables away. Oh heck no! First off, we didn't ask you if you were the manager, we could care less who you are. Lady, if I wanted to be lectured I would've had dinner at my parents house. Who are you to be lecturing us in front of a restaurant full of people watching? Lucky for them we had a bunch of people coming so we stayed, unlucky for us. So we're seated, the 5 of us and we're calling everyone to make sure they're almost there. She walks by us a few times, talks to one of the waiters and points at our table. What the heck is your problem lady? Our anxiety level is to the max right now, and we were sweating bullets waiting for everyone. I am not kidding you. Another 15 minutes pass and here we go again. The "Manager" named Porsha walks up to our table again and lets us now, that they can no longer hold the rest of our tables since everyone is so late. She tells us she is trying to run a restaurant and must accommodate everyone and not just one party. In the most condescending tone I've ever heard. Oh wow! Thank goodness everyone walks up at this point and she kind of changes her tone and says she hopes we understood where she was coming from. No Porsha sorry we do not understand how you can treat your customers this way. Alright now to the food, finally. I ordered: Center-Cut Filet Aged Angus beef tenderloin, cut by hand, served with mashed potatoes colcannon and seasonal vegetables $31 My Hubby ordered: Roasted Prime Rib Aged and roasted on the bone, served with mashed potatoes colcannon and horseradish (upon request) $28 My Hubby's meal came out wonderful and so did everyone elses. I ordered mine medium well and it came out raw on the inside. Why, oh whhhy me? I was so hungry, high strung after what happened with the manager lady, and afraid to send it back because I didn't want them to mess with my food. I mean who knows after the whole incident. So I tried to take another bite but it wasn't happening, can't eat it at all. It looked like it was just pan seared on the outside and served to me. The meat was purple on the inside when I cut into it. Maybe some like it that way but nope not me, I like it cooked. Fully cooked, thank you very much. So we send it back and by the time it comes back everyone else is finished with their delicious dinner and mine is over-cooked the second time around. Oh well, I'm over it at this point and just eat it. Everyone was still talking about what happened so a friend of the bday boy and my hubby asks to speak to the general manager on duty to let him know what happened. He was very apologetic and decided to give us 3 free deserts. One for each table, since the tables were separate. We all try to finish eating really quick so we can get the heck out of there and ask for our check. Guess what? The deserts were charged on the bill! HAHA! What a night! We tell our waiter that it wasn't supposed to be charged and he tells us he didn't know apologized and takes it off our bill. The best part of the meal was the end, when we got to walk out, pretty much ran out of the horrible place. It's filled with ritzy, over the top people with tons and tons of old money that think they should be catered too. We were not those people, but still should've been treated like respectable customers. Shoot it's not like we were going to dine and ditch! We can pay for our meals. Yes there's no corkage fee when you bring your own wines but STILL not even worth it and never again.

Corkage is probably a huge plus but I'm 4 years underage so I guess I'm missing the whole point of Los Altos Grill. Corn bread was really good. I'm very indifferent about cornbread but this made me rethink that. Other than that, food was pretty good but nothing amazing.

The service was weak.  The host at the door was courteous, we felt welcomed.  But the waiter was hard to find all throughout the meal.  In fact, the table across from ours, the gentleman there started yelling that the last 10 minutes no one came to wait on his party, party of two! But service aside, this is a nice spot for a casual family dinner.  The food is tasty.  I had their ahi tuna salad and it was delicious.  Others at my table had the ahi tuna burger, the heirloom tomatoes salad (special of the day), and the chicken salad.  Everyone enjoyed the food. I also hear it's the place to be on Thursdays and Fridays.  I'd give it another try and hopefully someone there will make up for this bad service and I can come back here and give it the 4 star rating it most probably deserves but not tonight ;)

My wife and I have long been going to Los Altos Grill and simply love the food. Chicken Enchiladas, Roasted Chicken, French Dip, Deviled Eggs, Peel and Eat Shrimp, Creme Brulee, Snapper with rock shrimp, Grilled Corn w/Garlic Butter, Grilled Artichokes, Banana Creme Pie, etc. are simply awesome. So why not 5 stars? The restaurant is very noisy when busy, hostess can be snooty, they hate substitutions (e.g. won't ever sub a half an artichoke for vegetables/starches to  but will gladly charge for a full order), and the wait staff tends to be on the more junior side. That said I can still recommend for the food (and can even more recommend the sister restaurant Rutherford Bar & Grill next time you are in Rutherford/Napa area).

If you want to find out where everyone in los altos is on a friday night go here. How can a town be so dead outside and yet so lively inside los altos grill? Perhaps because there is not a single decent hangout/date type places nearby.You can come here, hope to get a table, and never have to talk too much to whoever you're with. Plenty of stimulus. Alas it's not coming from the menu.Here's a place that refuses to change a single thing, other than food quality (dropped after it took the name los altos grill) and the font of the menu selections.  You can still get ostrich and the same wines.(how many glass of testerosa can they pour?) You'd think with all the serious wine aficionados in the area they'd pull it together.

I have mixed feelings about this place. I ordered fish that was way too buttery and not very fresh judging by its chewiness in my mouth. But my husband ordered prime rib that he completely devoured and he wants to go back for his birthday to order it again! And I do recognize the great service and appreciate that there is NO CORKAGE FEE. So at the end of the day, I do recommend dropping by this place, but stick to meat!

Came here to celebrate my hubby's birthday.  We came here before when it was Bandera, seems like the same menu.  We started off with the skillet cornbread, I don't usually like cornbread, but this was pretty good although it needed to be served piping hot (not luke warm like it was served to us).  I also ordered a hacked salad which I really enjoyed.  My hubby got the barbecue beef ribs which were pretty tender and not drenched in bbq sauce.  My mother-in-law ordered the tuna poke which she thoroughly enjoyed and the sliced leg of lamb which she couldn't finish b/c she was helping my father-in-law eat some of his prime rib.  The prime rib was really flavorful, but a bit gristly, very hard to cut.  Then we got the OREO ice cream sandwich for dessert, which was pretty good as well.

the food is great, especially the grilled artichokes but the service is the worst I have ever experienced.  And when we asked for the manager she was arrogant and worse than the bartender we had the problem with in the first place.  However, to be fair, this was 3 years ago and we haven't been back.  Maybe it is time to try it again.

I have been going here regularly for years.  Back when it was Bandera, before the patio and piano went in, and the consistency of their food is excellent.  I have eaten almost everything on the menu at least once, and love it all.  Their outdoor-BBQ'd chicken is awesome, their steaks are super.  Even the deviled egg appetiziers, or the peel-and-eat shrimp are awesome too.  I would highly recommend eating here if you have never tried it.  It is usually the default destination when someone is visiting from out of town, as one of the best places in Los Altos to eat.

This place has some of the best ribs. These are the most tender ribs and they taste great. I've been here many times now, but its the only thing I ever order, The mashed potatoes have a good mix of garlic in them and their cole slaw taste more like a chinese chicken salad, it must be the peanuts.    The food here is comfort food and it does taste good. The only draw back is the service at times, and almost always with the host/hostesses. The center U shaped bar takes up most of the place and it causes a rather loud atmosphere in the center and there just isn't enough room for people waiting. Even with reservations it seems like there is still a 10-20 min wait. The dress is rather casual, or whatever you really want it to be, I've seen it all here. The food is reasonable in price and worth every penny. Its only the service that hurts this place. Order the ribs and start off with the grilled artichoke trust me.

After reading the reviews about this place we gave it a go.  It felt very dated when you walked in - the decor is dark and dingy (not dark, the tasteful type of dark atmosphere, but just.....old).   ;-) Also, we found that the menu was quite limited as compared to other nearby restaurants.  For example, there was nearly nothing on the menu that was vegetarian. Lastly, it took us nearly 15 min. (sitting at the bar!) to order a drink.  The staff seemed more intent on visiting with the obvious "locals" than waiting on us.   Overall, as first impressions go this wasn't a winner.

This place hits the key points  all the way - super layout, excellent service, delicious food and a cool atmosphere. The horseshoe bar in the middle sets the energy level & great people watching. The two ring layers of booths give dinners  the choice of taking in the show or settling into their own booth zone. Service is premium, running like clock work - teaming between hosts, bartenders, runners, managers and servers brings everything together seamlessly. It's understated, but all your needs are addressed precisely and quickly. Los Altos Grill caters to families, young couples and the retirees - all mixing comfortably. The prime rib is always superb, which I had last time with skillet corn bread & a Caesar salad. My Mom always has sea food, which she loves, this time she had a great sea bass. Hats off to our server Amir - typifies the staff - gracious & charming. You can't got wrong at the Los Altos Grill for a fun, on the town, dining experience.

service was lackluster tonight. Ok, downright irritating. We were a party of 8 so gratuity was included in the bill so maybe thats why our waitress didn't even try. Nary a refill of water or a visit to check on the table. Woudnt have been a big deal except that our water cups were the size of Dixie cups. She was eager to get us to order dessert. When we asked for the menu, she replied that there wasn't one, but rattled off 3 choices. We know the desserts are on the menus, but she was too lazy to fetch one. So effing annoying that it overshadowed the food.

Wanted to try this place for a while, but the last time I stopped by, the wait was so long (weekday night) that we decided to go elsewhere. Well finally, I was able to enjoy a dinner here... I think it was a Sunday night and there was something going on, so there weren't as many people as usual. I got the cornbread for appetizer and prime rib for the main dish (I know, not the healthiest of meals... I was splurging on calories). I guess I didn't read the description too well because I didn't know that all the cornbreads are jalapeno flavored. It was good and had that added kick, but I think regular corn bread might have been better. The prime rib was delicious, but I should have gotten it medium rare instead of medium. All in all pretty good - although I am still not sure why it's so super happening all the time. I will try something else next time.

Great place for a casual lunch or dinner out with family and friends. May not the best place for a first date or a business meeting since the place is usually packed with a long wait for a table and can be very noisy making it difficult to carry on a sustained intelligible conversation. But the  crowds, noise and excitement of the mostly local regular discriminating patrons is just a tribute to the establishments fine food and casual ambiance. If your in the area be sure to include the Los Altos Grill in your fine dinning schedule

After numerous visits over the last year, I've decided to move my review from a  4 to a 5 star. It's well warranted.  This place has consistently well-executed food and service, it's BYOB, and the prices are very reasonable for the quality delivered. Plus, if you make a reservation, you avoid waiting 45-60 minutes for a table. I've tried most of the menu (ribs, chicken, prime rib, french dip, corn bread, tuna, etc.) I've yet to find something that I wouldn't order again. Love this place!

I've been to Los Altos Grill twice, and eaten there once. The food is good; I would even say quite good. But, I won't be returning. The second time I showed up, it was a Sunday night. We walked in, and were told that it would be a 30-minute wait. We decided to wait. And wait. And wait. We went and asked the hostesses (a group of three ditzy teenagers who seemed to have difficulty managing what should be one person's job) what was up. They said, "Well, people with reservations are coming in, so they get seated first." Wait a minute...so...the 30 minutes they quoted was assuming that NONE of the reservations actually showed up, and every time someone with a reservation appeared, they didn't take their pre-reserved table but instead jumped the queue and pushed everyone else down the list? I asked the hostess droids. Yep. That's what they do. And, apparently, this EXCEPTIONALLY COMPLEX system needs three of them to manage. We gave up and went somewhere else. It was the most staggeringly incompetent way of managing a restaurant's tables I've ever encountered. It means that the time they quote for you is a sublime work of fiction; if you have to wait at all, assume it's going to be at least twice the time quoted. Because those reservation folks are jumping in line in front of you; they don't have their own line. Dumb.

OMG!!!  Why didn't I find this place sooner?!  When the waiter found out that we were mostly first timers, he hooked us up with free cornbread.  I don't even like cornbread, but LAG's is DELISH!  I hesitantly ordered prime rib and was NOT disappointed.  Every single bite was flavorful!  Many yelpers rave about the french dip though, so perhaps I will try that next time. . .but may end up sticking with prime rib.  Lastly, no corkage fee?  RIDICULOUSLY cooL!  Los Altos Grill is amaaaaaazzzzzzzzzzzzing!  I can't wait to go bacK! :D

DH still calls this place Banderas.  I guess that was the name years ago before they changed it to Los Altos Grill.  I was first introduced to this place by my then BF (hubby) about 7 years ago.  First off their dirty martini is the bomb.  The cornbread is spectacular.  I had some kind of a chicken dish and I remember it being really good.  Hubby likes meat, so that's all he orders.  Expect to wait on most nights, so do plan to come early.

I'm becoming a huge fan of this place!  I just love the warm decor of the place and the lighting.  To go with the warm atmosphere, they have a live band playing near the entrance of the restaurant.   The thing I love most about this restaurant is that they don't charge a corkage fee.  No corkage fee every single day!  I came with three other people, and we brought two bottles of wine with us.  We just ate, talked, and drank the night away.  Time passes by so quickly in the presence of great company.  We were at the restaurant for a good two hours, and by the time we knew it the restaurant was closing. The food I had was once again delicious.  My group of friends and I decided to order the special appetizer of the night, which was a Chicago style spinach dip.  I'm not sure what makes this spinach dip "Chicago Style", but the dip had a good amount of spinach and had the right amount of cheesiness.  The dip was accompanied by tortilla chips.  They also provided sour cream and some salsa to go along with the spinach dip.  For my main course I tried the prime rib this time around.  I figured if there are so many great reviews on yelp for the french dip sandwich, the prime rib must be good.  I ordered my prime rib medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly when my food came out.  I like how they give you a cup of au jus and horseradish to go along with the prime rib.  Prime rib was juicy and tender.  The piece of steak was huge!  I asked my server how big the prime rib was, and he said it's usually about 16-18 oz. bone in.  I was absolutely stuffed after trying to finish my whole steak. One person in my group ordered the cheeseburger.  I noticed that that they use some type of sweet sauce on the burger, and that made the burger unique to their restaurant.  I love the quality of the ground beef they use for the burger patty.  I must get this next time I come here again, if I can resist ordering steak.  I'm not a big fan of the fries that comes with the burger because they are too thinly cut, but I love coleslaw, so I'll try that with my burger next time. I will be coming back OVER and OVER again when I want a chill night to hang out with friends and drink wine!

Didn't think I'd like it, but I did. Good bar vibe, lots of chatter and very friendly crowd. I met plenty of new people. This is a place for prime rib lovers, not so sure about the other dishes, but it's a good hunk of meat, well-cooked and served by fun, friendly and efficient staff. It was a quick visit, I don't feel compelled to choose it over other more local places but I'll pass by again one day to try the ribs and make some new friends

For a Hillstone restaurant, I find the Los Altos Grill to be average. Yes, the no corkage fee is great, but the food is mediocre. On my last visit the cornbread was on the dry side, and the deviled eggs were very salty. My mashed potatoes were bland, and there was nothing special that set apart their glazed salmon, ribs, or ribeye steak.

My number 1 go to restaurant. Limited menu, but almost everything is excellent. No corkage fee for BYOB and an excellent wine list if you are bottleless. The wait for a table is usually 30-60 minutes so my wife and I usually sit at the bar. Always a shorter wait. If you are a semi regular the bartenders and wait staff will make sure to greet you, shake hands, and chat a bit. Seems to be a company policy. The Chocolate Sunday is totally to die for. The chocolate sauce is served on the side. Save room and share (it's big) you won't be disappointed. Wes S

Houstons in the City is one of my favorite places so I knew I had to give this place a try. We went on a Friday night around 6:30ish and luckily there was no wait! The place reminds me of a smaller, rustic version of Houstons. I can see the similarities in the food, but it just didn't hit the spot for me. I tried the cornbread, which was good, but it got boring after a few bites. I didn't enjoy my prime rib too much, but it was mainly because it was a bit overcooked and I'm not the type to send back my food. I'd probably come back at some point, but it wasn't a memorable meal. I would have definitely been more disappointed with it if we had a long wait.

To get a table at Los Altos Grill, a reservation is definitely recommended unless you want to wait 30 minutes or longer. The outside of the building looked like a ranch and when you walk in, there is a large u-shaped bar that takes up the whole middle part of the restaurant, which appeared to be the main attraction. It was very dark, except for single lights shining in the middle of each wood table, wood beams going across the ceiling and comfortable red booths. The noise level was a little loud especially, when seated in a booth right next to the kitchen, which is out in the open right behind the bar. Besides for the semi-tacky uniforms the servers wore (white collared shirts with striped aprons), they were friendly and the service was amazingly fast. For a starter, the skillet cornbread for $5 was a great beginning to the meal. It was infused with Ortega chilies as well as whole pieces of corn and the top crust was sweet and crispy. The French dip was made with medium-rare, very thinly sliced beef (with no fat in sight) sandwiched between French bread and was definitely the best French dip I had ever tasted. Although the au jus sauce did not have as much flavor as I had hoped for, it was served with salty very thin French fries, which made the plate complete. The enchiladas were served with a salad that included cucumbers, onions, cheese, black olives and a tomato and tasted like a very good Greek salad. The enchiladas themselves contained juicy white meat chicken, spinach, and cheese and were covered with a light orange enchilada sauce. The white rice with parsley that complemented the enchiladas and salad was a little bland, but overall the enchilada plate was above average. Even with the high prices, the skillet cornbread and the French dip sandwich would definitely lure me back to Los Altos Grill.

I visited this place for the first time this past weekend. After all the rave reviews I do have to agree with all the other YELPERS that this place offers great food.. However, I am giving it only 2 stars because of the horrible service we received. We came in with a party of 7. Four adults and 3 children.. Our waiter was horrible. After we sat down a waiter came and took our drink orders.. He was attentive and got all or drink  and appetizer orders correct however he wasn't our actual waiter. Our waiter came shortly after him and asked us if we wanted our wine opened and if we were ready to order.. We told him no that we just placed our appetizers.. He came back after bringing our wine glasses and asked us again.. ok fine.. we're ready.. We placed our orders... and requested water as well for the kids along with their apple juices. When the dinner orders came one of the orders came out wrong and he was able to fix it pretty quickly.. Which was very nice .. But he forgot the waters... I still wasn't upset at this time because i figured he was very busy... Here is where it went bad... After eating for about 15 mins.. He came by and asked us ooh are you done? Can i get you a box? umm dude i still have 5 out of the 6 ribs on my plate do i look done? THEN.. another 10 mins he goes to my friend on the other side of the table and asks her if she is done... She said no the kids are still eating but you can bring us some boxes.. After bringing the boxes he comes back again and asks us if we are done... FINE ok i'm done... he then asks about desserts.. ok bring by the dessert menus. He informed us they only offered 2 that night.. a creme brulee and an ice cream sandwich .. so we ordered both! Desserts were amazing.. BUT as he delivered the desserts he also DELIVERED THE BILL! WTF? oook.. He then is hovering over our table waiting for a credit card... soo we pay for he.. he quickly grabs it and says thanks! umm ok... Keep in mind we had JUST started on our desserts... I would go back for the food.. however the service was lacking.. I felt soo rushed thru out the whole meal. Keep in mind that we had a table of 7 with 7 meals and dessert. So our bill was not "cheap"...I"m not sure why the waiter wanted to rush us out but we were not the last ones the restaurant was still about half full when we left... I was very disappointed because this restaurant is located in Los Altos which boasts great service and food..

My husband and I are big fans of Los Altos Grill!  Not only has every single entree we've tried on the menu been just great, there is no corkage fee.   This is such a wonderful feature for two people who go out to dinner quite often! and really enjoy wine!   I often take my clients to Los Altos Grill for dinner, and between the ambiance, food, and conversation, everyone always enjoys themselves very much.

I don't get it. Yes this place is busy, but unbearably so. It needs crowd control because they are so disorganised. Hostesses had an attitude problem, but waitresses were attentive. The food was so unremarkable and overpriced (please skip dessert, SO not worth it). While the booth seating was comfortable, the darkness and loudness of the place wasn't. The crowd at the bar was a bit sleazy, but at least they were a bit more subtle about it than most places in the South Bay.

No Corkage - that alone warrants 3 stars.  Their prices are very reasonable and they have a decent variety to the menu.  Much to the dismay of my boyfriend I always order bangers and mash - I love it every time!  He often mixes things up and his experiences are usually hit or miss.   His protein tends to be over cooked and dry (why I took off one star)  The seating are all high booths which gives a great sense of privacy.  Service has always been excellent and even when the food has just been average - we have always had a great time with the nice atmosphere and our favorite bottle of wine.

This is just the best place in the world. Always fun and the food is incredible. If it wasn't packed and noisy then it wouldn't be the same. My wife is a salmon fanatic and their salmon is her absolute favorite. I always tell visitors to have the ribs but my personal favorite is the french dip. The dip duo and the artichoke are the starters to not miss. The burger is pretty amazing if all you want is a good hamburger for once.

Good things: no corkage fee good service nice set up Bad things: not many vegetarian options they don't serve you water??? over priced the vegetable plate was really bland and mediocre.  Like come on, put some effort into that!  It was $13.  It was so bad it prompted me to write this review.  They literally boiled some vegetables and put them on a plate.  At least grill them or something, put some olive oil on them, or even spices!  I would've been better off with a basket of french fries.  But maybe the veggie burger is better, but I doubt thats vegan.

I have been to this restaurant twice and I have had good meals both times. It is very casual and I saw many men wearing shorts however the women dressed nicely. It is difficult to get reservations here and when you arrive you will probably have to wait a few minutes for your table to be ready. We started with their manila clam and salmon appetizers. For the main course we had the prime rib sandwich and seared ahi tuna salad. We were impressed with everything and I can not wait to return.

Food: There are only 10 dishes on the menu but they are good sized portions, the staff appears very proud of the food and everything was amazing. Really good place for comfort food and they were not shy about adding greens either. Ambience: I loved the live music, musicians were reading their notes from iPads, very innovative. Nice booths and a fireplace, so it really felt cozy enough to have an intimate conversation. Crowd skews older, but that's no problem, everyone can enjoy. Service: Pacing was a bit too fast for me. They checked on us constantly, a bit excessive for me, I prefer a slower pace. We found ourselves "relocating" our conversation very often, after speaking to the waitress. It looked like the staff was very happy to work there and got along well. Very nice and highly recommended for classy comfort food and celebrations.

If you didn't know, they are part of the same family as the Rutherford Grill in Napa. Staff is energetic, friendly and fairly knowledgeable. You can tell they front of the house staff and the kitchen staff have some synergy going on... What is the most impressive is their selection and pricing for wine. You can tell they know what is good and price it extremely fair. Food is beyond your normal "grill" food as well... Going back soon!

I've been coming to Los Altos Grill since it was Banderas.  Get there early, or make a reservation (I hear they have reservations now!)  As for the food.  Oh how I wish the Macho Salad was back on the menu.  That aside, the menu is simple and tasty.  I loved my french dip sandwich.  I've also enjoyed the ahi tuna burger and a salmon burger.  Solid, tasty, interesting food.  Their wine list is impressive and they pour a nice sized glass of wine.  Also, no corkage, EVER!  Not even on New Years Eve when my table brough 3 bottles of wine.  But, folks, be sure to tip as if you'd ordered alcohol, don't tip on the lower total or your waiter will be sad.

"Bandera" - the only ALMOST cool place in Los Altos (zzzzz - yea yea yea. I can say that, I LIVE THERE). That being said, I go a lot. Very good food, good booze, good wine list. They do take a short list of reservations, but if I can get a seat at the bar, thats my preference (I'm single, and dont have kids - most the booths are kid-filled). Not sure about the recent piano addition (like it wasnt loud enough?) Not to mention, the songs the guy was playing were comically LOS ALTOSish (again, zzzz). I was waiting for him to break into "FEELINGS"... shoot me NOW!!! The snapper (in the summer) with the shrimp and mango salsa is killer. Everything on the regular menu is good. French dip and fries are awesome. Artichoke rocks. The chips and dip duo - guac is not great, double up on the white trash chz and mayo dip. Its GREAT. Salmon on the menu is great, the wild salmon special is usually a tad bland. If they are offering escabeche as a side, double up, its to die for. The banana cream pie is gross - pudding on bananas on some weird-ass crust. All portions are NOT as big as they were when they opened, and the prices went up ta boot, but...food IS consistent, so, there ya go And, of course...bleu chz stuffed olives in a dirty martini? oh yea...bring it onnn  - who needs dessert? (although, they were MUCHHHH LARGER martini glasses when they first opened - HICCUP). Now, if only hot, single men under 70 hung out there......oh well, again, its Los Altozzzzzzzzz. 10/08 Update - so, whats up with the Thai salad only being served on a few random days? HELLO? And, I finally got wind of the MACHO salad being available if you ask...put both on the MENU!!

This is a wonderfully consistent restaurant.  Whatever I've tried from the menu has been excellent, from the cornbread to the french dip sandwich, hamburger, the house salad is fantastic with homemade corn bread croutons, etc. Service is reliable and although I'm quoted a 20-30 minute wait sometimes upon arrival, I'm ususally seated much sooner. If I have waited, I try to stand back by the serving bar because the show is terrific!  Just like watching the Food Network!  Very fast chefs preparing entrees for final inspection and tweaking prior to being released to the wait staff.  Take a glance into the kitchen behind the grill area and WOW - it's huge! The system used by the restaurant ensures that seating, drinks, food, and dessert are provided in a timely manner. One note I would make is this.  Because I've eaten there so many times, I would appreciate the appearance of a new dish on the regular menu.   For a consistently great meal, exciting ambience, and that pleasant, comfortable feeling, definitely check out The Grill in Los Altos!

They shake a mean martini and the service is amazing. I've been twice and I had the Ahi Tuna both times, it's so good I can't seem to get myself to try anything else. Their cornbread muffiny things are an awesome change to plain, normal bread. I really like this place, I'm just not fond of this type of atmosphere. So really my not giving it a full rating is personal preference.

The best French Dip sandwich EVER! You will pay about 18$ for it, but Im telling you its delicious! My husband had the ribeye special that was awesome too ($32).   We had to wait 2 hours for our table, but there is enough room to hang out with a glass of wine.  I am looking forward to spring when the weather improves so we can sit outside on their patio.

An interesting little place in downtown Los Altos that reminded me quite a bit of Town in San Carlos (for anyone whose been there).  I went there last night to catch dinner while watching the NCAA basketball finals (yes, I know it's not a sports bar), but I liked the atmosphere of the place last time I went.  For dinner I had the roasted pork chops, which were literally as big as my head.  Strangely, I was able to eat the entire thing (tasty) and polish off a glass of pinot noir before that horrible, horrible game was finished.  I'm guessing the place is a little more lively and exciting on a weekend, but on a Monday night, I should have known better.

I went to Los Altos Grill with a party of 7 for a graduation dinner. We had a reservation and were seated right away. First off, let me say how great it is to have no corkage fee - we brought our own bottle of wine and a bottle of champagne. Both the hostess and our waiter were extremely friendly and provided great service. I had the cheeseburger and fries for dinner and it was absolutely delicious! The burgers are rectangle shaped and are on a longer french roll, so they look a little different but taste wonderful! I tried bites of everything the rest of our party had (roasted chicken, pork chop, bangers and mash, tuna poke) and it was all really tasty. Overall, great atmosphere, wonderful food and good service! Will definitely be coming back!

Normally a good restaurant. They have a dish now with "Kobe style beef.". This beef was tough, stringy and overdone. I lived in japan and the only thing about this "Kobe style beef" that resembles Kobe beef is that I think it was beef. Also bad service.  In between appetizer and meal waitress just disappeared and we never saw her again. After much confusion, finally did get new waiter. Disappointed. Good artichoke appetizers.

Los Altos Grill is my favorite American restaurant on the peninsula that I've found so far.  It's definitely a meat-and-potatoes kind of place; so although their grilled fish selections will probably be pretty good, I would recommend sticking with the meaty items here!   My standby here is the prime rib sandwich, which has yet to disappoint!  The sandwich consists of a very generous portion of thinly sliced prime rib, and the au jus for the sandwich is amazingly good.  The shoestring fries are also very good (although at times a tad too salty).  I believe the sandwich is $16, which makes it one of the better deals on the menu.  Other great items on the menu include their baby back ribs, the prime rib, and the cornbread in a skillet.  I have yet to try the ribeye (although every time I vow that I'll get it the next time I'm there!).  For desserts, their banana cream pie is very caramelly and good :), and the key lime pie is also quite good, not too tart. The atmosphere of the restaurant is upscale; it's quite dark, and the booths are fairly intimate (and they have nice large round booths for larger parties).  The service is generally good, although occasionally the servers seem a little harried and too busy to get to your table. This place is almost ALWAYS crowded, even on a mid-weekday night.  Make reservations, especially if it's a friday or saturday!  However, once you order, the food arrives impressively quickly.

People, people ~ please let's put this into perspective and not lose our minds.  Superb food?   As a local eatery, Bandara/Los Altos Grill (stupid name change!) is worthy of no more that 4 stars for folks that do not venture beyond a 5 mile radius.  As a non-local restaurant, no more than 3 stars.  It is good consistent food, in the neighborhood with a good bar.  Our grandparents during their day probably thought the same of Stickney's in Palo Alto.  I've never had a bad meal here nor have I had euphoric one.     Bandara/Los Altos Grill offers upper tier fast food - burgers, fish sandwiches, enchiladas, rotisserie chicken, salads, cornbread, ribs; the steaks and pork tenderloin are thrown in for good measure .   If you are like me and mine the conversation goes like this: "Where should we eat tonight?" "I don't know, just no Chinese or Mexican and I don't feel like driving." "Bandara?" "Ok, let's go before it gets too crowded."

Located in the heart of what you can call downtown los altos this place is always packed. Every weeknight it is busy so that is kind of a downer. Last time I went I had to wait 30 min with my family and we had a reservation. Once we got seated the 12 dollar chips and dip were good but at least they give you free refills. Then comes the main course. Both times that I have been there I have gotten the ribs. They are amazing. if I had a last meal I would have to seriously consider having these ribs. The meat is smoked and grilled and comes off the bone with ease. THey give you a fairly good sized portion and you will be glad you ordered these. I was full that night and ontu the next day. Get the ribs the first time you go, dont spend 30 bucks on fish or some weak steak. Get the ribs. I would give it a 5 star rating but i have only had the ribs so I will have to go back and try other things.

I've been going to Los Altos Grill (and formerly Bandera) about once a month since we moved to Los Altos in 2000.   I would say the main attraction for us here is that we know exactly what we are going to get.  The menu, food quality, service and price is very consistent.   I would say those are consistently good, not great.  We've had very nice dinners here with friends and family.   Los Altos Grill is usually crowded, noisy and a 30-40 minute wait.  We've had some very nice experiences going early (around 4:30 or 5:00) before it gets crowded and noisy and the servers are not stressed out yet.  Not the perfect place, but this is more a sure bet than any other place in Los Altos.  Many other restaurants in town are hit or miss (for those that can remain in business).

I cannot say enough good things about this fabulous restaurant. It's the go to place in Los Altos. The vibe is nice, the dimly lit atmosphere is great, the booth seats are comfortable and private, especially if you are enjoying a meal with your special someone. The cornbread is an absolute must! Delectable indeed! The only criticism I have about the restaurant is I really think some of the waiters need to work on their service skills..sometimes they are a bit slow (maybe because they are super busy), and sometimes they could get our orders that are customized a bit wrong.. but either way, they have made up for it and they are wonderful overall in my book! 4 STARS!

I have been coming here for years since it was Bandera and have never had a bad experience. The food is always well prepared and tasty. My favorites are the beef ribs and the prime rib French dip. I usually always order the corn bread that always keeps me coming back for more. Another bonus is the no corkage fee.  When I go out with friends that like to order bottles of wine off the menu I try to end up here so I don't have to split a super expensive bottle, I just suggest we each bring a bottle.

I ate here last week with family to celebrate 2 birthdays- that was the first mistake. This place is hard to accommodate to parties larger than 4. The ambiance in here definitely makes it more of a place to take your significant other, especially given the dim lighting and predominately booth seating in the restaurant. Out of all the things we ordered, the ones that stood out were the cornbread skillet (with bits of jalapeno), clams appetizers (delicious sauce broth), and chocolate sundae (best chocolate ever!). And it's pretty awesome they don't have a corkage fee if you bring your own bottle of wine. Other than that, the food is a bit overpriced for what you get. For example, the veggie platter was a bit short on quantity (the plate looked only half full!), and the prime rib sandwich is a bit overpriced for almost $20. To sum it up, this place is worth to try if you're taking someone on a date and plan to get boozed up since you can bring your own bottle!

Los Altos Grill is the most popular place in town. We had grilled artichoke for appetizer, filet mignon and salmon and everything was delicious. For desert; the Oreo cookie ice cream - fabulous. Good service, the server was helpful in pairing wines. The place can be a bit overwhelming because it gets very crowded and reservations are needed otherwise the wait can be painful.

5 stars for the PRIME RIB! I have come here many times over the years, and I may have only been slightly disappointed once. The service is always professional, friendly and attentive. I normally only get the prime rib french dip sandwich.  They have better prime rib than anywhere I have gone - House of Prime Rib, Sundance, Black Angus (The prime rib at a well-run Black Angus is actually quite good). The prime rib tastes like real meat - not something that has been marinated to death and no lonber has the semblance of beef.  And it is very flavorful inside as well.  I feel the middle meaty portion of most prime rib you find is sort of bland.  The outside rub is nice and salty.  There is the perfect amount of fat - not too much and not too little.  It is served hot and when you ask for medium rare, you actually get medium rare (not medium).  Even when you get the sandwich, you should ask for medium rare if that is how you like it; otherwise, it might come too well done.  The meat is sliced thin thin thin.  The au jus is excellent, and served piping hot.  I could drink it like a soup,  just the perfect amount of saltiness, and not too thick.  The roll it is served on is grilled to a buttery toasty perfection.  It is not the kind of heavy sourdough.  It is light enough to absorb the french dip perfectly.  The combination of the sandwich with some of the cut horseradish and au jus, is the perfect combination of succulent meat, with just enough heat from the horseradish and saltiness and juicyness of the au jus. I also love their Nice Little Salad.  It is a sour and sweet vinagrette dressing, but more tangy than sweet.  The mixed lettuce is always fresh and crispy, and not overly dressed.  They put on their homemade sweet cornbread croutons which is just divine (I usually never eat croutons as they are usually the packaged overly salty variety).  The salad comes with a beautiful red Compari tomato sliced in half, and deviled eggs.  Very inviting, and tastes even more so.  It is the perfect start to your dinner. The mashed potatoes are not that great.  A bit bland with a somewhat grainier texture than I prefer. The ambiance is nice.  Quite dark like a steakhouse.  Usually at the bar, you find an older clientelle.  However, you'll find the tables accomodate families with kids, singles on dates, adults only parties, etc.

The original post is here http://www.guiyanggal.co… Whenever thinking about meeting friends for dinner, places like Palo Alto, Santana Row, Mountain View always come to my mind first, because those places are packed with trendy and tasty restaurants to meet any requirements. So, when Tim recommended Los Altos Grill to Crystal, Cashin and me, I was suspicious, very suspicious. What on-earth Los Altos could have to offer?! It's a family bed-room city after all! We decided to go, only because Tim sweared that they have the-best-in-the-world cornbread. Again, how good a mere cornbread could be?! I could not help scoffing at Tim's enthusiastic recommendation. I bet Crystal and Cashin was simply being polite and following us. To our pleasant surprise, the place was a hit, a hidden gem for American comfort and hearty food with a slight upscale twist. The skillet cornbread was ungodly tasty, buttery with a crisp crust and textured slightly with kernels of corn. The slight sweetness of the corns played perfectly with the refreshing spiciness from chopped jalapeno peppers. The serving was huge and easily shared by 4 of us. Crystal and I both love steamed clams, although Tim could not stand it. They actually inbeded a piece of garlic bread underneath the steamed clams to suck all the juices. The bread tastes delightful. Tim ordered the Grilled Ostrich (Tim always ordered those strange/unusual dishes, rabbit, duck, once deep fried scorpions in China), and I ordered the BBQ Beef Rib, with meshed potato and buttered broccoli sprinkled with some cheese. Both dishes were tender, juicy and succulent. The ostrich tasted like a slowed cooked beef. They both were simply goooooood and satisfying.

I try to eat here at least once a month.  I've had almost everything on the Menu and have never been disappointed.  The drinks are a little pricey, but very good.  When the restaurant was under old management the margaritas were to die for and came in a large glass.  Now, they are not as good, but the food is excellent!  You won't be disappointed.

I LOVE THIS PLACE!  My only regret is that I just discovered the Grill in the last 18 months. Pros: High quality classic American cuisine in a swank yet comfortable environment. The best, most professional wait staff on the Peninsula.  Bravo! Extremely reasonable prices (especially for Los Altos). No corkage! The best damn french dip sandwich I've ever tasted. Cons: Popularity = long waits Reservation system.  If you make a reservation, they simply move you to the top of the wait list when you show up.  They don't reserve you a specific table.  I've waited over 30 minutes beyond the time of my reservation before.

My absolute most favorite restaurant ever. Before I moved up to SF, Los Altos Grill would be the place my friends and I would celebrate birthdays, graduations, promotions, or just kick off a weekend with some great food, wine and company. LAG has no corkage fee, which is a huge plus. The ribs are absolutely perfect, as are the cornbread and artichoke apps, and the nice little house salad. After you have this house salad, every other house salad will pale in comparison. It's true that you have to wait quite a while for a table sometimes, but it's well worth the wait, and you have your own wine to keep you company at the bar. The ambiance is also quite ideal--great dimmed lighting and an unpretentious atmosphere. Just go there and see for yourself.

I cant remember what I had when I went here, but it was very good. I think it was some kind of steak. I remember the cut being excellent, although my dad had probably the best looking French dip sandwiches that I have ever seen. Service was great with a nice cute waitress who was extremely helpful. The place was ultra packed and extremely dark. I had to wait 15 minutes for our 6pm reservation.

We absolutely love this place.  There is not a thing on the menu we don't like.  The chicken is so succulent, the ribs fall off the bone, the lamb and prime rib are to die for.  Coho salmon is my least favorite salmon, but their BBQ style has won me over.   Great mature atmosphere, but yet I see families as well.  I would recommend reservations even on a week day.  This place is always packed and doesn't seem to be impacted by the recession.

We've come here since it was Bandera's and always liked the food, although since it is no longer Bandera's we do like the food slightly less for the higher prices. Most of the time we come on weekdays because we drag an 8 year old with us and can't afford the long waits, but here is where we discovered a pattern: do not go on Fri or Sat after 6PM, or when it is just very busy. We've generally had no problems, but twice, when it was very busy, things went South.... Deep south. First time (2009) we arrived at 7PM and had almost an hour wait before being seated. It was very busy. We ordered a grilled artichoke for appetizer, two steaks (filet) and kid's ribs. After a long wait the artichoke arrived: cold and barely grilled. After about 8 minutes we were able to signal our waitress and complain. So took the artichoke back and was going to "fix it". We reminded her to not have our entrees fired because of the delay. A "mere" 15 minutes later the artichoke came back. No idea if it was the original one grilled more, or a new one. Didn't matter. The artichoke was blackened and literally on fire. Small flames coming off the charred parts. Couldn't believe they even dared serve it. This time asked for the manager and complained. Try number 3. The third time was the charm and the artichoke was fine this time. Only problem was they attempted to deliver our entrees at the same time. We told them to take them back and fire new ones after we were done with the artichoke. When the newly fired entrees arrived, both requested medium rate, one was fine, the other was still moving on the plate so rare. Kid's ribs? Nowhere to be seen. Explain that to an otherwise very patient 8 year old. 10 minutes to a waiter, call the manager. We explained that this was getting ridiculous. I guess they got the message and actually the head chef came out to apologize. From there on they were good about it. They brought whatever my son wanted to keep him busy (a drink and french fries), re-fired both steaks and brought now excellent steaks and ribs and we finished dinner. After an almost 3 hour experience we were exhausted and, although filled, not happy. That got somewhat fixed when they picked up the tab for drinks and dinner: all of it. So, they deserved a second chance. That second chance (on a busy night, we did go back several times when it was not so busy), came last night. Our son really wanted to eat there as a special treat, which is why we stayed despite a promised 60-70 minute wait (Sat night, 6:45 arrival). The wait, in the end, was 75 minutes. Service was slow. The order was: 1 grilled artichoke, 1 steak medium rare, one snapper special, and kid's ribs. Artichoke took a long time, but was otherwise fine. Next up entrees. Took about 15 minutes after we finished the artichoke, so about 45 minutes after having been seated (it is now 8:40 or so). Snapper is fine, steak looks bloody. I am a pretty good cook myself and now how to cook steak. Poke test with finger confirms rare. I cut the steak about 1/3 of the way in: very rare. Wait 10 minutes for a waiter. Having learned, I told my wife and son to eat, lest their food gets cold. Explain the problem. Response: "Very sorry sir, what would you like us to do, would you like something else?" "No, I would like a properly cooked steak please." "OK". 20 minutes later a plate is brought: It is the same f****ing steak that I cut, still in two parts. They stuck it back on the grill or under a salamander! Outside 1/4" is now medium well, skin is charred, and inside just barely touching on medium rare, but more rare and still bloody and almost cold to the touch. Mashed potatoes: almost cold. Asked a random waiter for the manager who arrives after about 7 minutes. Very apologetic, but insists that one can "fix" a steak using this approach. I tell him that for $34 I expect a properly cooked steak and not this "thing" put in front of me. "Very sorry sir. Can we get you a new one, or something else?" It is now around 9:20, over two and a half hours after hour arrival, almost 1:20 after being seated and I still don't have an entrée that I am willing to eat and pay for. Besides my wife and son are way done eating, and it is way past my son's bedtime, so my answer is: "No thanks, I am done". To their credit they make me an offer of take home food (which I decline because by the time I come home and have my son in bed it will be cold). Also, although the manager did not tell us, our waiter informs us that the bill has been taken care of. They could have just tossed a $10 piece of meat, and made a new one, and do it right. Instead they ended up having to write down $75 of food, and a (still) unhappy customer. Lessons for LA grill: Get your quality control going, even more so on busy nights. Don't serve food and wait 10 minutes or more to check in if everything is alright. Don't argue with the customer about what constitutes a properly cooked medium rare. Not at these prices.

Best in Los Altos and one of the best in this part of the peninsula.  Wish they held more tables for reservations, as the wait can be a pain in the butt and we've not eaten here several times because the wait is too long.

I'm a bit picky about restaurants. I've worked in a few - cooked and waited. I've also eaten at many of the best restaurants in NY and SF. Main yardstick is value. Higher prices mean higher quality. Of course, that is a completely subjective computation. Los Altos Grill is pricey, but worth it. It is my favorite restaurant within 20 miles, at least. Most things on the menu are executed very well. The best are the short ribs, NY steak (when they have it - ask for it blackened, trust me), chicken enchiladas, ahi salad, tomato beet and burrata salad (seasonal), cheeseburger ($12, but it's the best around), grilled artichoke, cornbread, and a few others. I'm not a big fan of the leg of lamb or the french dip. The chicken is basic, but good. They must spend a good amount of time and resources on service training because it is excellent. They work in teams and you can ask anyone walking by to take care of something and they will. Here's an example: They really screwed up on a couple of dishes I ordered. On the way out, I mentioned to the manager that the first dish I sent back really needs to be looked at again. She was apologetic and offered me a free dessert on my next visit. It didn't need that to be happy, but fine. I returned a week later with my family who were visiting from out of town. Somehow, the manager recognized me and comp'd dessert for the whole table, 8 of us. That is a product of good training. I go to this place about 1-2 times a month. What I like most is that they are consistent. Not everything is perfect. Some dishes miss the mark. Service is never spotty, though. They are polite and unobtrusive. Every 2-3 months I go in with a close friend and we bring in 2 bottles of good wine. THEY DO NOT CHARGE A CORKAGE FEE AT THIS RESTAURANT. And, we have never gotten an attitude from any of the staff. The wine list is reasonably priced, another relief. I was in a PA restaurant, 3 Seasons, last year and noticed they were serving a glass of familiar chardonnay for $9, but you can buy the bottle for $11 at Safeway. That's a rip off and many restaurants try this crap and I won't return because I don't trust them any more. On the other hand, LAG has figured out how to run a profitable business w/out ripping you on the wine and they pour a generous cocktail. It is clear to me that they put a lot of effort into the place. For the most part, people who work there care about being professional and that's what I appreciate. And, yes it is very busy - for a reason.

We still refer to this restaurant as "Bandera" which operates under the Grill but is under the same ownership.  Our two young boys choose this wonderful country club style bar and restaurant when given the choice and we eat here at least 3 times a month.  It is not cheap but the kids' meals are generous and the bar just dishes out a bit of relaxation.  It is a local crowd that wants to cut loose, but in our town, that doesn't happen too much. :-)  At least, one can count on Bandera for great service, a consistent meal and a relaxing atmosphere.

Good bar area for the pre-dinner drinks, albeit a touch expensive for a cocktail.  At least you make up for that at dinner when there's no corkage fee on whatever you bring.  The place is crowded and reservations are a bit behind, but the food more than makes up for it.  As many people have mentioned, the ribs are 2nd to none there.  Tasted the Filet and BBQ Salmon from other's plates and would've been ecstatic with that as well.

I tried this place out saturday night for a first date, and we had an excellent time. I definitely advise getting a reservation, as it gets super busy. I love how the bar was set up in the big oval, and the whole place has great ambiance. The food was terrific. I had the rotisserie pork chop and I loved it. It was also the biggest pork chop I've ever seen! A whole 14 oz, so needless to say I took some home. My date had the bbq ribs which were excellent too, fall off the bone tender. The house salads we had were great too. I loved the deviled egg that came with it. The bar also makes some excellent drinks as my date had some great top shelf margaritas. Our waiter was great. He tried to avoid interupting my date as much as possible as we were really talking like non stop. We will definitely be back.

As a single guy, I go and get a drink around happy hour, always nice, good looking upscale Los Altos business women to chat it up with... As a food lover, I just don't know what to order when I go  cause.............. , its ALL GOOD. for starters, The Tuna Poke with Shrimp and Avocado is so FRESH always... to die for... n the cornbread is a gut sticker, but well worth it.. the jalepeno has a little kick to it... and you may need a nap afterwards... always warm and cozy inside, smells nice, kind of oaky..the  lighting is good, tables are not cluttered together, a bit busy as always, but its worth the wait.  and event hough its so busy, you can always hear each other in a booth without any issues... You get what you pay for here.... no doubt a good spot.   consistent.

Some of the best ribs/steak i have ever eaten. The cornbread is made in a cast iron skillet and made with real pieces or corn and jalapenos. For drinks they are a little pricey but if you bring your own bottle of wine they dont charge a corkage fee.  The wait can be a bit long on Friday or Saturday night but def worth it. I have been going here for years and will be going again soon. I think i drooled a little on the keyboard!!!

This Los Altos Grill, (Formerly Banderas) same owner., is one of my favorites. I enjoy sitting at the Bar. The service is great. The food, Great. Very professional bartenders are polite and socialize nicely, and are very accomodating. I love this place. Good Filet Mignon, (however, I don't like my filet butterflied) They over cook it that way, so tell them not to do that, and your good. The cornbread, awesome in a cast iron skillet, great rotisserie roasted chicken. No corkage fee is a nice thing should you like to bring in a nice wine of your own.

If I could give 6 stars I would.This is the only place to go if your in Los Altos and one of the best restaurants in the peninsula. I try to go here a few times a month. The Bar is large but somehow still gets packed daily. I enjoy sitting there and talking with the friendly locals and the bartenders. There all friendly and personalize your experience to make you feel special. They make a great Martini as well as the wine list is affordable and has many well known selections at a great price. The No Corkage policy is very generous and great when you have a special bottle to bring. For food I typically get the French Dip, Veggie Burger or Filet. If you need a starter the Grilled Artichoke is the way to go. The Ice Cream Sundae and Oreo Ice cream sandwich are unreal and are a must even if your full. All in all Los Altos Grill is one of my favorite restaurants...the food and the vibe keep you coming back for more. Keep up the good work!

I went  to Los Altos Grill for the first time on a date and I gotta say, I liked this place so much I wanted to like the boy just for bringing me there (but sadly it just wasn't meant to be) The atmosphere is so warm and cozy and inviting,  The lighting is just right.  Throw in a glass of wine and a girl is ready to fall in love.  Fellas, I highly recommend this place! Oh and my steak was amazing as well, Cooked just the way I like it.  No sauce just salt and pepper and butter and the got the medium-rare just right.

Loud.  Was wishing we knew sign language to communicate. Had a reservation, got there about 5 minutes early, still had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated.  Thursday evening, 6 pm, and the place was packed, no waiting area, we are all just crammed in by the front door waiting for our table.  Once seated, the waitress was very nice, brought water and wine glasses right away and opened the bottle we brought.  The no corkage policy is nice, but probably more important if you have a really special bottle of wine to drink, or a lot of wine drinkers in your group.  Not likely that the 2 of us would drink a whole bottle of wine in one meal so not much savings there.  We had the lamb, fine, but really not $25 worth of excitement, and the ahi,  also good, but also overpriced for the small serving.  Overall, there was nothing really unpleasant about the place, but for the prices I think we will only go back with a larger group for the free corkage option.

No corkage fee.  I repeat, no corkage fee!  This alone is a reason to patronize the place.  The atmosphere is decent, if a bit overwhelming on crowded night.  The food is good, if predictable.  But where else can you enjoy a great bottle of wine from home and not pay $25 for the privilege of opening it?  I was pleasantly surprised.  Of all of the dishes I tried their, the queso appetizer was the best by far.  Very, very tasty.  Perhaps it doesn't say much that the cheesy appetizer was the best, but it really was delicious.

This is one of mine and my husband's favorite places to go for a date night.  The artichoke and the corn bread are both sublime.  We usually end up ordering both and pigging out.  I almost always get their center cut filet and have never been disappointed.  My husband varies on what he gets but it is always good.  Also, the mac n cheese is delicious!!!

Wow!  What a place!  This is a well oiled machine.  From appetizers to dessert.  Simply the best food.   We started with the corn bread which was very sweet and cooked in a little skillet with jalapeno's in it but not too spicy.  Delicious.  Then the grilled artichokes over mesquite coals (I think).  The best I ever tasted. Then fall off the bone beef short ribs slow cooked for 10 hours then sauced and carmelized the last minute on the coals.  With the best BBQ sauce ever. 5 ribs was a nice portion and the best I ever had.  Came with mashed potatoes and brocoli in the potatoes. Also a delicious peanut slaw which was vinegary not creamy which I loved.  The only pet peeve is never serve cold slaw on a hot plate!  Service was supreme and the kitchen was run flawlessly with tickets dissapearing every few seconds.  I would go back every day if I could afford it.  Wish it was not so far from the East Bay!  Great atmosphere, bar and ambience!  If you are on a blind date this is the place to hit a home run.  Get there early though or prepare to wait.  CHOW!

Food is good and worth the wait.  My favorite is the prime rib sandwich served with hand-cut fries (you can also opt for a side of vegetables or cole slaw). If you feel like something lighter, try the fish fillet sandwich which was recommended by our waiter; very fresh, grilled to perfection and served atop cole slaw and buttered toasted bread.  I've also tried the slow cooked rotisserie chicken which is great.  For dessert, order the Oreo cookie ice cream sandwich as it will not disappoint. The service is somewhat spotty on busy nights but the waitstaff seems to always have a friendly and helpful attitude. This place gets busy often and the bar definitely helps with the wait. Upon entry, a large U-shaped bar awaits you where you can order quality cocktails or start on your own bottle of wine (no corkage fee here). The bar is great and plays to the energetic vibe of the restaurant. Parking here is easy (even on a busy night) and there are always pretty cars in the lot.

Went on a Tuesday night with a girlfriend.

Had a nice dinner tonight at the Los Altos Grill. The interior is very nice with a sort of rustic mountain feel with lots of wood. There was a fire going in the corner and a piano player at the entrance. the bar area is very large and in the middle of the dining room. I'm sure you can also eat at the bar. There are several TV's around the bar area. There is some outdoor seating close to the entrance and inside some very nice booths for diners. The selection of food was good with fish, meat and some other dishes. I had the brats(sausage) and spuds which were very good with the house zinfandel (really good). This was a Sunday night and it was busy! All the table were full and we had to wait awhile. We did have to ask for bread several times and water. Prices for dinner were about $15 to $27.The only downside is the noise level was kind of high.. If you want it quite go to beausejour in los Altos. I'm pretty sure I'll be back to the Los Altos Grill.

My favorite restaurant on earth.  The artichoke appetizer is a must have.  Do not go there if you are not going to get it.  If for some reason the artichokes the farmers have are too small they will serve three halves instead of the two big ones they normally have.  Was one of the greatest things they have done.  My two favorite main dishes are the rotisserie chicken and the prime rib.  They have these amazing mashed potatoes that have some great texture to them.  If I order the chicken I usually request to get mashed potatoes with it rather than the rice it normally comes with.

NOT what it used to be.  When it opened, the martinis were large, the rotisserie chicken dinner had 2 legs per dish, so more like 1/2 a chicken with an additional leg, and was huge, yummy, with mashed potatoes to die for.  The margaritas were large, strong, using fresh squeezed lime, and you could get a child's portion dessert.  Enough for just one person.  It has really gone downhill sadly.  We used to eat here twice a week, but just went in for fun after a 6 month hiatus and really disappointed.  The "mesquite rotisserie  chicken dinner" which was their signature dish @ $11, consisted of 1 over cooked leg and small breast, with some plain dumb rice and tasteless sauce over the whole thing for a whopping $17.00 bucks! Used to cost $11 with lots more chicken!.  You used to be able to order  ONE piece of skillet corn bread, but now you have to order an entire pan full.  !!!   You used to be able to order the dip trio, which was guacamole dip, creamy spicy cheese  dip, and a salmon dip, now it is dip "duo" for twice the price.  The prices are really HIGH.  Tiny martini glasses now, watery margaritas, and to top it off, since their customer base has dropped off, probably due to the above,  instead of going back to giving something  of value for your money, they brought in a baby grand piano and player Sun - Wed.  Why don't they just offer what they did before  that really worked?  We used to go  twice a week and it took us 25 minutes to drive down that way. It was "our spot"  The one thing that's still great there is NO corkage fee.  Good ribs and enchiladas too.  We really won't be going back though.  I also asked for the manager to speak with him about what had changed and to ask why, but he never showed up at our table.  Aslo, NOT good for kids at all.  Dark, cozy and definitely ADULT.

It's just a fun place to go and have drinks and dinner.  It's kind of loud and busy, but the boothy dark atmosphere makes it a little more private, and it's surprisingly easy to have a good conversation here, despite the crowds around you.   We always bring my dad here when he's visiting - he loves the roasted chicken.  My husband always gets the prime rib, and I like the veggies and they have a good wine selection (and they're generous with it).  We went last night, and the waiter asked for my ID, and I almost fell out of the booth laughing (btw that was always my tactic when I really was underage - back in the days after fire was invented, but before the wheel.  Driving around in those cars with square tires was such a drag).  Gotta tell you, that made my day, if not my week.  My husband told me to get over myself, the guy just wanted a good tip, but I'll take my compliments where I can get them!

I've been going here since 2001.  It's one of my favorite places in the world.  There's a variety of foods from delicious steaks, grilled chicken & fish, burgers (tuna burger is my favorite), wonderful sashimi salad and wonderful vegetarian dishes: grilled vegetable, heirloom tomato salad, beet salad, etc.  The smoked  salmon is made fresh, on site and it is the best I've been able to find anywhere.  That includes Alaska, Canada, yes anywhere.  There's clams, cornbread, grilled artichoke, just too many wonderful options to even begin to list.  For dessert, get the banana cream pie.  Once again, it's the best I've ever tasted.  Mixed drinks are are made of fresh fruit juice, no pre-mix here.  Best cosmo you'll ever have.  Martinis are up, dry and perfect.  No corkage fee!!!  Serivce is fast and friendly.  Servers and management are extremely accomodating.  Atmosphere is awesome.  Perfect for friennds, family even romantic dining.  Great bar with the game on and live piano music.  Nice table and booth seating if you prefer.  There is a reason this place is crowded nearly every night.  Sunday -Tues nights tend to not be so crowded.  Is it cheap?  No.  You get what you pay for and  this place is worth every penny.

I'm originally from Santa Monica where we have Houston's, Bandera, Gulfstream and R+D (which I've never visited), so I'm pretty familiar with this chain and what they offer.  I was surprised after a year and a half of being up here to find Los Altos Grill.  It looks just like a Bandera to me and it was a surprise to learn that it once was.  I'm not sure why Hillstone Restaurants change names so often (some Houston's are now Hillstone, Banderas that used to be Houston's, etc). We went with my in-laws for a Wednesday night dinner.  The interior was very similar to the West L.A. Bandera, complete with the jazz combo (although this is a free standing building).  This location also has a small outdoor seating area too.  We entered from their rear entrance, coming through the kitchen.  I noticed that most folks were drinking wine instead of cocktails, is that a NorCal preference?   I opted for a beer and we retired to a fireplace near the side to wait out our reservation time.  The hostess magically found us at 7:45 and off we went to our table.  The food was fantastic.  Large, meat and potatoes comfort food.  We started with the jalapeno cornbread (served in a little skillet), then moved on to small salads (garnished with jalapeno cornbread croutons).  Both were fantastic. Rich and filling.  The salad diced just the way I like it.  Bit anchovies on the side if you wanted. I had the sirloin lamb steak (I had never heard of such a thing).  It was delicious, if a little undercooked (I ordered it like my beef--on the rare side).  Meanwhile our servers brought more drinks, condiments, water, and whatever else we needed. Very efficient service.  By the time we were finished we didn't have room for desert--which I saw the pastry chef making in the kitchen.  My father-in-law very generously paid our check (I have to imagine it was hella expensive) and we were off.  Good, good meal. The negatives: The place is extremely noisy.  You could barely hear the live music.  You really had to concentrate to hear your table mate's conversation. The place is extremely crowded.  I expected this, but it's still frustrating when you want to get somewhere and just sit down.  You say 'pardon me' a lot when you're moving through here. I love the decor and the style of the interior, but it gives away it's chain origins. They all tend to look the same after you've visited a few. I don't understand why it has to be so expensive.  Like, $11 cocktails, and $17 hamburgers.  It is good, though. I'll be back.  Apparently they have something of a secret menu that I want to order from.

Hands down my favorite restaurant in Los Altos! The food is better than excellent (I love the prime rib, smoked salmon appetizer/side dish, rotisserie chicken, and I could eat the banana cream pie every single night!). The place has good ambiance and they're famous for their no corkage fee. Only drawback is that if you come without a reservation, you're either going to be waiting a long, LONG time or you're going to be stalking people at the bar waiting like a vulture for them to leave.

My husband and I love the LA Grill! Anytime we get a babysitter, this is first on our list. It definitely gets crowded, but if you get there early, you can usually get seated right away. The service is always outstanding and fast (but not hurried). It is a fun place to people watch, too. We LOVE the artichoke app, and the Oreo dessert (yummy). The only thing that is bad is the wait sometimes, but again, if you get there early, it is not a problem. It is also awesome that they never charge a corkage fee. Huge plus. Overall, definitely a great place!

Went here for dinner last night with some work folks (hosting a visitor from out-of-town)... nice looking place.. very clean and professional.. food was ok.. nothing really spectacular (but the mashed potatoes were excellent).. had the bangers & mash... lots of drinks as well.. prices were a bit steep (in my opinion, based on the food quality and quantity).. but work  paid for it anyway.  Parking was no issue, and service was good.  Nothing wrong at all, but nothing really stood out either  (except the prices)...

As always Bandera aka Los Altos Grill is amazing...if you're an old timer of Bandera you must know about the Cluck and Moo..if not order it!  Ribs/Chicken and either cole slaw or colecannon pots...amazing!  Their french dip is to DIE for.  Service is always quick, courteous and great.  Corn bread to die for...NO corkage EVER I just have to say I wish I lived closer I'd be there weekly :-)

One of the standard dining-out places for me and my hubby-to-be. Great ambiance, the crowd is always lively, friendly service, and we love the food. If you are able to, call and make a reservation early. We never do and the wait is usually 1.5 hours. Which is fine for me as long as I have my glass of Pinot Grigio in hand. Otherwise, we have been successful at squeezing in at the bar every so often. I always order the hacked chicken salad. This is the only chicken salad  I've ever truly enjoyed and craved. The dressing has a sweet flavor and the chicken is tender and juicy. Add in an order of fries that are exactly the right amount of salty and crispy. And for dessert....the ice cream sundae is to die for. I would never ordinarily order an ice cream sundae but there is something about the simplicity of this dessert. Creamy vanilla ice cream along with chopped nuts and the rich chocolate sauce you can pour on yourself. It's not a bad way to go. One of these days, I may even try something else on the menu but for now, Los Altos Grill doesn't disappoint.

We've been eating here since they first opened, as Bandera Restaurant. The menu hasn't fundamentally changed, nor has the cooking--solid execution of hearty meat-and-potatoes fare, a little more upmarket than most. Excellent cornbread, beef ribs, and be sure to get the crème brûlée if its on (seasonal). Huge portions, especially the roasted chickens. Reservations strongly recommended if you're not there at opening-they are usually packed, out the door lines by 5:30PM.

Really Really liked the place! It was my first time here and didn't have any expectations, but the moment I entered the door I knew it would be a great experience. Since the wait was almost an hour long(btw there was no reservations) we decided to wait at the bar. It was a great idea because they don't charge for corkage fee, like many other restaurants, and my friends conveniently brought 2 bottles of wine. Woo Hoo! The bartenders were very nice and helpful. After being seated to our table, I skimmed through the menu. They didn't have large selection but alot of the items seemed really Delish. Few of my choices were Seared Ahi Sandwich and Roasted Chicken. But when the waiter came and recited the special, I couldn't resist. So I ordered the Ribeye. ($30) OMG....yum! It came with a side of Tomatoes, Blue Cheese, and Basil. It was a wonderful combination. And the meat was cooked to perfection. My other friends ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad, Roasted Chicken, and Tri Tip Sandwich. They all enjoyed their meal except the Chicken Salad. It just had too much crunches(fried wonton wrappers). Although we were way too full and had to decline the waiters offer to buy us a dessert, I would love to try them next time.  P.S. the pan crusted corn bread is a MUST for appetizer!

My grandmother raved about this place so we went. Very simple, good food. Kind of an everything type menu even though it wasn't very extensive. Grilled fish, meat and nice rotisserie chicken. Wine list was pretty good. So was the service. Only two minor gripes, the weird salad that came with deviled eggs was something I'd never seen before and why do they put goat cheese on the side vegetables?

First off, I'd like to thank YELP for helping me pull this place up!!  I had very little time to find a spot for East Coast visitors to SF to meet us (we live in Santa Cruz) for a dinner shoe-horned into a short weekend filled to the brim With "obligations"...hitting the Yelp site, I put in a halfway area (Mt View w/ a 5 mile range)...checked the 2 and 3 $ symbols and then punched the search by ratings...I cruised the resulting list and came to The Laos Altos Grill!! BINGO!!  what a great spot...JUST RIGHT!!  they gave me a 5:45 rez at 3 the same afternoon!!...just enough time for a shower and squeeze over the hill before the 5pm traffic ...food was excellent...service, harried but very competent...for as packed as it got (and this was just a Thursday night!!) we were able to visit comfortably...  they had music but not blasting...lots of easy parking...great crowd...my guests were so pleased with the fish and I had the rib-eye...total dinner bill for 5 with drinks and 18% tip was just under $200!!  FAB!!!  Did I mention that the place is really just a beautiful spot to have dinner??  anyway, FIVE STARS and sooo worth it!!  Like AH-nold sayz:  "I'll be baa-a-ah-ck!!"

hands down my favorite place in the bay area, outside of SF. we've been here so many times we've gotten the ordering down to an art.. let me share my findings with you today. for appetizers, start with the dip duo; two delicious piles of goodness, one a cheese dip that's out of this world, the other an avocado dip that just can't get any better. they never bring out enough tortilla chips the first time round though.. their deviled eggs are AMAZING, and their cornbread is authentic and delicious. next are the main courses.. and there's NO reason to be creative here. I guarantee you the beef ribs are among the best you will ever have in your entire life.  I also guarantee you that the burger is among the best you will ever have, so the most elementary split is the Burger/Ribs combo, split with a friend. If you want to get a bit more creative, the steaks are awesome, the prime rib sandwich is tasty, and the ahi tuna is VERY solid. you'd think at this point there's no more goodness to go around, but you'd be wrong; their sides are just as amazing as their main dishes: best fries i've ever had, best coleslaw i've ever had, and damn solid mashed potatoes. Oh, and I almost forgot: NO CORKAGE FEE! Bring plenty of your own wine. For desert....oreo......cookie.....icecream.... I love you Los Altos Grill.

I ate here with my husband last night and it was really good. Everything we ordered was good with the exception of my "hacked" chicken salad. We had the prime rib sandwich. It was really good. The prime rib was pink and the dipping sauce was hot which made each bite nice and hot since the sandwich comes out warm. The only thing we wished was a little different was the bread to be more toasted bc it was a little soggy. We first had this sandwich at Rutherford Grill in Napa and although it was not as good as we remembered, it was still excellent. The grilled artichoke was sooo good too. Just the right amount salt to make it tasty. The bbq ribs here were really really good too. Better than Rutherford grill. There is plenty of meat on each of the ribs and the bbq sauce was yummy. The Spanish rice we got on the side was also very good. The mashed potato and fries were only ok. My chicken salad was only ok too. I did not like the tortilla chips in it and the dried dates. The chicken in the salad was also cold instead of being warm like the last time I had it. Overall, this is a very solid restaurant and we will be back.

I went here because I heard it was an exact copy of a restaurant I love in Napa (same owner, menu, etc.) called the Rutherford Grill.  Well, the place is the same, the menu is the same, but the food is not close.  I ordered the artichoke appetizer and it was as good as the original at Rutherford.  However, I also always order the ribs and when I received my order, it was half the size and the quality was about 1/2 as good.  When I got to the third of four rids (at Rutherford, you get an entire rack), the rib was cold (refrigerator cold).  I didn't want to return it as I had eaten two already, so I just mentioned it to the waiter.  He was a VERY good waiter by the way and it's not his fault the kitchen messed up and he actually made the restaurant tolerable.  He insisted I take a few ribs home and brought me a doggie bag.  Anyway, even the homemade cole slaw and mashed potatoes that come as sides weren't nearly as good as the Rutherford Grill.  We had the banana cream pie dessert, which was very good.  My guest had the roast chicken and said it was very good.  Overall, it's ok, but if I compare it to the Rutherford Grill, it comes up way short on the rib department. One last comment, bar was packed and there were 4 or 5 bartenders and yet it took a kind old lady sitting at the bar to get someone's attention for a drink (15 minutes to get one glass of wine and a diet coke).  The bartenders seemed unaware of their surroundings and don't look up to see who may need help next when delivering an order.

Houston's was one of my favorite restaurants in LA & my husband thinks their prime rib was better than Lawry's, so after moving back to San Jose, I was disappointed to learn that the only Houston's was in S.F. Then I found out Los Altos Grill belonged to the same restaurant group as Houston's & having to look at their menu online, even the food offered was similiar so I was eager to try it! We ordered the Ahi Tuna salad, the portion is smaller, I wish there were more greens, and prime rib, still one of the best we've had, nice & tender, not at all overcooked, especially when my husband likes them cooked blue. The Roast chicken was good as well, very juicy & the spanish rice that came with it was delicious, full of flavors, I can't comment on the corn bread that we ordered simply b/c I was too full. The service was nice although the waiter had messed up our order & was forgetful, but we didn't mind. The bill was very reasonable, having to bring our own bottle of wine w/o being charged corkage fee was a definite plus! I will go back, again & again! :)

our party of 4 showed up at 7:45pm, 15 minutes before our 8:00pm reservation time. we did not get seated until 8:35!  Why even have reservations when you aren't going to honor them? that was the first of many bad things to happen this night at Los Alto Grill...... we got seated. our server was rude and had a pretty bad attitude right from the get go. i will leave her name out, but if any of the managers or owners see's this review and wants specifics, i'll be more than glad to share that info with them.  we ordered appetizers and drinks: the salmon poke, grilled artichokes, and deviled eggs. drinks ordered were jack and coke, champagne, merlot, and chilled grey goose. the appetizers took roughly 30 minutes to arrive at the table, however, we got our drinks in about 10 minutes (which was nice). the salmon poke was disgusting. the grilled artichokes were over cooked, but the deviled eggs were decent.  then we ordered our entrees. 1 prime rib (medium well), 1 salmon, 2 ribeye specials (medium rare, and rare).   Now , here comes the part that really made the rating a 1 star....... My date, who ordered the prime rib, medium well, gets her plate put in front of her, and the prime rib is bright pink, and dripping w/ blood. She asked me "this isn't medium well, is it?" of course not! So we all waited for the waitress to walk around our area, so we could call her and have the prime rib cooked to medium well.  This took about 10 minutes, and we all were waiting for her plate to come back, so we could all start eating.  The waitress tried to argue w/ my date that she ordered it medium rare. WHY? We know WHAT we ordered and HOW we wanted it prepared! DO NOT argue w/ the customers. Just take accountability for your mistake, and make it right w/o giving any attitude! When the prime-rib finally arrived for the 2nd time, that is when my friend's date took a bite out of her salmon. She almost vomitted. The fish was rubbery and undercooked. We called the waitress over, again, and told her we wanted to change the salmon to a prime rib , medium rare.  So, there we were , again, waiting for her prime rib to come out, so we could start eating........ The dish that arrived at the table was not a prime rib....it was a rib-eye....but since we already waited so long to eat, she just accepted the ribeye, so we could start eating.  So, when I took a bite of my rare, rib-eye, it was not even room temperature anymore, due to all the waiting, so I asked the waitress to stick it on the grill a little bit to warm it up. Reluctantly, she told me she would ask the chef if this could be done. So, now, it's almost 10pm, and we finally got our dishes in front of us to eat. None of us were really in the mood to eat anymore, so we just ordered more drinks. The more the waitress would come around, the bitchier she got. It got to the point where I really wanted to just stand up and give her a piece of my mind, but I thought better of it, and just decided that I was going to write this review instead. I will give the manager and owner ONE chance to make up for  this terrible experience!  albertrtsai@yahoo.com

I have tried this place only once and most likely will not be going back.  I ordered the Bangers and Mash which is mash potatoes and sausages.  The potatoes were tasty but a bit dry.  The sausages that arrived were not cooked through and was still cold in the center.  I ate one bite of it and did not get sick the following day.  The waiters were happy to cook it again, but did not remove the item from the tab either.  Overall, besides the uncooked sausage, everything was decent.  Nothing special.  There was a live music band inside.  Overall, I wouldn't go back unless I have to.

i just love this place when i get the chance to go there. i would have given this place 4 stars but over last few years seems more of the regular houston's menu has made it here so now it get the full 5 from me. the hacked chicken salad and the tortilla soup are what make this place for me. i've eaten houston's for over 20 years and suspect chili's stole their chicken enchilada soup from them. menu is new american and portions are large. i think and it's all good and pricey and worthy of somewhat special meals. it's loud and informal but i think it's best for smaller groups. the houston's restaurants outlet is franchise food but i think it's the best franchise restaurant in the usa.

I typically like the other restaurants in this chain, but the night I ate here I had to wait 20 minutes after arriving (with a reservation on a Wednesday!).  Then, they were out of the veggie burger, and being a vegetarian, my only other option was the vegetable platter which was nothing special.  And to end things off, I thought I would enjoy a sundae....too bad they were out of it, too.  They must restock food on Thursday.  I will never go on a Wednesday again, and probably won't go back period.

I love this place and eat there 2-3 times a month.  Love love loooooooove the ribs--big, meaty, beef ribs that are sliced from the prime rib and roasted crispy. It's always standing room only and you have to wait 20-30 minutes for a table so I like to get there early.  Great place to people-watch as THE PLACE IS SO NOISY YOU HAVE TO SHOUT  if you sit at the bar.  The service is impeccable.

Toto, we're not in Los Altos anymore. That is what comes to mind as soon as you step in to Los Altos Grill, formerly Banderas.  From open to close, it is packed in with a lively and mature crowd. There is always at the very least a half hour wait, and that is if you are lucky. But every single night many people are ready and willing to wait, for Los Altos Grill is worth it. The oval bar in the middle of the restaurant is the central attraction, with people couples and business associates sitting shoulder to should while the friendly and capable bartenders keep their glasses full Once you are seated, the service is simply superb. Each and every time you visit, you can expect it to be friendly, efficient, and flawless, like a perfectly choreographed dance. The menu never changes, and the quality never does either. The menu is full of hearty meat dishes and is accompanied by a few fish specials each night. For an appetizer, the corn bread and the artichoke are a must. The pan-cooked corn bread is makes for a sweet, golden crust with a moist, crumbly center. It is full of flavor, with pieces of kernel and pepper in it. The artichoke is cooked over the grill with some simple lemon and garlic, making an ordinarily lackluster vegetable memorable. The dip complements it perfectly. The roasted chicken is one of classic dishes. These winged birds cooked rotisserie style greet you as you walk up to the door. The meat is fresh, moist and cooked to a perfect golden brown. It is served over a pilaf rice and with a cooked tomato on the side. Another classic is the cheeseburger. Many could argue this is the best burger they have ever had. How do they make this American classic stand out from the rest? It is a simple no frills burger, with each and every element adding to the burger. The burger is juicy and thick. The bun is fluffy and fresh, but sturdy enough to stay together as the burger is devoured. The American cheddar drapes over the entire paddy. But perhaps why people keep going back is for the desert. Their homemade Oreo is something to write home about. Two Oreo disks (a perfect portion for splitting) are made with a thick Oreo crust and Oreo ice cream. The cookies sit in a shallow pool of a rich espresso sauce. To top it off is a dollop of freshly made whipped cream, which is barely sweetened. The helps to balance the strong espresso. The menu at Los Altos Grill may be full of simple American classics, but each dish is prepared to such perfection and served by a knowledgably and warm staff that it impossible to not walk out that door satisfied.

We recently had a horrible experience at this restaurant.  I've given it 3 stars only for our previous experiences.  We've dined here numerous times and although it is extremely busy on a weekend night, we've always felt it was worth the wait.  You just need to go in knowing you'll wait, order a drink and an appetizer and try to find a place to sit (we usually go outside).  We decided to take our 16 year son old this Saturday night since we thought he would really enjoy the food.  We got the usual 60 minute wait time which was no surprise.  Then we were seated and placed our orders.  We all ordered seafood which comes with a vegetable side.  The service was extremely slow.  When the food arrived, the vegetables were inedible.  I mean, rock hard.  They had the appearance of being cooked but they were raw and tasteless.  The fish was very bland as well.  No condiments, nothing.  Our waiter came back to check on us when we had eaten about 1/2 of our fish and we told him about the vegetables.  He asked if he could bring something else but our entrees were almost eaten.  We asked for some french fries for our son cause a small piece of fish wasn't going to do it for him.  At this point our waiter just appeared to feel awkward and brought us our check.  It was awful.  We came home hungry.  If you have to wait an hour for a table the food better come to the table cooked (at least!).   I doubt we will return. Update:  Had to come back and say that manager contacted us via email and asked us to come back for another try with a $50 gift card.   That was totally unexpected and I was impressed that they would go to that level to be sure their customers are satisfied.  I would still avoid weekend nights and just go alone with the hubby since it's tough on kids to wait that long for dinner.  It would be great if the would take reservations!

The food at the Los Altos Grill was good, and there is a really nice jazz band that plays there on Wednesdays. Beware though: when leaving a tip, do not believe the "helpful" tip calculations of 15%, 18%, and 20% at the bottom of your bill. These have been calculated on the food AND on the tax. If you go by them, just know that you are paying tip on the tax. We complained to the management that this is a dishonest way of getting people to pay higher tips than they intend to do. They made no apologies and made it clear they intend to continue this practice.

Chose this restaurant for my husbands 50th birthday, and made reservations two weeks prior letting them know it was a very special occasion.  We showed up five minutes early and were told we would have to wait 20 minutes.  Twenty minutes turned into an hour.  They had grossly overbooked!!  There was an older group (in their 80's) with the same reservation time and same number of people that had been waiting even longer than us that finally took a table outside (and it was a cool evening).   I realize there was not a lot they could do at that time, but it was very very disappointing.  The food and service once we were finally seated was very good.  It's unfortunate that the experience was overshadowed by poor planning on the restaurant's part.

As Jerry Seinfeld once said, the most important part of a reservation is holding the reservation.  My husband and I have been frequent diners at the Los Altos Grill.  We live close by and have enjoyed the walk to the Grill, the food and the atmosphere.  We have been frustrated with the less than friendly attitude of the host staff on several occasions, however our recent experience was the worst yet.  We had a reservation for a party of 8 (yes, I realize that is a large group).  Four of us arrived an hour prior to the reservation time and checked in.  Our entire party arrived well before the scheduled reservation time, and the host staff was told that we were all there.  Sometime later, one of our group was told there was a slight delay and one complimentary appetizer was brought to us (yes-1 appetizer for 8 people).  Two hours after we had arrived (which was one hour after our reservation time), I asked the host staff about the status of being seated and was given a snotty, condescending attitude and treated as if the more than one hour delay was my fault.  One of the hostesses let it slip that another party had insisted on being seated at our table earlier in the evening, which had delayed those parties with reservations from being seated on time.  She also said to me that it was the holidays and what did I expect them to do?  Well...what I do expect is for reservations to be honored, to be treated with courtesy, and to be told honestly what the expected seating time might be.  Had we been told up front that there was a long delay we might have decided to go someplace else (but I guess they didn't want us to do that).  Because of this experience, it is unlikely that I will be returning to the Los Altos Grill again, and will only recommend it to those who are willing to put up with the poor, condescending attitude of the host staff.

pros: nice decor, lots of wood, warm, cozy, attentive service in general cons:  2 out of 4 meals were largely inedible.  one had to be sent back b/c the fish special was almost completely raw inside (sea bass).  The waiter even had a grimace when he saw it.  A steak ordered medium well was almost as rare as you can get and cold in the middle.   Hence the two stars - if they can't get what they're known for right - there must be some underlying issues.   Also, the response was pretty casual to the blatant mistake on the fish and no manager apology or other comp to try to make it right.  Almost like it was no big deal.   Pass on this restaurant

Great place. I liked how the kitchen was out in the open for everyone to view. We had a very nice server and was very helpful. We ordered 2 of the prime rib french dips that were the best french dips we have ever had, corn bread and a caesar salad which was really good with their home made corn bread croutons.

The prices have continued to creep up over the past 10 years so it is not as alluring as it used to be.  The cornbread still rocks but the wait staff seems intent on turning tables as quickly as possible. Overall vibe and quality outstanding but pretty pricey to be seated and out in 30 minutes.

Apparently the economy is improving and the wait for a table at Los Altos Grill has increased exponentially!  Granted it's the only decent restaurant in downtown Los Altos, but a 60-75 minute wait for a table at 6pm on a weeknight? No thanks!  Even the bar area is packed with hungry customers hovering behind those seated at the bar, impatient vultures waiting to swoop on a vacated bar stool. So much for our fav local restaurant!

went here a few weeks ago, third time that i've tried going there for dinner but the first time i waited for a table. (6pm on a friday) didn't end up getting a table but was able to order an app and some drinks at the bar while we waited and ended up belly'ing up to the bar. so obviously the first downfall is that it is very busy and we've never been able to get a reservation. the atmosphere was nice and the price was reasonable. had prime rib and it was ok....it was cooked a little to rare for my liking and I they did give me the option to get another peice that was more cut. I think the might have just had an off day because the guy next to me said he'd been there before and had better prime rib (he actually returned his). other than that, the app (chips and dip) was great and the chicken my girlfriend had was great and so were the mashed potatos with my prime rib. would still give it another try another day to see if it was just an off day.

Awesome food.  Can't wait to go back, especially for the homemade ice cream sandwiches.

the los altos grill is located in los altos, much as ulysses s. grant is buried in grant's tomb.  with that in mind, w.h. and i found our way into the comfortable confines of this classy establishment.  unfortunately, this joint has no corkage fee, which results in booming business and long waits for tables during peak hours.  you'd think the denizens of los altos wouldn't mind coughing up a few bucks to have their wine poured for them in such a nice restaurant.  nonetheless, everything from the atmosphere (low lighting, large circular bar, exhibition kitchen) to the service (cheerful and attentive, but not intrusive) to the food was top notch.  i would say that the food is delish, but only phantom foodies use that term.  i would say that the food is to die for, but that phrase is reserved for total losers.  therefore, let me just say that everything on the menu (yes, everything!) is excellent.  my favorites include the cornbread appetizer (warm, crusty, and unctuous), the veggie burger (sweet and crunchy), the prime rib  french dip (indescribable, so i won't describe it), and the booze, most prominently their fine selection of gins.  not only did i leave the grill fully satisfied on this visit, my friend w.h. was quite pleased that she was able to keep down her dinner (with her irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance and multiple food allergies, dining out is usually an adventure for her).   in summary:  great food, great service, great atmosphere.

Service was great! We walked right in and sat down. Of course yelped before we ordered. For starters we had the deviled eggs which for me were good, but could have used a little less onions. Don't get me wrong onion lovers, but this was overkill. None the less, very tasty, and it was a decent priced appetizer. (3 bucks!) We had to get the cornbread, some southern hospitality with a little twist! I think there was some jalapeno bits in there? Whatever it was, it was good! Hot, fresh, fluffly, yet sweet....ooooh..how my mouth waters just thinking back of it. I ordered the ribs which were like everyone put it, "fall off the bone" ribs! The mash potatoes were yummalicious! The only thing that did not blow my mind was the cole slaw... Errrrr.... But boy did everything else make up for it! My friend got the prime rib which was very juicy and succulent. What I loved about what his came with was the sauce, put that bad boy on your mashed potatoes, and you are in white fluffly heaven. Did I mention our meals came as if we were trying to feed a soccer team? HUGE portions! Didn't have room for dessert, but would love to next time. Trust me, there will be a next time! Such great service that when we walked out, the hostess rushed to the door just to open it for us!

my 32nd birthday dinner gone bad. boo l.a. grill. i'm bitter. only reason we wanted to try l.a. grill was b/c k and me have been to the rutherford grill in napa. l.a. grills sister restaurant. we fell in love w/ the ahi burger and the prime rib sandwich at the rutherford. so we figured it would be just as good here. not remotely close. k's ahi (1) was chopped up and formed into a patty. it had the smell of old, stanky fish tank. the ahi burgers at rutherford was a whole ahi thats grilled. it was my bday so i ordered the special. a 14oz. rib eye (2). it was ok. didnt taste fresh. almost as if it was previously frozen. i've actually had better steaks at black angus. edible to describe it in a better word. what disturbed me was that they charged me $34 dollars for it. not worth it. i can go to costco and buy a 3 pack of prime grade rib eyes for that price. sorry to cap on you l.a. grill, but we've veto'd you for life.
