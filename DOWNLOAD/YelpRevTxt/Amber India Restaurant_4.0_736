Excellent service. I liked the presentation. The server brought out the food and served it to us even though it was it family style. Upscale ambiance with white table cloths and glass stemware for water. Colorful artwork decorating peach walls. The rooms were brightly lit and very nice. The food was flavorful, spicy, cooked well with nice textures, and reasonably portioned. The lamb ghosht and spicy chicken masala were delicious. We chased our spicy dishes with basmati rice and butter naan. Mmmm, pillowy butter naan dusted with a char from a tandoor oven. The prices were steep but worth it when you factored in the pampering service.

Good food but a bit over priced. Service can be slow and it gets unusually loud inside. Lunch is crazy busy and is served buffet style. For dinner, the scallops were really good! Then again..also pretty pricey for what you get.

Good food. Slightly over-hyped. There are many places in the neighborhood with better food and service. Food is good, but had bad experience with one of the servers there. Also I find it a bit expensive for the ambience and taste of food that it offers.

Yay. After having this in my bookmarks for so long I finally made it here for a nice girls only Dinner with Denise L And Victoria C. We decided to eat family style and order a few dishes to share: Chicken Tikka Masala,  Kerala Lamb Curry and Handi Prawn Biryani. All of which were very tasty. The Tikka Masala is somewhat different to what we get on the other side of the pond, it's a lot less spicy!! Initially it was my intent to not have any of the Handi Prawn Biryani  as I'm not a fan of Seafood but once my companions told me they could not eat it because it was too spicy I had to give it and try and I must say it was very good! The first few bites are fairly mild but then the spice kicks really in. Obviously I've become a lot more tolerable to the spice with Hubby cooking curry over the years! Both the Garlic and plain Naan were also delicious and perfect for dipping in the Curry sauce. Some useless information here.. Where the rest of the world tend to eat Indian Curry with Rice and Naan it's not the norm in India. The population of North India tend to eat their Curry with Bread alone whereas the South prefer Rice. It is very rare that both is served. Anyhow, back to Amber India... The restaurant is very clean and neatly laid out with good service and friendly front of house staff. The pricing is a little more than most of the other Indian restaurants I have been to by about 20%. I notice that they have the same pricing here as their location in Santana Row. It does get very busy here too, even when we visited on a Tuesday evening the restaurant was full so I advise booking a table in advance.

Dud. The wife has reasonably excoriated Amber.  I share her frustration if not quite her hell-hath-no-fury intensity.  A nice room, you should expect a pleasant experience for the prices charged.  But what you get is a dinner experience based on a restaurant that's doing a virtual buffet steam table assembly line in the kitchen, from which they rapidly serve you. There's the disconnect... if I wanted fast food I'd go somewhere else.   I felt like we were being controlled to a time budget, something like 41 minutes to turn our table.  We came EARLY, 5:20pm well ahead of their dinner rush.  But they still rushed us. (Shameful that we would want to take a whole hour for dinner.)   They pushed us thru the drinks, ordering, served fast, wanted to clear fast, checked to see if we'd paid while we were waiting for dessert to be delivered.  Really?  Even greasy diners have the courtesy to say, "no hurry folks, take your time" with a smile. Food - bland flavors wetted with house standard gravy. They cooked the shrimp well, but hard to point out anything I wouldn't have been just as happy with at a buffet joint. They burned someone else's nan in the kitchen, and shared the odor with the dining room.  Overall, Meh Meh Meh.  No need to return for the food.   A little baffled.  We were on the peninsula, the yelps were very good so we gave Amber a try. We had a very good meal some years ago at the Amber on Santana Row.  Maybe we got a rare bad experience, but we could see they were working all the tables the same as us.   My recommendation is take the time to go across the bay and explore the myriad of great Indian cuisines available in Fremont and surroundings.

I have been to this restaurant twice so far for lunch buffet, which has an excellent selection and extremely satisfying dishes.  One of the best indian lunch meal I've had. Early bird gets the worm.  Be there 10-15 minutes before 12 noon will ensure your sit at the table without waiting 15-30 minutes. Enjoy!!

When I think of Amber India I think of average over-hyped and over-priced food designed for a non-Indian audience. There is much better Indian food within less than a mile radius from this location and the staff at other places is much more polite than Amber staff. We were here once on a Friday and we came with our infant son who was asleep in his stroller. The looks the staff person at the front gave us and the manner in which we were asked to wait clearly stated that children aren't welcome. We were subsequently seated at a table near the back service area which was no coincidence. The food probably deserves three stars but the arrogance and pricing brings the entire experience down to less than one star.

Overall the food is typically very good.  The vegetables are very fresh.  My experience with the vegetarian entrees such as malai kofta, palak paneer, and daal has been good.  My husband has enjoyed the chicken and fish as well.  However, I had a really flavorless navratan korma there today.  It ruined my meal. I am really disappointed.

I've come here a few times -- once for the lunch buffet and the other times for dinner.  I think the food is good but not great.  The elaichi paneer and kadai chicken are my favorite dishes.  But other restaurants in the Mountain View Sunnyvale area keep me away from Amber for the most part.

Have you ever met someone who appeared sketchy on the outside, but then turned out to be generous and elegant once you got to know them? Amazing experience! I never expected this restaurant to be so good, as it's tucked away in the corner of a center filled with a chiropractic office, cleaners, and video store. I would always pass by and wonder, especially because it always looked crowded with more people waiting outside. I figured: It must be good if people are willing to wait + Yelp said so = Let's DO this. FOOD: --------- I recommend doing family style, at least for dinner. Portions are HUGE, and you will get to sample more items this way. The total for two of us with mad leftovers? $65. * GARLIC NAAN - You must get this. Who ever thought a piece of bread could contain SO much flavor? Pleasantly bursting with garlic. The butter naan was also good, but the garlic naan really stole the moment. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) * CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA - Simply divine. One of the best chicken tikka masalas I've EVER had. I was blown away by the smooth creamy flavor. We ordered this at mild spiciness, and it was perfect -- not too spicy for me and just the right amount of heat. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) * KEBALA LAMB CURRY - Really rich with thick curry, and they are able to make this completely non-spicy. Perfect with naan. This dish is pretty filling and heavy... literally the meat is super heavy. Two of us shared and I still ended up taking home about 2/3 of the dish in a box -- that sucker weighed at least a pound! Oh, how I love leftovers. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) * PISTACHIO ICE CREAM - Delicious dessert. The 'ice cream' was more like chunks of iced milk. It took a bit of effort to cut bites to eat, but was definitely worth the effort. We didn't care too much for the 'noodles' that accompanied the ice cream. The spiced flavor just didn't mesh with the sweet iced milky goodness. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) The leftovers tasted even better the next day! I made myself a delicious Lamb Currito (curry burrito). AMBIANCE: ---------------- You would never expect such a beautiful interior by judging from the outside. As soon as I entered, I noticed the luxuriantly furnished waiting area. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) The dining area was lovely as well, and very conducive to an intimate meal. -- 1. http://www.yelp.com/biz_…, 2. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… SERVICE: -------------- Attentive, friendly, and super helpful when we requested advice on what to order. The waiter was very knowledgeable on all the ingredients, flavors, and which items were his favorite versus which were the most popular. Our water glasses were never empty. Good sign! But the best sign of good service is being accommodating through thick and thin. Like the klutz I can be sometimes, I was holding my heavy box of lamb curry in a precarious way, and it toppled out of my grasp and onto the floor of the lobby. Lamb burst forth from the box all over their beautiful rug. I was mortified and stood there, in an apologetic half-shock. The host cleaned up the mess in good spirits, and then OFFERED TO REPLACE MY FOOD... that I had spilled! That was extremely generous! TIP: It seems to be much less crowded on non-prime nights of the week (Mon-Wed). On prime nights you'll definitely need a reservation. You can also call ahead to ask how long the wait might be. TIP2: Now that I've gotten to know Amber India, I know why it's so popular! I hope we become very good friends. You should become acquainted with Amber India too.

I came here with two friends on a Sunday, and we were seated more or less immediately. I ordered the Amber Dinner (Green Mixed Salad, Seekh Kebab, Palak Paneer, Tandoori Chicken, Ceylon Chicken Curry, Saffron Rice, Naan Bread, Gulab Jamun, Tea/Coffee), since I couldn't decide among the other options. It was way more food than I could eat. I didn't like the kebab, since it was a bit dry, but the rest was amazing! The palak paneer was particularly good, and both of my friends really enjoyed it as well. One of them is Indian, so I suppose his judgement should weigh more heavily than mine. The meal is really expensive, but it could easily feed two people.

This is probably the most delicious Indian food I have ever eaten. And the service was absolutely fantastic as well! My friends and I were looking for a nice place to go for dinner on a rainy Saturday evening. We called ahead to Amber India, knowing that they would likely be packed, and they told us they would take our reservation for 10 people at 7 if we could all be there by 7. It's a good thing we called in too, because the parking lot was packed as was their lobby when we got there just in the nick of time! Even though some of us had our hearts set on specific dishes, we decided to go with a family style meal. I was really interested in getting their chicken tikka masala, because that's always my go-to Indian dish of choice. Others really wanted the butter chicken and the aloo gobi. Well family style enabled us to get those dishes as well as: - Chicken masala: quite spicy! - Mirch Ka Gosht: lamb with a peppercorn sauce that was super spicy! - Handi Prawn Biryani: slightly spicy, but REALLY good, and it came with a nice cooling yogurt sauce that I used with the other spicy dishes as well - Palak paneer: I didn't try this because I don't like paneer, but others were slightly disappointed in the taste. They said it was too creamy, almost like creamed spinach. It needed more body. - Baingan Bharta: This was an eggplant dish which was slightly spicy and very tasty. The description didn't mention it, but I swear it had peas in it too! As for my chicken tikka masala, it was excellent as expected, though with more of a kick than I am used to with CTM. I thought that their butter chicken was more my style. And of course the aloo gobi did not disappoint. The cauliflower florets were perfectly cooked with just enough texture, while the potatoes were cooked well through. All of it was super flavorful and delicious. We got several sides of rice to go with all of the food. While the entree dishes themselves are deceptively large (they look so small!), the rice dishes seemed to be too small. I think we ended up having to get 4 orders total to cover the table of 10 in addition to the 4 naans we also ordered. All of the food was SO good. And I'm really glad that I got to try so many different dishes. I also got a mango lassi to accompany my meal. While the cooling yogurt and mango would have been pleasant during the meal, I found it too sweet to drink by itself. I wish I had kept it for later when the spiciness started to get to me though! Throughout the meal, our water glasses never went empty. The servers were efficient and friendly without being obtrusive. I would say that the ambiance at Amber India as well as the fabulous service really sets it apart from other Indian restaurants in the area, even the nicer ones. The food is truly delicious as well. Prices are on the higher end, but I think the overall experience justifies the increased cost. You can tell that other people think the same thing because the restaurant was packed for the majority of the evening and only started slowing down around 9:30 when we left. I'll definitely keep Amber India in mind the next time I want a really good Indian meal.

Amber India, one of my favorite places for fine Indian cuisine! ~~~~   Food   ~~~~     The food here is outstanding! I love coming here, because I know that I receive the most savory, mouthwatering dishes available. The butter chicken is to die for, and the naan bread made me want to pack my bags and move to India! The dishes cost a little above average, but you get what you pay for, and boy did I get what I paid for!     My advice for attending this restaurant: Come with a group or large party and order to share. The portions are gigantic and with 4 people sharing Amber India's conception of  "dinner for 2" we still had leftovers! I still had enough food leftover to have a tastebud-savoring lunch the next day! ~~~~   Service   ~~~~     The waiting and service at Amber India is bar-none fabulous! We were seated in a timely manner and had our drinks in no time. The waiters were very knowledgeable on all the dishes, and knew exactly what dishes we would like best to make our night great! I did call ahead and got a reservation, but on the not so busy nights such as Monday-Thursday you shouldn't have a problem with waiting in line for your seat. ~~~~   Appearance   ~~~~     Whilst you wouldn't think it from the outside, Amber India is one beautiful establishment! The seating was fabulous, the walls and ornate rugs made you think you were in one of India's palace's being served as royalty. The overall mood was very friendly, and this place is a great place for either family dinners or date nights with the spouse. ~~~~   Conclusion   ~~~~     If you aren't enjoying Amber India's famous cuisine, then you are missing out! I've recommended it to all of my friends, and they all fell in love with the place after their first time eating! The only reason I'm not giving a full 5/5 is because the prices are a little steep, but you get amazing food for the price, and alot of it to boot!

Best North Indian food in the bay area. Similar to what you would get in good restaurants in New Delhi; flavors are authentic, good service and a nice, cozy atmosphere. - Great kebabs and achari lamb! - Also, a great buffet on the weekends if you like authentic chaat (North Indian street food); not available on the regular menu.

4.5 because holy shizzle this is the best Palak Paneer I have ever had in my 23 years of gluttonous food consumption and believe me I have had a LOT of the spinachy stuff. But this was a whole new breed of dish. The texture was creamy in the most eye-rolling way, so smooth while still retaining the bright, fluffy texture of spinach puree and not the cloying heaviness of too much actual cream. The color itself was emerald, fresh, and even, beautifully presented with juicy chunks of paneer. The texture of paneer was more akin to fresh mozzarella than the usual denser variety. And the flavors! Perfect balance of spices, nothing overwhelming, nothing left to be desired. Licked up every last speck of green and left the steel bowl shining. We also ordered the the Paneer Elaichi Pasanda (cardamom paneer cooked in almond sauce), which I had never seen at other restaurants. We were wary about ordering so much paneer but the variety in this dish was very different but equally if not even more delicious than that in the palak. The paneer here came in large flat pieces, was slightly denser, but so creamy and tender. The sauce was the perfect harmony of spicy, sweet, a little bit of tangy, and all sorts of wonderful. Hummmmed and Mmmmmed my way through this one as well. Bread-wise, we got the paneer goat cheese naan (yes, more paneer), and the spinach broccoli roti. I would say their bread here is not as good as other places but still, they made excellent vehicles for the fantastic curry dishes.  Drinks here are also sweet and strong. Lastly, I want to mention the service which was EXCELLENT. Everyone was very attentive, polite, helpful, and quick. Amber India is definitely more "upscale" for dinner despite having the usual lunch buffet at lunch and a wonderful place for a classy night out. That said, will definitely be back for lunch sometime for some AYCE action of the Palak Paneer of my dreams.

Very disappointing overall in so many ways. Do you want to feel rushed out the door? Neither do I. From the moment we were seated, at 5:20 pm no less, we were hurried and harried. One minute in we were asked for our drink order. Hello, i can't read your selection list that fast. Settled on the minty mohito, sweet and under-liquored, underwhelming. Of course the drink was delivered pronto, poured out of a pitcher?, and combined with a take your order request, again. No you can't and quit bugging me! We paired a goa-style prawn curry with a peppercorn spiked lamb. Basmati , palak paneer and garlic naan rounded out the meal. More missed opportunities here. The prawns were large and well cooked, but the sauce was bland. No acid notes, barely a coconut flavor, just brown. Same for the lamb. We were warned it would be spicy but, alas, not, more brown flavor. I think the food was prepared buffet style and the brown sauce was ladled onto everything. Naturally, the food arrived in the time it takes to fill the very small serving dishes. Speaking of portions, most items are $17-20 or more, very poor value. The palak paneer was the tarnished star of the meal, butter the predominant flavor. I love butter but i like some spice with that buttered spinach. I wondered, again, is their a flavor vacuum in the kitchen, all hint of spice removed from the dish before delivery. Does spice slow down service? Unceremoniously , while i was still eating, the check was plopped down. No less than 4 servers harried us , all seemingly determined to turn our table. When i arrived i thought the atmosphere was serene and beautiful, by meal's end i saw the restaurant for what it was. A conveyor belt style of food service with bustling, distracting waiters trying to move me out. Hurry up and buy! Feeling feisty, i decided to try the pistashio kulfi. Don't. It is saffron/pistashio kulfi, i have bought these ice milks before and the pistashio is good, the combo with saffron too one note. Four ice cubes of kulfi sit atop the galub jamun orange sauce and some soggy pasta. Truly an unappetizing presentation. Let me sum it up. If you want good indian food, don't go here! It's a fleecing you will be served. Bombay garden buffet down the street is far better, even the amber cafe owned by the same operation is better. Too bland, too rude, too bustley and too bad!

Some of the best Indian food I've had in a while. The sauce had the perfect amount of spice. My friend ordered these weird fried dough balls that were bigger than softballs but completely hollow. They tasted great and work well for scooping up food, but I spent most if the time trying to figure out how they did it.

Excellent, fresh food, great variety for lunch buffet, clean though a little cramped at times. What I liked most about Amber was that the curries were not overly oily or salty - a hallmark of most buffets.  My theory is that most Indian buffets over-salt their food so the patrons drink a lot of water and fill themselves up on water.   While the selection of entrees is not as extensive as some other Indian buffets, the food is extremely tasty and tastes quite authentic.  Buffet selections are spiced delicately and do not overpower the palate.  Ordering a la carte does present the opportunity of having it cooked to your spice tolerance and I encourage you to do so - the chefs will not disappoint.  Both locations (Mountain View and Santana Row) offer a good but not overwhelming selection of a la carte items on their menus.  The specials are always good and if you're unfamiliar with Indian food, please feel free to ask your waiter - they are usually well educated and will give you a good explanation of the different entrees. One complaint I do have about the Mountain View location is that the location of the buffet makes for a very sub-optimal flow of people past the buffet.  But given the design of the restaurant, there is little they can do to improve it.  It can get very annoying during the busy lunch hour crowd so plan to be a bit patient! Dinner is always a great experience here.  It is rarely crowded or noisy so it is a good place for both a business dinner or a quiet date.  Good ambiance, a fairly good wine list and really excellent food combine for a good but not inexpensive experience.   ~ 4 stars overall.  Great food, really great people and great value for money.  Amber is one of my go-to places and I have yet to be disappointed! # 288

This was my first real foray into Indian cooking.  My son eats at Amber India a lot and loves Indian food so I thought lets go for it.  We ordered a lot for 3 just to try different dishes.   I also wanted to take a lot home for lunch the next day. We started with the Aleppy Fried Prawns Tender Prawns marinated with Chili Flakes in a rice flour batter served with a peanut sauce $11.95.  The shrimp were a bit soggy, not crispy. Along with the shrimp, we ordered a bowl of the Cucumber Raita  Grated cucumber in yogurt sauce $ 3.95  which was odd in that it was very liquidey but we had no way to eat it.  With forks?  LOL   Next out came the Butter Chicken Shredded tandoori chicken in a tomato, butter and fenugreek sauce $17.95 which was great though so much more sauce than there was chicken.  The chicken was very tender.  My son had to order the Chicken Tikka Masala Chicken tikka cooked in a mild tomato sauce  $17.95 which was similar to the first dish but the chicken was dry and only a few chunks of chicken compared to lots of sauce.  Next was a spicy lamb dish but I am unsure of which one.   I liked it.  This had some potato in it but again more sauce than substance.  And the Palak Paneer  Spinach with farmer's cheese and spices $14.95 was good too.  We had an order of Garlic and Basil Naan Naan with garlic and basil  $ 2.95 which was great to eat more of all the sauces left but I could not taste garlic or basil.   For dessert we got Bengali Rasgulla Farmers cheese dumplings, rose flavored syrup 4.50.  I think this may be an acquired taste.   The reason I am giving this review only 2 stars instead of the 3 stars the food probably deserves is that we had ordered tons of food for 3 people with the idea of taking it home for lunch the next day.  Twice I asked for another bowl of rice wrapped to go since none was left from the too small bowl we had ordered for 3.  I expected to pay for it but the manager? came right over when he heard me order it and told the young man not to charge me for it.   Well, I got NO rice! So today I was left with all this Indian food which is mostly sauce and no rice.  Made me very unhappy! Would I go back?  I would have especially to try dishes that were not mostly sauce but not now.  I am still mad.  LOL!  I hear there is a great Indian place right across the street we will try next.

This is not the great Amber India I remember. It's been a couple years since my family and I have eaten at Amber India.  All of our past experiences were great. On a whim last night, we decided to eat there.  4 entrees later, we left disappointed. Our meals paled compared to prior dishes eaten there and didn't match some of the better Indian dishes we've had at places such as the Gaylord and Turmeric. The mulligatawny soup was watered down.  The tandoori chicken was bland.  The rice was unusually dry.  The navratan korma lacked flavor.  The saving grace was the butter chicken... but then I've never met a butter chicken dish I didn't like. If not for the super attentive service, nice ambience, and yes (of course) the butter chicken, I would have given our dinner 2 stars.  It's a far cry from 4.5 stars from the past.

Great, excellent fresh curries and other goodies.  Their tandoori chicken is juicy (not usually my experience, unfortunately).  Their curries are spicy and delicious.  Their goat curry is fabulous (even though I feel so guilty eating it.)   Naan is piping hot.   They had wheat vermicelli pudding, instead of rice pudding, which was delicious but a strange texture.  I had two little bowls of the stuff.   Price = $16.00 for weekend lunch.  (I think weekdays are usually $13 for lunchtime.) Service = friendly, efficient.

The Peshawari Chicken sizzler was great. For the entree we ordered Ceylon chicken and Dum aloo. Both dishes were lacking in taste. Dum aloo seemed more like gravy of tomato mixed with kofta. Both dishes were below expectation especially given the high price of each of them. Overall seems like an overpriced Indian restaurant. Yelp should mark this restaurant as $$$.

After a long hiatus I returned to insanely expensive food and RUDE, Snooty attitude from the self declared "general manager" who basically told me I was lying when he got in my face and said, "those people had reservations" in the rudest most condescending way possible. I told him that I had spoken to "those people" and they had told me they didn't have reservations and who had eaten and left by the time we were seated. The bottom line is that the dude who took my name totally forgot to call me in from outside (My friend and I took turns going in to check and remind him that we were sitting on their outside bench waiting). He looked pale and stunned when we walked in and he sat us immediately but not before the fat, obnoxious, bossy dude wanted to give us his attitude. Instead of apologizing and offering a drink, dessert, anything, the management did nothing. Horrible-this type of attitude and poor service shouldn't be tolerated ever but when you are paying $6.00 for naan and almost $18.00 for chicken, it's unimaginable. There are too many awesome indian restaurants in Silicon Valley with humble wonderful staff to ever deal with this place again.

I go to Amber Dhara regularly so i was eager to try Amber India since it's closer to my house. I would say that the food, service and atmosphere is just a notch under Amber Dhara. That being said it's still wonderful. We had the rogan josh and butter chicken. Both were delicious.   We weren't really sure who our waiter was since several people attended our table. They were all nice but when we were looking for refills or an extra order of naan even they weren't sure who we should ask. I would probably come back but I prefer the PA location.

Vegetable Samosa- Crispy patties stuffed with spicy potatoes and peas Gobhi Manchurian -Crisp Fried Cauliflower Florets, green onion, soy,garlic, sweet & sour sauce Butter Chicken- Shredded tandoori chicken in a tomato, butter and fenugreek sauce Everything was spot and good, service was always good. Yum!

I have to admit that this place is quite decent in terms of their food. The food is very flavorful and the menu is quite extensive. They have excellent service!!! I haven't had anyone physically serve me food in a while! But, this place is not cheap. The bf and I went here for dinner last Sunday and ordered 1 plain naan, 1 garlic naan, Chicken Tikka Masala, and this other vegetarian dish. The total bill was over $40!! What really irked me was that they have pretty small portion sizes. Just a tad disappointed about that. If I really want Indian food next time, I think I might skip this place go to Naan n Masala or Shalimar instead. The food is just as good, but definitely leaves a bitter taste in my mouth and regret after forking over all that cash from my wallet for the bill.

Arrived around 7pm last night and waited for 45 minutes. So make a reservation if you want to eat here. The four of us shared: Veg samosa: 3.5/5 not bad, decent size Spinach Paneer: 3/5 the cheese was very odd in texture, not what I am used to. Chicken Tandoori: 3/5 surprisingly not dry, a bit on the bland side Butter Chicken: 5/5 the best dish period, very buttery Scallops: 2.5/5 don't let the hubby order seafood at an Indian restaurant. Pistachio ice cream: 2/5 didn't taste like pistachio, wouldn't order it again. Service: 5/5 I was surprised when they served the food to my plate! Kept our waters refilled. Bottom line: Good service however the food lacks some of the flavorful Indian spices.

YUM. I came here with my co-workers (17 of us!) for a late lunch at 1:45, so it wasn't really crowded. I love Indian buffets and this place was really yummy! It's definitely one of the fancier Indian buffets I've been to and the waiters were really quick on refilling our drinks but they also seemed to be in a rush to get us out. They were clearing out our tables while we were still sitting and talking, but not a big deal since we were all done eating. The food was so good and there were actually a lot of things I've never tried before (unfortunately I'm really bad at remembering the names of the food...). Some of my co-workers were guiding me on what to get because I usually just grab stuff and put it on my plate, but I definitely had a good food experience here! I will come back another time. :D

This place had really good reviews and we had good expectations when we went there, with it being located in the Silicon Valley and all. But the experience was so mediocre I am surprised people gave it 4 stars.  First of all the food was super expensive and it can easily cost over $50 for two people. The food is just mediocre I had way better Indian food for less than half the price. Naan was ordinary and the poori I ordered was at the best a Meh. The matter paneer was good but again for the price its just OK. I also saw that they had Kerala lamb curry which said its made of coconut milk and trust being a Keralite I never had lamb curry with coconut milk in my life and I don't even know what Cochin scallops are.

We must have eaten the same day as another reviewer who got food poisoning because....we got food poisoning. This was the one and only day we decided to dine here and shelled out over $100 for our spread. We ate a mixed grill tandoori, mushroom dish, lamb curry, kir, and a cauliflower appetizer that I can't remember the name of. The "return" on our investment came the next morning. I called to mention our abdominal ills and the manager suggested that it must have been the strong spices. Us white people clearly aren't used to Indian food and the intense abdominal cramps and watery poop are probably just a symptom of acclimating to this "strong spice". He offered a free buffet lunch. Uh. Thanks.

I came here for dinner with a party of 8 expecting good service and good food, and guess what, I got neither. So I ordered butter naan and Barrah Kebab. When the naan came I notice that one side of the naan is completely burned and black, so I asked the water if he can change it for me, and here is the reply: oh, this is how it is supposed to be , it is supposed to be burned, look at all your friend's, theirs are burned too... !!!!! well, do you know that burned bread is also a health concern? Also, you charged 2.95 dollars for butter naan and I can't expect mine to be at least not burned???? He did change it for me, not happily though. Then the Barrah Kebab was on a sizzling hot plate, which is fancy, but guess what, the hot plate is so sizzling hot, the meat is burned too.... this time i just don't bother to complain. Here is another lame part, we got the check, hmmm, for a bill of 162 dollars they charged more than 16 dollars of tax! I know I live in California, and the tax is high, but I don't think they are actually 10% ( 8.375% to be exact). It is not that much money, but what they did was just really lame... Anyways, never going back there again.

This is a tough decision for me, between 1-2 stars. So to start off, we got take out and did not dine in. We got Hara Kebab,  Rogan Josh,  Ceylon Chicken Curry , Bengali Rasgulla(dessert),Rasmalai(dessert). I must say that i do not have budget constraints and do not mind pricey food. The food we got was really REALLY bland. The lamb was dry and sauce was just blah. The chicken was OK, but really just assorted pieces of chicken bone mostly. It seems like they took the left overs of the chicken and made this dish. Even the rice was not impressive and contained pieces of herbs and spices that can make you gag if you dont notice them on time. The 2 desserts we got are really the same exact thing. One with different sauce then the other (not mentioned in the menu). Overall, for the price they charge i think 1 star is even too much. I will never eat there again. I can not understand these good reviews and i strongly suggest you read other reviews before you decide going. It's so over rated, dont get suckered like we did. There are better places all over Mountain View.

Such a gem. Doesn't look like much -- in a less-than-attractive small shopping center on El Camino in Mountain View -- but don't judge a book by its cover.

I came here with a friend on Friday night and was blown away. This little place is tucked away in a nondescript shopping center on El Camino, but you walk in to the most wonderful mouth-watering smells, and the first thing you see is two walls lined with "best restaurant" awards. Very reassuring! We sat and were quickly greeted. I was impressed at the server pulling out my chair and handing me my dinner napkin. Chivalry goes a long way with me! We ordered butter chicken and tandoori chicken/lamb and shared both dishes. The server anticipated this and brought separate dinner plates and served each of us a portion of both dishes. We ate and talked, and man...that food was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I only had a mild heart attack at the price for about a second before I remembered we'd ordered appetizers too. Definitely a little spendy, but SO worth it. I will DEFINITELY be back.

I celebrated my birthday here and I had a wonderful experience! I'm super picky with Indian food and I know that the food has gotten a LOT better over the years! This place has been around for so long it has to be excellent :) Decor - AMAZING! Perfect for a romantic evening, a birthday gathering, a friendly reunion and plenty of other occasions. Really accommodating for large groups! Just be sure to make a reservation Price - for an Indian restaurant, this place is definitely on the pricy side and the quantity is smaller than other restaurants. The quality and the ambiance is great though so for a special occasion it's well worth the price! Service - friendly, very attentive, gave excellent recommendations, easy to make reservations with and they didn't make a fuss when we were 15 minutes late! Keep in mind portions are kind of small, especially for large parties ordering appetizers and planning on sharing! Might have to order doubles... Things to order: -Gobi Manchurian -Reshmi Tikka {this was decent, not fantastic though) -Butter Chicken (didn't blow me away like I expected because it was a little tangy but it was still delicious and satisfying and I'd order it again) -Butter Naan -Cucumber and Yogurt Raita (comes with biryanis) -Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani (nice and spicy!) -Navratan Korma -Ras Malai (my brother's favorite dessert!) -Kulfi Falooda (yummy rose flavored ice cream with noodles dessert) What NOT to order (these weren't terrible, but they weren't worth the price and I wouldn't order it again): -Vegetable Pakora -Jal Jeera (spicy drink) -Malai Kofta Overall, very pleasant experience! Hopefully we'll be back for many more special occasions with my family and friends :)

The butter chicken lives up to the hype, but the restaurant is pretty pricey and we didn't feel that the experience quite justified the prices.   We shared a vegetable samosa appetizer ($5.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) and each had the famous butter chicken ($17.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) and an order of rice ($2.95) and split an order of naan ($2.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) While I knew it was pricier than other places, I didn't realize how much so.  The butter chicken is $18 as compared to $13-15 at a few other restaurants we have been to in the area.  However, since rice and naan are not included, the total for the complete entree is $24 pre-tax and tip.  That's pretty hefty.  The charge for naan isn't so bad, but $3 for rice seems especially high to me, especially given that the portion of rice we were given for 2 was barely enough for one of us.  We each took home half our butter chicken and we had no rice left over. That said, the butter chicken was fantastic.  It was the best I've had anywhere.  It had a rich, creamy sauce and tender, white meat chicken.  Usually I find the sauce slightly too sweet or too tomatoey or too something, but this struck just the right balance of all the flavors.   Oddly, my husband had the same dish and his sauce tasted distinctly different than mine (we each prefered our own but could both taste the difference).  Strangely enough, the same thing happened to us at Amber Dhara, their sister restaurant in Palo Alto.   The samosas were very good too, with a nice filling to crust ratio.   We both found the ambiance nice.  We were placed a table for 2 tucked into a corner of the dining room, so it was quite private.  The service, while friendly, was a little awkward and overly formal.  Also, although the food came out very quickly, they could have been more attentive about refilling our water glasses. As an aside, I think the reputation of this place as having super mild food is a little undeserved (whether you view that as a good or bad thing depends on your perspective, I suppose).  I freely admit that I like my Indian food mild, but I didn't find it especially so here.  Yes, the butter chicken was mild but it tends to be anywhere, and it had a little kick to it.  The samosas were quite spicy, I'd say at least average compared to other restaurants I've tried in the Bay Area.  I know several people who swear they don't like Indian food because its too spicy, but will eat here.  That seems strange to me as it doesn't seem much milder than the food in other local Indian restaurants. Anyway, I would definitely like to come back for the wonderful butter chicken but I think next time we'll probably do the lunch buffet which is a more reasonably priced $15 ($16 on weekends). (Best __: Best Butter Chicken)

Have been wanting to try this location vs Santana row. Location is hard to find, however the decor inside the restaurant is lovely. Let's talk about food. I have a feeling lunch would have been better to try out, however the food at dinner was not bad. Rogan gosht-very well done. The eggplant was good. I love bindi masala, however this could have been cooked a bit more& needed more masala. Naan was okay. The Hyderabadi biryani had great taste, however could have been cooked a bit more. I'll try the lunch buffet next. Just like the other reviews, this place is pricey vs the amount of food you get.

It was ok. + Authentic + Good food + Quality service This type of food is not the most exciting to me. A lot of well made curries eaten with rice and flat breads... Hard to explain but my experience was that it wasn't "fun". I guess my preference when eating this type of food is less fancy and more "bistro"-ey. I would not come back by my own choice. Anyway, if you really like Indian food... Go here. If you're just looking for someplace new... I say search harder.

FInally, I like one of the Amber restaurants. Relaxed atmosphere, great food and very reasonable pricing make this the best amongst the chain of restuarants under the same flagship.

Been meaning to write a review about Amber India.  The first time we went, we had a large group of 9 people.  We made the reservation in advance.  We arrived early and had to wait for some time, but was is insignificant.  Once we were seated however, that was it for over 10 minutes.  No one came to bring us water, no one came to take drink orders.  This was a Friday night, the restaurant was not that busy.  Nearly 20 minutes before drink orders were taken. People would walk by, we would try to get their attention, and they would look away.  We didn't understand what we had done.  We were most definitely the only young group in the restaurant (23-29 years old) and we had a diverse mix of people, and perhaps we were too loud but we could hear loud people in another dining room.  We finally had our drink orders taken, and everything just took forever.   The food was good, but certainly not for the price.  There are virtually thousands of Indian restaurants in the Bay Area that have the same dishes for half the price, and just as good if not better.  With better service.  We were not impressed and tried to negotiate them comping the corkage fee for our wine (we ordered plenty of cocktails as well), but they would not.   Went a second time, just a small group of 4, and while service wasn't as bad, the food just wasn't anything special for something that is so plentiful in the area.  To prove this point, we went to a spot up the street 2 nights later that blew it away (need to go again before reviewing).  If you want super quiet and formal ambiance (we are not rude or outrageously loud, we dress nice, etc) then you may enjoy it.  Or perhaps we've just been unlucky.

I came here last night with a friend for dinner as I had a http://restaurant.com coupon for this place. I've actually been to Amber India several times before previously and have always had impecable service along with tasty food.  However, this time, my experience has turned for the worse =/. After we were seated and ordered, I pulled up my coupon on my cellphone and showed it to the server per the coupon instructions.  However, the waiter insisted the coupon had to be printed out and pulled the manager over to speak with us.  The manager also insisted the coupon had to be printed out when the app stated the restaurant just had to write down the certificate code and call in instead.   The manager was very rude and after stating this, walked off and ignored our table.  My friend and I decided that after such rude service that we would not eat here anymore. I'm very disappointed in Amber India's service as they are the ones who chose to advertise with http://restaurant.com and if they cannot follow the policies set forth by http://restaurant.com, then they shouldn't sign up with http://restaurant.com.

Ordered the butter chicken--garlic naan--tandoori salmon--mango lassi. Butter-chicken was delicious and not too spicy or too buttery---like the butter chicken disaster I've tried @ Curry Up Now. This was creamy with all those Indian spices I love, it wasn't just hot--it had a bunch of interesting tastes and a little kick. Garlic Naan--was great, not too thick and dough like and not too thin and crispy like a cracker. Really enjoyed the fresh garlic on it, paired well with the BC. The Star of the Evening was the...Tandoori Salmon! My date had special dietary restrictions and the server helped us choose something appropriate and we risked the salmon and IT WAS AMAZING. It didn't hurt his stomach at all [we think the marinating it in yogurt has something to do with it]. This dish was was gorgeous as well. Service was good, I especially liked the way they served the food  with the double spoons onto each individual plate---makes one feel kind of special. It's nice. The decor was nice but I admit, I wasn't really paying attention. I was more concerned about the food. The mango lassi was okay and disappeared quickly but I wish they would've added some cardamom to it. That always enhances the drink. They also package your food to go for you--sweet deal. All in all when I'm craving Indian food again, I'll go back.

This was described to us as the best Indian food on the peninsula, and if that is true, it's disappointing.  Nothing was wrong with any of our food, (vegetables, lamb, butter chicken, tandoori chicken) which was probably a little less greasy and a little more tasty than most.  But it was ultimately just not that different from what one gets at solid Indian places throughout the country, and for a significantly amped-up price and atmosphere. I've had better Indian food at two different places in New Haven, Connecticut.

I think this place was okay, been to better Indian buffet around south bay.  There were more vegetarian dishes than meat/fishes. I didn't like the lamb dish because it was way too gamy. I like the butter chicken, but just the sauce.  The chicken was way too dry. Other than that, nothing really stood out.

This location is not easy to find. We drove right past it several times. Ironically, their sign, among the names of other stores in the strip mall, is bright red and white but we kept missing it as we were wearing shades! The parking lot was packed during lunchtime so we had to park in the next lot over. My first impression of the restaurant was of wanting to turn and run the hell out. The crowds waiting for tables were ear-splitting, and there didn't seem to be anyone working. No one was at the reception station and I couldn't tell who was waiting for a table and who was waiting to pay (later found that payment happens at the dining tables). The chaos of it was a turnoff, especially after knowing the serene ambiance of the Santana Row Amber India, but we were celebrating a friend's birthday so we stuck around. Finally another waiting patron pointed out that I needed to go get on the waiting list, which I did during one of the hostess' rare appearances. From there, it took about 15-20. The white tablecloths were nice, as was the minimal decor. Not at all like the fancy branch, but I expected that from reading the reviews. Unfortunately they wouldn't allow the option of ordering from the menu, and said we could ONLY do buffet, so one in our party didn't eat (except for the naan on the table). That was a shame and I just wasn't buying their explanation: they usually allow it, but it was "too busy" to do it that day. Um, the crowds thinned out rather quickly after we were seated, and we pretty much had the place to ourselves. They couldn't accommodate a single menu order? I wouldn't have selected this restaurant had I known. The buffet was delicious, albeit limited. It's a very small place and I think they set out as much as they possibly could without hanging food from the ceiling. No complaints about the food. It was odd that no one asked if we wanted to order drinks, so we brought up the subject of mango lassis and they brought them out, no problem. But we got the cold shoulder when pointing out that the bill reflected four buffets, when only three were ordered. They changed it, begrudgingly. The waiter also seemed flummoxed when we requested a refill on naan. Is that really so unusual to them? I got extremely full and no digestive problems -- always a great sign with a buffet! -- and the birthday girl loved her food, so that was wonderful. Not sure we'd come back to this one. A weekday lunch buffet for $14 is steep and we're spoiled by the fantastical loveliness of the Santana Row date-worthy site.

I came here after looking for Indian food on yelp.  It had a lot of reviews and rated to be $$ with 4 stars, so naturally I'd think this would be one of the better Indian restaurants around.   However when I got there and looked at the menu, I instantly noticed that the prices were definitely on the $$$ side for Indian food.  But that's ok, I thought.  I can afford to pay for good food once in a while.  My friend and I ordered the vegetable platter as appetizer, 2 naans, a rice, and two curries.  The bill came out to be $70+ including tax and tip.  It's the most expensive Indian place I've EVER been to.   The quality of the food definitely wasn't on par with the price.  It was rather bland.  The $5 lunch boxes I get sometimes for work tastes better than this.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the food is horrible, I'm just saying that it's not very tasty.  Though the naan was a little burnt and I had to peel off the burnt part before eating.   Service wise is ok.  Nothing special.  The atmosphere is good and the inside of the restaurant looks fancy.  Bathroom is decently clean.   Anyways I'm not sure what's the hype about this place and why it's $$ instead of $$$.  Did the owner pay yelp to take off negative reviews?

Good lunch buffet. I just went back for the first time in many years. Amber may be a victim of its own hype because the food was good but not so amazing that it deserved the title of best Indian food on the peninsula/Bay (maybe my expectations were set too high). Amber was not significantly better than its competitors - although the quality and degree of freshness seemed high (especially their spinach and corn dish - very fresh and flavorful). And yes, the butter chicken was good - just not noticeably better than other good butter chicken dishes I've tasted elsewhere. And Amber is pricier than others - albeit the atmosphere is more upscale and the service a little more attentive than others. I'd go again, but there are so many other Indian places nearby that I have not tried yet, that I probably won't bother to return.

I used to go to this place for special lunches back in the day, a couple employers ago. I remember a great birthday lunch with coworkers. I love their famous butter chicken. Recently, we've tried a bunch of breads and mushroom muttar, lentils, Goan fish, and garbanzo curry. All were quite tasty, with their own flavor. Their samosas are the best I've had anywhere - usually they are full of dense pasty potato, but Amber's are moist, with individual chunks of tasty potato. Yum. The restaurant's decor is lovely, but the outside is so deceiving. The strip mall they're in is quite sad looking. My coworkers and I used to laugh a little about this when we visited - the first time someone introduced us to the place we were a bit skeptical. They lose a star for prices, though... It's quite costly for a smallish portion of anything. Luckily, I can use my Betterworks account through work to get food for free (to me)! :D

Tried again. Same experience, more or less. Not bad food, but somehow lacking in the spiciness of really good Indian. The price remains astronomical for the buffet (I think $18 dollars), and I just don't think the value is there. Service is meh, certainly not good enough to sway my decision. Won't go back again, personally.

Really great lunch buffet! I reserve my 5 stars, or amber would get one! Food was excellent, and well labeled. Lots of variety, and very clean for a buffet. The ambience of the restaurant is very nice. Nice table linens, flatware, etc... One of the nicest buffets I have been to. Service was very good, as little as was required. They seemed almost overstaffed for the lack of service needed! Everyone was very friendly. I think, if Amber was a little close to 10$ for a lunch special, it would be 5*'s. Will go again and again (it's right across the street from work) :D

We learned about this place from SF Chronicle's annual 100 best restaurants in the Bay Area.   Amber India was one of the very few South Bay restaurants made the list in multiple years.   We have been there three times.  The first time even though we had reservation, the wait was still 45+ minutes.  We figured that was what you  put up with for great food.  We were glad that we waited because it was the best Indian food we ever had, even better than the food I had in India.   With that, we went back with high expectations for the 2nd time.  Interestingly, there was no wait the 2nd time, the crowd  miraculously disappeared that evening .  We were seated right away.  The food was flavorless, bland, staled, and even worse  there was a lot of sand in the spinach dish we ordered.  Apparently they didn't buy the right stuff (triple washed) or didn't take the time to correctly clean the spinach.  it goes without saying, it was a huge disappointment at a very high price.   With the stark contrast, we decided to give it another try and hope the 2nd visit was just an off night for the restaurant.  The third and last time we went there, the food was just average, nothing stood out but at least there was no sand in the food.  We haven't been back because we could get much better Indian food at less than half of the price else where in the Bay Area.

I've only come here for the lunch buffet (which I think is the best time to come) and this place is awesome!  I come here for my birthday every year during lunch to celebrate.  Everything tastes of quality ingredients and the service is quite attentive even for a lunch buffet.   It's my favorite Indian place and it's always worth the visit!

Wow. Never been a fan of Indian food, well, until tonight. We ordered like 8-9 dishes to share plus several serving of different Naan bread. All the curries were done just right. Rich enough but not too oily or overpowering. Perhaps they have taken a notch down to cater to non-Indian like myself? Anyway, the best dish (to me), was that sizzling plate of chicken, prawns and vegetables. Don't remember the name as I didn't order that. Yum. My constraints tonight was the fact that I was meeting some new friends, so that could only mean one thing: I had to eat with manners. Yes, "sharing" and only take 1 piece each time the plate passes my hand. Oh, and no matter how much you want to help yourself with seconds, a long table means you can't reach unless you ask for it to be passed. Next time, will come back with just the family, so I can pig out and eat however  I want.=) Walked out the restaurant and felt mixed. On one hand, love the food I devoured. On another hand, this meal more than offset at least 3 days' worth of calories burned at the gym. Literally, 2 steps forward and 1 step back.

Went for the lunch buffet...The food was okay! The curries are unique and I have never seen before (ie taro curry, mushroom curry, spinach and corn, etc), but did not really taste authentic. However, it was not bad, it just was not what I was expecting. They did not have any paneer dishes :( They are really generous with their naan, and the serving staff is EXTREMELY nice! I don't eat meat but my friend said the fish curry was her favorite. All in all, i would pay $10 for this buffet, not $14.95 (plus tax and tip....)

This is the best Indian food in the area. Growing up in the UK and visiting there regularly I am spoiled with good curry. Amber ranks right up there with some of the best Indian I have ever had and is easily the best in the bay area that I have had at least. Chicken Vindaloo and Tikka Masalla are both very good. If you like it very hot just ask they are more than willing to make any dish to your heat level liking.

Used to come here a ton and over the years have tapered off. This is partly due to the fact that there are closer Indian places to my house, and partly due to the fact that every time I came, it was packed to the gills with a ridiculously long wait. Now, that there were so many people waiting might be a signal that the food is amazing, and I must say, the food is quite good. It's pretty heavily spiced, which I like, but sometimes the flavors are a bit muddled. Cardamom is sometimes used to excess. It's also pricey. $14.95 for the lunch buffet (up from $12.95 a few years ago) isn't cheap, especially when there are places at almost the same quality for $11.95. The space is nicely appointed, with vibrant colors and pretty linens. There is one main room and one side room; both rooms are further divided into sections, allowing for some privacy. Servers are attentive. Obviously, they don't need to be that attentive at the buffet, but at dinnertime, it's nice to have a server who's there when you need him.

For appetizer I like the Vegetable platter, you get a variety of different items that you can try; Samosa, Pakora, Hara Kebab & Papad. The Biryanti rice plates are all good, they have a spicy after taste which I like. I really enjoyed the Tandoori Chicken salad; the walnut raisins give you a yummy surprise causing you to want more and more. The Sea Bass Tikka was different, I've never had sea bass cooked this way before, so if you like fish and want your tastebuds to enjoy something unique, try this. The Butter Chicken is the best chicken there, do not get the Chicken Ka Tikki, it's really plain and not worth it. For Lamb, get the Barrah Kebab, not the Seekh Kebab, that too isn't as tender as the Barrah. For dessert, please do not get the Gulab Juman, unless you want something that taste like a wet ball of cinnamon with sugar water. Instead try the Kesari Kheer (rice pudding). Overall this place gets 3 stars based on it's inconsistency; one item may be really tasty and the other plain so you never really know what to order until you do and figure it out on your own. However, there are 6 different Amber places, and I've only tried one so maybe if I tried others my stars may change... There's one opening up in SF soon, hmmm. We shall see Amber.

Well, I took the plunge.  After being jeered and taunted by my co-workers for never partaking in Indian cuisine, for my friend Will's Birthday I said YES....to Indian food!! However, I am not a true believer by any stretch.  It was mildly enjoyable, however it seemed my co-workers thought it was awesome. The rice was tasty, and the 2 chicken dishes I had, butter chicken (no butter whatsoever I might add) and grilled spicey chicken along with their bread called Naan turned out to be an ok lunch. Now mind you I find many of the smells that emanate from Indian food to be somewhat repulsive so this review is less a fair and balanced review and more personal opinion. The service was stellar, and the staff was incredibly nice.   Easy to get to and plenty of parking. Will I eat Indian food again? Not by my own accord.  I feel the same way about sushi; it was something I can now say I did, but a repeat performance is slim to none. I will now return to my previously preferred cusine, which for tonight means grilled teryaki chicken, brown rice and grilled veggies.

Great food, exceptional service, and always clean!  I love the clean, white tablecloths, and the ambient, dim/orange-y light is perfect for a cozy meal with the ones you love!  I've gone to their lunch buffets a couple of times, which was great to try out different things that I don't normally order when I come here for dinner.  Gotta get here early to miss the lunch rush, though!   I come here with my boyfriend, usually, and everybody I have brought with me, CRAVES the food and wants to go back asap!   As a base, I usually like to order the garlic and basil naan, rice, MY FAVORITE sukhi bhindi (spiced okra with onions! the menu says it's seasonal, but they always have it every time I order it!), butter chicken (of course, because it's the best!), chandani gosht (Tender chunks of lamb cooked in cardamom, cashew nuts in a smooth rich gravy - SO GOOD), and then anything else my friends would like to order.  But usually, they leave it up to me to order.  So, when it's just the two of us, we usually have leftovers to take home, which I love to do, but this could feed 4 people, normally.   We've become recognizable to the staff since we've come here so often, and they've always treated us great, from the get-go! Keep up the great job!!!!   OH!  And if you want to eat here on a Friday night, make a reservation in advance because it can get busy!

Would get four stars but is too a little too expensive for my liking. Shared Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Paneer, and Tandoori Salmon with rice and garlic naan. Chicken and salmon were a little too dry. Palak paneer was delicious. Service was good Decor was pretty uppity I'm kind of thrifty and don't really care about atmosphere that much, so I'd rather go to Darbar given a choice.

$15 for lunch buffet.  A little too expensive for what you get.  I enjoy the butter chicken.  I also like the palak paneer (creamed spinach with farmer's cheese) and the aloo goobi (potatoes and cauliflower).  But, everything was too salty.  The gulab jamun had a weird aftertaste.  The fish curry is a bit on the bland side.  I do not recommend the lunch buffet.  The menu changes so it is hard to recommend dishes for dinner.  But, I had a good crab dish and a good fish dish here at dinner time.   The service is still very good.  And, it has a nice business/professional ambiance.  I just wish the food was a bit more consistent.

I was very happy choosing Amber India from the many Indian cuisine options in the area. The chicken tikka masala was excellent, some of the best I've tasted. The butter naan needed some flavor, but served it's purpose (helping me down the tikka). The service was helpful and courteous. Definitely returning.

Three stars for the price of the food. I can't believe for two people we spent $80 for two veg dishes and one scallop dish. And although we also spent about $20 on two glasses of wine, the food came to  about $50. And we ate everything so the portion sizes were not large. The food was definitely good, but not exceptional. With all of the great Indian restaurants here in the south bay, paying $40 per person was a bit much.

I love Indian food. I have spent my life in California trying different Indian food restaurants, both here in SF/Bay Area and also down in SoCal. Amber India is the best I've had. I have tried most of the well-reviewed Indian restaraunts in the Bay Area (especially their weekday buffets) and Amber India (the one in Mountain View) has the best in my opinion. It isn't that it has more offerings than other places (it doesn't) or it's cheaper (it's $14.95) but the quality of the food is unparallelled. The chicken is high quality (not the cheap, fatty stuff found in many butter chickens and chicken marasalas). The sauces are all excellent. The potatoes are cooked just right (not too soft). The naan is fresh. The rice pudding isn't too sweet nor too bland (and just the right viscosity). I make it a point to eat here for lunch whenever I have the opportunity. Apart from the buffet, their dinner menu is pretty varied, and every dish I have tried here was excellent. Also servers are very nice. Only complaint is that I think sodas are priced high at like $4 or something (I usually don't order soda, but was told this by someone I ate here with). Bottom line: if you like Indian food, swing by Amber in Mountain View (it's better than the Amber India in San Jose in my opinion).

Best to call ahead for reservations...especially this time of year with so many holiday parties.  We walked in at wait was 30 to 40 min.  We were initially told 15 to 20 min and it was endurance contest waiting for table.  They were all around very courteous and professional.  This was a going away dinner for me.  My niece and brother loved the mango lassi,  Chai was good.  We had assorted vegy platter that was ok with assorted tandori appetiziers.  Then main course of butter chicken, rogan josh, palak paneer, peshawari chicken tikka, with dides of garlic naan and plain naan plus rice for 5 people. The waiter accidentally dropped naan that was left over to go (in the kitchen) and they came out to tell us that it happenned and made us a fresh batch to go.  Kudos for that!  They are super busy now, so again call ahead to make reservations.

You'd be surprised to find such a quality restaurant hidden in a nondescript strip mall, but it is well worth the effort to find. I frequent the lunch buffet about once a month.  The currys are very flavorful and delicious. My favorites include the butter chicken (yummmmm) and the fish curry.  I also LOVE the palak makkai (spinach with corn).  Plus, the naan is served hot and fluffy.   As others have noted, this place sure isn't cheap.  See $14.95 for the buffet always leaves me wishing I had a bigger stomach so I could consume more!

I'm going to put it out there - best Indian food in Mountain View. My roommates and I come here pretty regularly, and I'm always happy with the food I get. The curries just have a more complex, richer flavor than a lot of other Indian places in the area. Some stand-bys for my roommates and me: butter chicken, paneer elaichi pasanda (a superior alternative to paneer tikka masala), and navratan korma (tastes like a cream of vegetable soup!). The biryani is also good, but more ordinary. A lot of people have mentioned the lunch buffet, which will definitely fill you up with all the available options. The buffet versions aren't as good as ordering individual items though. There's also a take-out option for when you don't want to sit-down in their classy digs - if you live nearby, I'd recommend this as the wait can get pretty busy during lunch/dinner rushes.

I can't give this place a full 3 stars....2.5 at most. It was a bust for me, a heavy bust especially from my expectations for a place with an overall 4 star rating on Yelp.  I wasn't expecting to be blown out of the water, but I did expect to enjoy most of the dishes I normally get. Came here on a weekday for buffet lunch and tried most of the usual dishes (butter chicken, curry, aloo goobi, etc.).  The taste just didn't make me want more but I did enjoy the PALAK PANEER. The NAAN...oh the naan.....I love naan and I did not like it here.  Flattened too thin that most pieces were too crispy to have the right texture.  Sigh...so disappointed.  I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I was... On top of the less than stellar food...the prices! More expensive than most Indian buffets. PARKING: Crammed in a shared lot SPACE: **Tables fill the inside and every open space. **Didn't like that the buffet is separated in two sections --the chicken and fish curries were put with the desserts!  By the time any of us noticed, our plates where full.  WTH.

Nothing about this place warrants the very high prices, the elitist atmosphere, the spooning out of itty-bitty portions onto my plate, the aggressive insertion of the dessert menu underneath my face, the serving of clients who arrived after me, before me...  The restaurant is set back in a pseudo-strip mall, next to a video store that looks to have a larger-than-average adult section. Except the taste of the food.  It's phenomenal, and unusual.  It's easy to find places that satisfy that general curry craving, but this goes above and beyond.  My boyfriend and I experienced their malai kofta, these potato-and-paneer dumplings that truly do melt in your mouth, immersed in a cardamom-y tomato cream sauce.  We also got their pindi chole, which was surprisingly spicy in the best possible way.  They don't have a ton of vegetarian options compared to many Indian restaurants, but what they do have, they do very, very well.

The boyfriend and I came here a couple weeks ago since we haven't had Indian food in a while. I only saw that it had good ratings on Yelp, but didn't know it was more on the pricier range. The decor and ambiance is very nice and elegant. Definitely somewhere you'd like to bring a date or have an intimate family dinner. It's quiet and the lighting is dim. We ordered the chicken tikka masala and another chicken dish and some garlic and basil naan. When the dishes came out, we were a bit taken back because the price range here was higher than other Indian restaurants, but the portions are tiny. But you get what you pay for, right? The chicken was super tender and the sauce was very flavorful. I want to say it's the best-cooked (I can't say if it's authentic) Indian food we've tried. The garlic and basil naan was to-die-for though, so delicious. Even though the food was really good, I'm still on the fence about going back here often because of the portion size compared to the price. Everything else though... I recommend it!

I have been lucky enough to only dine at Indian restaurants that were recommended by friends and were amazing, but this restaurant was no different. Butter chicken and chicken tikka masala with garlic naan are my defaults, and they did not fail me.

Came here a few months ago for dinner with some friends. There's a huge variety of food to choose from here-- and everything is delicious! We had the cauliflower appetizer--sketchy at first, but it was actually really good. I wish the portion was bigger!! We had the chicken masala, butter chicken, and an eggplant dish. All the dishes were delicious-- portions don't appear large, but surprisingly filling! The naans were also very good- sightly crispier than what I'd usually prefer, but still full of flavor. The service here is also great- we made reservations for a Fri, night and were seated right away. Our waiter was also very helpful and recommended some great dishes for us.

Amber India had a great feel to it. Modern art hangs from the walls. Chandeliers hang from the ceilings. White table cloths hang from the tables. Everything about the restaurant feels modern and fresh. Although the restaurant is modern, the food is traditional. (If you prefer a more modern, fusion-style menu, check out their sister-restaurant, Amber Dhara.) I ordered the mirch ka gosht, which was a lamb cooked in peppercorns, green chillies, ginger, and saffron. The menu advertised it as "spicy hot." When it came out, it had a good enough flavor to it, but it wasn't as spicy or flavorful as I expected. Also, the lamb was a bit tough. Overall, though, the flavor of the saffron really came alive with the spiciness of the chillies and the peppercorns. I liked it. What I liked more than the lamb was the garlic basil naan that I ordered alongside it. The naan itself had an excellent flavor, and it tasted very good when dipped in my curry from the mirch ka gosht. I think I preferred the curry with the naan even over the curry with the lamb (as it was intended)! Service was also quite delightful. Every staff member I encountered was smiling, and friendly toward. Overall, Amber India makes for a pretty good outing!

I normally frequent Passage to India while I'm in the South Bay and craving Indian food, but decided this time I would try something different. Based on the number of reviews as well as the number of positive ones, I expected deliciousss food. Overall I felt that the selection wasn't great, and the price was the same ($16 for lunch buffet during the weekend). Even worse, it's smaller so it's really crowded. There is always a line for the food. The highlights were the palak paneer, butter chicken, and tandoori chicken. I tried a bit of the fish curry, and it had a really weird taste to it. Normally when I stack my plate with lots of curry, it somehow always tastes good. This time it definitely did not. I don't see myself returning.

Really great lunch buffet---perfect butter chicken and tons of options. But damn, $15?! I guess that was worth it, but I wish I had come hungrier...

I like the food, but I find the Amber India Mgmt to be a bunch of arrogant jerks who don't always treat us well. I've been here enough times to notice that we get better service when we visit with our non-indian friends. At times when it's just my family & I we've been ignored, our order's been messed up, we waited longer than others for our food (even though we ordered first), etc. Plus not to mention they nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING! I'm done with them and am taking my business elsewhere.

Delicious butter chicken.  I feel like I could end the review right there.  But then I would neglect to mention the goat cheese naan.  Goat cheese!  It was all delicious.   Servers and hosts were very attentive.  The ambiance is cozy, and not as trendy as the location at Santana Row, which is actually nice.  We came her on a Friday night on a whim, and though the place was hopping at 7:30, we still managed to snag a table even without a reservation.

The buffet here was expensive and although it was good, I wasn't wowed.  There is a large amount of food in the buffet, but not a great a selection. There were only a couple of meat dishes and a couple veggie options, but a lot of side type options (salad).   Service was a bit slow.  I'd come back, but wouldn't go out of my way.

Amber is of course a high-class Indian restaurant. I can find nothing wrong with the decor or the food. Both are as good as I've had in the area. What I dislike about Amber is the snobbery of the help and the prices. There are a surfeit of Indian restaurants around town; is Amber worth paying double or triple (no rice included, seriously?) over others? No, it's not. The portions are smaller, the food is a cut above, but not that much better, and while the dining room is nicer than your average, it's in the lower bracket of the fine dining set. And the help! First time there we asked, "Neither of us are very hungry, will one order of Chicken Tikka Masala be enough do you think?" The waiter gave us a strongly disapproving look and said in a lecturing voice, "Of course not." We stuck with one dish anyway and it was, of course, plenty. On another visit, as someone (not our waiter) was boxing up our food, I asked him to include some rice and the rice we had ordered ran out and I declined a refill at the time. The individual gave me a confused and then disapproving look and said finally, "I will check if we will do that for you." Will the rice was ultimately provided, this is not how I expect to be treated after dropping $60 for bulk-prepared food. If you're in the mood for Indian, want to show your companion a nice time, and are feeling a bit flush on the cash front, go for it. Celebrate! But otherwise, go somewhere else.

Amber India reminds me a lot of Kaygetsu in Menlo Park ... both are Bay Area "cuisine standards" located in nondescript, stretch mall settings. For Amber, its neighbors are a martial arts studio, a tutoring center, a dry-cleaner, and other small businesses. It's a typical stretch of El Camino Real. In MV, there's nearby Shiva, Sakoon, and Passage to India but Amber trumps them all. So if you're looking for a cool, trendy, "impressive" setting, you might have to travel to the Santana Row or SF versions (which IMO doesn't have the same caliber food). Again, if that kind of stuff is important to you - and to some, it's a deal-breaker. But focusing purely on the food itself - and as many reviewers have mentioned, once inside, the appearance and service are perfectly adequate - it's terrific, food-coma-inducing stuff. I understand that the hard-core "foodies" will dismiss Amber as Americanized (or rather British-ized), inauthentic fare but c'mon ... unclench a bit, huh? The butter chicken and chicken tikka masala are the obvious crowd-pleasers, though I'm also partial to their vindaloo and tandoori dishes. I was in New York for several years and Indian restaurants in "Curry Hill" and East Village were in regular rotation ... Amber replicates the experience well and definitely takes me to a nostalgic place.

I don't know the proper yoga etiquette, but post workout, Amber India certainly hit the spot! After our second Bikram Yoga class, my two friends and I were starving! There was barely a time that we took a breath once the food hit the table - everything was so good and smelled phenomenal, we were dying to try it all! This Monday evening was not super busy, but usually the restaurant is filled with patrons. Towards the weekends, make a reservation if you don't want to wait. Yelp has a handy open table link where you can make a reservation online. We were starving, so it helped that there wasn't a wait to be seated. The restaurant is beautifully decorated - simple and light. You can find all types of parties here - families, hot dates - they even have a lunch buffet earlier in the day. The front area looks a little desolate and it's hard to believe there would be a nice restaurant in the building, but it's poppin' in the back! Romantically lit (first or second date acceptable!) beautiful art on the walls, warm environment, etc. The waiter portioned out our first serving which was super awesome. It's family style, so it might break the ice in awkward social situations: "My dog is crazy cute! She makes my heart sing!" "I hate dogs." "Yeah - pass the paneer, please?" ---------- Thankfully, everyone can unite over good Indian cuisine - which is what we did. they have a good size list of beer and wine if you desire, but it totally not necessary to enjoy your meal. Things we think are necessary: Palat paneer (DELISSSSSSSSH!) Aloo gobi Garlic and basil naan (get 2 orders if there are more than 2 people. trust me.) Butter chicken Chicken masala... Basically everything. Basically. Table service was AMAZING. the waiters were super attentive and even packed the tiniest bits for us to go. we should have ordered more. WE SHOULD HAVE ORDERED MOAR. If you manage to leave any, the left overs are so amazing. Get you butt down to Amber India. Take a date. Eat stuff. Next time you're in the Palo Alto/ Mountain View area, make it a stop along your taste-of-the-bay route. Trust.

We mostly do take-out here and have eaten a few dinners which I remember thinking that the service was excellent and well presented. No other Indian restaurant in the area really can compare to the quality you get and you really pay for that quality. We had plain naan & garlic naan, palak paneer, lamb vindaloo (not as spicy as I had hoped), mushroom mutter makana, navratan korma and 1/2 tandoori chicken (one would you think you'd get a breast, leg, & thigh, but instead you get 2 legs & 1 thigh, & 1 breast which is a strange way to cut the bird and had I known the whole chicken was only $4 more we would have ordered the whole chicken...see next paragraph). A lot of food yes, but they are great for leftovers. Anyway, I would not have ordered the navratan korma as it is too creamy for my taste. I only ordered it because the menu wouldn't show up on my iphone from the Amber website and we wanted to pick up before we got home. I guessed as to what I wanted and didn't do a good job explaining that I wanted a vegetarian dish with meatball-like shapes. Amber needs to make sure that they have a mobile viewable menu.

Five stars for the food, 2.5 stars for the service. It's hard to single out a specific dish, because I'll just end up listing everything I've eaten there, but I love the saag paneer especially, and the food is spicy and flavorful. Even the rice has spices. The naan is merely ok, so I usually get the rice. But then, I prefer rice. The food is extremely tasty. This place is moderate if you don't drink, spendy if you get alcohol (especially wine).

It's hard for me to rate Amber India, because in San Diego where I recently moved from, you can get a better Indian meal for 1/4 of the price.  However, Amber India is the best Indian food I've found yet in the Bay Area.   The decor is beautiful, swank, and posh.  You cannot help but feel slightly awesome while you're in Amber.  When you order your dish, they actually put it on your plate for you, portioning you out some rice and curry.  It's a nice touch. We had the Butter Chicken, which is delicious (but usually called Chicken Makhani).  The lentil dish we had un-believe-able.  I mixed the two together and it was delicious.  They served us quickly and we were in and out in very little time.  It made for a quick yet tasty and relaxing date night in the city.  I will return!

The best Indian lunch buffet I've been to so far. I really like their butter chicken which is just excellent and the palak paneer is perfect! Another plus to this restaurant is it has a great selection of items at its lunch buffet and every dish I've tried is very good with just the right amount of spice and definitely always fresh. Fish curry, naan and tandoori chicken are all really good! The lunch buffet is $14.95 which is not exactly cheap however you definitely get what you pay for. I've been here a lot of times and the food is consistently very good, service from the friendly staff was great and the restaurant is always really clean. I'll definitely be going back :)

A good, dependable Indian restaurant. I've been there on multiple occasions and never been disappointed. Nice ambiance. Friendly staff. The food is flavorful. Seems to be a local favorite. Try the lamb biryani (ask for spicy) or the Mirch ka Gosht. Both are very good. The Hyderabadi biryani is a classic. I tried a few vegetarian dishes too and they were quite good.

Look: It's a nice little place... Food: I love Indian food.. but I'm not an expert or anything... but here's my opinion.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala... it was decent... Most places I've ordered this, there's always been a certain level of spiciness too it... but here.. it seemed decent... I thought the chicken wasn't terribly overcooked.. but my boyfriend thought it was a bit chewy.... and we both agree that there was nothing special about the sauce.. The other dish we ordered was the Vegetarian Delight... And we both found this pretty good... not super extraordinary.. but good.. and much better than the tikka masala.  The variety of dishes were nice. The garlic basil naan was good.. nothing super special... but good while it was warm... the bread that came with the veggie delight was nice, warm and fluffy.  I liked it. :) Service: The staff seems very friendly... and was available when needed. Our waiter had recommended the Tikka Masala over the Butter Chicken (which was what I saw most reviews about)... I kind of wish I ordered the butter chicken to see if it's better! Overall: It's okay.. I think it's a little overpriced... but that's just me... I may have my expectations.... and this time..it just didn't meet it. :(

I've had a lot of Indian food and I must say that Amber's dishes were deeper, more complex, richer, and tastier than much of what I've had to date. To me, it seemed like the spices were infused as opposed to a simple coat to the main ingredient. Another nice surprise was the excellent and attentive waiters. They even dish out the first portions of rice and entrees to get you started. If you're craving Indian, I would highly recommend this restaurant.

Pretty pricey take-out buffet, but you can fill up your take-out box to your heart's content! There's also a larger variety of dishes, more than what I'm used to. 4-5 dishes are chicken/fish, 4 dishes were veggie, 2 fried snack dishes, salads, and yogurt. The staff was very polite and helpful. They make eye-contact with you. I hate it when you have to flag them down and you just can't tell if they hate you or are deaf, so A+ here. Ambience was nice - dimly lit, nice white table cloths, clean seating area. The naan they provide had black sesame seeds, which I've never had and noticeably aromatic rice. All the dishes were in deep, brass dishes. Chicken was juicy, and this veggie thing that pretends to be a meat thing was juicy (I have no idea what it is) Very nice. Will definitely come back...with people willing to spend money on good food.

Been here for the lunch buffet quite a few times with coworkers, kind of pricey though! After tip, adds up to ~417. But their butter chicken IS very good, and so is the fish curry. Also, fresh fluffy naan. Although I probably prefer it a bit more toasted. Have ordered their sea bass tikka, AWESOME. tender flaky sea bass (i call it cod, though) grilled to perfection. Spicy chicken masala was not bad but wasn't such a fan of the sauce. their chicken (whether in the butter chicken or this dish) is always cooked perfectly. tender and melt-in-yr-mouth! Seekh kebab had a bit too much cardamom, very strong spice there. Vege biryani was kind of like chinese fried rice, haha. Not bad.. Garlic and basil naan was very fragrant!

Another day, another mediocre, stuffy North Indian restaurant. I've been to this place, and its mirror images in two dozen other US cities, and it's a tragedy every time (I did not come on my own free will). Why is North Indian food so tepid, uncreative and standardized in the US? Worst yet, this joint is unusually vegan UN-friendly, as they pre-make all of the sauce bases for their dishes. So, vegans beware: their is only one or two options for you on a menu that it otherwise full of cream, butter and yogurt-laden dishes. To start they were twenty minutes late with our reservation; I let this slide as it was a busy Saturday night and they were packed. As stated earlier, this is a terrible place for vegans. Which is a real shame and oddity, as North Indian food is actually normally vegan-friendly; moreover, dishes that contain cream or butter can easily be modified to eliminate those ingredients. Amber commits a mortal sin by pre-mixing all of their sauces, which is a lame shortcut and also suggests a lack of creativity in the chef. It also means this place is basically an assembly line for generic, lame dishes like butter chicken and chicken tikka masala. If you like garbage Indian food like that, and are willing to pay $13-15 a dish, Amber's your spot. If you care about your food, go elsewhere. I got the only vegan dish on the menu, the aloo gobi ($13). To be fair, this dish tasted fine. It was competently made, but didn't blow me away. The portion size was pretty small, though, so don't expect leftovers (I easily finished this dish on my own). I also had an order or tandoori roti ($2) which was solid. We had an issue with the service. It wasn't super friendly or attentive but our server somehow also didn't get one of our orders and then claimed that we never ordered the dish to begin with. Had he simply apologized, offered us a free order of roti, and gotten us the dish, everything would have been fine. If Amber had more vegan options (why not some dishes with tofu or seitan? how about using different vegetables, such as broccoli or asparagus, instead of the same old boring potatoes, tomatoes, cauliflower and lentils? how about some soy milk chai, or coconut pudding?) and better service, it might warrant another visit. But it will never have those things because, at the end of the day, it's just another generic North Indian restaurant.

Came here for weekday lunch, which is served buffet style. It's true, the butter chicken is great.  Rice is good, desert good too.  The roasted chicken was a bit dry, and one thing on their salad bar was really salty, so I would avoid that.  The ambiance was nice, looks upscale.

I went here recently for the lunch buffet. Yum! Everything I tried from the buffet was tasty, and I particularly liked the fresh naan that was brought to our table. The place was packed and had an upbeat atmosphere, which worked really well with the buffet format. It was just a bit on the expensive side for lunch, but I was happy with the quality and overall tastiness, so worth it. I would just offer a word of caution to any other folks out there like me who can't take the heat -- some of the dishes did run hotter than I expected. I also took a spoonful of some type of condiment from the buffet, then got mixed up when I was eating and took a bite of it like it was a vegetable dish. HUGE mistake -- eyes wouldn't stop tearing, agony, misery, etc., etc. Oops. So I very much look forward to going back to Amber India for lunch again -- I will just steer clear of that particular condiment :)

Why did this Indian dinner cost me $159 + ? ...my friends' instructions were, go north on El Camino past Rengstorff, and there's Amber.....I passed Rengstorff, and nada. I picked my cell to get information. Operator: this is 911 Me: sorry, I meant to dial 411; let me just hangup... Operator: sorry please stay on the line. If it's a mis-dial, I need your info... (*2 minutes later). Me: oh, sh@#, there's a cop, and he's pulling me over. (*3 minutes later) Cop: you know you're not suppose to use your cell phone when driving... Me: sorry officer...I tried to get off the line, but you see this 911 operator... (*5 minutes later) Cop: Here's a citation for $159, and BTW Amber Restaurant is near the corner of Rengstorff by the car wash.... I follow the fricken cops' instructions and still NO AMBER. Is it just me, or do you think Amber needs a bigger signage? OK, besides the $159 useless Police direction for Amber and the 911's operator's insistence to stay on the line, and the 30 minute wait at the restaurant once I finally found it, Amber's food was actually quite tasty , with an ambiance that was a little too high-brow for my then present mental state (that cell phone traffic ticket, still on my mind) Amber India serves up flavorful Indian cuisine at a high level (OK, my traffic ticket is still on my mind). Our meals at this location (which was hard to find, if I had gone to Amber Cafe, I would not have this damned ticket), the food was prepared and presented well (in this economy, why $159, why not $50 for the first cell phone ticket?). The Mirch Ka Gosht, lamb cooked with peppercorns, green chillies, ginger and saffron - was spicy solar flare hot (I hope that cop gets indigestion, for giving me bogus information); You can tell that the curry here is made from scratch (I'd like to scratch that cop's car right about now). It was so deliciously tangy (for $159 cell violation, this curry should have been served by dancing girls). The Chicken Tikka Masala, which was chicken (this traffic ticket was sure chicken sh$%) tikka in a milder tomato-based curry. The chicken was soooo tender (that damned 911 operator, I'd like tenderize her). We also had Goat Cheese Paneer Naan (I wonder if it's a felony, if I secretly herded some goats inside that guy's cop car). Very tasty. And the beer...(If were going to get a $159 ticket, it should not have been for some wimpy cell phone usage...I should have been for drinking a jug of Taj Majal)..great stuff. As many reviewers have already noted, Amber India is located in the South Bay...and use a GPS.

I was only in the area for a weekend and after doing much research decided to try out the lunch buffet. Amber India probably has the best Indian buffet that I've ever tried. They have a great variety of dishes (chicken, fish, vegetable, and even goat). The dishes were high in flavor and not too heavy like some places that I've tried. I also had a mango lassi that was also the best mango lassi I've ever had! I usually don't like mango lassi but decided to give them a try. My only regret was overeating to the point of discomfort. Pro-tip: Try a little bit of everything, but load up on the butter chicken and tandori chicken! Possibly the best dishes there.

Love this place. The ambiance is fancier than the average Indian joint, and the food is really rich and tasty. The butter chicken/chicken tikka is super good, and the baigan barta (sorry for the spelling) is the best I've ever had anywhere. The only beef I have with this place is that their palak paneer, my favorite vegetarian dish, is always way oversalted. It's so salty it needs about a 2:1 ratio of rice to even attempt to eat without shriveling your mouth up like a snail on a salt lick. I love their lunch buffet too. Nearly the same quality of food, and lots of it!

Had the lunch buffet for the first time and walked out disappointed. The tandoori chicken was extremely dry and hard, and the only dish that stood out was the butter chicken...which, in my opinion, wasn't worth the 15-minute wait. The buffet line was poorly set up, leaving veeeery little space for access to the restrooms. Lesson learned. We're going back for dinner only.

I was told that this place would be better than the Amber India in Santana Row especially for their lunch buffet but I felt somewhat deceived as I disagreed heavily on the quality and taste of food here versus the Santana Row location. This location is much smaller and less fancy than the other location, but they also have a smaller amount of food during their lunch buffet. They don't have a huge variety of chicken and their butter chicken was just about the only thing that was good here versus many varieties at the other location. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't all it was hyped up to be and given the choice I would definitely eat at the other location. Their prices here are a little cheaper I suppose but not enough to get me to come back.

The boyfriend came back from a trip to London last year and would not stop talking about the amazing Indian food he feasted on while there. He said that he had never had Indian food that was so tasty, that was until we came to Amber India for dinner. I'm a pretty boring Indian food eater if you leave the ordering responsibility up to me. I love all things tikka masala and anything with cauliflower, but the bf is more adventurous so we feasted on the following: Chicken Masala (no tikka) - This dish was definitely one of our favorites. Tender chicken that needed no fork, with a super flavorful sauce full of spices. Great sauce to scoop up with the awesome naan we ordered. Cochin Scallops - Spicy scallop curry cooked with cocunut milk and peppercorn sauce with a hint of tamarind. I learned a lesson with this dish. Seafood + Indian spices and curries don't agree with my tastebuds. Dal Bukhara - Lentils slow cooked with spices, cream tomatoes. This dish was my ABSOLUTE favorite. Wow... I love lentils and the cream sauce that they were swimming in. Although the prices were kinda high, for the type of atmosphere, quality of food and great service, the price tag doesn't seem so bad.

The butter chicken here is soooooo good, and the wait staff is always so friendly.  I have nothing negative to say about this place! Except... the food is SO good, you won't know when to stop yourself at the lunch buffet - so expect some major food coma after wards.  It's a little bit more expensive than other Indian restaurants, but worth it if you want good food. Butter Chicken + Mango Lassi = mmmm :)

Based on 8 million reviews, Amber India is a fine place to eat.   One more review: Wait staff at Amber India appear to be authentic Indian men, and the clientele by and large do not appear to be Indian.  What does this tell us about food served at Amber India? I don't know.  But the food tasted good to me.   Is it proper etiquette to review the party who sat next to you at the restaurant?  Because I would really prefer it if I didn't have to sit next to the loud mouth wannabe hedge fund manager and his prissy children. A man, who three times during our meal, reprimands his wife:  "Shut your mouth.  I'll tell the story."  To my complete and utter amazement, she did shut her mouth, as she sat and listened for probably the six thousandth time to the story of when, "I spoke with (enter hot shot CEO name here), and he told me that there was really going to be a shake up over there, and we had all better be prepared for the fireworks, and the blah, and the blah, blah.....blah." "Blah." "Oh, waiter?" He beckons loudly so we all know to give him our attention, "Tell me, is there any way that you can package up a little of your tandoori seasoning for me, perhaps in a plastic bag?" Smug smile stretched across his face.  Yeah, while we're at it, we'll package you up some naan dough so you can really do it right.  This is a business turkey head. "The wife and I are thinking of purchasing our own tandoori oven.  Have you got any idea where I can find a good one?" Expectant and still smugger smile stretched across his face.  Surprisingly, the waiter was so nice that he actually went and spoke with the chef, and came back with a number for a guy who sells ovens.  Wait, we are in Mountain View right?  Oh yeah, one word: Google. So, at this point, I ordered a large Taj (beer), and decided that my review of Amber India had more to do with my ear drums than my taste buds.  If you are looking for a good place for slightly pricey Indian fare that will never be confused with bad food, though perhaps under spiced, Amber India will more than suffice, just ask to be seated next to the quiet elderly couple in the back so you can enjoy your meal in peace.

I came here on Sunday for a friend's birthday and had the $15 lunch buffet.  I really enjoyed it, though to be fair this is only my second Indian buffet so I don't have too much to compare to.  I liked being able to sample a lot of different dishes, since I usually do get sick of eating a single dish for the entire meal. My biggest complaint would be that about half of our naan was burnt.  Usually naan is my favorite thing to eat at an Indian restaurant, but I didn't feel it was very good here. Overall a great place for groups since I'm sure everyone will find something they like.  It's great if you have vegetarians in your group too, since they had quite a few vegetarian dishes.   Another plus is there's no cake cutting fee, so you can bring your own cake if you're ever celebrating something.

Amber Alert!  Supposedly good restaurant nowhere to be found! I think the Amber India emperor has no clothes... or in this case, chicken tikka masala. Aloo tikki was bland, bland, bland. Dum aloo was interesting and good, but consisted of four small balls o' 'tato for $11.50. The chicken tikka masala lacked tandoori-ness. There are better Indian restaurants around (Marigold, Nawab, Passage to India, Vik's). Go to them.

Ever since my coworkers got me hooked on Indian food I had to try Amber India while in California. This place was elegant, the menu prices for dinner ranged anywhere from $12-$30. Definitely a hi-end Indian place. I tried the Three Mushroom Biryani which was rice bowl with an assortment of mushrooms with spiced basmati rice. It was full of flavor and not too spicy. As a side I ordered the Poori, it's a deep fried whole wheat bread. This was very different from any poori I had ever tasted before. It was fluffy, warm, and just delicious with my rice bowl. The service was a bit slow, especially since me & my friend were the only ones in the restaurant, but they were very polite and even helped me with pronouncing my order. Too bad I was too late for the lunch buffet, that sounds like it could have been right up my alley! Al tho dinner was a bit pricey it was worth it!

This was my first visit to this place.  The place looks really clean and classy. however, that is what I can say good about this place.  I was surprised to find out the buffet pricing was  higher that other Indian Buffet  places I have been so I thought the food should be good quality.  First thing I notice was the selections were so limited and the most popular Indian food  ( Chicken Tekka Masala) was missing in action. My other favorite Indian Food was Tandoori Chicken.  The chicken pieces that I picked were cold (room temperature).  I asked why chicken is cold and they told me that perhaps the bottom pieces are warm.  I selected a couple of more pieces from the bottom and it was the same.  I was very disappointed.  The naan was good and fresh.

Amber India, an upscale Indian restaurant, is always packed during the lunch hour, with patrons enjoying their all you can eat buffet featuring an array of delicious entrees, including vegetatrian, fresh fruit and dessert.  I have had lunch here several times with friends and have never been disappointed.  Unlike other Yelpers, some complaining of small portion sizes and high prices, I have not ordered off the menu before. The fixed-priced buffet may be a little pricey, for some anyway, but this is offset by both variety and quality and the ambience.  Lunch at Amber is a special occasion. Amber Restaurant may prove hard to find if it is your first time going there.  It's located deep inside a nondescript strip mall off of El Camino, but you really can't see it from the street.  Make sure you find the right Amber.  Don't confuse it with the fast food Amber, further southeast along El Camino Real, and quite visible from the street. If you are bringing a group for lunch, call ahead for reservations.

I am a spice-wimpy foodie. Does that mean I'm disqualified? Dunno...but I do know I enjoyed my meal at Amber India tonight and I'd like to go back to try more. We had a party of 6 and the entire staff was very attentive and nice. I had the Tandoori Seafood Platter for $27.95. On a platter with semi-sauteed onions, I got a lobster tail, 2 huge prawns, and 2 pieces of sea bass tikka (fish cubes marinated in lemon juice and spices). There was a mint-ish sauce and a tamarind sauce to go with the seafood. Very tasty meal along with some basmati rice and some of their garlic basil naan. The Dum Aloo Bukhara sounded too good to pass up ($12.95). It's a vegetarian entree of Danish potatoes stuffed with mint and apricot chutney, cooked in a rich gravy. So we ordered one of these for the table and made it our appetizer, each getting one small potato with a bit of naan that came with it. It was scrumptious and I will order it again, this time all for myself. :) One of my sisters got the butter chicken entree for $16.95. I tried a small bite and it was quite good. Something I'd like to try another time. It's tandoori chicken in a tomato, butter, and fenugreek sauce. I will have to look up "fenugreek" online to figure out what that is. My brother-in-law tried a seafood curry, and he liked it. I can't vouch for it as I didn't taste it. My daughter had the Handi Prawn Biryani, which is huge prawns with saffron flavored basmati rice ($17.95). They were very generous with the prawns. Even though we ordered extra mild, it was too spicy for my 9-yr-old, so I now have lunch for tomorrow. Yeah! There were enough other items on the menu that tempted me, that I know I will be back. I'd like to try more and I'd like to re-order those potatoes with mint and chutney. Delish! Amber India succeeded in convincing me I do like Indian food.

I have a new restaurant pet peeve. I am tired of ordering something off the menu, having someone say "Would you like x or y with that?", requesting y, and then having magical and ridiculous additional charges show up on the bill. This is particularly ridiculous when you order a main dish that consists of nothing but meat and some sauce. Really, am I just going to eat nothing but giant chunks of meat in sauce? No, I am going to at the very least need some rice or other magical carb with that. It's not really an addendum or a side dish to the meal: it's how the dish is eaten. It's like ordering fajitas in a Mexican restaurant, having the server ask, "Would you like corn or flour tortillas?" and then seeing a $2.95 charge added on to the bill. I'm so over it. This is the experience you will have at Amber India. The food is good--I'd say 4 stars based solely on that--but the prices are steep, about $15-$18 just for a decent (but not sizable) portion of meat. Considering you can easily get 10 times as much food on a just-as-delicious buffet down the road, this is rather excessive. Then, you tack on $4.95 per person just for rice, and an additional couple of bucks a head for naan, and an appetizer and just a single beer and all of a sudden you're signing a bill for $72 for a dinner for two and you don't even have leftovers. WTF. I HATE being surprised at the check. I hate having to take the time to stop and read every item on the bill because I am just thrown at how those charges could have possibly accumulated to such a ridiculous amount. And I hate that I am compelled to leave a minimum 18% tip no matter what, because service here is brusque and forgetful. There are a multitude of better options in the area, and I would even recommend taking a step down foodwise to avoid the unpleasant surprises you'll get here.

Maybe it's because I'm in the south bay so I've been spoiled by great Indian food at great prices, but I wasn't impressed by Amber India.  It's average at best, and at $14 for a lunch buffet, is way too high for this quality.  The ambiance is fancier than your typical Indian restaurant, but the extra $3-4 doesn't mean they can get away with it. The lunch buffet had a decent variety of dishes, although they are tilted much more vegetarian then the standard buffet.  The only meat dishes were fish curry, chicken curry, butter chicken, and tandoori chicken.  Most places have at least twice this amount.   The vegetarian fare had dishes like creamed spinach with corn, eggplant, etc., but all of them were uniformly *soaking* in butter.  Seriously.  At first, I thought the spinach was a pesto sauce with all the oil in it.   Maybe the standalone a la carte orders are better, but I see no reason to have the buffet.

Amber India is my ALL TIME FAVORITE Indian food! I get a craving for this place once every 3 weeks. Living in San Francisco, I have tried many many many Indian food. Every time I try a new Indian restaurant is just fails me when it tastes water down, not enough favor, spices does not mix well. I literately go to Amber the very next day because I need to satisfy my craving. I only order 2 things (all the time) on the menu and eat it all by myself ( NO Sharing!). My ultimate favorite is the Bagin Bharta (Eggplant Curry). They make is so FRESH! The spices are perfect, not too spicy not too plain. I LOVE how they saute the shallots to give it a aromatic kick! They mix in fresh peas! Every time you take a bite, the sweetness pops in your mouth. Second is Butter Chicken. They use very fresh Tandoori chicken shreds in this dish. I hate the chunky ones that are thick and dry. The tomato curry is delicious and the best! Some places sometimes make it too sweet. But this is cooked to perfection! Then of course I get 3 orders of butter nann. ( yes, I eat it all by myself) That's all for me! I'm sorry I cant share. I finish everything by myself and I even wipe my nann on the plate to get every last bite! -1 star because it is expensive. It is worth it but I'm use to $5.95 Eggplant (vs $11.95) 6.95 for butter chicken (vs 16.95) $1 per whole nann (vs $2.50) Just by myself, every time I order this I leave spending $40!

With so many great reviews, I don't know what more I can add..... But, because I loved it so much , I'll certainly give it a shot! I had lunch here last week, (after saving calories and a cheat meal for it!) We were seated immediately, and even though the lunch is buffet, the service was great. They kept the waters refilled, which was so necessary with all the spicy food. The vegetarian items were just ok for me. I had a bite of everything to try it, though. The tandoori chicken and butter chicken was FAN-FREAKIN-TASTIC! The curry chicken wasn't that interesting , but given how much I loved the other two chicken dishes, it was no big loss. It's a little pricey for lunch, but it is buffet, and it's so good, you can't really argue the price. I can't wait to go back:)

Quite possibly my favorite restaurant in the Bay Area.  I drive from SF just to eat here sometimes.  The lamb is fantastic.  And I have had three friends orgasm from eating the Butter Chicken (aka: chicken makhani, aka: chicken makanwala).  Messy and embarrassing when it happens.

For a place that serves authentic Indian cuisine, there sure are a lot of non-Indians here.  A second location can be found in the very authentic Santana Row in San Jose.  I initially went here for the buffet lunch and was not impressed.  I would recommend coming here for dinner service instead. Food:  3 stars.   I came here with two vegetarians, which was a great idea because I had the meat dishes all to myself and even got to sample some of their dishes.  I would have raved a bit more about the food, but the prices are too high for this non-upscale restaurant, which is located in a strip mall.  Clearly, this restaurant is capitalizing on all the hype created by Michael Bauer, yelpers, and the like.  I would have loved to try the tandoori lobster ($29.95, are you out of your mind!), but I settled for some cheaper chicken dishes instead ($16.95 for the butter chicken).  The food overall is good, but I would steer WAY clear of the desserts. Service:  2 stars.   Service is sloowwwwww........ There were several long gaps between courses and the server took foreeeeever to take our order. Atmosphere:  3 stars.  The restaurant's classy exterior neon sign puts its strip mall neighbors' storefronts to shame (The Gorin School of Music better step up!).    It was kind of dark inside, but fortunately that all changed when my arsonist vegetarian friend "accidentally" set fire to the naan basket with the lit candle on the table.  Strangely enough, we put out our own fire because the slowwwwww servers didn't get to our table in time. Hits:   Butter chicken, malai kofta, vegetable biryani. Misses:  Desserts, including the gulab jamun, bengali rasgula, and especially the rasmalai. If You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Shalimar, Vik's Chaat Corner

Amber is one of the best Indian restaurants in the Bay Area and definitely stands out as a venue with fine cuisine at an affordable price. After exploring a variety of Indian restaurants over the past few years, I've settled on Amber as my "go to" Indian restaurant. The restaurant has an excellent ambiance and amicable staff that is welcoming, helpful, and responsive. The food quality is excellent - my favorite dishes include the Palak Paneer and Aloo Gobi, and their chai tea has an appropriate level of spices commensurate to traditional Indian chai (warning: it's also pretty caffeinated). All in all, I definitely recommend giving this place a whirl when looking for excellent Indian dining!

For years - this has been our go to place, for Indian food,  in the whole bay area. The food is consistently good. The service is friendly and the decor is decent. The butter chicken is outstanding, but everything is good. We have also catered food from them and they always do a good job. A few dings: location - little strip mall, but it has worked for them for years. The wine list is OK, the cocktails are OK, nothing special. The prices are reasonable, the food is authentic Indian and the atmosphere is great. I hear they have a great lunch buffet but I have never made it there for lunch.

I came to this restaurant for lunch, around 1:40 PM as I Iove Indian food and I was thinking that the area should have plenty of good ones. Well, this one does not below to the "plenty of good ones" list... Anyway, I chose the usual lunch buffet and here we go: The Bad: It is priced at $13, not including a drink so it is more expensive than most other standard Indian lunch buffet but if the food was worth it, why not. Well, the food was not worth it. Food was less than average, rice was overcooked, it became like Iranian rice, crispy. Choice of dishes was limited, sauces were running low to none and no one would even think to replace them. Service was not personal at all which can be good sometimes but with such average food, they could make a difference with excellent service. The restaurant look is simple but fine. If the price was lower, it would get to the 2 stars. Charging $13 for this is really affecting the rating this restaurant should get. The Good: Hum.... let me think?

This review is only for the lunch buffet. Another reviewer described Amber India as the "golden standard" for Indian buffet in the area.  I disagree.  Any such golden standard should have the following: 1) Large selection. If you are lucky, they may offer one lamb or beef dish. Otherwise, it's a couple of chicken dishes, several veggie dishes, naan and lots of salad items. Personally I don't go to Indian buffets for salad items. And the dessert selection is small compared to other buffets I've been to (and I've been to a lot!). 2) Reasonable prices.  On a recent visit I was charged just over $15 for the buffet, and that's without any drink!  This is $3 more than any other Indian buffet in the area. Zounds! 3) Adequate parking.  If you come here at noon, I wish you luck! That said, I do agree the food here is good, but I can't say it's the best in the area.  And the service is excellent and friendly.  The interior is also well furnished, with a slightly modern touch. Fresh naan is delivered to the table rather sitting on a steam tray.  But Amber India is not unique in that respect. Several other buffets do the same.  The dining room is also very cramped.  When the place is full, the buffet line actually blocks the entrance to the dining room or snakes very closely to tables. So much for intimate conversations. I think Amber India is coasting on its reputation. That reputation was built on a small, uncrowded Indian spot that used to be reasonably priced and relatively unknown.  That is not to say I wouldn't eat here again. It's just not a place I would go out of my way for any more. As for the golden standard of Indian buffets, I think Turmeric in Sunnyvale comes the closest. Plenty of parking, stunning decor, reasonable selection of delicious, unique items, and a few bucks cheaper at that.

Indian lunch buffets are the only buffets I like.  And I would rather have a smaller selection of quality items versus endless bowls of varying curries.  With the latter, my lunch ends up being a taste testing to find what items I really like... but the taste testing gets me full too. I wasn't sure why this place charged $13.95 for a lunch buffet.  They do have linen tablecloths and the decor is a little fancier but I didn't feel it was worth the money.  Right now, taking into factor the world's status, I would pay $8-9 for a lunch buffet and that's really reasonable from what I've seen. There are a lot of items that my plate was full and I had 6 more bowls to conquer so I left those for the second round.  Unfortunately those were all the chicken dishes which I found to be dry, even in the butter chicken.  Really shocking actually.  My favorite of the day was the paneer masala - great flavor, great texture, not the overly porous paneer I have at some other places but more like tofu. Another thing I really liked is the CHAI TEA.  Wow, it's really good here.  It's not too spicy; I've never drank a Chai that fast before.  It went terrific to the meal but also added to my fullness.  Fill your stomach wisely when eating at these types of places.

I've been to this place twice in as many weeks. Pretty good stuff, definitely more exquisite comparing to my run-of-the-mill corner Indian restaurants. The thing is, I love my corner Indian restaurants, and $40/head meals aren't really my thing. Mind you I have a lot of Indian friends at work and they are all good at sharing their food, so I can be hard to impress with the price/quality ratio. That said, I do appreciate food made with pride. Or anything made with pride (except for things that MUST be made with pride, like babies). 4 stars for the juicy, tender lamb that left me oblivious of the big hole in my pocket.

I love the ambiance and food at the other location in Santana Row, so I was so super excited to try this place for the lunch buffet.  Sadly the ambiance is kinda plain, the service was fine and the food pretty good but super expensive. Driving up it's a really shopping center but plenty of parking to be had.  The outside isn't very exciting and upon walking in the inside is very bland and boring.  It wasn't bad just neutral I guess.  I will say everything seemed very clean and orderly which is great when working with buffets. The service was efficient.  The buser/waiter wasn't friendly really but he brought nann, refilled our waters and got our bill quick.  Very efficient service. The food was good, my favorite was the chicken curry (2 types) but it wasn't amazing.  And with a $15 price tag for buffet lunch - ouch!  While there was a fair selection I just wasn't blown away by any particular dish.  They were all fine or good but nothing stood out.  Good food. I guess I had my expectations too high but it was good, not great and not great for the price.  While I would go again or recommend again I wouldn't go out of my way.

After a few hours spent getting myself and "Janet" H.  (along with Vy N.) ready for a Halloween party, we stopped by here to grab some food. Immediately walking in with our costumes, we got some looks from the diners but the staff were kind enough not to even bat a lash. I chose a vegetable curry based on our server's recommendation that came with naan. I made it garlic naan because, well, I like garlic naan! It came with a lentil soup and was really delicious. Be careful when it comes out because it is piping hot and I burnt my tongue on it. But it was so good! Definitely must come back and try some of their other dishes!

Fellow Yelpers, this is really the first time you disappoint me! This place is no 4-star, what's going on?!?! This place is like the P.F. Chang for Chinese food! Yes, ambience is great but it's totally overpriced and the food don't measure up! Don't get me wrong, I don't have problems paying these prices but the food better impress! I can go down the street to Taste Bud for half the price and better food. For the two of us, we spent $48 (tips/tax included) for 3 dishes: Mushroom and Cheese Roll - Maybe we shouldn't have ordered it.. this is way too americanized! It tastes like a regular egg roll, period. Mirchi Baingan Ka Salan (Pepper and Eggplant) - Yike! This is too creamy and has no favors to it Butter Chicken - It's good but average. This place is not very authentic. I expect indian food with lots of herbs and spices but the dishes here are very americanized (fried? creamy?) Not coming back. I feel ripped off.

The food would get 4 stars, but the service only gets 1, so I'm being generous and giving it an overall 3.  Every time I leave there I feel so cheated because I have shelled out for a decent meal with really sucky service.  The first time I went there for dinner, they claimed that they couldn't find our reservation, so made us wait for 30 mins for our table.  The second time I went there for dinner, my naan caught on fire (on one of their little table candle decorations).  They whisked the burnt naan away and didn't replace it--I would have rather had burnt naan than no naan at all. The third time I went there was for lunch.  They said that we would have our table in 5 minutes and we ended up having to wait 20 minutes before we were seated--I mean, really--a 20 minute wait on a working day when we already had a reservation!! No restaurant is worth that! The food is definitely better than the average Indian restaurant.  The items in the lunch buffet was a bit of a hit or miss.  They had a weird potato+soy dish that no one seemed to like and a strange combination of turnips and spinach that I'd never had before (nor will again).  If you don't mind aggravations caused by bad service, go ahead and check out Amber.

Haven't been here in ages, but I definitely remember the samosas and the lunch buffet were divine!  The tandoori chicken, lamb, aloo gobhi, saffron rice and malai kofta were my favorites. I'm sure I'm missing a lot here. I need to be more adventurous with Indian food.  But you can't go wrong with Amber.  The ambience is serene and the waitstaff are attentive.  They need one in downtown Sunnyvale!!

This place has definitely changed over the years. The interior decor has been remodeled and is modern and fancy. The weekday lunch buffet price has also risen to $13.95, but feature chicken-only for meat eaters...along with a dish of what used to be hot, but now cold fish...what happened to the lamb? ...out of everything that I had from the "hot entrees," the rice was warm while everything else was either cold, or room temperature...including the naan!!! The wait staff did promptly remove my plate when I went back for seconds....but neglected to refill our room temperature naan, despite asking... ...oh yes, a piece of my chicken was sour...perhaps it was putrid?

There are so many Indian restaurants around that most of them don't have  more than five people in them at dinner time. Amber is different. It was packed in there. I didn't really understand why until I had dinner. First, the decor is nice. It's not kitschy; just intimate and tasteful. Second, the food is good ... err maybe even great. I had the Palak Paneer, which is a staple I judge restaurants by, and it was excellent. The Karahai Chicken was pretty good. The assorted naans were hot and chewy; perfect for scooping up some tasty palak. Finally, the service is nice and they even distinguish themselves by serving the dishes for you. I really liked it. The only thing I could be unhappy with is the price. Though it was a good Indian meal, I don't think it was worth the $60 we paid. Oh well, it's not overpriced enough to prevent me from going again ... so I guess they accomplished the task of getting me to pay as much as possible without deterring me from coming again.

What a delicious meal I just had. The bf and I came here on a Thursday night for dinner. I had heard a great many things about this place, all good, and it certainly didn't disappoint. When I saw the outside of the place, located in a strip mall, I didn't think much of it, since I was there for the food. But once I stepped inside, I was very pleasantly surprised. It was really well-decorated, and the wait staff were all dressed in shirts and ties. Not your typical Indian restaurant for sure. We ordered the butter chicken and rogan josh with two orders of garlic basil naan and one butter naan. The butter chicken... It was divine. Definitely the best butter chicken I've ever had. The rogan josh was also very good, but I think it was overshadowed by the deliciousness of the butter chicken. Both types of naan were also done very well. Not too thick and heavy, or too crispy. Damage came to about $50 before tip, which is a little on the pricier side for Indian food, but if you want GOOD Indian, this is definitely the place.

Looks can be deceiving!  The outside makes the restaurant looks small and meh, but the inside is beautiful.  My bf and I went here on a "fancy" date and the lights were dim and candles were lit.  Good place to get your romance on! Pros: -Deee-licious food!  I don't know what I ordered, but the tandoori style lamb and chicken thingy was awesome!  According to my bf, and he was born and raised in India, this food was pretty damn close to being authentic. -Service was excellent.   -Indian beer was good.  Yeah that's right.  It was light and crisp. Cons: -Bit pricey.  I may need to search for hole-in-the-wall Indian restaurant.  Wait...do those even exist??? Bottom line:  Haven't been here since, but I'd go here again for a "fancy" date.  A general tip for eating Indian food:  do not workout right after.  It hurts like a bitch.

Everybody loves Amber! Just look at the buffet line at lunch, and the line outside waiting to be seated for dinner. I used to be lucky enough to live on the same block: Me: Hello Amber, I'd like an order to go Amber: Go ahead Me: Daal Makhani, Butter Chicken, Lamb Saag, Rice, Gulab Jamun Amber: 30 minutes Me: Love you!

Received a gift certificate here as a thank you.  Decided to take my mom becuase husband does not so much like Indian food. The food was fabulous! We had tandoori fish, vegetarian appetizer sampler and curried mushrooms.  Everything was amazing.  Daughter even ate some of the curried mushrooms, even though they were spicey!  We got her a mango lassie to cool her mouth down. The service was attentive, though I think they got a bit annoyed that my six year old is such a slow eater and then spent 10 minutes in the bathroom when she finished eating.  My mom said they brought the check while we were in the bathroom and kept checking to see if she had paid and putting it closer and closer to her, until she picked it up and put it at my seat, hoping they would leave her alone until I got back.  We had arrived early, but it was clearly dinner rush by the time we left. Now...for the surprising part. From the outside this looks about as upscale as your neighborhood burrito joint.  I have been to the Amber India Bakery and Cafe and had expected this to be a similar vibe to that.   But on the inside, it's all white table cloths, fancy decor, soft lighting, upscale. It was weird. The experience was so discongruent with our expectations that, even though the food was a good 4.5 stars, I am putting it at 3.5 overall.  If I get the chance to eat here again, I would reconsider.

We brought the kids to Amber for dinner recently and, despite the many spills we left on their white tablecloth and the several close calls we had with the china dishes, the wait staff could not have been more welcoming.   This over-the-top attentive and respectful service is what I've always liked best about Amber India (at both this location and the snazzier one on Santana Row)... and it just makes me want to come back again and again.  Of course they've got their "People Love us on Yelp" sticker up in the window, so I'm clearly not the only one with this point of view. I love the food here too, of course, though my young kids have not yet acquired the taste for much beyond the Naan.  My personal standbys include the Aloo Gobi, Butter Chicken and Saag Paneer.  We also tried the whole wheat Roti this time, and it turned out to be a great bread option for my son who's allergic to eggs (the Naan have egg). I'll be back again soon, though probably more often with adults than the little guys.

I was surprised at the interior of this restaurant after seeing the bright neon sign out front. The interior is polished,  the lighting is perfect, and the noise-level is fairly low. I would say this would be a great place to take your SO out on a date. The service was impressive, but also confusing because it seemed like we had 4 different waiters. I tried the following dishes, and they were all good: Vegetable Samosa, Chicken Tikka Masala,  Malwani Shrimp Curry, Kerala Lamb Curry, and the Garlic and Basil Naan. The meats were all tender, and the I dipped my Naan in all three entrees....Mmmm!

Not your typical neighbourhood Indian place, it's a bit classier inside, with above average service and food. This one is not as dressy as its Santana Row counterpart, but that's just what I want. Somewhere nice but casual. I've been here a couple of times and have liked it every time so far. I've had quite a few of their dishes, most of them are very good. The staples, like chicken tikka masala, is wonderfully flavourful, the veggie dishes well-spiced, and they have an interesting selection of goat meat and seafood, which isn't too common in other Indian places either. I liked their garlic naan too. Dessert wise, their kheer didn't strike me as being amazing, but I liked their pistachio ice cream and gulab jamun (deep fried dough balls in syrup). This is a perfect place to treat some out of town guest to slightly fancier Indian food (instead of just going to a good ol' buffet). However, if you want to impress a date, go to Amber in Santana Row instead. The interior will wow you the second you walk in!

Pros: This place is amazing.   A "pillar of the community" Indian family took me here and I have never looked back.   The food is of the utmost quality, and the fact that the lunch buffet is priced at market ($14 or so) is amazing.   Cons: None really!  If you want a more fancy location (their interior is really nice, but it is in an El Camino strip mall), you could try their posh Santana Row or San Francisco locations. Fun: Butter chicken (chicken makhani) is to die for--that is what keeps me coming back.  I have tried dozens of other chicken makhanis now and no one can match it...

We eat here often, which says a lot since there is so much Indian in the area.  The food is extremely creative, the menu is expansive, and the flavors are impressive.  It's a solid blend of approchable food and elegance.  The waiters actually serve the rice and curries onto your plate.  The food itself is amazing. We are vegetarian and have tried about 6 different dishes.  All were flavorful and well balanced.  Most are extremely creative as well.  The one complaint is that they do not ask spice level.  Most dishes were fairly mild, which is probably a good thing for most people.  So if you like it spicy - they will kick it up a notch for you. When we have friends and family in town, we almost always take them here - and their responses have been strong and all positive so far. Wonderful!

The setting is nice, but there are many Indian restaurants in the area that serve better food for lower prices. If you are looking for ambiance this is a good place to check out. The lunch buffet options are good. I liked that they had a variety of vegetarian dishes to choose from. Everything I tried was pretty good. Aloo Gobi happens to be my favorite vegetarian Indian dish. I ordered it on my second visit and was sadly disappointed. The cauliflower was not cooked thoroughly. I think I will stick with Janta for Aloo Gobi. I am glad I tried this restaurant but I don't have any reason to come back.

This was my first shot at supposed "authentic and delicious Indian cuisine" thanks to Yelper reccomendation. Personally, most of the chicken dishes were lightly spiced and perhaps for more of a Western palate. TBH? I certainly didn't mind. I tried the Chicken Tikka Masala for the first time and I have never liked the taste of tomato more! My chicken tikka was simmered in a creamy and lightly spiced tomato sauce served with a cinnamon scented long grain rice on the side. The rice is not included with your entree and neither is the naan. I was very happy with the flavors in my dish and the crispy/chewiness of the naan. Although, garlic and basil, I didn't really taste any garlic. The BF ordered a spicy chicken curry which he couldn't finish (he ALWAYS cleans his plate) because of spicy overload. Amber India doesn't mess around I guess. I definitely see Amber as a future craving. Side note: Staff was professional but a little on the serious side. Could've used a smile or two. Also, no wait around 7:15pm on a Friday night.

This is hands down the best Indian food I've ever had. And it was healthy although we did order a few very rich dishes. I went with a group of 6, we were never out of our chai tea or water as the waiters were attentive on the refills. We were dining with vegetarians and I mention this because I love hot wings... but we ordered this kind of spiced cauliflower dish and I kid you NOT... they tasted exactly like hot wings you'd get at a bar, although obviously much healthier. It was amazing. I also had a rich cheese and tomato dish and the tandori chicken. We all shared family style so I tried at least 6 different dishes and I was in heaven though entire time. It really was such a treat and I highly encourage you to go out of your way to dine here.

This is the first Indian restuarant where I tasted and enjoyed every dish!  We came here after I frantically ran around in the rain on Peacock Ave, Mtn View trying to recover my lockbox and For Sale sign from one of my short sale listing.   Bob's spring roll sushi and table grilled Korean style BBQ was delicious last night so I was willing to settle for something simple and fast: soup.  Pho was the first thing that came to my mind but this area is definitely not known for Vietnamese food.  Instead of going to Pho Y, we ended trying a new restaurant today: Amber India. They are open from 11:30 am until 2:30pm for buffet lunch. Most Indian restuarants regardless of how fancy they may be, serve lunch buffet style. The $14.99 was well worth every penny. They had every kind of curry imaginable : curry chicken, curry fish, curry goat, curry cheese, and even curry vegetable. My favorite here is the butter chicken, a rich creamy blend of curry spices with chicken. I am not a big fan of curry or anything that  tastes like armpits but we unanimously agree that this is a 5 Star Restuarant. It is Saturday night and after mass tomorrow, we have already decided to bring the boys here so they can experience a different type of food from what we normally enjoy : Vietnamese food.  I am looking forward to tasting the fresh naan, tandori chicken, and safron rice. Amber India also has a huge selection on their dinner menu but relative to the price, you will be better off eating the buffet at lunch. There is a second location at Santana Row.

Tasty, but waaay overpriced! I ordered butter chicken, veggie samosa (2 were included), 1 naan, and 1 rice for pickup.  The total was $25 and change!  Admittedly, it was pretty good.  The butter chicken had a nice rich sauce great for dipping your naan into, and a decent kick (I ordered spicy). However, I've had better. Perhaps it's a nice place for a sit down dinner, but as far as the food goes for the price, I can't recommend it and I won't be back.

Most amazing Indian food I've ever had! I love me some chicken tikka masala! We also had the best spinach dish, and the lamb. We ordered the Cheese naan and a plain one. As I entered in I was surprised at how nice it looked inside. I was expecting it to look like Naan N Curry. This place has nice white sheets and cushioned seats. The staff was nice, some looked kind of intimidated when we asked questions. Once we ordered it took awhile to get the food. I think it was a combination of impatience and hunger pains. I thought it was hilarious when the food did come, the staff actually put the food on each of our plates, it was really weird. I felt like telling them to stop, but it was awkward. The dishes seemed really small too, I'm used to the portions of Naan N Curry, but these bowls seemed very tiny. I was soo wrong! I was so full by the end of the night. The best thing was the spinach dish! It was so flavorful and creamy! We could tell the butter was in that dish, OMG I could eat that everyday! That's how you get your kids to eat their vegetables. Give them Amber India spinach. Only bad thing was the dessert. We had this ice cream noodle "boat" thing. Very weird to the taste. I couldn't handle that on my palate. Overall great food, can't wait to try the one in San Francisco.

This was a great place!  The customer service was really awesome, and the actual restaurant was well decorated. The location is interesting, kind of in a dark area, way in the corner of a little plaza.  There's plenty of parking which was good. I noticed a lot of people doing take out, as there were people coming in what seemed to be PJ's and basketball attire.  One person inquired about actually dining there while picking up his food to go when he saw me and my friends who were fairly dressed up waiting for our reservation time to come up. I got Indian Rain for a cocktail, came in a martini glass, and was pretty sweet (what do you expect right?).  With all the rain happening, I guess that was what was on my mind.  Though if it had Indian Sunlight, I might've gotten that instead =) Anyway, great place, I'd definitely go again.

I had an amazing dinner at Amber last night.  I had heard great things about the butter chicken (Shredded tandoori chicken in a tomato, butter and fenugreek sauce) and it definitely lived up to its star status.  I also loved the other dish we got:  Mushroom Mutter Makana (Mushrooms and Peas cooked with lotus seeds in an onion ginger curry). We also chose the Aloo Tikki (Crispy potato patties with subtly spiced centers) and Papadum wafers to start, and whole wheat and garlic basil naan with the meal.  All were exciting to eat and perfectly spiced. Amber is definitely my favorite Indian restaurant around.

We went on a Sunday, for the pricier and seemingly "extra large" buffet. I must say this is one of the most overestimated buffets in the South Bay. We paid $15 per head and there was nothing other than Chicken for the compulsive non-vegetarians. Though one of the three chicken preparations was pretty good (Kerala Chicken Curry - with a base of Coconut Milk), but the "kabab" was semi-cooked with very strong presence of uncooked spice on the outer layers and the "butter chicken" was very passable. The Indian "starters" / "appetizers" section was so-so and even my wife did not seem interested in second helping of the desserts. Next time, I am going to nearby "Passage to India" for a local Indian Buffet. P.S. Oh, yeah there was a kiddie birthday party going on as we were entering. A few kids were intently watching for the manager to leave his station so they could attempt to dislodge a huge hand-made vase nearby! I tried to look the other way.

This restaurant is great. Aside from the amazing food, I was able to go home afterward and not spit hot fire from my ass. That is a huge selling point to me.  I love Indian food, but at 90% of the places I've ever been my post-dinner experience is just like Jeff Daniels in Dumb and Dumber when his tea is spiked with Turbo Lax.   The service was impeccable, I felt like I was only being mildly judged by the waitstaff.  The butter chicken was just as good as others said, and the palak paneer was equally great.  I suppose a restaurant cannot continue to be one of the top 100 restaurants in the bay area for so many years on flukes.

Here's the thing of it: Amber India is an ecstatic experience at lunch. I don't usually like buffets, but theirs is fresh and yummy and varied every single time. I always leave super-satisfied, wishing only that I had had room to eat more. Dinner is another story. Every second time I go in the evening, it's tasty and unexpected. But the in-between times, it's no better than fine, leaning toward bland. Go with high expectations at 1pm, lower expectations at 8pm.

I had visited this place during my pre-yelp days and wanted to re-visit before i put down a review. So went there on a weekday night without reservation, was promptly seated, orders taken and the service was good. Would command a 4 stars i would assume We ordered the Paapdi Chaat and Tomato Soup as starters.  The Chaat was good but did not measure upto Viks Chaat in Berkley. The tomato soup was more like a curry with vegetables and not what i expected of an Indian soup. I wanted the food without onion but they got me the soup with onion, so was a straight reject! The guy taking orders did not listen properly i guess! The Malai Kofta gravy was kind of bitter and not upto my liking.The Roti was tad too cold. Overall not a bay area top 100 i would say! Food commands 3 stars if not less I had ordered a take away biryani and raitha for my friend who was hungrily waiting for me, but the package which they gave me turned out to be some left over food from our table!!. Man the service is definitely downgraded to 1 star Nothing great about the ambiance, a 2 star i would  say. Overall a 2 is what i give. I am not driving all the way to mountain view for amber anymore!

There is much better Indian food in the Bay Area for 2/3rds the price. You might as well eat at a better restaurant for what you pay here (the portions are small). I'd recommend Amber Cafe (Bits and Bites), a more casual setting but a better deal for your money over Amber restuarant's formal setting.

Amber India got me excited about Indian food again! I first came here in 2005 to try their lunch buffet, and I was deeply impressed. Earlier this year I started going back again regularly and really found out how much I love butter chicken. I ordered take-out through them a fair bit. The dining room is lovely, but it's a bit crowded on their busy nights, and also strangely *dark*. It feels a bit pricey as others have pointed out, but they are definitely consistent and flavorful. Personally, I think my favorite for Indian is probably Darbar over in Palo Alto. Try comparing them yourself and let me know what you think.

Three words: butter chicken + naan. All day, err day...when I am at an Indian food buffet. The only times I've eaten Indian food, I was at lunch buffets. Hrm, probably because I require access to unlimited naan.   There is a large variety of dishes whose real names I cannot begin to recall, but I do remember there being rich butter chicken with plenty of tender meat, roasty toasty naan, tandoori chicken, fish curry, chicken curry, zucchini curry, potatoes and green beans, peas and cauliflower, fresh veggies, some cheese dish, and many more. Me? I only have eyes for butter chicken and naan. I also tried my first mango lassi here, which turned out to be cool, sweet, smooth, quite tangy/yogurty, and full of mango flavor. The restaurant interior is rather cozy and pretty clean, albeit there is a lack of windows. Servers are very attentive about taking empty plates, refilling waters, and replacing vacant naan baskets. Lunchtime is a flurry of people, but the servers are always quick on their feet. Next time, my plate will be half buttery sauce with chicken and half fresh veggies (I am a rabbit when it comes to fresh veggies). With fresh and fragrant naan, I shall wipe up every drop of savory deliciousness and wash it down with a mango lassi. Side note: I came on a business lunch with my supervisors. I noticed a lot of other business-attire-clad groups coming in for lunch as well. Super side note: There was a girl wearing red cowboy boots. She was not. Pulling. Them. Off.

This place is just sooo gluttonous because of the fantastic lunch buffet.  Every time I visit for lunch, I end up leaving with an overly stuffed stomach and end up wanting to take a longgg nap or drink five cups of coffee. Plan on arriving early because after 12 PM, they get very packed, so you may end up having to wait for a table.   My favorite dishes here include butter chicken, fish curry, and the creamy spinach with corn.  Those are the most memorable but I also enjoy many other dishes, but I can't quite remember the name of those.   I love the naan they have here because it is fresh out of the oven and so crunchy.  It goes great with the spinach and the butter chicken.   Mango laasi is a great drink to cool off some of your tongue from some of the spices used, but the drink is rich so be prepared for it to bog down some of your appetite.   This restaurant is one of my favorite places to visit for Indian lunch buffets!

I ordered from Amber India for an office luncheon.  I called about a week in advance and Manjeet was very accommodating and helpful.  He suggested we try the butter chicken and palak paneer (spinach with farmer's cheese and spices)  Both dishes were a big hit. The butter chicken was covered in a flavorful sauce, moist and tender, and the spinach,  chopped fine and seasoned lightly...excellent!   We also had the Sea Bass Tikka- delicious cubes of Sea Bass seasoned with spices and lemon juice that enhanced the mild flavor of the fish - it melts in your mouth!   I will go back just for the Sea Bass, it's something I know I'll get a craving for. So good. The dal bukhara, the slow cooked lentils are another must have.  I'm a light weight when it comes to spicy food, so they were a bit too spicy for me, until I poured them over my rice, then I couldn't stop eating them. Excellent flavor. The food was delivered to our office so I can't say anything about the physical restaurant, but I'll be heading over there soon to try that lunch buffet everyone's yelping about!

It's in a strip mall.    But the inside of the restaurant is a nice decor and has a good vibe.   The food is some of the best Indian that I've had in the Bay Area.   The meat and vegetables that they select are very fresh and of a high quality.    The curry and masala sauces are well made, with a complex and refined combination of spices.  They do not over-power the food with spices.   Great value for the money.

This is without a doubt the best Indian restaurant in the Bay Area, and likely one of the best in the entire country.  From a demographic perspective, it makes perfect sense.  The Bay Area is probably second only to the Big Apple in terms of domestic foodie destinations - it's strength definitely being Asian cuisine (such as Indian). Mountain View is nestled in the heart of the super affluent  Silicon Valley - so lot's of well traveled techies with plenty of disposable income.  And Santa Clara county has the largest Asian Indian population in the nation percentage wise (6.4%).  And Amber is the very best of the proliferation of gourmet Indian restaurants that has resulted from the above confluence. It's located in an unassuming strip mall and the decor is still very typical Indian restaurant (though with a clean modern flair) but nothing about the food is ordinary.  The first thing I like is that the spice levels aren't watered down for newbies or tourists.  This is pretty much a given in the Bay Area, but trust me, if you live elsewhere - it's a big deal.  For me nothing ruins a meal at an Indian restaurant more than having to douse everything  with raita because I forgot to tell the waiter to make it extra spicy (i.e. normal spicy if you're Indian).  The menu is Northern Indian which means tandoori and lots of rich, creamy sauces.  I've tried about 20 different things on the menu and I can honestly say I've never been disappointed. The first thing you'll notice is the use of the finest ingredients.  All the meats are succulent and the vegetables are always crisp and fresh.  Many lesser Indian restaurants get away with cheaper ingredients because they mask it with flavorful sauces.  You get the best of both at Amber. The butter chicken is legendary and I must really say it is a stand out.  Personally, I hate having to order chicken tikka masala, "the pad thai of Indian food", every time I dine with a group.  It's like a cog: tikka masala + "x" other dishes... BTW tikka masala isn't even Indian, it was invented in Glasgow!!!  Anyway, I digress.  Butter chicken IS a real Northern Indian dish that it is quite similar to tikka masala and I highly recommend ordering it at Amber even if you are sick to death of its banal cousin that was invented in some pub in the UK... I've only had the lunch buffet once but I also highly recommend it.  The selection is huge.  I think I counted 14 entrees to choose from.  It's a nice variety of curries, tandoori meats, and vegetarian dishes.  Although sauce based dishes keep well (they often taste better the second day), the food is slightly better when you order from the dinner menu instead of eating from the buffet - but expect to pay more also.  Overall the cost is more than some are accustomed to for Indian (about $30/person) but it's certainly justified as the ingredients, preparation, and presentation are all first rate. Can you tell this is my favorite restaurant?  Indian food is my favorite cuisine.  I've eaten Indian food all over the country (NY, SF, DC, LA, Chicago) and the world (New Delhi, Singapore, London, Fiji, Tokyo, Thailand) and Amber tops them all.  I discovered Amber a couple years after it opened when I was living in SF and it is the restaurant I miss most.  Every time I go to SF on business I go out of my way to stop at Amber - it's the highlight of my trip.  Obviously the word has spread as they've opened up restaurants all over the Bay Area.  I tried the one in SF, and though it's still good, it does not compare to the original.  It's likely they dumbed down the taste a little for the "chicken tikka masala" financial district crowd...

I came here with a group of friends for a special occasion dinner. The food was AMAZING! We all were so into the food and everyone kept commenting on how awesome the food was. Their Chicken Tikka Masala is to DIE for. The lamb curry was alright, and the other curry we got was okay... but the Tikka Masala was a hit! I love how they have a bunch of different types of Naan as well. Garlic Naan was a favorite. I am coming back here tomorrow for some lunch buffet! I love this place :)

Every couple of weeks or so I have the following  conversation with a friend of mine:   "Hey, you want to get some dinner after work" "Yeah, that would be great, but nothing too expensive, I'm so broke!" "Oh my god, me too!  We'll just go somewhere cheap" Now, "cheap" and "Amber India" don't really go together, but we often end up going here anyway, some of our favorite dishes include the tandoori chicken ($18), butter chicken ($17), kerala lamb curry ($17) and of course, some naan ($3), add to that a glass of wine or two and our "oh-my-god-I'm-so-broke" dinner some how manages to cost us $70.  Funny how that works, isn't it?

My Indian food hating boyfriend dragged me to this restaurant so I was expecting a lot. Amber India exceeded my expectations as they have a very large variety of appetizers, clay oven baked meat, curries (various veggie, fish, chicken) and dessert bar! We made it for the lunch buffet 20 minutes before their closing time. The waiter warned us but we said it was fine--and proceeded to pile high multiple plates of food at once. We were starving and went a little overboard with the food! I especially enjoyed the fish and chicken tandoori curries. They used a type of white fish in their fish curry and it was delicious! I don't remember the names but they had some fried potato ball appetizers spiced with indian spices that were flavorful and unique. The warm basket of naan served was thick, fluffy and the perfect utensil to scoop up the curry. After stuffing out faces, I hit up the dessert bar and tried some Indian desserts that I've never tried before. The fried dough covered in a sticky glaze, rice pudding and fresh fruits was the perfect way to end my Indian feast. I was more then impressed with their lunch buffet and know it's authentic because many Indian families were eating there too!

We had the butter chicken and the chicken tikka masala.  Both were really good but still not as good as Naan N Curry, in our opinion.   We also ordered the onion and garlic naan. Both of them were really thin,  not that satisfying, and cut up into pieces so one order of naan does not mean one whole naan (the kind you get at naan n curry). The lamb kebab was pretty good, but don't mistaken that for the one on their appetizer menu, because that one was...not so tasty. The service, however, was horrible. We asked them for a simple request with our receipt and they said they would and could do it, came back with the wrong thing, then sent their manager to tell us that it couldn't be done when I know it easily could have since I've also worked at a restaurant once in my life before. Also a little overpriced if you ask me. 4 stars for the entrees and -2 for the service.

Amber used to be THE Indian restaurant in the Bay Area. I feel it has lost its touch. The food is still tasty but has too much butter and cream in it. It also tastes old - granted curries need some time to ripen but some stuff should not be coming straight from the fridge/ freezer. Thankfully they have dinner offers for $29 - very good value that you get out of that for two people sharing.

Just ate here about an hour ago! They had a special buffet to celebrate Diwali and the food was so delicious! Unfortunately for me, I ate too much because the food was that good, and now I'm about to fall asleep in my lowly cubicle at work. Indian desserts were really sweet today but I ordered a cup of Chai Tea to go with it, and that was a great idea! Been here before this too, and you can always expect good service and scrumptious but heavy food = )

I've always heard good things about Amber India, but have never gone for a couple of reasons: money (I'd also heard it was pricey) and geographic chauvinism (I live in SF and commute almost every day to Stanford, and damn if I'll go south of Page Mill). Stupid, stupid me. I finally went yesterday bcs a friend held her birthday dinner there... and I regret every moment of my life that I haven't had tandoori paneer in my mouth.  Holy god, I didn't even know one could tandoori paneer until last night, but there it was: a sizzling cast iron plate adorned with salmony-orangepink cheese cubes, all nestled in a bed of tangy peppers.  Today my vision was blurred by dancing cheese cubes, singing their siren song: we are so tasty, you want to eat us. The pakoras were tasty, the samosas as well--but they only offer a veggie variety (no luscious lamb pockets, alas).  The mango lassi was quite good: the yogurt was just a bit tangy, and not too heavy or thick.  They also had a strawberry lassi, which i'd never seen before; perhaps i will try it some time, if the lure of the mango abates somewhat. We got there on the early side, about 6 pm, and we were a party of about 15.  We got seated in a small room in the back area, and off to the side; all was fine for the first hour or so--but then the restaurant started to fill up, and the surrounding din became almost unbearable!  It may be that the front dining room is better for dates or parties interested in talking, not yelling, to one another, I don't know...  Service was also *incredibly* slow, but I wasn't sure if this was bcs we were part of such a large party.  Then again, we had a predetermined menu chosen by the hosts, so there shouldn't have been any surprises for the kitchen or waitstaff...  However, i'm planning on returning VERY soon, and as a party of two, so i will update then!

Every time my boyfriend and I go here, we're condescended to by the hostess, ignored by the waitstaff, and shocked by the prices on the menu -- yet we keep on coming back, which makes a pretty strong case for the delectable food at Amber Indian. Probably the first thing that needs to be said about Amber is that they're in a strip mall. Despite (or perhaps because of?!) this, the three times the boyf and I have gone, we've been told there was a half hour plus wait -- even though the restaurant was filled with empty tables. Yet magically, the moment we apologized and said we were going somewhere else, a prime-location table somehow opened up. And it's not just the host: the servers are a bit prickly too. Last time we went, the restaurant was three quarters full, and staffed by a veritable ARMY of servers (all looking sharp'n'stuffy in matching suits), yet it took over forty minutes to get our entrees after our appetizers were cleared, and over half an hour (and about seven requests) to finally get our bill. Look, Amber, you can be as snooty as you want, but at the end of the day, you're still in a strip mall next to a questionable massage parlor. Get with the program. The food though, oh, the food makes up for most any slight. Every time I come here, I taste some new, transcendent delicacy so exquisite that I doubt whether, up until that moment, I had truly experienced food. You guys, this stuff is delish. My favorites: the delicate aloo tikki, artfully drizzled in a trio of subtle sauces; the frontier naan, generously studded with nuts and stuffed with an impossibly rich raisin paste; the lamb biryani, which kind of makes me want to go out and become a Mongol emperor. Who knows? Maybe the snooty and inefficient staff is merely a hero's quest one must endure in order to get to this mind-blowing cuisine. But as you can see by my star rating, not even that drool-worthy frontier naan can totally erase the bad taste from my mouth. Bottom line: Amber India's food is exquisite, but all of their pretentious airs end up doing the food a grievous disservice. Amber: Stop sniffling over your strip mall location, give all your waitstaff a handful of No*Doz, and, mmm, can I have a refill on my ridiculously delicious naan please?!

This is a must, each time I visit the bay area.  I haven't found an Indian restaurant in my area that serves butter chicken.  My favorite time to visit Amber is during it's lunch buffet.  I don't eat enough to justify the price but I love the selection. My server today was great.  Water glasses, iced tea and naan refilled promptly.

Absolutely AMAZING service and ambiance - way classier than its unassuming outward appearance. Really good food as well.  A lot of other reviewers talked about the butter chicken so I had to try that. However, I was a little dismayed to discover that butter chicken and paneer tikka masala (the two things we ordered along with naan, rice, and samosas) come in very similar tomato-based sauces. Also, the naan was a little small and we had to order another midway through the meal. Overall, wonderful service and solid food.

A friend of mine used to go so often to Amber India that the chef would come out to great him every time we were in the restaurant. I don't blame him for going so often. Their Chicken Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken are fantastic. The thing is, every time I go to Amber India (unfortunately, not enough given I no longer live in Mountain View), I always feel a bit... giddy after the meal. It may be the garlic or some spices or it just might be that the food is so good. Whatever it is, I hope they keep it up.

Seems very popular and has great ambiance. I got takeout, and that was painless. I recommend the Barrah Kebab (lamb) because it truly is succulent and delish. I also recommend the Butter Chicken, or anything similar, because the pieces of shredded chicken are large, but all choice meat. Any picky eater would have no problems with this meat. No fatty pieces anywhere. Add the Navratan Korma veggie entree (creamy sauce with peas and small veggies) for the perfect trifecta. I'm not a Mulligatwany Soup expert, but I would skip that to leave room for the entrees. You won't be able to stop eating! Don't forget to order a separate Saffron Rice with each dish. The portions of rice are small and not included. (Or order the naan)

Everyone knows that the South Bay is heaven for indian-food lovers.  And while I lived there, no restaurant was more hyped than Amber India.  So when my Indian mother-in-law came to visit, we took her here for the lunch buffet. Not surprisingly, the place was packed.  It is indeed decorated very nicely, and the buffet selection was pleasingly large.  Still, while I naturally ate until I couldn't move anymore, I have to say it didn't live up to my sky-high expectations.  Now, quite possibly that's due to the fact that I had the buffet, and we all know that indian buffet food can be "dumbed down" a bit to appeal to a mass audience, in particular by not having enough spices.  So it would be interesting to try dinner here sometime.  Also, if I had just stumbled upon this place I probably would have raved about it.  But that's the way hype works: eventually the reputation just gets built up beyond what's realistic.

WOW! AMAZING food AND service. Nice and attentive staff. There was almost always a waiter standing at the corner of the small room we were at to see if anyone needed anything. We heard about this place when we went to dine at the Melting pot in San Mateo b/c our waiter there used to waiter here and he said it's very good. So we were very pleasantly surprised that it was just around the corner of our home, so we walked there! We ordered  Fish Tikka (Sea bass marinated in lemon juice and spices),  Chicken Tikka Masala (Chicken tikka cooked in a mild tomato sauce), and Garlic/Basil Naan. My hubbie ordered an Indian beer to try and I had a Mango Lassi. Everything was SOOOOOO good! Each dish was delicious. Our waiter made excellent suggestions.  I suggest you eat the fish right when it comes b/c it tastes the best very hot and fresh, melting like butter! The texture changes when it's colder. The service was amazing. I did not expect them to place the food on my dish for me, starting with the rice, pouring some Tikka Masala on it, then placing some fish on my plate. They came back to check a few times to see if everything was alright. We asked for more rice and it came right away. They even came to scrape the crumbs off our table after they took the plates away. This place is a bit more pricey than a typical Indian restaurant but worth it. Definitely a great experience and we can't wait to come back again.

Okay, I'm just another reviewer strengthening Amber's already rock solid 4 stars, but let me elaborate. This is a begrudging 4 stars.  Their food does taste good, but it is WAY overpriced.  In the vicinity,  I'd rather go to New Saffron Club for its cheaper and also yummy buffets. The naan portion that they give you is especially stingy.  Their service is pretty good, but the last time I was there, I thought the food took too long to come out. There's just not really anything about Amber that would make me want to come here over the other excellent Indian restaurants around here.  I don't see anything that the high price adds, but I'm still giving it a 4 stars because the food is good.

Sorry Amber fans, it just didn't live up to the hype for me. Nice restaurant with a great atmosphere and friendly, efficient staff but the food was just OK at best. I eat a lot in India and while this was more authentic than many Bay Area restaurants, the flavors just weren't right, far too bland and Americanized for the premium they seek for authentic Indian cooking. I can't think of one dish that was worth going for let alone anything outstanding.

MMM I would definately come back. It's in a plaza so it's pretty easy to miss. The lunch buffet is a bit on the pricey side but it does come with Naan. It was $13.95 per person. I basically filled up on rice and butter chicken. Their butter chicken is one of a kind. Their wait staff is friendly and very on the ball. My water was always refilled even before it was gone halfway.

Seriously, twice the price for 1/2 as good as I am used to in the Berkeley area. Spoiled, I guess, but Lordy- the samosas were luke warm and had a "day old" kind of quality to them. Not a good sign at the beginning of a meal, but we perservered. They brought out the traditional tamarind and the green sauce, (of which the name escapes me), as well as mango chutney (straight out of a can) and we ordered some extra pickles. We shared a tasty lamb dish (not memorable enough to remember the name) and a tandoori chicken, which I found to be really strange. I dunno- I like my tandoori meats to be neon red and have a texture that pushes back against my teeth, so the eating is a detectable kind of meat-teeth relationship. Have you ever over-marinated chicken in papaya? That fiberous texture you expect is compromised. This chicken was tasty, but a little too soft ,and there was nary a speck of neon red for my ever vigilant Dept. of Aesthetics. The garlic basil nan was completely lacking in both the garlic and basil flavors.  We skipped dessert.  The service was very good, though. Oh- and the address numbering system on El Camino Real is from a planet I had not yet been to. I suppose it makes sense from a city planning perspective, since it's a wide blvd, but really it's ass.

Best Indian restaurant in the South Bay, possibly in the whole Bay area. I usually prefer dumpy place with great food like Shalimar or Pakwon, than pricey/chic place like Roti at west portal when it comes to indian food. But Amber is the place that I'm willing to pay big bucks for. Atmosphere, service, etc., was just great. Food however, is just wonderful. We had the amber dinner, thinking that it'll come with tiny portions so we ordered extra naan and appetizer. But God!! It was a miracle or a great mercy of God that our stomachs did not explode. Food was so good. The chicken tandoori was tender and juicy, the lamb was just amazing, the spinach and cheese however is not my favorite, the vegie samosa was very tasty. The chai tea is free refill which is really really nice of them. The Kulfi was fantastic. Great place for dinner with your date or family or business people. Do not sit next to the kitchen entrance cuz you'll end up smelling like indian food for the rest of the week.

I just went to this restaurant for lunch today with my co-workers for our product launch celebration. I think that this is definitely one of the better Indian restaurants amongst the Indian restaurants in South Bay area that I have ever been to so far. The food wasn't insanely spicy or anything, and was very flavorful. We had a reservation for our group so there was no wait to get our tables, but I saw many people were waiting for theirs in a lounge. So, I think it is better to make the reservation if you go there during the lunch hours. I felt that the place was a bit too cramped to accommodate that many people, especially in the area where we formed the buffet line. Also, as compared to other Indian restaurants, I think that the selection of the buffet items is rather limited. While the food selection was limited, for the ones that they had, they were all good. The service was also quick and attentive.

I came here with a friend for her birthday.  She raved about this place, so I couldn't say no.  Walking in, the aromas that I inhaled were delightful.  I got very excited.  This restaurant had a very nice ambiance, it is small and cozy, but you don't feel crowded by the other patrons.  The wait staff was kind and attentive...never an empty water glass.   We ordered the chicken tikka masala and chandani gosht (lamb) with a side of rice and garlic and basil naan.  I love chicken tikka masala, it is one of my favorite dishes to order...I usually order that and one other dish at almost every indian restaurant I go to.  The chicken tikka masala was very good, I like it a bit more on the spicy side, this one was creamy and comforting but it didn't quite have the bite that I prefer, but still a very good dish.  The chandani gosht was really really good.  I've never had that dish before and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The lamb was so nice and tender and the sauce was creamy, but didn't feel too heavy.  I highly recommend ordering this if you like lamb.   Overall, this was a great place.  I love that it is small and intimate.  I definitely prefer Amber over Shivas.

This is a place I take guys on dates. It's cozy, even when it's busy. The food is off the charts. The service is impeccable.

I am so happy to have found a good  "with table cloth" Indian place in the Bay Area.  I have been in the SF area almost six years and, in that time, have discovered a number of hole-in-the-wall type Indian and Pakistani restaurants.  But until this past weekend, I'd not found a sit-down Indian restaurant that was as delicious as the divey places.   After reading a couple of newspaper reviews in the waiting room, I ordered the butter chicken.  It was beautifully seasoned and delicious.  Friends ordered the chicken tikka masala (pretty good) and the chicken masala (outrageously good).  There was some lamb curry ordered at the other end of the table which was also tasty, although I'm not sure of the name of that dish. Service was okay - nothing horrible, nothing wonderful.   It's worth the hour plus drive from my house - that's how good this was.

Great food and wine worth your time! Man I love Indian food and hate it when it's all tastes the same!  Not in this case, each dish was delicious and not overspiced...my girlfriend may disagree with that but she loved the food regardless.  Try the butter chicken and the dahl.  The dahl may be vegetarian but it has all the flavor and taste of a stock made from ham bones...that's right...mouthwatering!  The wine was also reasonably priced with very little mark-up.  We had the Cinnabar Mercury-Rising Merlot.  It was juicy and full bodied for a Merlot and just $30 for the bottle! Service was friendly and quite humerous.   This place is busy and I highly suggest reservations...adding on is a bad idea since there is a line out the door.  Oh and one more feather in the hat....lots of ethnic Indians...you know that's good stuff!

Amber India has become my favorite place for Indian food.  Despite the fact that the parking lot for the tiny strip mall that it is in is teeny-tiny.  Despite the fact that I would call it a hole-in-the-wall.  Despite the fact that the portions are just a tad too small for the prices they charge.   I love the food.  Chicken has always been nice and tender.  My favorite is the chicken tiki-masala.  Service is always above average, and I think its rare these days to find positive consistency in good customer service. I am not a big fan of their desserts, though.  And it's too bad they don't have a bar/lounge area.

The ambiance was such a surprise! It looks deceivingly cheap from the outside, but the inside is a nice, well-decorated sit-down restaurant. I celebrated an anniversary with my boyfriend here and it was a great date spot. We came on a Saturday night around 8pm and had to wait about 15 minutes without a reservation. The food was pretty good. We had the samosas (vegetarian) and drinks to start. He just ordered a Heineken, but I got the Amber Passion cocktail, which was really good! We also had the butter chicken and the rogan josh- both were yummy. When they served us, the waiters spooned some rice onto both our plates and then gave us both servings of the two entrees. The waiters were really attentive and our glasses of water were constantly refilled. Overall, the meal was a bit more than $70 for the two of us, which isn't too bad. I thought it was a nice spot to eat.

I was amazed at how clean the restaurant was, this is upscale Indian food. We got pretty common dishes (butter chicken and a lamb dish). Amazing! The curry was the perfect consistency and flavoring. The naan is also very good. On top of that, the service was great! Treat yourself to Amber one night, you won't regret it!

YUM!  I was craving Indian food and decided to try this place out based on the awesome Yelp reviews.  I raved about it to friends and colleagues afterwards, and a number of them were already big fans. My husband and I shared the Amber Dinner, which included Green Mixed Salad, Seekh Kebab, Palak Paneer, Tandoori Chicken, Ceylon Chicken Curry, Saffron Rice, Naan Bread, Gulab Jamun, and Tea/Coffee for $ 29.95.  Very reasonable!  Incidentally, it was Lent season and I had given up rice, so I was really happy to have the naan.  We also had an order of a seafood dish...it was either the Madras Seafood Curry or  Goa Fish...which was tasty as well, and not spicy at all. I'm so glad I live close by.  Can't wait to go back!

I like Indian food... a lot. That said, this place was just OK. I thought this place was way over priced... though I eat small portion sizes so maybe that is why it didn't seem worth it :P They had a lot of authentic stuff--its laid out buffet style--and my Indian coworkers were really excited over the dessert dish... it was like a creamy white rice(??)... it reminded me of rice pudding actually. I found only one chicken curry I absolutely loved, but I couldn't find it when I went back for seconds... they all looked the same :( (So make sure you pay attention to the names of stuff :D) Also there was a vegetable side, cucumbers &(cant remember!!)... and it was SO WEIRD because it really hurt my mouth. LOL... I seriously gagged and had to grab a napkin. Perhaps I am allergic (most likely not) but I have never had to do that before in my life!! No side effects either... just a really bad after taste :P That's all I have to say about Amber! Go spend your money somewhere else! :D

After only living in Sunnyvale for 8 months, my boyrfiend and I were regulars here.  The staff recognizes us and they're so friendly and accomidating.  I've also been to the Sanata Row location, and it doesn' thave the same feel. They've decorated it to be modern and swank and as a result doesn't have the same authenticy. My favorite dish is the Chicken Tikka Massala...I know, the most generic Indian Food there is but so so good. (BTW, the Butter Chicken sauce at Amber is the same as Tikka Massala but TM is white meat only, which I prefer.)  I also LOVE the vegetable samosas, so flaky and fried and flavorful. There are only two bummers about this restaurant. 1. They tend to rush you through so if you're looking for a nice, long dinner you'll have to turn the servers away. 2. The servers don't have specific tables, so you're always having to say no thank you to repeat questions. Honestly, I refer everyone I know to this restaurant. It's a little on the pricey side, but every dish is delicious and served quickly while hot. Five stars.

This used to be my default Indian restaurant until I found Janta. A lot of people go here for the buffet but I'm all about ordering from the menu. This way the chef is focused on the dishes and everything comes out fresh.  Some of favorite dishes here which are mostly unique to Amber: Fish Tika - Sea bass marinated with lemon and spices Mirch Ka Gosht - Lamb w. Pepper, Chillis, Ginger, Safforn (nice and spicy) Paneer Pasanda - Cheese cooked in almond and cardamom sauce Prawn Garlic Kebab - Prawns roasted in garlic and chilli paste. I've also tried the Amber in Santana Row but only for lunch.  Even though I don't care for buffet it was pretty good and surprisingly cheap (not sure if this was because it was during the week ). If you want the full experience from Amber definitely order from the menu and go for the things that they specialize in.

It has 100 reviews already so: - It is nice and posh which is tough to find for Indian - a good date place. - Yes, the butter chicken is great.  Get it or something similar. - Check a map before going.  El Camino changes numbering right around there making it a bit hard to find.  It's in a mini strip mall with a video store.

Note: I have only been here for the lunch buffet, but the lunch buffet is why you should come. Everything here is good and not prohibitively expensive.  The selection of food for lunch is amazing with a complete repertoire of salads, sauces, veggies, and some meats.  They bring you free naan with your lunch.  The service is attentive and you are ushered through quickly without the feeling that you are rushed. Their butter chicken is outstanding.  I love the rice pudding and fresh fruits for dessert.   I've had some really yummy vegetarian dishes here as well.

First off, this is not a cheap place. Many dishes are $15-$20, vegetarian dishes around $14 With that said, I believe the overall experience, wonderful atmosphere, and especially the quality of the food makes it completely worth it. Everything was outstanding, nothing was even slightly mediocre. Service was professional, helpful, not pushy or obtrusive, and our water glasses were never below half full. We had the garlic basil naan with the saffron rice as sides. I'm partial to lighter, crispy naan that's not too bready, and it was great. As entrees, we had the butter chicken and paneer elaichi pasanda. I initially ordered the butter chicken and malai kofta, a paneer dish, but the server kindly let me know that the malai kofta had the same sauce as the butter chicken and recommended the paneer elaichi pasanda, which honestly was the star of my experience. It was creamy, delicate, and delicious. All in all, I'll always return to Amber India for special occasions and times I just really need an exceptional dinner.

People seem to swear by this place.  I've been to this location and the Santana Row location a few times now and have been underwhelmed by the food.  By no means is the food bad, in fact it is very average.  In no way though does is live up to the hype. On my most recent visit I had the chicken "kadhai" and the achari gosht which were both ok.  I did like the basil and garlic naan quite a bit.  As as appetizer I had the vegetarian samosas which were average - lacked a bit of kick. Beyond the food the service is fast and friendly.  If I'm going to be eating Indian food in the South Bay/Peninsula I'll just rotate between the dozen Indian restaurants along El Camino (including Amber). Oh, and the prices are steep here for the offering.

This place is really good, however, their selection at the buffet is not as broad as Bombay Garden in Fremont. (Don't get me wrong, they do have a decent selection.) It's also a bit pricier than I expected. (I think it was $16 for lunch buffet?) If you want more buffet selections to try for a cheaper price, check out Bombay Garden in Fremont, CA. As for dinner, we specifically ordered: Assorted Vegetable Platter (Samosa, pakoda, harra kebab & papadum) $ 8.50 Vegetable Samosa (Crispy patties stuffed with spicy potatoes and peas) - LOVED these. They came out super fresh and crispy. Vegetable Pakoda (Mixed Vegetable fritters) - These were pretty tasty as well. Harra Kebab (Cottage cheese and spinach kebabs) - Not sure if I am a big fan of these. I think the flavor of the other appetizers overpowered this one. Papadum - These are okay, but personally, not my favorite. Butter chicken - I loved the butter chicken here. It was really yummy. Lots of flavor but not very spicy so you can enjoy the food. A little more spice would be nice though. Rice, mango lahsee - Delicious. I'm not sure how you can really screw these up. This place is definitely more of your upscale Indian restaurant, most likely catered to non-Indians (although during buffet time, I did see quite a few Indian people there so it can't be that "Americanized"). I'm not a total Indian food connoiseur, but I know I've tasted good Indian food (in London, as well as restaurants recommended by Indian food lovers) and this place is great. But be prepared to spend a lot more than your average tasty Indian food joint. You can depend on this place to be fresh and tasty every time. You won't be getting the typical indifferent service as well. The waiters are super nice and friendly, and your water cup is always filled. They also answer your questions without being annoyed/rude. Good job! =)

Okay, I'll admit, it's expensive.  That's the only negative comment. This is flat-out the best Indian food available on the Peninsula, possibly on the entire West Coast. The chicken Tikka Masala is out of this world!!!  We used to trek all the way to San Francisco for Indian food before discovering this place.  Nothing in SF even comes close.

YUUUUUMMY!  This place is delicious - and I get picky about what Indian food I'm having.   "Expensive" but not a bad value -- I have so much leftover that it's worth the price. Chicken Tikka Masala (about $18):  has a wonderfully balanced tomato/fenugreek gravy.  It was sooo good with the garlic naan.   Palak Paneer: Paneer w/ spinach (about $12):  has a really good garlic flavor to it with a real fresh paneer.  Never had paneer as good as this.   Tandoori comes fresh out of the oven on a sizzling plate.  There are seafood options too.   I didn't know Falooda meant "noodles" though.. so on the dessert menu, Kulfi Pistachio Ice Cream + Falooda is just that.  I thought Falooda was a dessert drink?  I guess I was wrong.   mango lassi ($4) is good for calming your senses/stomach if the curry is too much for you. Guys, you can't make this stuff at home easily (unless well, you're Indian and have family to teach you).  This place is where you go to experience what you can't easily.   When I went, I got a table right away on a Friday night at 7pm.  It was packed though.  All sorts of people -- ethnic Indians and others.  Seeing natives (ethnically) is always a good sign that this food is authentic and up to par.   The outside of the restaurant looks crappy (It's in the Olive Tree Plaza) but inside is totally furnished and real nice.  Dim lighting so even good for a romantic dinner.  GREAT service too.

Yes people... the hype is real!  Amber is really, really good. I'll start by saying that I've had the lunch buffet a handful of times.... it's sooo good.  I wish I had an extra stomach that I could open up for times like that! I've also had takeout, and it was equally good.  I really can't think of anything bad to say about amber... although it doesn't look all that appealing from the outside.. but what a gem inside!

Hard to compare this experience with my last Indian experience at Shiva's in downtown Mountain View. Both serve exceptional food. Tucked quietly in the corner of a small "L" shaped plaza. It's dark around this area and I almost missed the turn in! Use Carl's Jr. across the street as your landmark. If you pass Carl's then you've missed the restaurant. There's plenty of parking as the restaurant is the only store open in the plaza during dinner time. There's also a nice waiting foyer. It can get busy, so I recommend making reservations for parties of more than 4. We went as a party of 5 and were nicely situated in the middle of the room on the only round table. Actually, there's 2 rooms. The front room is where the bar is located. There's only two pages to the menu. They are big on chicken and vegetarian dishes here. For five people, we ordered 2 appetizers, 6 entrees and 3 desserts. There was some take-home food. They're specialty drinks were very appetizing. I'll definitely have to try them next time. I unfortunately, decided to be adventurous and tried the jiljaru - spicy mint and lemon drink. It was not what I had in mind at all. I did not like it. I'll stick with the lassi. My favorite dishes of the night were the butter chicken, samosa, lamb dish, and spinach cheese. I don't remember their names. The servers bring the food out all at once and actually serve you each dish on your plate. They provided complimentary rice. Everything was flavorful and tasty. Naan was great as well! I hear the Indian Chai is good as an after dinner drink. That is in my list to try next time.

Came for the lunch buffet and filled my plate with a little bit of everything.. or so I thought.  Apparently there's a second table where the butter chicken and lamb curry lives. I, being a rookie, filled my plate with all the veggie items from the first table. By the time I tasted a bit of everything on my plate, I was full. Everything kinda blended in together so I have no idea what was what.. but it was all good (albeit it bit greasy). Next time I'll get a taste of the chicken and lamb.

I can't pronounce (or remember) most of the names of the dishes we ordered here. If I had a menu, I'm sure I could awkwardly point at them like I do when ordering. What I can do is describe the color and contents of the food we ordered. The vegetable samosas were OK, but I've had better at hole-in-wall and take-out places. We had to try the Buttered Chicken (creamy orange-y sauce w/ chunks of chicken) after reading rave reviews about it, and it was pretty good, but I was more into the other orange-y dish (with fried cheese dumplings) we ordered. I wasn't impressed with our lamb dish (smothered in white-colored sauce). It was chewy and somewhat bland. Still, this is one of the better Indian Restaurants I've been to. The other things I really did appreciate were the great service and the upscale ambiance. I just don't understand the hype though. Sure, it was good, but I expected much bigger dishes. We were full at the end, but I suspect we filled up on naan. I just expected a lot more for my money. Maybe I feel like I got ripped off because it looks like just another strip mall Indian place. (Now if I went to the Santana Row location, I might feel differently.)

I ordered the okra, lamb biryani, raita, chai and garlic naan. I couldn't have been more pleased with the meal. Everything was so fresh and well prepared. Okra was firm and served dry (no sauce) yet full of flavor. I've been craving it ever since. Biryani was cooked to perfection with soft moist lamb chunks that were not fatty. Flavor in the biryani were very nice. Chai, naan and raita were basic and did not lack anything. I'll be coming back here next time I'm in the southbay.

When I was in India, I stayed at this fancy hotel for foreigners which had a rooftop restaurant.  Locals don't go to the restaurant, they think its overpriced Indian food.   Amber India reminded me of that restaurant.  Its good, the service is very expedient, the food is good, but I am not sure its worth paying a lot for Indian food.    Indian food is unlike a lot other cuisines in that more expensive Indian food isn't significantly better than cheap indian food.  Come here for a nice occasion.  They do serve your portions of the food which few Indian restaurants will do.

Extremely flavorful food without a ton of grease, within a pleasant dining atmosphere.  I ate there on the early side for a Friday dinner (6-ish). Service was prompt even as more people started trickling in.   Three of us had naan, rice, butter chicken, daal, and a cool yogurt dish with carrot slices in it. My friend introduced this to me on his way back to Palo Alto for a 5th-year business school reunion. How'd he hear about it? His friend (who's half Indian) discovered this place on the recommendation of some other peeps in the know. Viral marketing at its best!

Amber India is excellent.  You wouldn't guess it by it's cover.  The original location is set back off the street in a non-descript strip mall.  If almost appears like it's closed.  But trust me, try the door, you won't regret it. From the beginning, the staff is always very courteous and attentive.  We have always been sat very quickly.  The service is excellent, it seems as though you have 3 or 4 serves taking care of you.  Your drinks never get below 1/2 full, and your silverware gets replaced after each course, and the food is served onto your plate. The food is excellent.  Each dish is spiced to perfection, with unique flavors.  Some of our favorites are the Masala Scallops, Butter Chicken, and Chandani Gosht (Lamb). Amber is not cheap, but it is absolutely worth every penny.  I would highly recommend to anyone.   Haven't tried the Santana Row location yet, but maybe we will give it a shot.

Hubby and I love this place! It's our FAVORITE Indian restaurant. We discovered this place when we both lived in our "nest" in MV a few summers ago (I needed to live close to Palo Alto for my summer associate position at my firm). I'd never been a huge fan of Indian food before, but this place is so yummy! And I have yet to find another Indian restaurant that's even remotely as good as this place. Hubby and I are both huge fans of the chicken tikka masala. We were adventurous and tried some other dishes, but the consensus is that the chicken tikka masala is the best. Their butter chicken is also quite good (and similar) to the chicken tikka masala. I also love the type of chicken they use: juicy, fresh, large pieces of white meat. The service is impeccable, and it's a very nice place to have lunch or dinner. The only con is it's quite pricey for Indian food, but considering this is a "classier" place, I guess that's part of what you're paying for. Warning: even though there are 3 locations in the Bay (the other two are in SF and Santana Row), their menus are DIFFERENT, and they prepare the SAME dish DIFFERENTLY. Case in point. Went with Hubby a few weeks ago to try out the Santana Row Amber India for the first time. Ordered the chicken tikka masala (which wasn't on the menu). Definitely did NOT taste the same, nor was it as good as the MV location.

Best Indian buffet I have ever experienced.  Everything was delicious and the selection was incredible.  It was nice and busy in there which is great for a buffet because it keeps the food fresh!  I did not find anything very spicy which is probably so that they can keep everyone happy.  So if you can't handle super-spicy Indian food, you will be fine at Amber.  Service was impeccable and the chai was lovely- nice and strong. There were even some things I had never had before (especially the sweets) and it was fun to try.  I will certainly be back!

With over 500 reviews and an average of 4 stars, I'm not sure this restaurant needs another review. Amber India serves up flavorful Indian cuisine at a consistently high level of quality and service. In all of our meals at this location, the food was prepared, cooked, and presented impeccably. As many reviewers have already noted, Amber India is located in the South Bay, where there are numerous Indian restaurants that offer very good food at a significantly lower price. My recommendation is this: if you're looking for Indian cuisine and you can't afford to go wrong, i.e. introducing Indian cuisine to a friend, going on a first date, entertaining potential clients, etc. pay the premium and enjoy a fantastic meal at Amber India.

This is pretty much the standard against which I compare every Indian restaurant I go to in the US (the only place that has come close so far is Banjara in East Village, NYC). The service is always pretty good and the ambience is nice too. The Santana Row unit they opened several years ago was not quite as good initially because they tried to do some weird fusion thing with the food, but they came to their senses in the last couple years and now they do what makes the Mountain View original so amazing -- high-quality traditional North Indian food. This is what I usually get, all of which is consistently mind-blowing: Chicken Tikka Masala Kadai Paneer Malai Kofta Saag Paneer Onion Kulcha / Butter Naan Their lunch buffet is also amazing (albeit somewhat pricey). They have all the great dishes that you would order under normal circumstances, and they even have a Chaat station, which is pretty rare among buffets I've been to.

Quality is ok, but selection is nothing to write home about. The buffet is about 10 dishes on a good day. Together with a tip, it pushes 20 dollars. Not worth it. Overpriced, overrated Indian joint, patronaged by multitude of Valley's Indian families. Skip this one and go to New Saffron a bit north down on El Camino for huge selection for less money.

Dinner was OK, but not worth the prices.  We went without reservations on a Saturday evening.  Not advised.  We waited over a half an hour.  Reservations are definitely the way to go.  The restuarant is not large and fills up quick.  Wait staff was efficient and friendly.  The butter chicken was excellent.  The lamb curry was mild (even though I asked for something stronger), but still good.  The Mango chutney was almost an americanized preserve.  The raita was subtle and tasty.  Our waiter was nice but smelled bad. 01/14/2007

I ordered take out and was pleasantly surprised to find my food still warm by the time I sat down at home.  However, for $20 I was a little surprised by how small the bag was, but hey it's supposed to be the best in these parts right? The Chicken Tikka Masala was great.  The sauce was complex, tangy, spicy, sweet.  I loved how it hit my palate different ways with each bite.  The chicken was good, cut to manageable pieces, great with the sauce.   Big negative was that my naan tasted day old.  It was tough and chewy.  I feel like they threw it in because I was taking out and couldn't  complain once I got home.  Boo on day-old tasting naan.

Just ate here with my gf based on the recommendation of fellow Yelpers. First off, the service is excellent.  We were asked how we were doing multiple times throughout the meal and our water never reached below half full. As far as the food goes, the Subz Ki Shammi (Spinach and cottage cheese kebabs) were delicious.  For my main course, I had the Malwani Shrimp, which was good but not great.  My gf had the Chicken Tikka Masala which she described as "not too sweet, which is good because sometimes they put in too much garam masala and the chicken was tender."  The price on the shrimp dish was really high, around $20. They were really skimpy on the rice, but the naan (basil and garlic) was delicious. I do want to go back one more time to try the Palak Paneer and the Chai tea as other reviewers had recommended.

Why is it that the best places always look awful from the outside.  This place is located in a small strip mall and if I hadn't been introduced to it by a friend I never would have stumbled in.  But what can I say?  Only the best Indian around. The Palak Paneer and Butter Chicken are both mouth watering and to die for.  The tandoori chicken is a must-try and put it all together with the scrumptiously warm naan bread and you won't want to eat for days.  The wait staff is friendly and genuine and they never charged us corkage!  Been back several times now and can't wait to go again.

Went here with the family on a Wednesday night. By the time we left (7ish) the whole place was packed with people having work dinners. I wasn't too disappointed with the serving size despite what I had heard about them being small on Yelp. Yes, they cost a little more than at other places but I think the quality makes up for that. Here's what we got: Pakora/Samosa - perfectly cooked; crispy, hot, and not too greasy. Samosa crust was very good. Tandoori chicken - very tasty, wasn't the artificially red colored version thank god. Butter chicken - wow...the sauce was so delicious, creamy and...buttery. Tandoori Shrimp - a bit dry but very flavorful Fried cheese and potato dumplings(?) - forgot the actual name but this was very tasty as well. I could handle being a vegetarian if it tasted like that. Sauce was similar to the butter chicken sauce Vegetable biriyani - seemed like frozen assorted vegetable(saw a few lima beans) were in here but it was still good. At least they weren't overcooked. Naan - i was a little disappointed here. i think because they were so thin, they dried out really quick. I prefer thicker naan. Service was great. Food came out promptly. Same with finished plates. Water glasses were kept full and if our cocktails were empty, we were asked if we wanted more.

Yay!  Finally I can write something nice about an Indian restaurant! We went there for the third time today in 2 1/2 years. Each time we come out saying something nice about this place -- the first time we were there we liked the decor which is very upscale and comfortable! We went for a buffet lunch which was $15. The buffet wasn't huge unlike other Indian places but the selection was decent and tasty. Also, some of the items on the menu were not the usual stuff like the tikka masala variations you find in other Indian restaurants. The second time and the third time we went for dinner. The food is tasty and mild. But the only complaint I had would be the price for the amount of food you get -- it is a little on the pricier side and the portions are O.K. But if you are looking for a nice cozy Indian meal for you and your partner -- this is definitely recommended!

quality - they brag about the ingredients of high quality, but too bland for average indian. Food is more of americanized, hence you see lots of non indians. Price- Not worth writing home about. Location: It is in some strip mall, good luck finding parking on a busy lunch time. Clientele - Mostly non indians. (either very expensive or not authentic for most Indians, it is just my opinion). Management/waiters - Arrogant, mainly trained to please non-Indians.

Its another one of those pretentious Indian places. The food is okish, but a tad bland, I assume to suit the palette of its clientèle. The prices are definitely on the steep side, and the portions arent very big. Plus the waters try to upsell a lot which is irritating.. The ceylon chicken curry is good though.

Great Indian restaurant.  More upscale than the average Indian restaurant in the area.  Waiters were good and friendly.  We had the Chicken Tikka Marsala, Lamb Korma, and Cochin scallops and all were excellent.  We've just spent a month in India and this place has food as good as any you will find there. YOu could impress anyone by bringing them here.  Don't confuse this with the Amber Cafe some six blocks down the street which is run by the same people but is mostly a take out place.

My father wanted to go out for Indian. Yes, this is an opportunity for another shameless plug for Yelp. I decided on Amber after reading a few reviews and checking the online menu. It wasn't that busy when we arrived around 6 on a Saturday, but by the time we left, the restaurant was full and so was the waiting area. The smell wafting from the kitchen was wonderful. The waiter suggested the Mixed Grill and Butter Chicken and we added Saffron Rice, Garlic & Basil Naan and Dal Bhukara. There was a lot of "this is so good" and "have you tried that yet?" being said at the table. I would order anything from the Mixed Grill on it's own except the 1 shrimp on the sizzling plate was overcooked. My favorite, the Butter Chicken, more than made up for the poor shrimp. I was a little worried because the word butter was in the title but it had the perfect amount of creaminess with a little spicy heat. The sauce wad perfect for scooping up with the Naan. I thought the prices were a little high but we enjoyed the food. I'm looking forward to going back for the buffet lunch or the Amber Dinner. Next time a will forego the Amber Cosmopolitan, Chai and Kulfi Falooda dessert. The ice cream tasted like vanilla with very few pistachios and the small pieces of noodle at the bottom of the bowl didn't bring anything to the party.

Weekday lunch, a step above other buffets with a more formal environment and white tablecloths/glassware. A bit expensive too. Not particularly my cup of tea but decent lunch crowd in attendance. Liked the buffet selections, and could discern a higher level of cooking than I am used to seeing in Indian lunch buffets. I enjoyed every dish I sampled,and I tried to get a bit of each. Loved the taro root, butter chicken was unusually flavorful with lots of ground almond, and the palak paneer was a brilliant green and addictive consistency. I only ate a plateful but quickly began to feel stuffed, like uncomfortably stuffed, bloated. That feeling stayed with me for several days which was unfortunate. I tried to figure out what might have caused it and I am thinking it might have been some ingredient in the palak or perhaps too much taro? I am normally not overly sensitive and I have had Indian food many times. I still do not know and part of me is curious to go back and see if the sensation is recreated. I had lots of the paneer (because it was really yummy) so I am cautiously accusing it.

HELLA far from Ess Eff, but if you find yourself at a women's tennis tournament at Stanford, hungry and up-to-here with all the shiny, happy, white people, get yourself on El Camino and step into an equally happy, shiny setting, but with a little more flavor. Other Yelpers have expounded on the outstanding food so I won't go into detail on the oh-my-god-so-good butter chicken, coconut lamb, scallops--but the most remarkable thing I found about the place was the service. We called ahead but could only get there right at 9:45 pm (this is the suburbs, I was reminded) when they stop taking orders. They asked the kitchen, who said they would take us--score! The food came quickly and they even brought an extra side dish as an apology for having us order so quickly! I found this above and beyond given that we were the ones inconveniencing them. I know enough restaurant owners to know that seeing desperate, starving people come through your doors at the final hour is like coitus interuptus, so I am extra grateful. Once the kinks get worked out the new location in SF, we'll give it a whirl. If you're a peninsula kid, count yourself lucky you can indulge your Amber India craving on demand!

Despite Amber's positive reputation for its food over the years, and many of my Indian friends wanting to go there, it is always with much hesitation that I pay $14 for a buffet lunch when I can get equivalent quality and often better service at several other establishments in the area.  Granted, my Indian food intake is limited due to the presence of my mortal enemy, the cayenne pepper, so do what you want with my review. I don't know if there is some perceived extra value for the extra cash, but I'd rather not fork it over for the few things I can eat there that won't blow open my gut.

Whoa...oh, oh...Amber is the color of my eaterie... So when it comes to Indian food on the Peninsula, this is my favorite place.  My Indian friends also generally agree, so that must mean something. My Wife said that she didn't like Indian food, so I took her to Amber, and now she loves Indian food.  I told her that she just didn't like 'cheap' Indian food.  You will see many people complain about the prices...and to be fair, the prices are high for this genre of cuisine, but I still think Amber is the best. It is true that you can probably get Indian food that is 80% as good, for about 30-50% the price.  Hey, that can be said about some fine Cabernet's too! I would drive from Palo Alto over to Mountain View for Amber.  My experience is that the Mountain View location is a lot better (food wise) than the Santana Row location.  But, that's based on just 2-3 data points at Santana Row. Is there really any place better on the Peninsula for this genre of cuisine?

I am still dreaming about the butter chicken.  We got seated at a crap table (I suppose that's what happens when you show up a few minutes early for your reservation), but it sooo didn't matter once the food showed up.  I think there's a more limited selection of cocktails here than at the Santana Row location, but that's okay -- the food more than makes up for it. EDIT:  We've been back two or three times since I posted this review (with reservations), and never seated at a "walk-in" table again.  I have nothing but love for this place.  You may wait a few minutes even with a reservation, but it's worth it.

Me and my wife checked out the weekend lunch buffet today ($13.99). First off, loved the presentation and ambiance of this place...classy....unlike most Indian joints.  Let's see if the food matches up to the nice environment (food and ambiance are usually mutually exclusive in Indo food restaurants). Mini samosas - good and crunchy...the filling seems to be a puree though. Butter chicken - awesome stuff, rich and creamy Tandoori chicken - Now, that's what I'm talking about!! No, artificial red color, no dryness, no gamey meat segments...just good and good Mushroom Mutter - solid Chaat bar - had all the fixinings out for "Pani Pure" "Chole" - nice touch desserts - gotta love the fresh melon tray and kier, jilabees too... Overall, service and food and ambiance were all above par. Tad more expensive than most lunch Indian buffets, but you gotta pay to play I guess.

Amber India is my favorite Indian restaurant. Their prices are a little high, but the food is good quality and delicious. The butter chicken is amazing as well as the tandoori chicken tikka kabab and the naan. I like the vegetarian lental dishes, but I do not know the names of them. Amber is always crowded and filled with Indian people, therefore it must be good Indian food, right!? I would recommend making a reservation, so that you don't end up waiting too long!

Love, love, love Amber India!  My friends took me here when I was visiting them.  A few weeks later and I'm still thinking about the food I had here.  My sister and I ordered Dum Aloo Bukhara (Danish potatoes stuffed with mint and apricot chutney and cooked in rich gravy) for $11.50.  It sounded like such an unusual combo that I just had to try it.  We also ordered saffron rice for $1.95 and Assorted breads (Onion kulcha, naan and mint paratha) for $ 8.50.  The rich gravy had a wonderful flavor to it.  Potatoes were hearty and smooth.  Mint apricot chutney was a nich contrast to the gravy and potatoes.  I love all bread but my fav was probably the onion kulcha. My friend ordered a spinach curry: Palak Paneer (Spinach with farmer's cheese and spices) for $10.95.  Also tasty. Service was very courteous.  Wouldn't say fast but restaurant was packed so I'm not blaming them.  The waitstaff scoops a serving of each dish onto each diner's plate when they bring the food out.

Mmm.... naan and butter chicken. I am always in the mood for Amber India.  I could eat naan and butter chicken and nothing else for a whole week.  Unfortunately, that would also cost a ton of money, which I don't happen to have. The paneer is also quite good, but let's not mess around.   When it comes to the buffet, it's all about the butter chicken. Auuuughhh so good.

Their buffet, which on that day came out to about $14 dollars a person, is fabulous. Great selection with "plain" vegetables to satisfy those who need that neutral-tasting-fiber dose. I would say Amber is friendly to the Western palate, in that their food is spiced, but not excessively hot. What I mean is they use authentic and fresh herbs and spices, but you will not have to drink 5 glasses of water after every bite. I wish I knew how to get there by bus from the City!

Worst Indian food I had ever had in bay area and with those outrageous prices. Last week we ordered Gobi Manchurian, Aloo paratha and Mirch ka Ghost. Gobi Manchurian was too tangy. Aloo Paratha was the worst I had ever eaten in my life, not stuffed properly and too much dough, uncooked that too, yuck! My husband ordered Mirch ka Ghost and garlic nann. He had a similar exp with the Mirch ka ghost, no spice, no taste. Would never visit here again.

The original Amber India, before they started to expand and become trendy club-like restaurants. While all of the other Amber India restaurants serve great food, this menu has not been changed -- it is more traditional than the one's in SF and Santana Row, but just as good (if not better, in my view). If you wondering where to start on the menu, I have two words for you -- Butter Chicken. Outside of that, their Navratnan Korma rocks, and so does their Lamb Vindaloo (if you like spicy). Equally, Saag dishes aren't overly salted, like many other restaurants I've eaten at in the area. They are one of the few Indian restaurants i have ever seen do tandoori lobster - which rocks by the way. Although I am gluten free, I have heard the Naan is to die for -- especially the stuffed Naans (i.e. frontier naan). That being said, everything else on the menu is pretty much gluten free -- just tell them beforehand. Anyway, it's hard for me to drive by this place when I am in the Mountain View area and not stop in to get takeout for my wife and I. I'm a big fan of this place -- and a side note... it was also the first Indian restaurant I tried, where I fell in love and had a 3 times a week affair with Indian curries. MMMmmmm Butter Chicken...

Minus One Star for Price Minus One Star for Service Two Stars for Food Three Stars for sweet and yougurt Four Stars for Pani Puri (the small bubbles like snack) We have been visiting this facility over few years since we liked the Pani Puri. Over the time, the quality of food and service came down drastically while the price was jacked up skyrocketing. Prepare to pay the Tip forcibly. Conclusion: If you want to eat pani puri by paying high price and rude pricing while next to none in service quality, go for it. If not.. try something else

Amber India was the only place in Santana Row that was not completely booked for NYE dinner. I was just going to spend a night in with some old college friends, but at the last minute one decided he had to have a countdown, and thus he arranged everything. We set dinner reservation for 10pm, which is super late for me to be eating dinner, but it was ok since it was a last minute effort. When we got there exactly at 10, we discovered that the usual a la carte eating had been replaced with buffet style service, which is what they usually do for lunch, set at 35 dollars a plate. Also since it had become buffet for nighttime the tables just weren't moving as fast as they normally do. So our reservation got pushed back 30 minutes. While we waited we sat at the bar, I had a mojito which was delicious, and my friends had various other drinks. But the best thing that we discovered here was Zen Green Tea liquor. Mixed with just tonic alone this drink was YUM. It tasted like soda with a slight kick. I wanted to ditch my delicious mojito for this. After we were seated we rushed over to the buffet tables. The seafood curry was fantastic in flavor, although I wished there had been more seafood in it. Then the butter chicken which is a staple in Indian food for me was just the way I liked it, slightly spicy, and then the naan was perfect. I didn't like the ocra or the eggplant which weren't cooked soft enough for my taste, both were kind somewhere in between cooked and not cooked. Nevertheless because of the wait, we were treated to free champagne and all was forgiven. It was super dry, but it was smooth. Finally for dessert they had on display a chocolate fountain and ginger creme brulee. I'm not particularly fond of the ginger in my creme brulee, but my companions seemed to like it. This meal experience was up and down, but based on the overall experience and my experience before, I'll settle with 4 stars.

Excellent food, excellent company, excellent service. We closed the place down (admittedly it was a Monday night, but even so). Very attentive service, even after our group gabbed for an hour or more after dessert was served. All the food was excellent - the lamb in particular was totally melt in your mouth.

Amber is one of the best Indian restaurants I have eaten at.  The lunch buffet offers a wide range of dishes to choose from.  I personally loved the tandoori and butter chicken.  The food was not overwhelmingly spicy, but rather very flavorful. However, I found the goat to be bit chewy.  There wasn't that much to choose from for dessert though other than jalebi, fruit, and some sort of pudding. Overall,  I would recommend this place to anyone who likes Indian food, or wants to try it.  :)

Thumbs up from somebody on the east coast.  Places in Boston are not nearly as nice as this restaurant.. and did I mention this place is a buffet?  I came with a friend who I trust with food... and really enjoyed it.  Oh... and because of the number of people who come for the buffet, the turn over for the food is so high, it's almost like ordering 12 things from the menu.  The chicken mekhani is fantastic btw. Plus.. the waiter flirted with my friend and we got a free mango lassi out of it.  Can you beat that?

So, I've been hearing about this place for 1 year now. That coupled with the reviews and my expectations were high. After all, all I hear is how this is the best Indian place in Mountain View if not the Peninsula. I left disappointed. My Garlic Naan was soggy and might have been the worst NaaN I've had since I've been here. The Butter Chicken was above average but not spectacular. If you really love the "butter" part, you'll taste it more than other restaurants and it's blended very well. Other than that, the sauce barely has any hint of spice and lacked any imagination. Thus far, I still prefer Godvari, Temptations, or Shiva's

Amber India is my favorite indian restaurant for one reason alone: the quality of the food, which is what my five star rating is based on.  I could take a star off for the minor annoyances, but the food would get an extra star from me anyway, so five it is. The service ranges from decent to underwhelming depending on the day.  Getting your water refilled can be typically frustrating.  If you enjoy having your food pretentiously scooped out onto your plate for you, you're in luck.  Frankly, I can't stand it.  I have arms and I would much prefer you bring my food and disappear until I need my water refilled or the check.  I like my dish over rice, not with the sauce smeared pointlessly across my plate, which they ALWAYS do. I come to Amber India and exclusively order the Chicken Tikka Masala.  It's amazing.  If you don't like your indian food with some sweetness to it, you might not like it, but for me it's perfect.  The flavor is rich, tomato-ey and just sweet enough to offset the spice.  The chicken pieces are well cooked and usually almost falling apart tender.  If you can't deal with as much spice, get the butter chicken, which is fairly similiar but not as spicy. Although it's extra, the quality of the rice is pretty good.  Firm, but watch out for the cardamom seeds that flavor it.  If you bite into one, you'll never forget the overpowering flavor.  The naan is also good, and the onion kulcha even better.  If you dip it into the sauce you get with your entree, it's a fairly filling meal. Amusingly (or annoyingly, depending on your mood), if you come here and have several people order the same dish, some servers will ask you disdainfully if you wouldn't like to try some other dishes, as if they're offended!  I explained this phenomena to a friend moments before we ordered and sure enough, when we both ordered the Chicken Tikka he was questioned as if he'd made a mistake.  However, he loves his food as spicy as it gets, and when he challenged them to make it "as hot as you possibly can", he was not disappointed. Amber India isn't cheap, but having eaten at a number of indian restaurants, the only other one with a flavor that can come close to competing is Shiva in Mountain View.  Temptations was very good but the tiny portions were off putting. The ambience is decent if you care about that sort of thing, and on weekends, it's very crowded.  Frankly I've discovered that if you're close enough, it's better to get your food to go.  They package everything in fairly large and well sealed containers so I'm convinced I'm actually getting a little more food, avoiding the service I don't really care for and saving yourself the tip as well.

My favorite Indian food in the Bay Area, and I love Indian food. I prefer the Mountain View location to the SF location (haven't been to the Santana Row one) because the flavors are richer and just overall tastier. The lunch buffet is great--tasty and the restaurant is super clean.  For dinner, the food is great as well. Love the chicken tikka masala and the okra dishes a lot.  My only issue is that in principle, I feel like all dishes should come with rice; not here. Nothing comes with the meal, so a few orders of rice and all of a sudden your bill is $10 higher. Overall, it's pricey, so don't expect a cheap-o meal. But it's tasty and has good friendly service.

This is a review of the lunch buffet only. The food is delicious. There is no debate that this is excellent Indian food. 5 stars. Minus a point because they kept running out of plates and service was oddly not friendly. But, since it's a self-serve buffet there wasn't much service required and I was too happy eating the butter chicken and naan to care. Come hungry, the buffet will run you $13.95 plus tax and tip.

Did the buffet thing here today, and while I thought it was a good meal, I'm not a raving fan. First, it WAS a good buffet....small, but lots of choices.  "Interesting" choices in some cases, but still, choice, as a rule, is good. The tandoori chicken was truly excellent.  GOTTA hit that.   So why the lack of stars?  Well, this has to be the first Indian restaurant I've seen that puts mushrooms in many of their dishes. So, one of my fav dishes, chicken masala, I couldn't eat, as I'm allergic to fungus in my food. :-( Most of the other curries were just strange.  I'm sure that there is a demand for fish curry, but not at my table.  Ditto for eggplant curry (that just seems so wrong on so many levels). It was also one of the more expensive Indian buffets I've eaten at.  So, like I said, it was good, but there are just too many other Indian buffets in the Bay Area to make this a regular.

The Amber Restaurant in the Yerba Buena Gardens is right near our condo and looks very fancy. There were many atimes we thought about going but everytime we opted for something else.  When my cousin decided that she wanted to a birthday dinner at Amber India in Mountain View, it was going to be our first time trying the food at this local chain. The restaurant in Mountain View looks nothing like the one in SF. The one in Mountain View is located inside a strip mall and has a very traditional Indian feel to it. The wall is lined with reviews from Zagat, newspapers, etc. We had about 7 people for dinner and we decided to order a whole littany of items: butter chicken, chicken tikka, scallops, sea bass, cauliflower, lamb, garlic naan, samosas. We definitely ordered enough to satiate the appetites of 7 people with plenty leftover. The food was very delicious, very flavorful, the smells were pungent and very spicy! Service was also good as they came by to refill our waters and they brought out a knife and plates for us to share the birthday cake. Overall, a very yummy Indian dining experience.

Everything was delicious!  Between about six of us, we had about 5 dishes and I loved each and every one of them.   Service was excellent and there was still a decent size crowd despite the early dinner hour.  Simple decor and everything just feels cozy and comfortable. Some highlights: Mulligutwany Soup (yummy!), Tandoori Chicken (perfectly moist and oh so flavorful), Shrimp curry. They also have a pretty extensive vegetarian menu.  Can't wait to check out the Santana Row restaurant.

Very good Indian food.  Their chicken tikka masala isn't as good as Shalimar's, but this is not a hole-in-the-wall takeout place.  Good place to have a nice sit-down indian meal, have a drink, and share with others.  I went here with a large party and they had no problems accomodating us. The Santana Row location is even nicer and has more modern decor.

Fantastic Indian food! Ok, so I am sentimental about Amber India because it was my first Indian food, and you never forget your first... but past that, the Butter Chicken is TO DIE FOR!!! For those who are wondering what in the world is Butter Chicken- it is like Chicken Tikka Masala, but a hundred times more delicious because it has the dark meat and the white meat. I've probably had everything on the menu, and I've never been disappointed. Location is hysterical- Amber is tucket away in a dark corner next to a tanning salon and a dry cleaner... it's a well-hidden gem.

I'm of the opinion that I have no real basis for comparison with Indian food. Beyond good and not good, I have no idea how to distinguish excellent from pretty good. The Chronicle cites Amber India as the best Indian you'll find in the Bay Area and that's all I have to say in terms of a review. We liked the Butter Chicken(Shredded tandoori chicken in a tomato, butter and fenugreek sauce) $16.95. Achari Gosht(Lamb cooked to perfect tenderness in pickled spices) $16.95 was a little spicy and less enjoyed by the table. I was indifferent about the Dum Aloo Bukhara(Danish potatoes stuffed with mint and apricot chutney and cooked in rich gravy) $11.50 The breads were okay, not standout. Garlic and Basil Naan(Naan with garlic and basil) $ 2.95 and Keema Kulcha (Leavened Indian bread stuffed with spiced minced lamb) $ 4.95 The Jaljira (Spicy fresh mint & lemon drink) $ 3.00 was not to our taste at all. It tasted like something you'd want to dip your naan in, rather than any sort of palpable drink. Salty, spicy, and sour all at the same time--a party for your mouth.

I used to love Amber. Their sizzling panner tikka was the best in town. Unfortunately, in the past 3 years, service and quality has steadily gone down. We went there 2 nights ago as a party of 8. The service was substandard (I personally had to stack the used plates and walk to the front desk to request to be attended to). Besides, I ordered a salt lassi. It was the worst salt lassi I have ever had. It was sour to the point of being spoilt! I returned this immediately saying it is too sour. They did not even take it off the bill. I expected more from this establishment. I have been coming here for the past 3 years. I have noticed a steady decline. I have been disappointed enough times that I have decided never to go back again.

I hit this place for lunch with the guys from my office one day and it was really good. Seeing as we were there for lunch we did the buffet thing. In my opinion, indian food is one of the few cuisines that works really well in a buffet. Although this may be because im pretty ignorant of indian food. I love the stuff, and one of my good friends in college was indian, but i have to admit that i don't know as much about it as i'd like. Because of that buffets work well for me because i can just load up some rice, the scoop up whatever looks good (usually about 90% of whats out), lay it on top of the rice and enjoy. Usually i try to keep it pretty light for lunch, otherwise i'll have trouble staying away at my desk in the afternoon. The food was so good though that we all went back for a second round. The office was pretty quiet all afternoon after we got back. I think we were all pretty knocked out. I will definitely be hitting this place again, this time for dinner, and hopfully expanding my knowledge of indian food. But for now give me some chicken or lamb dish over rice, a few pieces of naan; finish it up with a tall galss of lassi and im in heaven.

This time we came back for the lunch buffet.  There was actually a 25 minute wait on a Saturday at 1pm!  I guess the rainy weather makes people want warm, comfort food. The lunch buffet has a pretty good selection, with a lot of the standard items.  The fish curry was a bit more interesting and unique, but my favorite was the tandoori chicken, of which there was breast meat and leg meat.  The chicken was perfectly moist and had a nice, slightly charred crust to it. The naan was fluffy and not drenched in butter, which I prefer.  There's also a nice dessert table that everyone was crowded around. I wasn't super sleepy after, which indicates there's not an excessive amount of MSG.  Water was poured quickly, and plates were cleared promptly.   At $15 per person, it was more than I expected for a lunch buffet, but the quality of it was pretty good.

OMG! My boss took my team and I here for lunch.  The place is kind of hidden inside of a parking lot, so you would never really be able see it..but what a hidden gem. My boss is persian and very picky about food so if this place is good..it's gotta be good..and he was on point! The buffet was crazy amazing! Typical indian stuff...the daal, pankora, curries, butter chicken, masala, the garbanzo thingy, the peas with the cubed cheese, omg..my mouth is watering typing this up...tandori chicken, really perfect warm to crisp naan...like wooooow! I think I just had a foodgasm! TOO good. It is a bit pricey and I've had another indian place just as good as this one..only 2 so far that has met above expectations, but this place was kind of expensive..I would still experience it though.  If you see a lot of indian people up in here, you know its good..it was packed with indians..so that tells you something.  Def try it!!

I'm going to be honest, when it comes to indian cuisine, I am usually happy sticking to the regular americanized fare- butter chicken, naan, lentils, and because of this, I have become some what of a expert in these dishes. The butter chicken at Amber is some of the best in the Mountain View area (and given the plentiful number of places that serve this dish, that is saying a lot). The chicken is always tender, and never dry and overcooked, and the sauce is the right balance of creamy and spicy. I also recommend trying the frontier naan, it's filled with dried cherries (I think) and coconut. YUM!

Oh Amber Amber! The king of sauce and queen of Indian food. Their only problem is the huge amount of excellent competition at slightly better prices. Amber is great Indian food. If you like Indian and you haven't tried Amber you should go there this weekend, bring some friends. I think their specialty is their sauce in all forms. It makes the butter chicken melt, it make the spinach flow. Be sure to try lots of dishes with their luxurious sauces. The food, the dessert, excellent. The problems? A little pricey, which is fine, but it's just not spectacular. There are many other, different, and equally interesting Indian finds in the bay. Their food may not be as smooth as Amber, but they are usually smaller and more interesting. Go to Amber, enjoy it, but also check out lots of other south bay Indian.

This is it.  My favorite Indian buffet in the whole world, and for one reason-Butter Chicken.  The water glasses are refilled frequently-a key factor in evaluating Indian restarants, and plates changed out at a good pace-but I do remember waiting for the check a few too many times.  Alas, even the buffet here is rather expensive-but I will still fight you to go if I'm in the South Bay around meal time. UPDATE, 11/12/06:  It had been two years since I was here, and never for lunch.  Was here on a Friday night with a group of four.  With an 8:30 reservation, we probably waited 15 minutes.  The food was fine, but bland.  We had someone with us who didn't like Indian food because it was too spicy, but she was fine with it.  While I would return for the lunch buffet (Over and over and over) I'm afraid the bloom is off the rose for me at supper.

Not bad, but I'm not sure this place lives up to SF Chronicle's rating of being one of the "Top 100 Bay Area Restaurants". We arrived in the parking lot outside this restaurant -- in a small generic suburban strip mall -- and almost left after seeing no signs of life (there are no windows and the door was covered on the inside with cloth). But the door (opened up to reveal a rather large restaurant inside, with a half dozen people sitting in the waiting room. It took a while but the food was good, a bit better than your average Northern Indian restaurant, but nothing extraordinary. Overall it was a decent dinner, although I'd say that the palak paneer was a tad salty and the garlic naan was a little dry. The thing is that there are so many other Indian restaurants in the Bay Area, some of which actually kick ass (and will remain my secrets for now :). I don't see myself coming back to this place as regardless of what SF Chronicle may think, I'm not convinced the prices and reputation are justified.

I can't believe it's taken me this long to actually come to this restaurant.  I've heard so many good things about Amber that it seems a little ridiculous that I haven't been here sooner! We headed here for the lunch buffet.  I was happy with the number of selections, but the area that they set up the buffet is seriously narrow and I'm not a big person!  (Ok, I do have a big purse and that probably inhibited two person passing in this little area) The veggie dishes were great and I was really impressed with the pumpkin dish.  I only tried the butter chicken from the three meat selections and it was great.   Two minor things I wasn't happy about: the naan wasn't as good as I've had at Amber at Santana Row.  Hmmm...maybe just a fluke.  Also, I thought $13.95 for buffet was a bit high.   The thing I really loved was that we could call ahead to be placed on the waiting list. A little far from my work or else I might be here more frequently. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Update (8/17/2008) I came here for dinner with a couple of co-workers.  I was ready to be wowed.  I had a glass of wine and my co-worker was intrigued by the Pink Elephant cocktail.  The description sounded so great, but it ended up tasting just like cough syrup.  Hmmm.   We ordered Palak Paneer, Butter chicken, Rogan Josh, and Vegetable Koorma.  I like everything, but felt let down by the naan.  It was probably the worst naan I've had.  Quite disappointing when the naan at their Santana Row location is pretty good!

Wow this place is expensive. Maybe it's my fault for doing a take-out order. I mean, who gets food this expensive and doesn't stay for the ambiance, right? But wow. OK the food was very good and clearly high quality. If it was half the price, I might give it 5 stars. But I've had a lot of Indian food in my time. Some of it was just as good or nearly as good, and some of it was better. But it has NEVER been that expensive. Never. I might go back here, if someone else was paying.

There are three locations for this Northern Indian restaurant, Mt View, Santana Row, and San Francisco.   The Mountain view Amber misses a 5 star review due to location being at the back of an unremarkable parking lot facing El Camino Real. I thought the interior table layout was kind of strange.  You could get a bad table location here, but fortunately we were against the wall by the kitchen. The quality of the food was great, table service was excellent, and the price was fair for an semi-upscale sit down restaurant. Cleanliness was good, but could elevate the ratings if they improved it a bit. We had the Rogan Josh (Kashmiri lamb curry), Palak Paneer (Spinach with cheese and spices, equivalent to Saag), and the yummy garilc and basil naan. All was delicious and flavorful (not too spicy), and portion sizes provided us with leftovers.

I love Indian food and because this place was so highly recommended, I decided to try them out. First of all, this is a great place for a first date. The ambiance is good, reasonably noisy, and the wait-staff are great. I ordered the chicken koorma and the lamb curry and I enjoyed it both. I also had the basmati rice and naan with the meal. The koorma is good with its creamy sauce and the pine nuts and the lamb curry was also good. It wasn't the best I've ever tried but it was still pretty good. Although this place was good I was surprised by the small portion size and the price. Although I was full at the end of the meal, I didn't feel satisfied with the meal and didn't feel inclined to go back. In fact I haven't gone back since my first visit 5 months ago.

I heard so much hype for this restaurant, specially when they opened a branch in Santana row. Recently I went to the one in Mountain View for a lunch buffet group, and I am not impressed at all. I am not an Indian , or an Indian food connoisseur, but I did not find anything special about their buffet compared to other Indian buffets around bay area. Their food was mediocre. The place was packed  (because of the hype and their awards on the wall), the buffet section is very limited and TIGHT to move around. I bet the one in Santana row charges even more , just because of the location. I don't compromise my meals for ambiance. Background: My ethnical background is Brazilian and Chinese. I have yet to find any cuisine that can match the variety and taste of either Chinese or Brazilian cuisines.

After reading that Amber India was the best Indian food on the Peninsula my English boyfriend and I went down for a visit last night. The food was outstanding.  The waiters were very friendly and made recommendations.  We opted for the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Kerala Lamb Curry.  We stuffed ourselves silly and can't wait to go back.  My b-friend says it was the best Indian he has had outside of England.... I give it 4 stars only because it is slightly more expensive than it could be.

The Service at Amber India is phenomenal.  The service was quick, attentive and very courteous (They poured our beer, were friendly, used crumb combs and were overall a great staff.)  The food is great as well and based on the food and decor only I would give 4 stars but the addition of the wonderful service makes this a full 5 star experience. The onion naan was excellent.  For my meal I had the Lamb,  Mirch Ka Gosht.  My friends had the Chicken Masala.  If you ask for it hot then be prepared because it is HOT but very good.  The food was so good.  The meats were tender and cooked to perfection. Again, the staff shines during the main course.  The presentation is excellent.  They prepare your plate for you, laying a bed of rice then your main course. If you demand great service to go with a great meal then you will not be disappointed at Amber.

WoW..World of Warcraft..no, just kidding! I went there the first time, and I had the Amber Dinner while my gf had the Vegetarian Delight. Mine was a lot of meat, and it was good but maybe too much, so following the law of diminishing returns, by the end of the meal I was stuffing myself. In fact  I had to get a box to bring some home. We paid a pretty price, the food was good, but nothing to go home and talk about. I would have given it three stars. Fast forward a year. My gf apparently was craving some juicy Indian food and we came here again. This time we got the salmon masala and she got the Vegetarian Delight again. The fish was really delicious, and very very juicy! Recommended! Together with the different little dishes that came with the Delight, it was the perfect sized meal to split two way. Top that with a couple of cocktails, and very yummy indeed. I would definitely go back and order that same combo!...

Appears to be another of countless Indian restaurants on El Camino, in a small parking lot next to a nail salon. We were surprised to find it has won some accolades (SF Chronicle Bay area top 100). The restaurant has a nice feel to the inside, white tablecloths and professional and courteous host and service staff. The food is moderately priced (slightly higher than average Indian restaurants in area, standard meat entrees $15-$25) and a carefully constructed menu (not overwhelmingly large, but covers all classics and has a large selection of both vegetarian and meats (including chicken, goat, lamb, seafood).

I was here for the weekend lunch buffet, which, in addition to the regular buffet, includes a little chaat table (this wasn't an accidental discovery - I love chaat and ensured that we'd be here on the weekend). Everything was extremely tasty - what else can I say? I'm a vegetarian, so I can only comment on half the offerings, but they were all delicious. Everything was freshly made and appropriately spiced. The chaat stand was a little haphazard - all sorts of ingredients just sitting in bowls with no clear instructions as to how to combine them - but when you put everything together, it tasted pretty good. The naans were served a tad too early (we'd barely served ourselves the appetizers), so they were cold and hard by the time we got to our main meal. Given the awesomeness of the meal, I expected more of the desserts, which were just passable. The chai was just like what you get in India - perfect. The service, as others have mentioned, was attentive. But when we hung out for a little while at the meal (trying to rouse ourselves from our food coma), they kept checking the receipt to see if we'd paid several times - so perhaps they were over attentive. Anyway, all things considered I would totally go back here.

Service definitely gets a 5 or higher- changed our seating when the party next door was too loud to carry on a conversation, were very attentive throughout the meal, and were respectful. There is a beautiful entryway, dimly lit (relaxing!) dining room with enough space in between so that your conversation is not your neighbor's. The smell when you walk in the door puts you in a good mood right away! The food was really good- I am no good at remembering names in Indian so I'll say it was the okra and the eggplant with peppers. The eggplant with peppers had me at hello- just a little spicy and definitely could taste the peanut flavors. The okra (and I must admit I have not spent a good deal of time becoming an okra expert) was spicier and had a nice texture to it. It seemed there were several vegetarian and seafood options on the menu for people like me who don't want to eat things they could visit at a petting zoo. All in all a lovely evening- and from what I saw, good for groups too (especially the front room).

Maybe it was the hype... But I wasn't as satisfied then i thought I would be with their lunch buffet. The tandori chicken... I could not get enough of! I never had it this good at a buffet place! The butter chicken was okay... everything else was.. pretty standard for a buffet nothing to drool over. Something that I think is very important at an Indian Buffet place is to "keep the nan comin!". And I don't like to ask for the nan constantly when our basket is empty. This knocked out a star actually... all the other buffet places have an abundance of nan! Also, this was a pretty expensive for lunch: $11.95... plus tax and tip came out to be $14. Which I would've much preferred to order a dish instead of a buffet where i really enjoyed two dishes...

Had dinner here a few weeks ago.  I thought the prices were entirely too high.  We ordered the Ceylon Chicken Curry which I thought was not very flavorful.  We also got the Rogan Josh, which was better and the lamb was very nice and very tender. Maybe we just picked expensive items but our entrees were $15.95 and $18.95.  I do not think the food was better than places with $12.95 entrees, which I think is more appropriate. And is it just me, I don't want the waiter to scoop my food out of the serving dishes onto my plate??

I love the food and the atmosphere at Amber but it's often hard to justify the price.  Similar food can be found for a few dollars cheaper.  I think you are paying for the quiet romantic atmosphere for the restaurant so I would recommend it for a date or a special occasion with a small group rather than a regular dinner.

Amber is perfect at delivering the richness of Indian flavors without the heavy curry. The dishes are as elegant as any French restaurant and the flavors have all the complexities expected. I went for dinner and we ordered: butter chicken, kerala lamb curry, garlic naan, and frontier naan. Both dishes and both breads were fantastic. The service was impeccable. The wine list was decent, but not as good as Shiva's. I will definitely return and surely bring friends. Note: the Mountain View location doesn't make the Duck Crpes that I read were fantastic.

I spent nine years in England, which has some of THE BEST Indian restaurants around.  Amber's Chicken Tikka Masala; the Rogan Josh; and the fabulous aromatic rice and Naan - coupled with some great Indian beers makes this one of the best Indian meals you will have anywhere in the bay area, possibly the world! It can be a little pricey, but it's worth every penny. If you are craving Indian - this is the place to come!  You won't find much better anywhere else on this continent or another!

On Mountain View location. While that lunch crowd wait is always a bit of a nuisance, I actually like this place a lot and enjoy the crowded environment fellow Silicone Valley lunchtime diners create here.  With a barely noticeable exterior, the restaurant doors open into a well-decorated dining space, bustling with excited suits gleeful standing in line to indulge themselves with a rosy version of fine Indian cuisine.  I repeat, this restaurant is VERY packed during work day lunch time for its noteworthy buffet.   For how packed and crowded Amber gets (especially difficult since there will always be customers standing or walking around for the buffet on top of default wait staff activities), everything is surprisingly orderly and the restaurant is one of the few comfortably clean I've been to for Indian cuisine.   Service is pretty good even during busy hours for me, I am not sure whether they filled my BF's iced water often enough.   A perfect lunch buffet spot, it has the modern charm of Clay Oven in San Mateo but has better, richer flavors and more variety of dishes.   In general the distinction between Amber and another "fancier" Indian  Restaurant serving good food, is that Amber noticeably takes a very fresh, Californian spin on good old Indian dishes, bringing more vegetables into curries than another more meat-centric restaurant and presenting a wide variety of uses for fruits. All the times I've been there I had fun refilling my plates with their creative salads, butter chicken, lamb curry, and whatever other varieties of curry sauces that had my spoon dip-anxious for. I love their fruit-and-dessert bar, and am pleasantly surprised and instantly en amour with Amber's dessert soup, milky, creamy, cold, with whole toasted almond and pistachio pieces, jade-green cardamom exuding its sweet fragrance, and a velvety sweetness that helps calm the post-buffet-adrenaline-crash, replacing guilt with bliss.

So the food is excellent. Amazing flavors, the meat was so tender and delicious We had: Vegetarian Samosas Garlic Naan Lamb Curry Chicken Tika Masala I would've give this place 4 stars, but the service was really underwhelming. We felt a bit ignored and had to flag down service. Where other patrons seemed to be getting better service. Not sure if it was an off night. Granted I'd rather have better food and spotty service than the opposite. I'd give them another shot.

Was there on a Saturday evening for dinner. Plenty of parking and restaurant wasn't crowded. Had hear much about the place so my wife and I had to try it. Sat down, service was very fast and polite. The samosa was very disappointing. It was not even hot, clearly, it was just heat lamp hot. The flavors were just OK. It almost feels like they have these sitting under the lamp and served when ordered. Also had a grilled meats appetizer plate. It was good and chicken was very moist. I felt the flavors in this dish also lacked the punch. Looking around the dining room, it felt like the place had Asian and Anglo customers. The only Indians were the staff. Maybe the flavors were toned down to suit a more western audience. Also had the sea bass. The plate was sizzling hot, but the bass was a bit on the luke warm side. I am not sure why this is the case. The flavor was OK but again, luke warm food and a toned down taste didn't suit me. Had the butter chicken. Big pieces of chicken in the sauce. Again, flavors were very mild and it was just OK. Needed more intensity in the flavors. Desert was only so-so. Wasn't my thing. Cost was waaay overpriced for what u get. Well, I had to at least come here once, but this place is reallly geared for a more westernized client. I am not sure if I will be back, for me, it was a combination of cost and luke warm foods, and for me, I prefer a much more intense flavoral experience. I much rather eat at Thabla (Tabla) in Foster City where the samosa burns my tongue and the flavors are kicked up a few notches.  Tabla does not have a buffet lunch, so maybe they only cook when it is ordered.  In addition, I like to eat where a lot of the Indians eat, and this place didn't seem to be one of them. My friend has been here for lunch buffets and he also felt the flavors were a little flat. All toned down.

I went here at the suggestion of a friend. After reading the reviews on Yelp, I had high hopes. We came for dinner and were immediately impressed with the ambiance. The restaurant was well decorated and dimly lit. The service was good. The manager came around several times to make sure everything was OK. The food was well seasoned. Our lamb curry was delicious, though I have to admit that I couldn't tell that it was better or worse than what I'd had elsewhere (for cheaper). The Naan was good as well, no better or worse. The lamb rack was delicious, but again, I've had similar for cheaper. I guess overall, we had a good time. The food was good, the service was good, the ambiance was pleasant. Was it worth the price? I'm not sure. This would be a good place to take a date but if I was just in the mood for good indian food, I'd go elsewhere.

We came here Saturday night and this was the first time I've been to Amber. This is by far the best Indian food I have ever had. We ordered a prawn dish, curry eggplant, butter chicken and curry lamb. We also got garlic and frontier naan. Everything was really good, the frontier naan was a nice change from what I have expected from regular naan, it had a raisin filling in it which was great. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the price. This was the best Indian food I have had so the $ wasn't a big concern but at $20-$25 per item it was a little more than I've normally spent for Indian food.

Amber India was on Top 100 Bay Area Restaurants. Went here last weekend for a very delicious dinner.  I would definitely go back.  Here was what we ordered: Appetizer: - Vegetable Samosa - very good & tasty, although small.  two samosa per order. Entree: - Seekh Kebab - okay.  Tender lamb, but on the sour side. - Ceylon Chicken Curry - the best dish of the night for us.  highly recommend! - Chicken Tikka Masala - was told that the Butter Chicken uses the same sauce, but the Tikka Masala is all white meat chicken.  So, it was a good choice.  We liked it. - Malai Kofta - It tasted similar to the Chicken Tikka Masala, but good in its own right.   Sides: - Saffron Rice - thought it would be yellow??? It wasn't, and not very saffron like.  Fail. - Garlic and Basil Naan - it's naan.  Not enough garlic & basil.  naan on the thin side - Regular Naan - had to order this to finish dipping into the sauce.  It's pretty pricey.  Two naans cut in half, so total four servings, for $2.25??  I thought naans are usually free.  This was on the thin side as well. Drinks: - The pink elephant gave me a NICE BUZZ.  Just one drink. Overall, service was good.  Decor was nice.  The ambiance was quaint.  I would go back.  I've only had home cooked Indian food, and was pretty disappointed with the other restaurants.  However, I enjoyed Amber India, and hope you will too!!

This place has a really nice ambience. Ordered Butter chicken.. it was a bit dry, even with all the sauce to drown it in. The food was not super great for the price you pay, so the stars are mainly for the environment. The lighting is really nice and a great date spot, otherwise don't come here if you're looking to save some $$. Although I heard the lunch buffet might be a better deal.

Chicken and lamb dishes superb, complex and beautifully presented. Service almost overly attentive. Gundlach Bundshu Gewurtz hit the spot and cost the same as Geyser Peak Sauvignon Blanc. Rice and naan are extra, which I think is a pain. It is expensive, but probably the best Indian food I've had in a long time--including in London. They even have tandoori lobster. Surprisingly, no waiting on a Saturday night, but this place is not cheap. However, the lunch buffets are $14 and $15, are available 7 days a week and there is a 10% discount for take out. The bread menu and desserts look outstanding, and I also look forward to trying their tandoori.

Was treated to a nice dinner by some friends who highly recommended it (esp. the butter chicken). Food was pretty close to outstanding. Naan was a bit hard, and I've had better samosas, but everything else was most excellent! Lamb, butter chicken, Flying Horse beer! Good atmosphere, full bar, nice place.

Kind of expensive, but well worth it. This was my second time at this restaurant, and I was very pleased with my meal both times. The food was really good, and the service was great. The first time I ate here was for the buffet, and I was surprised how good the food was on their buffet - none of it tasted like it had been sitting out too long or anything like that. It's a little too pricey for me to go there often, but it's definitely a place I'll go to if I want to treat myself or if I have friends or family in from out of town and I want to go somewhere that I know they'll like.

I've been here for both lunch and dinner. My advice, go during lunch. They have a buffet and you can get a variety for one price. If you go during dinner, he'll pay 3-4x the price of lunch just to eat what you ate during lunch. Dinner doesn't have buffet. Butter chicken is good here, then again, just about everything they make is tasty.

I came here for dinner before I had ever had much Indian food (I am now obsessed with it). I enjoyed the dinner thoroughly, I was trying dishes I hadn't had before. I came back another time for the lunch buffet. This time I was able to compare to the many Indian restaurants at which I had dined between visits, and the others were much tastier and less expensive. I'll have to go back for dinner and see how it compares.

I had very high expectations after hearing all the great reviews about Amber India (one of the top 100 restaurants in the bay area, zagat rated..etc..), and was quite disappointed.  The food was decent, better than some of the other Indian restaurants in the area.  But it just wasn't that great!   The lamb dish with almond sauce was not very exciting.  The sauce was rather bland.  The butter chicken was good, but slightly salty.  The service was prompt, but not friendly.   The dishes were rather pricey, but they do serve a lot of meat.  So, you do get what you pay for. Maybe I will try a different dish next time.

Rich, smooth butter chicken, delicious lamb curry, fresh okra, juicy tandoori, crisp samosas, and perfectly tart mango lassis were the order of the day here, along with some damned tasty cauliflower. From the outside, Amber doesn't look like much, what with being in the middle of a strip mall across from a burger joint, with a sign for the strip mall proudly proclaiming that you can get drug testing done in this strip mall. Ambiance is definitely not a fast food or strip mall restaurant.  In fact, it manages to be cozy and elegant at the same time.  No need to show up with a suit and tie, and by no means do they make you feel like you should.  One minor gripe, and a very minor one at that:  I say this as a big guy, the chairs they give you are a touch on the petite side. Service receives a hearty recommendation, with the caveat that we were here on a week night, and the restaurant was at approximately 65-70% capacity.  I never had to ask for a refill of water, servers delivered the meal promptly, and never helicoptered over us to leave.  We didn't even have to wait long for our food. And speaking of food!  Everything was perfect.  Toss out expectations of Indian Fast Food and be led into a true gourmet experience.  Serving sizes are surprisingly ample, and while pricier than most places I've seen, it's certainly worth every cent, as each bite tends to be packed with freshness and flavor.  From the perfectly crunchy-not-oily samosas, to the still-moist-and-tender tandoori, to the hot and fresh naan, this place served an excellent meal. I hear the lunch buffet is great, too!

If I were to have one restaurant in the Bay Area cater the rest of the meals of my life -- Amber India is definitely in the top three and stands a chance to be my top choice.  Of course, I'd probably have to try a few more restaurants to make a completely informed decision.  Plus I'm biased -- Indian food is by far my favorite. But to even consider having all my meals coming from one place for the rest of my life is a pretty big decision.  I'd have to consult with the Counsel, which are the Gnomes assigned to me to provide daily advice on how I should live my life.  They're helpful but a bit intrusive at times.

Delish!  True that this place is pricey, but it really is the best Indian Food I've had in the South Bay.  So good, I'd drive to Mountain View for it ... this location is that much better than the Santana Row (closer) one. Recs:  Butter Chicken, any of the appetizers, any of the Paneers - I especially like the Matar Paneer; the Saag Paneer is great too.   Friendly staff, good for groups, good options for vegetarians, nice for a special evening out or a date.

I've heard amazing things about this place, so I was really surprised when I finally made it overt here for dinner and it was just o-k.  There was nothing here that made me say WOW or left me wanting more.  And to top it off, I found the servers to be short and non-attentive. Don't get me wrong, the food is not TERRIBLE but it is just ok.  For a better experience, I'd rather go to Shiva's in DT Mountain View.

Selection less than most Indian buffet's in the area. The rest of the dishes were average. The Ugly:  Service was awful!  They kept my water glass full, but they took forever to bring me the bill.

Food was alright, I've seriously had better. NOT to say the food was bad! It was just ALRIGHT. My high rating is due to the fact that they had GREAT service. I'm a sucker for great service. The hyped up butter chicken was not what I expected AT ALL. It was more on the tomato side...and i wasn't even aware this dish had tomato in it!! So, again it was alright. The curried scallop was good as was the garlic and basil naan. But can you ever go wrong with naan?! Warning, the dishes do not come with rice, thats a separate order. This place is expensive but damn the service was by far the best I've ever seen in a restaurant!!!! My water was filled right after I sipped it!! And to my surprise we got an indian dessert which they brought out with a candle because my friend told them it was my birthday. I was constantly greeted Happy Birthday even outside. They were great!

I don't like Indian food at all but when a group I was with wanted to come here for dinner I thought I would suck it up and go. I ended up having a beer, salad, and an order of the goat cheese flat bread. The beer was great, the salad was meh, and the goat cheese flat bread was surprisingly good! The service was good and the staff was kind. I don't think I would return since I don't care for Indian food but if that's your thing then give Amber a try!

funny - I lived in Mtn. View for over a year and never discovered this place....kinda like with Queen House. Great food, inconspicuous location (i drove around a few times to finally find it).  Butter chicken here is famous, but I also like the chicken tandori, the lamb dish.  it is a restaurant that can offer spicy food for those who crave it.   I also like its asian salad selection - I picked this bean sprout salad that was fantastic! Great good and service.  I would recommend this restaurant to everyone.

I came here for lunch and came to try out their buffet. The selection is smaller but the quality makes up for it. What I really liked was their Tandoori chicken and the Murg curry.  The naan brought to the table was excellent as well, and I try all the naan everywhere because i love bread! It was fresh, hot and so delicious! The Buffet consists of  vegetarian dishes and a few meat dishes and then a few desserts.  I liked the dessert though and usually I don't eat them, but the brown cheese desert that is a little ball was pretty good! My bf liked the white pudding, which I didn't care for too much.  It was pretty pricy for just a lunch buffet, coming out to 35 for both of us with tax and tip. Lunch buffet is 13.95 per person I believe. But the service was excellent, the waiter kept refilling our water and was very nice..and very polite. Seemed pretty crowded there for lunch too which is always a good sign. Update**Wow the waiter here is really nice! Came back here 3x since then, and they remembered us and welcomed us back! Tried the Mango lassi, and it was very good. What was really nice is that when I asked when they might have this certain dish, the waiter actually asked what day we would be back so he could have it at the buffet for us! Then the other waiter came back at the end of our meal and told us he noticed we really liked the Tandoori Chicken and gave us some to go! I've never had such nice service, anywhere, ever. I highly highly recommend this place to anyone, the service is outstanding, and they are so nice here!! 5 stars!!

Excellent Indian in a white tablecloth setting. Not as adventurous as Ajanta in Berkeley. They play it safe, but very tasty. Goat cheese stuffed naan- oh yeah! Danish(?) potatoes stuffed with mint and apricot chutney were you bet good.  Service was excellent as well. Cheers. Update 9/20/08 New menu items: Aleppy Fried Prawns- Tender Prawns marinated with Chili Flakes in a rice flour batter served with a peanut sauce. I am used to a sweet peanut sauce from Thai restaurants and I can keep an open mind, but this sauce was kind of bland. "Tender" prawns were more limp, I'd say, and those chile flakes were not announcing their presence at all. Tried to wake it up with some tamarind chutney- then it tasted like peanut butter and jelly prawns. Where's that spice? Oh, it's right here: Peshawari Chicken Tikka- Chicken thighs marinated with mustard oil yogurt and a touch of ginger. Wow, this was great! Grilled and still juicy, love the tandoori skillet on a plank bit. The onions and peppers carmelize on the cast-iron. Even better the next day! Finally found a destination dish here. Thanks! Service was excellent as always, bordering on over-attentive but if you have to error on one side....

A boss of mine used to drive from Santa Cruz to Mountain View to eat at this place. I learned why one day when he offered me some of the vast portions he kept in his freezer, and then again two weeks ago when I got to eat at the actual restaurant myself. It's spot in one of the many strip malls of the area is unassuming, but the parking lot was full. The chicken tikka masala and saag paneer are worth every penny, and the naan and mango lassi make the overall experience fantastic. The only reason I've kept my rating to four stars is their pricing - I'd say they could slice $3 off each dish easily. Still worth it, especially for a date. The atmosphere calls for a step above jeans.

We've been going to this place since it opened many years ago. It's our favorite Indian restaurant in the South Bay. The preparation and ingredients are all top notch.  They use fresh meat, not previously frozen like some other places use. We mainly stick to eating at the buffet which provides a large selection of vegetarian and meat dishes and they have a chat selection too.   We have ordered from the menu at dinner, and the prices are high. The decor is nice, the owners upgrade the carpeting and chairs every few years and just completed their most recent renewal a couple of years ago - looks nice!  Don't let the strip mall exterior fool you.   Service has been consistently high and many of their employees have been with them for years which attests to good management.   We like the other two Amber restaurants - Santana Row and San Francisco, but this one is the flag ship and leans more toward conventional Indian dishes. There is a little more fusion-style going on at the two newer places which is kind of nice to try!

This little piece of India is located in a small strip of businesses lining El Camino Real, near the Los Altos area. After visiting several times, I have the following comments to offer: Lunch:  Served in a typical Indian buffet style, this format allows you to dabble across several basic dishes, plus includes fruits, vermicceli, and a special friedball in syrup desert (very tasty).  Price is $15 - steep for a simple lunch buffet.  Free naan is provided, if it helps^^ Definitely try the butter chicken! Dinner: Very classy feel and excellent, yet typical, Indian dishes available. Prices are more reasonable by comparison to other similar venues. The Service:  The wait staff are very warm, prompt, well-dressed, and incredibly professional.  The only comparable venue I have visited is Morimoto's in Napa - 5 star worthy service.

I was pleasantly surprised to find this place.  The Bay Area is full of bad-to-mediocre Indian restaurants.  Amber India easily rises above the rest. Other people know about this place, so you'll probably need a reservation.  Service was sufficiently prompt.  I found the atmosphere comfortable and pleasant. The food was excellent: properly spiced, properly rich, full flavors, fresh ingredients, with a feeling of generosity in how it was all prepared. I can't wait to go back and sample more of this menu!

The food was really really tasty and they had dishes that I haven't seen before. I got Dum Aloo Bukhara which was delicious. The naan was also very good. My friends got the Amber Dinner which is enough food for 2 people; for $25, that is one of the best deals available if you like meat and variety. I got to try some of their food and it was some of the most tender, moist, flavorful tandoori chicken! The lamb kebab was delicious too. The service was prompt, polite and the table was well maintained. The waiter made sure he had the right order but it got a little confusing when the food came. All in all, very good meat and veggie dishes but for the price, I'll keep this place in mind for special occasions.

I had heard this was the best Indian restaurant on the peninsula, that really does this place a disservice as it serves better food than most commercial ventures would bother preparing.  Which is to say the food is excellent and high quality. The food isn't dressed up and pretending to be American, it's about as real as you can buy.  The lamb isn't afraid to taste like lamb, a genuine rarity in the states.  The fried cheese isn't even greasy, so you know it's done right.  And the texture and flavor of the Tanook chicken is singularly impressive. Bottom line it is a great restaurant  in its own right, but everyone knows it.  I showed up 5 minutes before it opened and within 20 minutes 5 other people showed up.  If you going peak hours, a reservation may well be needed.  I'll certainly be going back.

Dragged here with doubts and skepticism, the word "buffet" shudders down my spine. Slap me unconscious and call me silly! What a great place to get lunch or dinner. Coming into a small strip, you expectations of quality is usually low. But once inside, the decor is very well done, nice Indian designs and paintings on the wall. The staff was quick to seat us at very nice tables and removed a table to better accommodate the two of us. Our server was quick to take our drink order and we head right away to the buffet bar. The bar is laid out well with a nice variety of dishes, all of which is very yummy. The sauces are all good, the lamb is tender, the chicken is moist and flavorful, and the butter chicken is so good. Probably packed full of calories, but who cares? I sure didn't with my third serving. Along with out meal, there is a nice selection of desserts. I finished up with small serving of watermelon, a strawberry lassi, and, like a raccoon, sneaked away a few sips of the mango lassi from my girlfriend. Absolutely delicious. The service is quick to clear your plates, refill your drinks, and answered what questions I had with professional and friendly face. While not on the cheap side, you certainly get your money's worth at Amber. It really is a great place to eat at and I will be back for more!

This place is a fantastic Indian Restaurant.  Me and my bro ate the lunch buffet there on a Saturday.  The food was terrific, the selection was bountiful, and the service was class.  Overall, this is one of those top quality Indian restaurants that are a rare treat in the bay area.   Even though the bay area has a lot of desis, the indian restaurants here for the most part are quite miserable.  Amber is an exception to this trend and is a superb dining experience.  Although the buffet has a bit of a steep price tag, I think it is well worth it after one has had a hardcore morning workout.

Be sure to bring your appetite because you get a lot of food.  A bit expensive, but overall a great place to go for a group meal. Be sure to make a reservation if you go there on a Friday night!

Do not pass go, head directly to Amber India for the lunch buffet. So good. Over half of the people eating there were Indian, which is always a good sign. Most variety I've seen in an indian buffet and the best indian food I've had since moving to the bay area last year. They have all the hits...butter chicken, palak paneer, daal, gobi, tandoori chicken, and a bunch of other stuff too. They bring naan to your table and do a good job refilling it. Dining area is on the fancier side, but they didn't mind my 2 year old being, well, a 2 year old. Staff was all very nice. Thumbs up for sure.

Delicious Indian food, but portions were definitely on the smaller side when considering the price.  Even so, only one person in our party ate enough to not have leftovers, but probably because he ordered the butter chicken.  Everyone agreed that the dishes were surprisingly spicy, but that might be abnormal since about half of the group I came with seem to eat here pretty regularly.  The Rogan Josh (Lamb Curry) was very good, with very tender chunks of lamb...good with the plain naan :)  Probably the nicest Indian restaurant I've been to...and that's probably how they justify their prices (along with the food).

I had such a great experience at this place the other night. T.J. the manager did such a great job at taking care of me while I patiently waited for my other party to arrive. To pass the time he brought me the most delicious Ginger & Basil Mojito - YUM! The food was delicious - we went with the pre-set Dinner and it was the perfect amount for 2 people with a little left over. Great service! Great food!

I love this place, and so do my friends who are actually from India.  I'm particularly a sucker for the frontier naan (stuffed with nuts and raisin paste).  The butter chicken is delicious, as is the scallop curry.  The chai is warm and tasty.  And the prices are fine for a nice restaurant in an expensive city.  Yum, I thought I was full from dinner tonight but I'm already hungry just from thinking of Amber!  Five stars!

I enjoyed my recent meal here with a friend. It was a little difficult to locate (in the corner of a strip mall) but once we got inside it was very nice and we felt comfortable talking and not feeling rushed out of the restaurant. We shared butter chicken and palak paneer. We also had some naan and asked for the corriander chutney, which i thought was delicious. We both ate plenty and there was still enough to take home. The servers were very attentive and are constantly refilling your water. I know there is a buffet lunch here, and I would like to try and come back for that, because I believe that the price would be a little more reasonable. I didn't mind the prices, but I have definitely had more reasonable Indian food with comparable flavors and quality.

I would have given this place 4 stars but the service bugged me a bit.  I mean, they were very nice, but c'mon, 2-3 different waiters asked us if we wanted dessert. It bugs when any waiter thinks we're ready to order when we JUST sat down in the beginning.  (lack of communication?) Pros: Food was terrific! Chicken was so tender! I loved the spinach dish.   Lovely atmosphere...great place for a date.   Cons: A bit pricey.   i AM interested in the buffet. yum yum!

We were a big group (12) with a 8.30 reservation, did not get seated for 45mins. Finally when we got settled, we had hurry with the order since the kitchen would close at 10. Starters came out just OK, the hara bhara kebab in the veg platter were overcooked (read as burnt). Finally the main course, the Paneer dishes were nice, malia kofta gravy was good, the kofta left much to be desired May give it another shot with a smaller group next time around

The first time I tried Indian food was in 2008 at a wedding.  Ever since I have been hooked.  I've tried various curries, tikka's , aloo gobi, etc. at different restaurants throughout the bay area.  I have never been compelled to write a review until I ate at Amber India.   I've visited both the Santana Row location and now the Mountain View restaurant and find that the quality of food is consistently wonderful.  Each restaurant has its own personality and slight differences in menu offerings, but they make me want to go back for more.   The food was succulent, full of flavor and the butter chicken was like velvet in my mouth.  I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  It was a challenge for me to not order everything on the menu, but alas, with only two people, we could only handle so much.   We started our meal off with a cocktail (Indian Rain) and appetizers.  Then  we had the butter chicken, chicken tikka, aloo gobi, saffron rice and garlic naan.  Each dish was presented in wonderful traditional service bowls and served on our plate by our wait staff.  The portion size was more than satisfactory leaving us with plenty to take home and share with our children.   Definitely the best Indian food, hands down!  Well worth the trip.  I'll keep coming back for more...

Very good Indian buffett.  The restaurant was packed for lunch and luckily we had a reservation.  They are more expensive than most Indian buffetts but you can taste the quality and variety.  The fact that the restaurant was really full shows that you can charge more while offering better food.  I see many reviews complaining about service but we had great service.

Been going here for about 10 years now and it never fails to deliver when I've got a fix for good Indian food. Consistently good food: Nearly every dish we ever order is very good. Not too sweet, not too oily, but a bit salty. The butter chicken, vege biriyani and palak paneer are our family's staples. Some other dishes we like are the spicy lamb curry and the naan and roti are well done (the Frontier naan is quite unique). Clean and charming ambiance: Very nice, clean and not too strong of an odor of spices when you walk in. They do however have a bit of a draft that travels through the restaurant so bring a scarf or sweater for the kids. Service quality depends on the night: The servers are very polite, with greeters by the door and will stop by at the beginning of the meal to make sure everything is OK. BUT it can get a bit busy, so getting attention of a server mid-meal can be a bit tricky. For example, when we needed more naan, we asked the nearest server to let our server know, and then when we saw our server again 5 minutes later, he hadn't been told and had to go back to the kitchen to order more naan, so about 15 minutes later, the naan finally came out and the food was cold by then.

2.5 Stars = Food 3 Stars = Service My husband and I just got back from Amber India. Went here based on yelp reviews. Drove 30 minutes south to try the place. I have to say hubby and I really don't understand why yelpers are giving this place 4 stars. We had the buffet and it was nothing special. All dishes were just okay. I did like the stuffed potato. Butter chicken wasn't the best, the sauce wasn't as creamy as we like. Also, my husband has never, never, never left behind naan bread, and at this place, he left behind naan bread. It just wasn't very good. Not served piping hot like it should be, not moist, and it was dry. We thought this place was going to be great because of the number of Indian customers so we were disappointed when the food was just okay. Yelpers complained about the cost of the buffet, almost $15.00. I thought that's not bad if you get high quality food or as high quality one can get from a buffet. Well, our bill came to $40.00 with tip. We had two lunch buffets and one coke.  Expensive for what you get. Won't be back.

Went to this place for the buffet lunch in a big group and everyone was happy.  They don't open until 11:30am.. most of our group got there then and the line for the buffet was already to the door.  It moves quickly though, and it's worth it.   Food is good and there was a lot of variety of vegetarian dishes, and wasn't too spicy (which I prefer).  We had a birthday boy in our group so it was nice that they brought out a special dessert for him after our meal... although we were not impressed with the dessert.  Maybe we just weren't familiar with what it was.   Parking can be tough during lunch time since the lot is small but it shouldn't be a problem if you arrive early.

Bad : Naan, very dry, felt like y'day's left over. vermicelli kheer, did not have any taste or flavor. No coffee or tea included in buffet. At this price, I do not recommend this place for buffet.

It's waaay too expensive. For the food itself I'd give it 3 maybe 3.5 stars, but everything costs ~30-50% more than I'd expect. The food is very north Indian and it definitely caters to a more western and less spice tolerant palate. I generally ok with that since I'm not Indian and don't particularly love some spices that appear often in Indian food, e.g. tumeric, cardamon (i'm not talking about hot spicy). Even for my palate the food at this place is overly watered down. Years and years ago, Amber was very different and much better with some type of Indian and European fusion menu along with the Indian classics. I had some duck dish that was quite good and very unique (and also somewhat pricy). Now it's just some marginally above average Indian place (with below average naan), but the prices haven't adjusted for the fact that this place is NOT "gourmet" dining. But if you do come here, the vegetarian options are a much better value (and possibly tastier) than the meat options. Two stars for placing in "my never coming back list." There are tons of Indian restaurants to try around the Bay. Amber is just not worth the visit.

We reached the restaurant at 9:30pm (yes, we were late). We knew that we'd have to get settled and order quick since the kitchen would be about to close. And we did while our waiter reminded us 3 times that the kitchen was closing - Fine. We ordered paneer tikka as an appetizer, a curry and bread. In around 10 minutes, all the food was out together, appetizer and main course. Fine - no big deal. We dug in to the tikka and surprisingly the paneer was actually cold (from the fridge) from the inside. That blew it! The cook was in such a hurry to go home and wrap up that he didn't even cook the food properly. We called the waiter. He apologized and said he'll reheat it and get it. Without asking us, he picked out the paneer pieces from our plates and put it back into the serving container! I didn't know what to tell him. I took this matter up with the manager when we were leaving (after obviously leaving no tip). He said that his staff must have been in a hurry to close up. I told him that I don't expect that food quality be compromised. He said he can't help it!! (You can't serve cold food to guests dude!) He was talking in a raised voice since there was almost no other guests in the restaurant. I told him that maybe he should pay his staff for another half hour so they won't be in such a hurry. He said - they can't pay them for just 15 more dollars. To say something like that was really irresponsible. That was it Amber - my friends and I (as far as I can convince them) are boycotting you'll. Mistakes happen - but attitude of this sort just ticks one off.

Horrible food & rude managment I have been an Amber patron for a long  time but thing seem to have changed lately for the worse. We called at 6 PM to make a reservation for 4+1 knowing very well that they server only a la carte during dinner (and buffet during lunch).  At 6.45 I called again to change my reservation to 5+1 and I was told I had no previous reservation. Huh. Well they took down the reservation for 8.30 PM. When we arrived we were surprised to find out it was a buffet being a festival day for Indians. Well not a problem, would have been nice to have been told. 30 minutes later we were seated and when I sampled the food it was asbolutely sub par. When I causally mentioned it to the manager he asked me to sample everything - "probably I had not tasted all the items". When I reiterated he mentioned "this is a buffet so I should not expect the same quality of food".  Oh really. Later the said "the food has been out  (on the table) since 5 PM (and it was close to 9 pm)".  I am horrified by the absolute indifference of Amber mgmt. At the end of my absolutely sub par dinner $21.95++/pp I asked if I could write my comments somewhere. They said they had no such facility. Amber did surely loose a long time patron yesterday.

I think this restaurant is overrated.  I came here with a party of 9 and the service was terrible, they probably figure gratuity is guaranteed so they scaled back service since they charge 18% gratuity for party of 6 or more. We ordered appetizers but they never came back to take the rest of our order until we had to flag someone down, after finishing our appetizers.  Most expensive Indian food I've ever had and the taste wasn't special, not worth the extra cost.  My vegetable biryani had frozen vegetables in it, no special veggies that would justify the extra cost.  I tried several other dishes my friends had and I couldn't understand why would someone pay $18 for a dish you can get $7 elsewhere.   I've had better and cheaper Indian food elsewhere, including my travels in India.  For Indian food, I paid French Laundry price for Denny's food.  Don't get suckered into this over hyped restaurant and save yourself some money.  I rather spend the extra money to look good than eating in a nice looking restaurant.

The lunch buffet presentation is exceptional, but the non-veg choices are limited to three chicken dishes (Butter Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, and Chicken Curry).  The butter chicken is a little over rated in my opinion, and a bit heavy on consistency.  They have a wider selections of vegetarian choices, and are pretty tasty.  The Naan is brought out warm and fresh every time.  Pretty decent lunch, but not worth 4 stars.

I always hear such rave reviews about this place; when I was living in the South Bay it was ooohhh Amber-- you have to try it, the best authentic Indian cuisine...honestly I went there twice with friends and all I can say is that the dishes were woefully undersized, the curry was not spicy at all- more dumbed down for the bland American palate. Everything in this restaurant was about ambiance, down to the hand-crafted ornate menu covers.  Go for a posh experience, but not an authentic one...fo sho.

After reading all of the 5-star reviews, this place was a pretty big letdown. It wasn't terrible - just not excellent by any means, and a bit pricey considering the food. The samosas weren't that large, and the filling consisted of a homogenous mix of what I believe was potatoes and peas. Fairly bland, and not terribly crispy. The vegetable biryani was decent, but nothing special. The Mirch Ka Gosht (lamb) was the real disappointment. It was pretty expensive (most of the meat entrees were $16 or $17), and not terribly interesting or spicy. In addition, the lamb was a little bit chewy. The naan was kind of cold, and sort of gross. For 2 people, it came to a little over $50 without alcohol.

The creamiest, most comforting and LOVING food you will ever taste!!  I ordered to go:  Chix Qorma, Chix Tika Masala, Chix Biryani w/ raisins, Keema Naan, Garlic Naan, and gulab for dessert!  I paid $60+.  Usually they should have thrown some basmati rice w/ that too (what if I didn't order the Biryani and Naan?).  I've NEVER tasted Indian food this caring and comforting before!  The feeling you get when you bite into the Qorma is like having your Mom feeding you soup while you're sick in bed after a long raining day falling off your bike in school  :-)

This is my second favorite Indian place, and I've been here several times.  Definitely call ahead and get a reservation (and then still expect to wait).  This last time that we went, service was very, very, very slow.  We always get the chaat as an appetizer, and it's pretty good.  We usually also get the malai kofta or saag paneer along with the chicken tikka masala.  The food is really heavy, but so good.  The ambience is really nice, and it's definitely a good date place.  Bit pricey for Indian food.  If you're willing to drive, and want some delicious food for lower prices (and more casual ambience), I recommend Kabobs and Curry in Santa Clara.

Amber India is a different type of Indian restaurant than most people are use to. Its a very nice restaurant and has great calming ambience. I have been here for lunch and for dinner. Lunch was a buffet and was great. Although it was really packed during lunch. Dinner was still busy but we got seated almost right away and everything was delicious. We had Chicken masala, buttered chicken, dal, garlic naan, a vegetable dish, and a salmon dish. It was somewhat pricier than most other Indian restaurants, but I would say that its definitely worth it.

My mouth still salivates from the delicious lamb vindaloo I had the other night with a friend. And the service - impeccable! But onto to the review... My friend and I came here last night. I made reservations, and I was really glad and surprised they accepted reservations (a lot of Indian restaurants don't). Previous to dinner, I had come here once before for the lunch buffet, and another time for dinner, but it was so long ago that I had completely forgotten what a treat this place is. We were seated right away, and we got a cozy table with table cloth and candlelight (a treat!). Our waiter was very nice, and laughed with us cheerily. We ordered the lamb vindaloo, the butter chicken, a butter naan, and a garlic and basil naan. The lamb vindaloo was amazing. Spicy, semi thick reddish sauce, and very soft and tender lamb that didn't have a hint of gamey taste (you know what I'm talking about). The butter chicken was good as well, but not as overwhelmingly good (it tasted too much like chicken tikka masala). The butter naan was thinner and crispier than I'd like (I like my naan fluffy and doughy). I didn't try the garlic and basil naan, but my boyfriend (who I bought lamb vindaloo and garlic naan to go because I wanted him to see what great stuff I had at dinner) said it was kind of dry and not very garlicky. The service, oh, it's great! When our food arrived, our waiter personally scooped out portions of our dishes and placed them on our plate. It was so lovely and unexpected. Mmm, another Indian restaurant to add to my list of favorites!

I'm tempted to doubt my taste buds but I'm a die hard Indian food fan and I won't be persuaded by the hype.  After ranking in SF's top 100 resturant list year after year, I had high hopes.  Too bad cuz there's nothing worse than anticipating greatness and experiencing  B-L-A-N-D.  No flavor.  I don't mean spicy, I just mean flavor.  This is a great intro for the novice, someone who has never eaten masala or vindaloo or briyani at Naan and Curry for example.   This area is rich in flavors from India, even mom and pop grocery stores have better tasting somosas.  Skip this one if your taste buds craves the rich flavors of the cruisine.

Been here a couple of times for the buffet lunch and it's pretty good.  I'm usually not a fan of buffets, so I'll definitely have to come back one of these days for dinner to try a la carte.  The selection is just ok for me. I personally love curries, so I wish they had more curry selections.  Definitely a good place for vegetarians!  They also have excellent mango lassis - very creamy and not overly sweet!  The atmosphere is really nice - a little more fancy than other Indian restaurants I've been to, and the service is good too.

Agree with some of the former reviewers, amber used to be great in the Bay Area. This locations the food tasted pretty good, but still could use some improvements. Chicken Marsala was very ketchupy, and the other dishes we had were a little cold. I may or may not comeback to this place, a little indifferent. But in the past, Amber has been great, but my recent experiences have been mediocre. They have potential.

Thought that the food was just ok here. The butter chicken, which is their specialty was really good, but the desserts were unimpressive. The interior is also a little dour - plastic chairs and not super exotic. The Indian folks that I was eating with really liked the place, so I think it's good. Just didn't really excite me.

Expensive but very good food.  The garlic basil naan is excellent.  The menu is a little on the short side - ie there aren't that many chicken dishes, but what they do they do well.  We go here often.

This place is great. I was pretty surprised of the location, it was in a plaza with other random stores, and not centrally located downtown. But the food, ambience and service made up for it. When we walked in we were greeted by the host and he sat us promptly. From the looks of the dinning area, the room was almost full, which is always a great sign. The atmosphere was romantic with minimal cultural art pieces hung on the walls and clean white linens with a small floral and candle arrangement. Service was spot on. We ordered the dinner special and it was enough to feed 2 ppl. It was a great deal for only $30. It came with naan bread, saffron rice, panaak paner, tandoori chicken, lamb kabobs, butter chicken, tea and a small serving of dessert to end the meal. It was a great balanced meal giving a little taste of everything. The food tasted extra fresh and authentic. Their panaak paner is the best that I've had and was my fave dish. This indian restaurant has lived up to its reputation and for that I give it a perfect score of 5/5.

one star for the service. the food was really horrible........and expensive. i had to stop by peet's cofffee to get some hot water to digest the food and also had to chew gum to get rid off the test. i thought it will be best to eat Indian food in the south bay since they have a large population there. i've had better Indian food in SF. so no more Amber Indian for me.

this indian buffet has the best selection i've seen anywhere. they had at least 15 different dishes that were waiting to be consumed by me. ultra high props for the lamb curry. the sauce was thick + full of flavor and the meat was tender. i also liked their vegetable curry. you get what you paid for and this place (around $20 per person) definitely delivers!

Could I find cheaper and better Indian food somewhere else?  Probably.  But I don't know where.  What I do know is that when I am hungry and am craving Indian food, I am willing to drive forty five miles to this place and wait for a table.  Is it crazy? Yes.  Is it worth it?  Hell yeah.  It hits the spot every time.

The food was delicious.  My bf ordered a curry scallop dish which I was a little doubtful of, but curry turns out to be a great compliment to scallops. The ambiance and pace was great for a date, but the seating arrangements left something to be desired.  The tables for two were situated very close to the entrance and with the heavy traffic flow, it felt like a notch above sitting in the hallway.  The service was a tad frivolous for my taste.  For example, they had a person who would sweep  the crumbs off your table, but we had to request an order more than once, our glasses weren't filled promptly, our tab came out wrong, and the ladies room was a mess.  So maybe polish up the service a tad and I would give them that last star.

i'll be honest - i'm not a huge fan of indian food.  i'm not a spicy food eater so i was happy with the selection of non-spicy food here.  the lunch buffet is an awesome deal with a good selection.  i was already stuffed after one plate of food!  the buttered chicken is really good and a must try!  the eggplant and tofu dishes are also very tasty.  and the desserts were yummy!  the rose sherbet drink i got was interesting (it's basically water with syrup in it).  i didn't have any chai tea afterwards but my lunch buddies did and they loved it. i went here with a few indian co-workers who highly recommended it otherwise, i would have never gone here.  it's unfortunate that the outside of the restaurant does not look as good as the inside.  the staff is very friendly and attentive.  it's a very diverse crowd that eats here and can get a bit crowded/busy at lunchtime.  but unlike some really crowded restaurants, the tables are spaced out in a way where you don't feel like you're running into other people's tables/spaces.

The wait was relatively long considering it was past 8pm and we were in Mountain View.  We deliberately chose to go to the Mountain View location versus the Santana Row location to avoid the crowd.  We started off with the Vegetable Samosa.  They were just okay.  Then we had to have the Butter Chicken because of all the rave reviews they had posted in the waiting area.  It was good, but I didn't think it was as good as all the rave reviews.  Also tried the Achari Gosht (I think), which I totally wasn't impressed with.  The lamb was a bit dry.  My favorite had to be the Malai Kofta.  Yum!!  We were totally full after dinner, but probably because we totally filled up on naan.  Ooh...and can't forget my Mango Lassi!!  To sum it up - the food was good, but nothing to rave about.  The price - pretty steep for what I thought was just "good."

Da bomb.  Their Butter Chicken dish is so frickin good, I could IV that stuff into my veins and be happy for life...but then i wouldn't get to enjoy the flavor!  My hubbie is Indian, and we agree...almost everything on the menu is fab.  you can't go wrong.  beware of a wait though, but it is worth it.  The lamb skewers were so tasty too.  It's a bit pricey for indian food, but similar to bay area restaurant prices.

I feel like an expert on Indian food and I am a little picky. This place was recommended by an Indian friend so I checked out their lunch buffet. Here are my reflections. FOOD The food was warm and fresh and they had many veggie options. The chutneys were good and they had a vinaigrette type salad that was really good (though not very Indian). They had the super spicy salad relish that not many places have. The veggie dishes were honestly not that impressive. I expect Indian food to be very aromatic -- its like food perfume -- complex spices and tastes. This was just OK. The eggplant was not bad but tasted a little more like a Chinese dish. The Dal was OK but not the best. Their wheat vermicelli rice pudding was not my cup of tea but I prefer rice pudding over vermicelli pudding. SERVICE The service was a little rude. I arrived at 1130 which apparently when they open. There were about 10 people waiting in line to be seated. To this the host said in a somewhat demanding way "Ok, everyone HAVE A SEAT". It was strange. Like we did not have a right to stand. He seated groups (of course not in the order in which they came) and then he totally ignored me. I travel for work so I am pretty used to dining alone but when you are the only solo person there and the host does not even acknowledge you it makes you feel like crap. I had to go back up to the host a few minutes later (being the only one still in the lobby and 'sitting' as he has demanded) and tell him that i was dining alone and obviously still wanted to be placed at a table. Later this 'solo diner' alienation happened again when the staff was passing out Naan to all the tables. By this time the place was half full and though I was the third table to be seated and I was almost done with my meal -- I was about the 10th table to get Naan. I don't care that much about Naan. I prefer rice but still again it made me feel punished for dining alone. I will probably not go back. For $15 including tax but without a drink I will likely just go to Bombay Garden. Much better tasty yummies there and they don't care if you dine alone.

Folks are in town, so they offered to watch my daughter and give me and the wife an opportunity for a date night.  We decided to trek down to Mountain View to try out Amber India. Location:  In a tiny strip mall on El Camino in Mountain View.  The parking lot is nowhere near big enough for the crowds that Amber draws at dinner time.  I wound up parking around the corner. Look and feel:  The hole-in-the-wall exterior does not do justice to the place.  Inside is quite well decorated, and the rooms are partitioned well to allow the diners a sense of separation from the crowd.  We were there at 8:30 on a Thursday night, and the place was jammed.  We had to wait 30 minutes to be seated.  Oh, and the place is brimming with Indian clientele, which is always a good sign. Menu:  It's a little fancier than the typical Indian place in the bay area, but not extremely so.  The waiter didn't even blink when we asked to order something that wasn't on the menu. The food:  We ordered the Scallop Curry, Baingan Bharta, Sukhi Bindi, and Lamb Saag (not on the menu.)  Everything was really quite good.  I have the impression it would be difficult to choose something that they didn't make well. Service:  Once seated, the service was excellent.  Several servers worked our table which ensured that there were not  stretches without getting our water filled. Value:  Here is where I'm not quite sold.  There's nothing I didn't like about the place, but we left wondering if it was worth the premium they charge, and I'm not certain it is.  One thing I'm sure of is that it's not so good that it's worth it to me to drive down to Mountain View from San Carlos for it.  There are places much closer that might not be quite as good, but are close enough, and cheaper. Will I go back?  It's not so likely that we'll just decide to go back one night, but we certainly wouldn't shy away if friends planned to meet there.  We definitely enjoyed our meal.

We enjoyed a delicious meal last night at Amber. We made reservations at 8:30 but still had to wait for about 15 minutes as they were trying to get our table ready. If you went around 9:15 there was not lines. Dishes were well flavored. We really liked the  malwani shrimp curry. It's a little pricey but reasonable for the money.

Amber has the best Indian lunch buffet in California.  Natraj in Laguna Hills is a close second.  Everything is fresh, flavorful, and they aren't afraid to have a couple spicy dishes.  The nicest thing is that they always have some items that are unusual for buffets. They also do a good job of providing both veg and non-veg items. Every time I am anywhere near Mountain View I have lunch at Amber.

This is an upscale Indian restaurant. I came here last night and everything that we ordered was absolutely fabulous. This is a good place to go out to eat with friends. You can try new things and order family style. We tried lamb, chicken, and prawn dishes; all were delicious. We also got vegetable samosas, a potato dish, along with a basket of assorted breads. I must agree that the buttered chicken dish is fantastic! They have tasty signature drinks as well. Although this place is a bit pricey, I will definitely be returning here when the occasion arises.

We like Amber India and when in the area it's where we go for lunch. We have the buffet which is $14.95 per person but well worth the price. The food is delicious and nothing is super spicy which I like but others may find too mild. The food is tasty and fresh and you get to try things that perhaps you would not order. The service is great but even at lunch at 1:30 pm we had to wait 20 minutes for a table because they can be busy.

We've been eating here for quite a long time.  The last few times we have been disappointed by the quality of the food.  We're also bummed by the prices (it seems like they have increased).  The food is still decent but not commensurate with the price you pay.  Example:  we ordered two veggie entrees and two orders of naan bread.  No rice, no drinks, etc.  It came to $30+   We're going to see what other Yelpers are recommending for our Indian food cravings.  ;-)

This is our favorite Indian spot. The food is incredible. Everything is great, but especially the Tandoori, Chicken Tika Masala, and Butter Chicken.

Made the trip down to Mountain View to celebrate a friend's birthday. Coming from the SF, the first thing that impressed me was the fact that there was easy parking right out front in the lot. But what followed proved to be even better. A couple of folks ordered the Amber Dinner, which came packed full of tasty treats - chicken curry, tandoori chicken and lamb, palak paneer. Based on a friend's suggestion, we also ordered the butter chicken with naan. There was not a single thing on that table that I wouldn't order again. Everything was so flavorful, and the meat was surprisingly tender. The service was very attentive, especially compared to most of the Indian restaurants I have been to. If I ever find myself in the Mountain View area and in the mood for some tasty Indian food, I would definitely return to Amber.

I went to Amber recently with a good friend who had never had Butter Chicken.  He came away a true believer and now wants to visit Amber every chance he can.  I had not been in over 5 years, and was happy to see that the food was as good as remembered.  You should make reservations since we went at 8:00 Wednesday night, and we still had to wait for 20 minutes.  But it was WORTH the wait.  YUMMY and delicious are my words for Amber.

We tried only the vegetarian items here and the were nothing extraordinary..in fact not up to the mark. The Navratan korma tasted like potato gravy..in fact have a good mind to give them my Navratan Korma recipe which tastes much better. There were no cashew nuts or raisins or fruits in the korma. The hara bhara kabab was good. but the pakodas and samosas were not very great. the sweet and the the green chutney were also not that great. Veg Pulao was not up to the mark. They did not serve raita with the pulao. Nan was also not as good as other restaurants...it was crispy and not soft. We did not have to wait for a long time to be seated but had to wait for a long time for the food. I am giving a 3 as I have not tried any non veg dishes there. Next time will try those and update this review.

I could eat Indian food until I explode, and it doesn't get any better than Amber India.  I was referred to this place by a local CEO who is "Mr. Silicon India".  I adore him, especially when he says "azzume" instead of assume.  ; )  Anyway, back to food....I'm a veggie and there's lots to choose from here!  Meat eaters will get their fill too.  The atmosphere is relaxed with a touch of elegance, especially when they light the candles in the evening.  This restaurant is a must!

I love this place... the service is impeccable, the food is outstanding and I love how the storefront says NOTHING about how wonderful the food is inside.  Since it is in a small outside "mall" of about 5-7 businesses and a parking lot, you wouldn't expect much of this place from the outside.  Once you step in the door, the transformation is quite remarkable.  The decorations are fantastic and tastefully done. But it's the FOOD that really speaks for this place.  I love chicken tikka masala, but I also love a very spicy chicken vindaloo.  This place is worth the money and worth a visit.  You will be a frequent customer once you try this place!

Party of four adults and 2 kids went for Saturday lunch buffet.  It's a good thing we had a reservation otherwise our wait time would have been really long.  We were strategically seated near the buffet table. They immediately offered high chairs and booster seats for the kids.  The ambience and the dinnerware were classier than the other Indian restaurants I've been to.  I was satisfied with the variety and taste of the dishes. I loved the spinach and corn.  I would love to eat here again.

I love India. I love the Bollywood musicals and the campy pop music. I love the fact that Shiva, the Hindu god, retreats to a Himalayan hideout for many months out of the year to smoke hashish and escape his shrewish wife Parvati. I love the chaos and indefinable essence of that country and most of all, I love the food. Judging from the quality of the cuisine, service, and ambiance at Amber, so do it's owners. The lunch buffet, usually unimpressive and generic in many Indian spots I've been to, is lovingly tended at Amber and well worth the fourteen or so dollars. Along with the usual dishes like Tandoori Chicken and Saag Paneer, Amber features a lot of more unique selections that are seriously delectable. And the naan.  Ah, I could wax poetic over the naan...but I won't...

Very posh setup with a ton of variety.  Not your typical indian buffet--and that's a good thing.  The highlight for me was the  butter chicken.  It was very rich due to the ghee/butter.  wow so good.  There was a goat curry with the first tender goat I've ever eaten.  Lots of veggie dishes including a wonderful cold indian potato salad.   The service was outstanding, and the staff did an awesome job with kids.   Prompt and available without being annoying.  Perfect! Would love to come back here for a-la-carte dishes and try their spice level.

I'm not really quite sure why Amber isn't a five star restaurant.  The staff is incredibly attentive, they even serve your dishes to you.  I suppose my only complaint is that we didn't specify that we could handle the spice...so our dinner wasn't as spicy as it could be.  But the flavors were incredible, both subtle as well as full bodied...if that is even possible.  We eat Indian a lot, probably three times a week on average.  This is definitely a great Indian restaurant.

Love this place! The food is amazing. I usually do Butter Chicken or the Tandori stuff. I usually go for dinner and make sure I have a reservation otherwise you will end up waiting.

Came here for a team lunch it I felt it was a lot better since we ended up going a little later than peak lunch time (1PM).  The food was pretty much the same as the previous time that I went, but I guess not being placed in the corner of the room and getting good service in a group made me up it by a star.  Not a bad place for group lunches as long as you make reservations and choose a slightly later lunch.

Save the money you'd spend here and get not one, but three excellent meals at any of the hole-in-the-wall, strip mall Indian places you like.  As with everyone else here, I agree that the hype just doesn't hold up, and I have had much better of everything at divier joints.  The butter chicken was less sweet and creamy than desired, the aloo tikki was bland and mushy, the tandoori mixed grill was a mixed bag of good and bad.  The garlic basil naan, however, was warm and delicious.  That being said, the ambience is warm and inviting and the wait staff professional and very attentive.  Now if only the food would merit the high prices they charge.

This was the second time we were there ,,,,,well bland food! The first time the chicken was bland/ undercooked and the roti / nan burnt The second time based on these fabulous reviews decided to go back! What a mistake! This time around  bland again. Maybe am too indian and I expect a little spicy food from an INDIAN restaurant, but whatever ,,,,,,,,in a group of 12 people we ordered 6 different curries,,,,,all of them sugary n creamy curries ,,,,I can understand 1 curry being like that but all! ,,,,,,thts not indian food! I should have guessed it from the fact that you hardly find indian patrons visiting both times I visited and what I hear from friends Maybe its just my palette and I would have still given it a little more rating based on how popular it is amongst the Americans  ,,,,,,but the icing on the cake was when they whisked my plate away and I wasn't even finished yet. I turned to speak to a friend and : O my plate was gone. How rude, the waiter did not even bother asking!!!!!! Probably it was near about their closing time and he was already dreaming about home! Will not recommend if you want to try decently spicy or authentic indian food.

The food was great: Chicken Tikka Masala (had better, but not by much); Dum Aloo Bukhara (potatoes stuffed with mint and apricot chutney and cooked in a tomato based sauce, Favorite Dish of the night!!!); Lassi (Both Mango and Sweet were delicious). Waiters were attentive and very nice. Even with our service dog they didn't give us any grief or treat us differently (other than a few stares). Missing one star just because it was a little pricey for the quality of food. I'm used to those awesome Chaat places where the food is delicious for only a few dollars. Amber was great, but for $12 a plate for indian food, I expect to have a mind explosion after the first bite.

Great place to get some delicious Indian food. I particularly recommend the Butter Chicken and the Spinach Saag. Some of the fish dishes are a suprising treat too. Be sure to order a some garlic naan and a hot chai to complete your meal.

This is the best Indian lunch buffet I've *ever* been to. As with all buffets, there are some dishes that were missing (chicken korma), but everything on the buffet was GREAT. It's a little bit more expensive than other buffets ($13.95) and a TON more delicious.

Fantastic! I have been to this location for dinner a few times, and it's my favorite place to get Indian food. The staff is wonderfully friendly, and the food is downright yummy. They also aren't afraid to make the dish super spicy. Don't be fooled by the unusual location in a strip mall. The inside has a nice ambiance.

Tasty dinner with nice ambiance. Quiet date place. We usually order the Amber dinner (enough for two), and maybe an extra order of butter chicken (my favorite). I feel pampered because the server actually puts the food on your plate (I felt awkward the first time, but now I'm used to it). The food is not too spicy, and it doesn't seem greasy at all. Any kebab appetizer is good too. Side note: If you get cold easily, bring your sweater or hoodie. The AC is on blast here.

I've eaten at Amber many times, starting with a friend's birthday dinner not long after I moved to the Bay (Spring 2006). Every single time I've been here until today, it's been absolutely wonderful and I would easily have rated it 5 stars. Yes, it's expensive, but the food was always unique and beautifully spiced and the service and ambiance are generally excellent. My favorite dishes are their palak paneer, dum aloo bukhara (potato dumplings with mint-apricot filling), vegetable samosas, and the sukhi bindi (okra). I've tried a few other things like the paneer elaichi pasanda (paneer in almond sauce), aloo gobi, and pindi chole, which are also good, and meat-eaters that I've visited with always say their meat dishes are really tasty too. I've been with friends and with several different people's out of town family and everyone always leaves happy. Until tonight. Tonight, the samosas were just like I remembered, with crispy outsides and flavorful potatoes. But the palak paneer was less flavorful despite packing more heat. The dumplings of the dum aloo bukhara were too squishy, and its sauce's flavor and texture had lost their subtlety and smoothness. I used to eat the sauce plain after the dumplings were gone, but felt no impulse to do that tonight. The naan was thin and too crispy, no good for soaking up flavors. The meat-eaters with me said the kerala lamb curry didn't taste like much. We all agreed that it didn't live up to previous experiences. Something was missing. A big disappointment after so many excellent experiences. With their prices, it's got to be more than just okay. It still gets four stars on the balance, but tonight was more like three stars. Amber, please don't go bad! Go back to your old ways.

Don't go for dinner, go for the lunch buffet.  I've been on Sunday afternoons and it's entirely Indian families, which should be a good sign.  I think it's $15/person, and they have all the classic dishes on their dinner menu, but this way you can sample some and go back for the ones you like the most! The butter chicken is the star, but all of the other vegetable and meat dishes (except I didn't try the goat curry) are distinct from one another and still very warm though out on the buffet line.  I like it when it's busy; the line moves fast, and the food is replenished often.  They're generous with the naan, too. Supposedly one of the top 100 restaurants in the Bay Area according to the SF Chronicle, but you'll have to search for it in this nondescript strip mall.

I don't know why this place was voted best in Silicon Valley. It's a standard Indian food lunch buffet. There were more options than usual, including three chicken dishes (tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and something else), but the buffet line is cramped behind a low wall and it ends next to the bathroom. Decent but utterly predictable food, meh atmosphere. Not worth seeking it out.

For the prices, I expected a lot more in taste and quantity. I placed my order and they told me 15-20 mins, 30 mins later I got my food. I ordered the Chicken Tikki Masala and it was not that great. The side of rice I ordered was extremely hard and dry. Maybe I hit them on a bad day, but I will never try them again. Their samosas were okay, but that's pretty much it. I ended up ditching the food and just grabbing pizza.

An unexpected jewel situated in a strip mall, Amber India offers visitors a vicarious trip to the Far East.  An assortment of appetizers introduces the tastebuds to an amazing range of Indian flavors: crunchy, veggie, nutty, cheesy.  Spices in sauces are artfully blended.  For dinner, try the Chicken Marsala or the Lamb Curry.  Nan (bread) comes in a variety of ways: garlic,  stuffed with cheese or nuts and raisin paste.  Prepared with pride and served with care and attention to detail, the food is bound to please.

The restaurant that finally made me yelp.  As a South Bay girl, it is ridiculous that it took me so long to finally make it to Amber India.  Everyone talks about it - East Indian or not.  It was worth the wait.   I began my feast with the Reshmi Tikka, kebabs made from minced chicken, cashews and onions, cooked in a clay oven.  Even if I just ate plates of the tikka for the rest of the night, I would have gone home a happy, happy girl.  But the parade of gastronomic delights continued with: Malai Kofta (deep fried cheese and potato dumplings cooked in a tomato cream sauce), Kadai Paneer (cottage cheese cooked with bell peppers and onions) and the Chef's Special Kadai Chicken (medium spiced dry chicken prepared with onions and bell pepper).  In my experience, most Indian restaurants shine easily in the meat category, but fare disastrously on the vegetable dishes.  Most of the time, the vegetable dishes end up of the same consistency, doused in cream, only to be distinguished by faint discrepancies in color.  Not so here.  The Malai Kofta were moist and flavorful with NO hint of mush.  The tomato sauce it was suspended in was spicy and only minimally creamy.  The Kadai Paneer was firm, zesty, and perfectly complimented by the dry stir-fried bell peppers. Lastly, while the naan was perfectly competent, it wasn't of the "knock-your-socks-off" variety.  Yummy, just not epic. (See Tikka Masala for epic naan).   Where service is concerned, I usually don't have high expectations for Indian eateries.  Amber impressed here, too, as the restaurant staff were attentive and efficient.  Add to this a pleasant dcor - Amber is not your average bustling Indian joint with a cafeteria-feel - Amber makes for a solid all-around dining experience.

based on yelpers' reviews, i had high expectations but was disappointed when i went to amber india last week for dinner. the food: it was good but not great.  i've had better indian food at several other restaurants in sunnyvale. i ordered the chicken tikka masala which was fine but nothing amazing. two of my friends ordered the scallop entree in a spicy/sweet onion sauce and had asked for 'less coconut milk' but the waiter got both orders wrong. the sauce came without any coconut milk. we ordered the garlic basil naan which was served lukewarm and flabby. there was barely any flavor to it--we couldn't taste any garlic or basil.  my friend ordered the 'frontier naan' stuffed with nuts and raisin paste--this was sweet and savory. really good though also served lukewarm. the service: there isn't much conversation with the waiters. orders are taken and dishes are served. when our entrees didn't appear for over 30 minutes, we had to flag a waiter from another table since ours had gone completely m.i.a. would i give amber india another try? i wouldn't. given the dinner prices ($30/person), the food quality, and the service, amber india doesn't deliver.

I've heard so many positive things about Amber, so when I had an opportunity to go for lunch, I jumped at it, expecting wonderful things of the food.   Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed.  Went for the lunch buffet, which was just so-so.  It wasn't any different than any other indian buffet that I have had in the Bay area.   The boondi yogurt was over salted. The dal flavorful - but didn't have the spice that I like. The fish was totally tasteless and cold! The asparagus with paneer was quite interesting. The creamed spinach was nice but once again, didn't have the spice. The tandoori chicken didn't have the true tandoori taste.  Lemon helped a little bit but not enough. The chicken makkhani was somewhat sweet - not something I like. The gulab jamuns were, well, gulab jamuns - nothing spectacular. I doub't if I'll go back here again.

I used to absolutely love the food here, so it pains me to write a poor review.  This used to be my favorite Indian restaurant, but the cleanliness of the place has really gone down hill the last few years.  We used to go there all the time for both lunch and dinner when we lived nearby, but we moved and stopped going as often.  We recently visited for dinner, and while we were sitting at the table, my wife noticed that were was an old, dried food splatter on the wall right next to our table.  We tried to laugh it off as just an overlooked cleaning mistake.  We ordered drinks, and dinner while having a chat, out of the corner of my eye, I spied a huge cockroach crawling across the floor, in the middle of the dining room.  When I called the waiter over to check it out, his reaction was really non-chalant, like it happens all the time.  Needless to say, we were both so grossed out, we bolted out of there immediately. It is unfortunate, because in the late 90's, early 2000's, I share so many good meals there, and the awards they won were so well deserved. Anyway, I have since been eating at the Santana Row location.  It is much cleaner, and the food is really good there.

Since I was down south along the penninsula, I decided to check out the "best" Indian Restaurant in the area.  I only eat lunch buffets at Indian places, and Amber's buffet is just okay.  I think people might find it special because it has a large separate table for desserts and for this special do-it-yourself assembly: a deep fried mini hollow puff that you fill with potatoes, rice, fried chickpeas, random spices and some oniony liquid.  I guess it's an aquired taste.  So, other than that, which I've never seen before, the rest of the regular buffet is just average.   The butter chicken has very small, stringy pieces of dark meat.  The chicken curry is watery stewed chicken with bones and not spicy or flavorful enough.  The tandoori is very good, though, with large chicken pieces, and you can usually find white meat somewhere. Some gripes: they put the meat at the very end of the line; they had three chicken dishes and no other meat dishes! (I've never been to an Indian Buffet that didn't have lamb, and that's usually what I eat, so grrr!), we had to ask for the naan (it should have been brought immediately, without us having to ask for it!  We're they being cheap, like we didn't know how to eat Indian food?), the price $13.95 for Sat lunch. My husband's gripe: nothing was spicey/zesty enough; he likes to use the naan to scoop up tasty sauces, but things were too bland or not saucy enough here.   And no dishes were a standout here.  I've had much better food and seen much more selection in Chicago.   The price of the lunch buffet is just too high.  The best buffet for me in the bay area is still Great India Restaurant in the city because for $6.45, you get extremely good quality meat in very spicy sauces.  The selection might be limited but the quality is very high.  Did I mention that I'm a carnivore? Update: after eating at Turmeric in sunnyvale, I had to drop this place by one star because Turmeric is only 10.95 lunch and this place is 13.95 and Turmeric has a bigger selection and much better quality food and much friendlier, etc, etc.

One of my colleague is a fan of this place and he took me for lunch buffet.

I have been meaning to write a review since Halloween day, the day when we went here for dinner.  I had sent a feedback through their web site  (the next day after Halloween) and never heard from them till this day! 1. The Naan was downsized due to economic downturn! 2. Malai Kofta, the Malai was so hard, it was not tasty at all. The waiters were outstanding in their service. I am unhappy about the pricey  food. Even more unhappy to have not heard from them after I submitted feedback thro' their web site 2 months ago. After the dinner, I just felt like tipping the waiters for their good service and not paying for the so-so food.

The Good: -Phenomenal Indian food. The butter chicken is not to be missed. -Garlic basil naan. Nuff said. -Extremely attentive service. Although the waiters aren't chatty, they are extremely professional and bend over backwards to meet your needs. -Surprisingly intimate atmosphere (given it's uninspiring location) -Efficient seating means we've never had to wait more than 15 minutes The Bad: -This food is the "mess-factor" equivalent of a sloppy joe, so beware if this is your first date restaurant.

Good food umm somewhat less variety to eat but I think I got into a lunch buffet so that might be the reason for it. The food smelled good and had an oily look as expected from the cuisine in northern India. If you love spicy food, this is more americanized and do not expect that it will get to the pores of the hair on your skin. People should try tandoori chicken to get the taste of this place. I especially liked the desserts and fried tid-bits which were served with the buffet.

I think this was my first time at an Indian restaurant.  It was pleasant because the service was excellent and the food came out really really quick.  I went with a group of people so I was able to try a lot of different dishes and share family style.  Some dishes were pretty tasty and some were not, but overall I guess I'm not a big fan of Indian food.  I liked the naan(flatbread) and a lot of the curries but some of the other dishes were not as tasty as maybe mediterranean food.   Prices were very reasonable also... I was in a group of 6 and it came out to $20/person.   The ambiance of the restaurant was nice and very Indian.   I would recommend this place if you are looking for some decent Indian food.

I really love LOVE love their palak paneer and their fried veggies (pakora???). YUM! And their naan is PHE'naan'MENAL! :) Their taro and eggplant dishes are pretty spicy but still super awesomely perfect. The dishes change from time to time and their fresh salad is SO GOOD! This place is pretty popular so the buffett line gets LOOOONG. So I advise taking 2-3 big fat plates (or however many you can balance with your hands) to reduce waiting time.;) I will definitely be back here MANY times and be leaving with a fatter belly.

I showed up just before closing and the staff was very attentive and accommodating.  Service is excellent, with the host informing me that last call was in a few minutes and being sure that I got a beer in time.   The place is quite nice inside, with lots of attention to detail, such as attractive art and quality servingware.   Despite this, I didn't feel out of place in a T-shirt and jeans. I eat a lot of Indian food and  the Butter Chicken was amazing, probably the best I've ever had.  The garlic naan was light and flaky and delicious.  My only quibble was the amount of rice I got, but I was asked if I wanted more and by that point I was stuffed. The prices were a bit high, but there was a LOT of chicken in my dish.  It's a shame I live on the other side of the country or I'd go often!  Highly recommended.

This restaurant was terrible. Not only is it extremely expensive ($16.95 for an a la carte serving of curry + more for rice and naan), the food was not good at all. I ordered the butter chicken curry, which got rave reviews in the quick tips section of yelp. It tasted like a can of tomato soup, and the chicken in it was dry and tough. The naan was thick and dense, not light and flavorful as I am accustomed to. The rice they served me had remnants of another curry in it; yellow pieces in clumps next to the plain white rice. Overall, this restaurant isn't worth the cost, and the flavor is horrible.

The Hara kebabs turned out to be just deep fried spinach with no taste whatsoever. Paying 6$ for this dish was a royal waste. Dal Bukhara is a speciality of restaurants in India. but here it was not upto the mark here. They should really change the name of it to some other dal. We had to order more rotis "thrice" before it turned up on our table. In the meanwhile waiters kept coming to our table to take our plates away. I do not think I will go back again.

I don't understand why this is recognized as one of the top Indian resturarants in the bay area. The food was expensive, and simply not good. The ambiance is pretty good in here - it is quiet, clean,etc. The chicken in my curry was very dry and flavorless. The eggplant was decent, but the portion was less than the size of a babyfood jar. The lamb was also chewy and hard to bite through. If i had to pick the MOST overrated restuarant in the bay area, Amber takes the cake.

Chicken ka tikka is a must.  Feels like it is "healthy" dish because it lacks a thick sauce.  Chicken is very juicy and tender.  Amber India gives a small discount to the menu price for take out food.  Arguably the best Indian restaurant in the Peninsula.  Only downside is the price.  Would rather eat quality Indian food though than try my luck at a five dollar joint.

Run by a charming and attentive staff,  Amber India dishes up a tasty array of food in an intimate and comfortable atmosphere.  I met three girlfriends for dinner there.  In the mood and to try several items and happy to share,  I can tell you that we highly recommend the Tandoori Salmon sizzler,  the Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Paneer  (Spinach with farmer's cheese and spices) and Amber Ki Hari Subzi (Fresh greens sautéed in a garlic sauce).  The Garlic and Basil Naan was also delicious.  The prices are decent as are the entree portions, oddly they were a little stingy with the rice.  I look forward to visiting again.

Yummy.  Went to Amber India while visiting 'home' and eventhough a little pricey, comparable to the cost of good Indian food in NYC.  Would definitely go again...

Arguably some of the best Indian food I've had in the South Bay.  In terms of taste, quality, variety, and authenticity, it's right there at the top of the list.  A lot nicer and cleaner, compared to some of the competition.  The service was surprisingly good too, again compared to similar restaurants.  Pricing is a bit higher but still reasonable.  In terms of specific dishes, my favorites were the butter chicken, followed by a cheese curry, and the tandoori chicken.  The miniature samosas were fabolous for those who like samosas but want more variety in their meal.  And make sure to leave room for dessert, which maybe too sweet for most but hits the spot for me.  Can't wait to come back here again.

My fiance loves Amber India, more than any other Indian restaurant in Mountain View. I think it's alright, but to me the food tastes the same as Shiva's. Maybe I'm missing something? Anyways, it's still really yummy, and I enjoy eating here. The ambiance is nice. Slightly upscale but not pretentious. The waiters have always been nice. Maybe a little pricey, though.

A typical Indian restaurant experience for me is buffet heaven, and about 10 glasses of water or 3 pieces of naan to soak up spiciness.  Amber India is no exception.  But its difference lies in the quality of its dishes.  Everything here just tastes better.  Even the naan is chewier, not overly charred, and they don't skimp on how much they'll provide you with.  Go is all I can say.

North Indian food from Punjab and Delhi, but also fish dishes (Bengal fish curry) from Goa and Bengal brought in by owner Vijay Bist. Mainly vegetarian appetizers. Prices run higher than most Indian places, but you get excellent service, white tablecloths, and attractive china. And it's quite yummy. No fear of rumble belly here! There's also a newer location at Santana Row. BTW,  in Hindi, the name is derived from Sanskrit, meaning "the sky". I had lunch there on Aug 28, 2009, where I ordered the jal-jeera, literally "water cumin" in Hindi, a beverage similar to lemonade, generally served as an appetizer . The cumin aids digestion, while another ingredient, the mint, has a cooling effect.  Another ingredient, black salt or rock salt, also acts as a digestive. It is a popular drink in northern India, and also rather healthy, as it contains no sugar.

I was in a grumpy mood at first, because we were given an absolute crap table in the hallway between the kitchen and the lobby.  But I was overcome by the delicious delicious scallop curry and butter chicken that we ordered.  They also had surprisingly good cocktails for the MTV.    The food is equal to or better than the Santana Row location, and the service is MUCH better (i.e. they actually show up at the table more than twice).  The atmosphere here is much quieter and friendlier, without the gobs of 28-year old junior finanical analysts wearing striped shirts.

There are certain cuisines that only make sense to me in a casual settings.  I've tried Mantra in Palo Alto in the past, and after having eaten at Amber India, I'm sure that Indian food belongs on that list as well. It was definitely unexpected, for me at least, to walk into this restaurant to subdued lighting and hushed conversations.  The interior decor didn't appear particularly Indian-inspired and neither did the atmosphere, for that matter.  But, as fitting with the more formal dining experience, service was prompt and attentive. We started with vegetable samosas, which were incredibly spicy and prompted an immediate order of a mango lassi.  The potatoes and peas were excellent and the samosa itself was crispy and light.   For our entrees, we ordered a palak paneer, which is spinach with farmer's cheese.  I am a huge fan of paneer, and its combination with spinach in the depths of Indian history was a stroke of genius.  I've discovered, however, that most places don't make this dish anywhere near the spiciness that I enjoy.  While this dish here was par for course in the spiciness scale, it ended up working in my favor because it tempered our other dish, which was off the scale in spiciness -- the three mushroom biryani.  I have to admit that I really liked the main ingredients to this entree, in particular all of the mushrooms which texturally complemented the nicely separated grains of rice with a chewy, almost luxurious silkiness (my apologies, there's a commercial for chocolates on the TV as I'm writing this).  However, this dish was a couple levels too spicy for me, and I ended up mixing a copious amount of the palak paneer into it... and when that didn't quite work, we also ordered a side of raita (which is excellent in its own right). I'm not necessarily discounting that Indian food can be "expensive" -- after all, one of my favorite Indian places is Dosa in San Francisco.  But, the atmosphere really needs to be more casual and fun instead of reserved and, dare I say, "stuffy".  The food was about a 3.5 and the atmosphere probably toned it down to a 3 for me.

Wow, there are so many 4-5 star reviews on here and to think I was almost going to give it a 2!  Well, I really want to give it a 2.5, but I'm rounding up and I felt 2 was a bit too harsh.  Anyhow, my overall general opinion of this place is just so-so.  One of my co-workers raves about it so I finally went ahead and tried it.  I went on a Friday night around 7pm and there was no one waiting, but we snagged the last table.  Apparently prime time isn't until about 90 minutes later since by the time we left, there were about a dozen people waiting. We were at the table closest to the host stand in the outer of the two main dining rooms.  The restrooms are towards the back of the restaurant and be careful...the floor is VERY slippery in the back room on the way to the bathroom.  I felt the hosts and waitstaff were all very nice and efficient.  We didn't have any service issues at all. We ordered three main dishes - the butter chicken ($16.95), palak paneer ($10.95), and mushroom masale wale ($10.95).  My first impression was that this place is severely over-priced.  I'm not trying to compare it to Naan and Curry, but I feel like the prices aren't really justified.  True, it is a sit-down restaurant, but the interior and ambiance are far from being posh.  It's very, very casual.  I went with the butter chicken because I love chicken tikka masala, but I wanted to try something a bit different.  The dishes are very similar and I can't say it's any better than the $5 version I get at Naan n Curry.  And I can't get over the $16.95 price point; I am by no means a cheap ass when it comes to spending money on food, but it's a bit much.  The palak paneer was fine and good - one of my favorite Indian dishes, actually.  The mushroom dish was on the spicy side, but it was fine.  I felt like all the dishes were good, but not outstanding.  The rice is priced at $1.95 and plain naan at $2.25.  For two people, you probably need about 2 orders of each and it really adds up.  We also had two glasses of wine as well.  Total damage with tip was $78 - ouch! Don't get me wrong, the food is fine, but I feel like I can get the same taste for much cheaper elsewhere.  Live and learn, I guess!

Hadn't been here in MANY years for dinner. Sure am glad I went. The service was TERRIFIC. From the owner who took the reservation, to the hosts, to all the waiters. They also provided us with an excellent table that worked particularly well for our family. Just super nice and attentive. So RARE these days. The food was tasty. I particularly enjoyed the Spinach Paneer dish. The spicy potato and pea samosas were really good too - great pastry around it. And really enjoyed the taste of the Chicken Tikka Masala sauce. We were in the first room on the left. It was quite relaxing, including the music. I so appreciated the great service!!!

The food was mediocre. Nothing spectacular and I expected more for all the hype. The decor looks cheap and dated, especially in hip and trendy Santana Row. I had the famed butter chicken and literally shook my head at the table wondering why everyone raves? It was the best of the dishes we ordered, but that's hardly an endorsement. We hoped the dessert would be better but the frozen milk/honey/fig thing was granular and coarse, kinda like frozen sand... and tasted only slightly better.

At least Amber India is consistent. The food was just as good as the one at Santana Row, but I have the same feelings about it. Although very tasty, it's expensive. I always ask for my dishes to be spicy, but they are not. There are a lot of really good Indian restaurants closer to my home.

This didn't look anything like the Santana Row location for Amber and considering the prices were the same, it was kind of a rip-off. I went for the $14 lunch buffet and it really wasn't worth it. There were some nice options like the lemon fish which was nicely cooked and more unique, but the butter chicken tasted like cheapy-restaurant quality butter chicken. It had that kinda sour aftertaste that cheaply-made butter chicken had. The dessert that I had (rasgullah) was dry and tasteless. Indian sweets are known to be really sweet so they don't have to cut back on sugar for the one dessert meant to be sweet on the table. They had fresh cut fruit and rice pudding also. The naan was ok but a little stale at our table and they didn't come by to refill it or our water. The restaurant is in a strip mall location and the interior is small but clean. Parking wasn't a problem at lunch. Overall this place isn't nearly as good as the Santana Row one, and the buffet isn't as good as Madhuban in Sunnyvale. It's about the same as Mayuri in Santa Clara... left with the same uncomfortable aftertaste of my food as I have there.

The atmosphere here is much more intimate than other Indian restaurants I like, with soft lighting and multiple smaller sized rooms, which makes it a nice date place.  Without a reservation it can sometimes take quite a while to get a table, though the waiting area is large and comfortable.  The food will not disappoint - it's really good.  Unfortunately you'll be wishing for more of it, because the portion sizes are too small for the price.

Yes, Amber may be pricey.  But the food is worth it! I went with two friends. I got the paneer pasanda. It was extremely flavorful, with plenty of paneer, and although spicy, not too spicy, greasy, or salty. The okra dish and the kadai chicken were also good. The mango lassi was pretty good (not the best). The kheer for dessert was quite tasty, as was the dal halwa. Altogether: an excellent meal

Lets not beat a dead horse here....WIth more than 100+ praises from Yelpers raving about the wonderful food, ambiance and service... you can be assured this place ROCKS. AMBER has two locations but the mountain view location is way better in my opinion. MAKE RESERVATION because the wait on a friday or Sat nite can be horrible. Even with reservation you can still expect to wait about 15 minutes or so. But the food is well worth it. ENjoy!

Everything we ordered was a winner...but I think everyone's favourite was the Mushroom Mutter Makana (Mushrooms with peas cooked with lotus seeds in an onion ginger curry). Don't let the little bowls fool you...the portions are much bigger than you think. Amber India is definitely a nice treat for your tastebuds.

I've been to the one at Santana and Mountain View, and I'd like to start off by saying that Mountain View's location seemed to taste so much better.  The food was good, but I did not find anything out of the ordinary or spectacular.  I thought the flavors were not distinct enough from dish to dish, and that some of the sauces were a little too heavy on the cream.  I really liked the naan and the pistachio ice cream that I had after dinner, but the food was just ok for me.  Had the prices not been as expensive, I would have given it 4-stars, but you like to feel that you get what you pay for, and I expected more for the dollar.  The service was really good, though.  If you want to try Amber, try the Mt. View one, but go in to it just expecting pretty run-of-the-mill Indian food for $$$.

I have to give them 5 stars....The food is excellent! Just ate here a couple of minutes ago...What a great experience! The butter chicken was exquisite and the mango ice-cream the best I have ever had. There was enough parking outside and the servers were also very helpful. I did not like the fact that they charge you for everything, from naan to rice. The place is a tad too expensive. I mean, for an indian restaurant that is. Normally I wouldn't pay more than $40 for two people at an indian restaurant. We ended up paying $70. I will come again, though. Excellent food - there is just no arguing about that.

This is easily the most delicious (northern) Indian restaurant on the Peninsula.  I had to add the northern or my southern friend would cry. Anyway.  Their menu has great selection.  They have done well with their bread offerings, cheeses (who knew?), seafood, and vegetables.   My stomach growls loudly when I imagine the butter chicken.  The ambiance here is incredible.  The walls are adorned with beautiful artwork, lighting and linen.   Would make a lovely dinner date spot if you are willing to spend some money...quite a bit of money.  Be careful.  This is the main reason why I like to go here with my parents.

This is my all time favorite Indian restaurant in the Bay Area (and I have tried alot). The food is delightful from the butter chicken to the korma to the palack paneer to the gulab jamun it is all wonderful with the korma being my favorite. They have a nice bar with with some really good specialty drinks. Service is generally pretty good. The only negatives that I can say is that it is a smallish restaurant, parking can be limited and was hard to find the first time (e.g. it's towards the back of strip mall) however this is not the fault of the restaurant. NOTE: We also really enjoyed the catering they did for a party I had awhile back...food was hot, fresh and very, very tasty.

from all the glowing reviews of this place, i expected it to be a lot better.  having  experienced passage to india (right down the block) last week, i was pretty excited in comparing the two, but it wasn't much of a comparison.  pti is superior in every category.   service: when we walked into amber, the manager/host almost reprimanded us because we didn't have a reservation--this is just an indian lunch buffet and not a prix fixe dinner at gary danko right?  so he told us we would have to wait while he checked if there was room for us--party of 2.5.  a few minutes later he said they could "accommodate" us and when we got to our seats we found that 6 of the seven tables were empty.  so why not seat us right away, since space was not at issue and why the attitude about not having a reservation?  on the flip side, at pti, we were seated promptly and the host even held the door open after seeing we had a stroller with us. space: pti is a lot larger/roomier and there is easy access to the buffet (on both sides).   amber's single sided buffet line is inefficient and at the end of the line, access back to your table is awkward--either you walk through the bathroom hallway/kitchen area or you have to bump your way back through the buffet line to get out--just poor planning.   food: quality of food is good at both places, but variety/quantity of dishes at pti make it the clear winner.  i usually go for at least two full plates, but at amber, my first plate was nearly identical to my second plate because there wasn' t much variety.  at pti, the variety makes for a much better buffet experience. amber and passage to india both have good food, but my overall experience at amber was fairly poor (4 for food quality, 2 for service/space/lack of variety), while i thought passage to india was pretty great.

This is pretty much the best it gets as far as Indian food is concerned! I've even been to India and have not found any restaurant that can compare, and I'm talking about restaurants in 5 star hotels in Mumbai! One of the sure signs that the food is good is seeing lots of Indians eating there. But, this place also appeals to good taste in general, so you'll see lots of non-Indians there too. My favorite dish here is chicken tika masala. By the way, this is a great place to go for closing a deal!

The worst ever and costliest Indian food available in Bay Area. They have Paneer Sizzler in the Menu, I ordered the same. The guy brought Paneer pieces in the plate. When I asked Sizzler supposed to be in a sizzling hot plat, he nodded in acceptance and got it Hot plate that was not even hot. Taste was worthless. Daal Bukhara was the worst ever I tested. Finally after all this horrible experience I decided not to give any tip. They charged my card with 10% tip even when we were only 2 people and I didn't mention the tip amount while signing the check so I disputed the same amount with my bank and got the money back... It is too costly considering the taste and service they offer. I will never go to this restaurant and suggest everyone to follow the same.

Curries are rich and flavorful (don't really want to know about nutritional information when we go), they have a chaat table, plentiful vegetarian as well as non-veg selection, the naan is hot and extremely delicious. It is the best introduction of the wonderful flavors of Indian cuisine who has never tried it before. The ambiance is lovely, and it's kid-friendly. A special treat each time I go.

A nice place for a date, Amber serves up decent Indian food, but they seem to have a problem hauling out the spicy (I expect "very spicy" to make me sweat and ask for more rice).  The serving sizes are generous, the food is delicious, and the vegetarian options, like most Indian restaurants, are quite plentiful.

My husband and I waited for 45mins on a Saturday night (around 8pm) to get seated but I'm glad to report that it was well worth the wait! The naan was perfectly roasted and the lamb was delish! They have a selection of Indian import beers and the Mango Lassa was flavorful. Can't wait to come back next time...and it will be with friends to share this great restaurant with!

Excellent salmon curry, naan, and service. Flavorful and mildly spicy. Good for a date or out of town guests. For serious spice, and a more family style, try Southern Spice down the street.

This place serves up some good food. I'm not even a fan of Indian food, but I enjoyed this place. Came here during the buffet, they have these fried greens that go really well with the yogurt sauce or the chutney. They also have a lot of grilled veggies, so you have some variety if you're tired of curries. Speaking of which, the curry selection is good. There were 6-7 if I recall correctly, half of which are vegetarian. There was one chicken curry I really liked (not the butter chicken). The veggie curry with lentils/potatoes was good too. Be careful when eating them not to eat too fast, as they put a lot of those little green pellets that will explode in your mouth. I also really like the flat bread.

I've been here 4 or 5 times b/c it's close to work. Ambience is cool and it's a cute little Indian Restaurant. It's clean and staff is friendly. I usually go for their buffet during lunch but I take it to go due to my time constraint. So, price for buffet is $13.95 and they give you 1 togo plate and 2 little containers. Some days, they'll have fried basils which i love and their butter chicken is always good... Their fish is a hit and miss. Today, their fish was soaked in a curry sauce which was tasteful. If it's not with curry, I would not suggest getting it. Would I come here if wasn't close to work? Maybe..

The food is great, no doubt - 4 stars! The food is really good, they have a pretty reasonable number of options as well, I really never had a bad experience as far as food is concerned, but not the service. But their service is mediocre, the waits are usually long, even when there are empty tables, and not even like they have too many customers coming in with a reservation. In fact, once I went in at 9:32(yes, I noted the time!), and this place is supposed to be "open" till 10 on a Saturday night. They said they cannot offer a table, but can give me food to go, since their last order is at 9:30(which is why I noted the time), then I wonder what "open till 10" means - that you get in before 9:30, but leave before 10?! All other "open till 10" places take orders till 10. Service - 2 stars. For equally good food, but much better service go to the one in Santana Row. Oh, and I went to Amici's and had a good dinner :)

Definitely not for the Indian palate! I think I have the lowest tolerance for spicy food among all Indians (Sriracha sauce is way too spicy for me) and I found the food here bland and tasteless. Even if we disregard the spice level, the food has absolutely no taste whatsoever. We ordered Amritsari Paneer Tikka sizzler which was supposed to be tangy. The dish was neither sizzling nor tangy. There were just huge (really huge) chunks of paneer with a half burnt, half red layer on top. It was not only sizzling but was actually cold! The mirchi baingan salan was also equally bad. We had to ask for salt and some spicy sauce to add to the dishes and the waitress brought Sriracha sauce (hahaha) I had been here a year ago and I liked this place but yesterday was a total disappointment. Too expensive for such horrible food.

For North Indian (that's not home-cooked by somebody's mom), this place is hard to beat. Yes, it is pricey. Yes, it gets crowded. But it's nice enough to bring the in-laws (cloth napkins? why, yes!) and the service is decent at dinner. (It's touch-and-go at lunch because of the crazy lunch crowds.) If you're looking for more bang for your buck, then go at lunch for the buffet. Butter chicken, rogan josh, naan by the basket. Ok, I'm drooling now. I've never been to the one at Santana Row, but I think it would feel like an impostor. After all, part of the charm is that it's hidden away in a weird strip mall on El Camino.

After a random but delicious buffet adventure, my friend and I decided to check out the evening offerings of this little gem.  (Did I spoil the review by calling it a "gem?") It.  Was.  Great.  I'm a veggie, and when we informed the waiter of this little reality he immediately launched into "super-service" mode, and ended up helping us pick our entire dinner.  We started with the veggie samosas and went on to the khardai paneer and a potato dish that I can't remember, as well as some house cosmos.  As an added bonus, the waiter brought us out an extra potato and cauliflower dish--gratis!--as well as a huge pot of raita (after I admitted my undying love for it).  The samosas were probably the best I've ever had, being superbly crafted around sweet peas and mashed, spiced potatoes.  The paneer was beyond delicious, and perfectly spiced with a pretty hefty kick to it.  The potato dishes were also spectacular, with one featuring a flavorful "gravy" that was an awesome complement to the chutney-stuffed diamonds that hid within (a total surprise, seeing as I thought I hated chutney).  The cosmos, made with blood orange-infused vodka, were also fantastic. Overall, the food by itself would have made this a five-star review.  The service, being informative, friendly and generous, puts Amber in a league of its own.  I count myself as extremely lucky to have this place nearby.   I also love the semi-erotic picture in the womens' bathroom.  Added charm, eh?

Undoubtedly, the "BEST Indian restaurant in the BAY AREA". The food is great...the ambience is nice...the service is decent(I have had a few rough tussles with one of the waiters there). I(and a lot of other people I know) have felt multiple times that this particular waiter discriminates against  Indians...so I decided to boycott the place...BUT I COULDNT BOYCOTT THIS PLACE FOR LONG! As time passed, my craving for Amber food increased so much that I put my FAT EGO on one side and decide to start going there again:). The food at this particular branch is extremely consistent and always good (that is not the case with a lot of indian places). I rate this location higher than the Santana Row Amber location which has a much better ambience but mediocre and inconsistent food. I love the Amber Cafe too (it is an informal version of the restaurant and has lighter items on the menu). To summarize, I am a big fan of the "Amber" brand and am thrilled that they have a location on Market Street in SF now:).

I've been to the Amber India in Santana Row and was greatly disappointed. Not until recently did I get the chance to taste the original rather than the copy. And what a difference does it make ! The food: I didn't know that such Indian cuisine existed, actually that's the best I ever tasted. It feels almost like French cooking but with Indian flavors obviously. The attention to the subtle balance of flavors is just outstanding. I've been there a few times and I've always been blown away. Now there's on dish in particular that one must try, their star dish in my opinion, and it is the butter chicken. The location: nothing special, it's in an urban, next to a dentist. One wouldn't expect to find such a good restaurant in that location. The interior is decorated tastefully and feels comfortable. The atmosphere is quite classy without being snobbish. The waiters: they're all very nice and efficient and they contribute to give an upscale feeling to the place. The price: it's very affordable which is kind of surprising for this quality of food.

Amber tries out some different things on the menu and also on the buffet, which I really appreciate. It's not as spicy as some buffets (which you may or may not like) but I think it's very easy to tell that they use quality ingredients. I like the fact that many dishes don't have little bones, which makes for more pleasant eating, IMHO.  I don't go here as often as I would like to, simply because the wait can be 30 minutes, and during the lunch hour I just can't wait that long!

First of all, Indian food is not one of my favorite types of food....but Amber India changed my opinion!  5 stars for customer service, ambience, food, and pricing.  Oh man, their samosa and butter chicken's the best!  Even my 6 yr old loved it (and he's picky!).  The only thing I didn't really like was the location, kind of hidden in a small plaza, but plenty of parking.  I can't wait to go again!

Came here for a lunch buffet with colleagues from work. They do a good job of segregating the veg and non-veg, for the overly picky. The food itself is rather average, and a lot depends on when you visit the table. Some servings of the food are amazing, others are just below par. A lot depends on your luck and timing.

Good lunch buffet, Dinner is over priced for almost the same items. Service at night is very slow. I took off a star because we were sat next to the one guest in the restaurant when we arrived, I took off another star because they resat the same table right after even though the restaurant was virtually empty. I felt like we were in the non-Indian corner and it lacked privacy..... I will be back, but I was very disappointed on my last visit

excellent to the owners: I noticed that you are expnding and opening additional Amber restaurants in the bay area. Please checkout Burlingame Ave in Burlingame.  This would be an excellent location and business move.  People are always dining out in Burlingame (even in a bad economy). Two restaurants recently closed and the buildings are empty at 1428 and 1448 Burllingame Ave.  There are other buildings and properties that are also empty.   Please visit the area on a Fri or Sat evening around 8pm and you will see. One the best survive Burlngame Ave and you are the best!

Amber is so far the best Indian Restaurant I've been to in the Bay Area. Amber Dinner is a good option, but it brings so much food that it could easily be shared between 2 people. The service seems slow, but it's one of those places that doesn't want to rush you out of your seat. The only recommendation I'd make to the restaurant is to have a sign outside, or something that shows the restaurant exists and is open - I kept telling my friends it was closed, because there were no signs and it did not look like a restaurant from the outside.

Suffice it to say I've had my birthday dinner here the past 4 consecutive years.   I think this is hands down the best indian food I've ever had.  (and I eat a hell of a lot of curries).  :)  I've tried probably half the items on their menu over the years, and have yet to try something I didn't like.  The quality is consistent, and immediately apparent.  They do take-out too, which is nice as I live close by! Only potential drawback is the price, which can be a bit high for frequent dining.

Disappointing food - all the "curries" seem to be based on the same stewed tomato/onion mix, which lacks distinct spices. In the UK, this is a mark of a real low-end "Indian" place. Generally muddy and muddled flavours. Rubbery prawns with an off flavor had obviously been taken straight from the freezer and dumped in the standard sauce. Very noticable that there were no Indian people eating here. Good jaljira (but if you don't know what it is do not try it - it's not a taste most people care for). Salty lassi way too thick - like sucking raw yogurt through a straw. Way overpriced for what you get. We cook much better than this at home, as do most of our Indian friends. The ambiance is so-so - not outright horrible as so many Peninsula ethnic restaurants are, but lacking in character and intimacy. On the plus side, service was very good.

Delicious, expensive, formal, consistent.  I always wonder why Indian restaurants in this area are so expensive.  You don't get that much food for your money - although it is really good.  We tried the lunch buffet once so we could taste different things - but most of the time was waiting in a long line that backed up to the door.  It was like a cafeteria with people pushing and becoming impatient.  I didn't get more food because the line grew longer and I couldn't see if they had what I wanted out.  Passage to India is a better buffet.  Amber India is best for a formal sit-down dinner...

This is one of our favorite (Indian) restaurants in the Bay area! The quality of the food has always been excellent. I always order their chicken do piaza (literally meaning chicken with two onions) -- it's a tomato-based, almost-dry curry. My husband is a fan of the tandoori chicken. There's a lunch buffet every day, even on weekends. It's a bit more pricey than other buffets, but the quality is more fresh and healthy. The variety of the dishes always changes, and there's always good salad and desserts. Very nice ambiance. Friendly staff. We've been here for lunch & dinner. The place fills up quickly, but is well worth the wait. We've called for take out orders also.

I expected much better things from all the reviews and the prices. I was disappointed. The naan was more like a poppadum as it was so thin and crispy. The meat, for having been marinated, didn't have much taste beyond that of meat, which leaves me to wonder how long it was actually marinated. The sauce was really good, as was the bhindi. But all in all, it wasn't good enough to justify the prices. I prefer their location in SF...slightly more interesting dishes and the benefit of knowing one isn't eating in a strip mall (so I'm a snob ;) )

A wonderful place for an Indian meal. The food is amazing (they have curried goat to die for!), fresh, and very tasty! The service is impeccable. The restroom is very clean and well-stocked. And you will often find other Indian families here. (A very good sign in an ethnic restaurant!) A large party of us showed up for an impromptu birthday party for their Saturday lunch buffet and they handled us with grace and ease. Extra points goes to the staff for when I was lamenting no gulab jamun in the sweets potion of the buffet (but my sister had some incredible kheer) within five minutes a waiter came bearing a small bowl of them for me!, and I wasn't even the birthday person! It was sublime, I practically licked the bowl clean! I can't recommend this place enough. Take your whole family - you won't be disappointed.

This used to be my favorite Indian restaurant in the South Bay.  We went last night after about a year away, and it's not the same.  One of the paneer dishes called for it to be spiced with cardomom, but there was barely a hint whereas I recall liberal use of this spice in previous visits to Amber.  The kebab e khas was lightly colored with red food coloring, which is also a change from the past as we used to love the fact that they did NOT use coloring in their tandoori dishes.  The fish tikka was good but the texture was a bit off as if it had been over marinated and the flesh got mushy as a result.  Chole and okra were both good...nicely spiced and not greasy. Sadly we will probably not go back again.  For $110 including tax & tip (the dishes above plus a mango lassi and one glass of wine), it just wasn't quite worth it being that it's not just as good as it used to be.  I'll have to ask my Indian co-workers what they think of Amber these days since they were the ones who turned me on to this restaurant years ago.  For a Saturday night, the restaurant was packed but there was not a single Indian customer to be seen.

I do not have much to compare this place with as I have not gone to too many Indian Restaurants, but I have gone to more than a handful and I have tasted bad and I have tasted good. Amber is good. Very clean, very good service, and very good food.

Bottom Line with this place: 1)  Good fresh food 2)  Great service, classy and clean looking place 3)  Very expensive I think the Mountain View location is a lot better then the Santana Row location.  The Santana Row location seems more watered down and tailored to the non Indian crowd

Finally, an Indian restaurant with service and class and attention to detail.  The presentation of the food is beautiful.  The food itself however isn't astoundingly extraordinary.  It's rather mild, although still richly spiced.  Next time I go, I'm going to request my entrees to be hotter....and I would suggest that you do the same.   And try the chaat --- very yummy.  They were even so nice to prepare a plain dish of papdi with yogurt for my 3-year old at no additional charge.  Definitely worth the drive to go here!

I've been coming here for a few years now but almost always for lunch. Dinner, which is not buffet format, has more variety but is significantly more expensive for smaller portions and same quality. Taking into account stuff like naan and rice, dinner might be $30+ a person versus the $16-$20 at lunch. All of my Amber-loving friends concur. The thing to get here is the butter chicken, their specialty dish and one of my favorite individual dishes of all time. Fortunately, it is available at lunch buffet, and it is very tasty and smooth. I don't know how authentic it is, but I do know it is pleasing to my palate. The butter chicken here is even better than the counterparts at the more upscale Amber locations in San Jose and San Francisco. There are other dishes to be sure...sometimes I might try the chicken curry or something. But really, when I am here, I go straight for my usual: rice then butter chicken. Maybe end with some gulab jamen. Service is decent enough although they clearly want you to order drinks. A star off due to dinner prices and maybe for lack of variety at lunch. But I will definitely be coming back as long as quality for the items I do want is there.

Ok so me and my buddy checked out this place tonight and yes honey trust the food was bomb.  Definitely come here on an empty stomach cuz Indian food is some hearty filling soul food ya heard.  I must say I've been to a few Indian restaurants and they are never too friendly or attentive but they were here.  So down to the food....We got the Vegetable Biryani which was very tasty and nutty. The Paleek Paneer which was so flavorful in spice and those cheese balls were to die for.  The Aloo Ghoobi, which is one of my favs, another winner.  We also got the Butter Chicken and I gotta say I didn't love it.  The sauce was a bit to herby like there was Oregano or Italian Seasoning in it and the chicken was dryer then an old lady's coochie.  And for $17 I was expecting a lot, but I just didn't luuurv it.  Dunno if I'll come back since there are better places I like, like Shivas

This review is strictly for the lunch buffet. Working in Menlo Park brings me to Palo Alto frequently for meals.  One of the Indian places we frequent is Darbar on Lytton in Palo Alto.  Wanting to try something different we ventured a bit further south to Amber India to try the buffet there. Overall the experience was good - easy parking, no wait for our meal ( we arrived at 1:30 ), and plenty of food to choose from as you might expect.  One thing we noticed right away was the very mild spice used in most of the dishes.  There was nothing I tried that was very spicy/hot.   In conclusion I would recommend Amber if you want a very basic Indian buffet that has been 'dumbed down' for the American palet.  Given a choice between the two I would go to Darbar everytime.  Oh, and by the way, the tab at Darbar for two with sodas is about $24 bucks.  At Amber it ran us $35.  Not worth the delta in my mind.

Last Friday, this is the first time I have been here and my work is down the block. I have to say, I enjoyed it. For lunch, was the buffet and I was full. At first I was hesitiant to eat here because of the spices they had (not a big fan of spicy food). To tell you the truth, I was working up a sweat but I came back for seconds. My favorite is the Butter Chicken so far. I've tried other dishes that were good but cannot remember the names.

Amber was the first Indian restaurant a friend of mine took me to when I first came to California 10 years ago. For someone who grew up in Delhi and was attending school in Austin, it was hard to come by a high quality version of Butter Chicken. Amber eased my fears that one can indeed find that caliber of  Indian in the US. They have good Tandoori dishes as well, including some interesting seafod based dishes. They keep adding new and interesting dishes to the menu. Parking can be a pain at times, it can get crowded, and it is a bit on the expensive side as far as Indian restaurants go. Some of my friends complain it is a bit too Americanized, which I agree with only partially. It isn't perfect, though I would still recommend it highly.

Wonderful Indian restaurant. All the chicken dishes are very good, especially the tandoori chicken, chicken ka tikka, and the butter chicken. For vegetables, try the aloo gobi, very simple yet very good. Also, the samosas make a great appetizer, they have just the right spicyness. The service has never been lacking, they are always on top of things. For dessert, the rice pudding is second to none. The brunch here is also very good. There are many of the same selections as at dinner, plus a salad bar and wide selection of fresh fruit.

Overpriced Indian food. For the price you would expect the entrees to come with rice or naan. The butter chicken was fine, but the chicken biriyani was about the worst I've ever had-Bland, soggy rice mixed with some sort of tomato curry and not even warm. We ordered gulab jamun for dessert and that was disappointing too-hard and cold instead of being warm and moist. Disappointing experience, will never go back. Far better Indian places in the Bay area.

We came here because we saw that it was listed in the Chronicle's Best 100 Restaurants in the Bay Area.  It was good, very good, although I'm not sure it was that much better than other Indian restaurants on the Peninsula.  It was a bit pricier too.  My Chicken Tikka Masala was good, although I wouldn't really say it was much better than other places around.  She got the Tandoori fish, which she raved about.  Definitely give it a try.  It is possible, I guess, that I just don't know how to distinguish very good Indian food from great Indian food.

My family and I went for dinner here 2 weeks ago . My daughter, by mistake left our IPAD on the table ( it was late and she was busy watching Cinderella on it) . We didn't realize this till the next day . Called the restaurant and was told that they didn't have one, but that's not all, someone at the restaurant tried to tell us that my daughter didn't have an ipad but that she was playing with a TOY laptop----helloo.... really? I need to be told what my 5 year old daughter did or did not have with her!!!!!  . The manager denied ever seeing an iPad in my daughter 's hand as well, but later checked on their camera system  and agreed that we came in with one but never left with one . We never got our IPAD back and the manager claims that his staff didn't STEAL it and put the blame on the laundry company . Hetold me he would check with them and call me back............ 3 weeks later--- that phone call has yet to come???? FACT: We walked into this restaurant at 9:10 pm on a Sunday night with two other parties inside the restaurant and left around 10:15, at which point there was just one couple dining and atleast 5 servers staring at us to leave. Karma my friends is a real phenomenon. Good Luck Amber. I will never go back even though I love the food there  . THE MORAL OF THE STORY : IF YOU LEAVE ANY EXPENSIVE ELECTRONIC BEHIND , DO NOT EXPECT IT BACK BECAUSE SOMEONE WILL STEAL IT.

With an Indian friend, I discovered this secret, hidden Indian restaurant on El Camino Real. Everything is traditional Indian: the interior design, music, ambience, food and majority of the people. It's casual but elegant, and the price is reasonable. From what my Indian friend told me, this is the best Indian restaurant in the Bay Area, and it's popular for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. They even have a website: http://www.amber.india.c…. Interesting.

Had heard a lot of hype about the restaurant.  Left very disappointed.  The dishes were hard to distinguish from one another; seemed to share the same/similar tomato/spices/onion base.  And, the sameness seemed to infuse the menu.  All three meat dishes were chicken dishes.  Not very helpful for those who don't really enjoy chicken. And, the prices did not help.

THE CHAMP IS HERE!!!!! setting---- awards in front in a large greeting area, two dining rooms decorated with rustic pictures and paintings. Very comfortable with soothing music. service---- unmatched in moutain view, even at chez TJ. The wait staff is breif and effiecent, but also knowledgable. The managers are always so kind and hospitible. You feel as though you enetered their house. Food---- I'll be honest everything there is not my favorite, but what I like, I CRAVE.... The naan out of this world, the spiced okra is great on top of the saffron rice. If you like seafood I suggest the Tandoori seafood platter consisting of Tikka bass and Tandoori grilled prawns. Not to forget the flavorless made flavorfull LOBSTER!!! HA!!! YA!!!!...Normally lobster is my least favorite food because it is bland, but not at this little gem; its got a kick and aroma.. Also try butter chix, marsala mushrooms, farmers cheese and peppers, and bhindi choli. I will let you figure out what it is....The dessert actually at lunch time 2 years ago made a guest of mine cry because it reminded him of his mothers cooking. If thats not a superbowl win for that chef I don't know what is. TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT!!! GO TO AMBER FOR LUNCH OR DINNER IF YOU LIKE OR HAVE NEVER TRIED INDIAN FOOD!!! IT IS THE BEST RESTAURANT IN MNT. VIEW

Limited variety. Food was very tasty ! Very cramped. Looks like the planners wanted to make use of every single square feet space. There is an annoying wall that separates the place where the dished are kept and one section of the tables. If you get a seat there, you have every chance of running into someone who is walking out from that section as you cant see them. Must Eat : Tandoori chicken (easily the best I have had in my life) Butter chicken If you dont mind spending $15 for a lunch buffet this is a good option.

So I went to this place a week ago with my buddies and the ambiance was good but not the food. We ordered Malai kofta and the green herb veggies. The malai kofta was very very hard and the curry was also not that tasty. As far as the green veggie goes, it was the worst I had, it just had green onions and garlic and it was extremely dry... The naan and roti were dry and cold too.. And the worst thing is: I had two of my friends just visit me for 5 mins at the restaurant as they were leaving for LA and the server added an 18% gratuity...so was really disappointed by that. So the 4 stars are not worth it... Best!!

Over-rated by Yelpers. On the day we went for the lunch buffet, the food was mono-color. Everything was orange - no sign of green anywhere other than the salad. And everything tasted the same - obviously they used the same curry or spices for cooking up the so called variety. The waiters forgot to bring our naan. Upon prompting, it took a good 20 minutes more. Other tables got their naans promptly, so I am not sure if this was some kind of intentional or accidental lapse. For the price, I can do two lunch buffets for similar food. Not going back, sorry.

We are regulars at Amber and do enjoy their dishes thoroughly. The only reason I take away a star is due to their God awful rude service. On Karva Chauth night, we had taken 8 others to dine with us. We hadn't seen the moon (which ritualistically, is symbolic on Karva chauth to break the fast). We thought to order and wait. We gave our order and  waited for 4 other friends to arrive. All of us were hungry due to fasting the entire day and when the appetizer came, thought to walk back out just to take a glimpse of whether the moon was there. We were stopped by the rude host (the manager on duty!) who said: "I hope your server told you that our kitchen closes promptly at 945. The kitchen will not wait for the moon to come out." I was in utter shock that they charge the kind of money they do and still take the liberty to be obnoxious, sarcastic and rude. Throughout our dinner, it got worse. The waiter forgot to bring us our drinks three times. We had to ask for condiments at least four to five times. Their demeanor showed that they just could not wait for us to leave. After paying a total of 18% gratuity (shouldn't this be optional always?!) for our larger than 5 party, our bill came out to be somewhere around 400 bucks. The only thing that stood out was that the food was very good, but not awesome enough for them to get away with treating people the way they do. The only reason Amber is running well in the Bay Area is that they do not have the same level of competition as other cities do. Lord knows why. After all, we have more than enough Indians per capita here :) I really hope that they take some lessons in hotel management because soon enough, there will be other restaurants with better food and service who will cancel them out.

The most horrible Indian restaurant in the bay area. The navratan korma was a disaster. The naans were like pieces of dried tree barks. Their way of making chicken biriyani is to just dump pieces of chicken and chilli powder in rice. Went with people who ate non vegetarian too and not a single person out of the group of 7 people liked it. Seems like they customized the Indian food to the bland pallettes.

So the service is so good it's almost irritating.  Plus, you're overwhelmed because it seems as if every single wait staff member is your server, so you get confused.  I don't remember the naan being particularly fantastic, but that may be because I'm still wistful for Naan & Curry in the City.  I got the appetizer sampler (as I'm a sucker for variety), but I must say that the samosas were not overly impressive.  I had both the Kingfisher (a pretty sweet deal) and Tak Majal beer, which complimented the meal nicely.  For a vegetarian entree, I ordered paneer alanche pasada (sp?), the cardemom flavored farmers cheese cooked in an almond sauce.  Of course, I was drawn to it because it sounded so unique.  I guess I'm just not down with the Indian concept of cheese; I don't know.  It was just *aight*.  As far as dessert went, I had to go for the Kulfi Falooda, which promised pistachio goodness.  Again, just *aight*, but if you go to the website, it features dessert images, and it appears that that may be one of them.  Perhaps I just got the newbie chef that evening, and he f*cked it up royally, since the two are nothing alike.

Best Indian food in the Bay Area, mostly because I definitely appreciate the effort to de-grease the food. People have called it the best Indian food in North America, and while it's good, this is a massive overstatement. Comparable Indian food can be gotten in New York, Chicago, and even D.C. Between SF and San Jose, you can find something that is pretty good for much cheaper. I think now that the initial love affair that Americans have had with Indian food is over, it's time for Indian restauranteurs to really kick it up a notch.

This is my family's special occasion restaurant. We've been coming here 2-3x a year for more than 10 years, possibly 15. The food and service have been remarkably consistent over that time period. The food, however, is simply not in the upper-tier of Indian restaurants in the Bay Area. I am (mostly) a vegetarian, so I don't have experience with the meat here, but superior vegetables (e.g. curries) can be had at other restaurants for much less money. The korma is especially odd; I've never had another korma like Amber's (in a slightly bad way). The service, however, is what keeps us coming back. It's always, always, always outstanding -- they're very accommodating about substitution requests. The chai is quite good, but the lack of choice of a desert (you get kheer) on a $25 thali is quite disappointing. This is a good restaurant if food is not your top priority, but you're more interested in impressing someone (client, date, etc). However, there is much better Indian food for much less money at other restaurants in the South Bay -- see my reviews if you want my opinion.

I have had food at Amber before and always felt that it is priced higher than what it's worth. I used to believe it's a 3 star joint, but my experience last night convinced me that this place is actually 2 star. They charge you too much for sub standard food. Many folks think that Dosa in SF is hyped. But, I honestly feel Dosa is much more value for money.

Well, it's been many years since I last dined at Amber.  But recently, I started going again.  It was a surprise to find that the quality of the buffet was much superior to what I remember from a few years ago.  The veggie dishes were fresh, the spices vibrant, and the buffet regularly refreshed.  I'm impressed!  And obviously have changed my rating.  :-)

amber india has the best indian food i've ever tasted.  the prices are moderate (~$17 for a dish plus the cost of naan and rice).  the service is great -- we never have to wait for water refills! we lived nearby and often had takeout.  takeout food is discounted 10% (plus you save on tip!).

I came here on a weekday for their lunch buffet.   My Indian coworker said this place was the best Indian lunch buffet in the area so we went . It's a good thing we made reservations for our party of 12 because this place usually gets PACKED during the weekday lunch hour.  The wait staff was very friendly and courteous.  The place is pretty small so everyone is packed in like sardines and there isn't much room to move or walk around.  I was extra cautious as I was walking around with plates of food, being careful not to bump into someone thus sending my plate of food flying into the air.   The food was very heavy and filling (as I had expected), but it was still satisfying.  The chicken was slightly overcooked (dry-tasting) but besides that I was pretty happy with everything else.  They don't offer too many dishes to choose from, but it's definitely enough to satisfy your appetite and keep you full (for the next 6 hours....).   My only "negative comment" about this place is the price they charge for the lunch buffet.  $13.95 per person? Seems a bit on the expensive side for a lunch buffet, wouldn't you agree?  After tax and tip I ended up paying $18 total.  The meal was good, but definitely not worth $18 in my opinion.  I'll probably be back because the food is decent tasting, but maybe not for another year or so...

Really bad service. No one comes by to ask whether you need to add something else or not. And we had ordered something called Hara bhara sabzi - but it was all bland - absolutely no taste - and when we complained about ti - all we got was a rude response saying you should know before you order! Even when we did order a replacement vegetable - we were not told that it would be exactly the same sauce as the other vegetable we had ordered. I am never wasting money here again!

Came here for a late bite on a weeknight. Service + ambiance. Dined on the seafood curry with scallops, mussels, and fish, and a lamb curry. The garlic naan bread was a bit dry, but the curry dishes were far less spicy and greasy than at most Indian restaurants - a pleasant surprise.  Mango lasse = delightfully tart. Would most definitely return.

I always resisted the lure of Indian food until my boyfriend finally talked me in to coming here. We walked in on a Friday night and wait was only about 10 minutes. The interior was absolutely fab- esp. the bathroom sinks omg you halfway don't want to wash your hands in them they're so gorgeous. Service was excellent, food was excellent, only drawback was that they were so packed and someone that worked there would walk by about every 5 minutes during the course of our meal and watched our progress and tried to clear our plates. I understand they want to fit more people in, but rushing the existing diners isn't the best method for that. Other than that, really nice experience and would love to eat there again and again!

I called to make reservations for two, a few minutes after they opened on Valentines Day. 11:30.The guy says I am on this list. The reservation was at 9:00 pm. There was a lot of people crammed in the entrance area b/c it was real cold outside. I asked a few times is out table being ready, the guy says 2 minutes more two times. The man was letting all the non-indians who were lower on the list being seated first. WHICH IS WRONG. Me and my wife got seated about 9.32 for a 9:00 reservation. I knew it is valentines day but the another reviewer said you'll have to wait no matter what. We got seated next the walk way in the middle of the place. There was cold air coming and hitting us, making it real annoying spot. We told the guy  about the cold air and finally it stopped a little. As far as the food it was great, the service awesome ( they even packaged our lefftover food), the price was a little high, but not that bad. I am glad that we stayed and waited for a table, now we know what to expect. It was so busy the restaurant stopped taking walk-ins about 9:15 pm. Dont go on a busy day!

Delicious, great service and nice ambiance.  Not a whole lot more to say.  There are a lot of Indian restaurants to choose from in this area, for basic good taste of the food, I think this is one of the tops.  I had a Navratan Korma that was creamy, mild and delicious.  My sister had the Saag Paneer, which had a bit more spice and was very nice as well.  The paneer had a good texture.  Our husbands were satisfied with their meat dishes, but I can't speak to those.  The paneer-filled Naan was TO DIE FOR.  Yum.  Looking forward to going back!

Amber serves great Indian food - not the spiciest in the world, but the meat in their dishes is incredibly tender and tastes great.  The butter chicken is a true winner.  There service is also great.  I'd give them 5 stars, but they're a tad pricey compared to the other local places and it can get a little busy there sometimes...

Amber is a mid to high tier restaurant that I chose because it's my birthday.  I'd heard a lot of good things about it previously but kept in mind that I've been disappointed before.  We were seated & the service was excellent.  Water glasses never went empty, & they checked on us repeatedly.  Then the food came out.  Aloo Gobi & some Chaat.  The kids like that chaat.  We got chicken tikka masala, veggie korma, chicken tandoori, lamb (something), & the eggplant dish w/ saffron rice.  We missed on the chicken tikka masala.  The chicken was overcooked & dry but the sauce was good.  The Veggie korma was one of the richest (in the cream) I've tasted & it was DELICIOUS.  Best I've ever had.  The eggplant dish was pretty spicy (not HOT spicy, just a load of spices used) & it was good too.  Really, the food was top notch & very high in quality.  I cannot say enough about the Chicken Tandoori.  If I were to rate chicken tandooris over all of the Indian places I've been to, this place would hold the championship.  It was so good my kids were scarfing it down like it was ice cream especially my oldest kid who has gotta rank among the pickiest eaters at 16 years of age.  BRAVO.  I had a bit of sticker shock still at the end because the portions you get from this place aren't the biggest & we orders a lot of entrees for 3 adults & 2 kids 3 of whom barely eat anything.  Well, now I know, when someone wants to eat good authentic Indian food & price won't be such a big deal, Amber is the place to recommend.

We had a awesome night at Ambers yesterday.  The food was great - the presentation of the appetizers were nicely done, the cocktails were perfectly done...and the meal itself was very satisfying.  We loved the allepany fried prawns, Kerala lamb curry and the kadhai paneer.  The chicken tikka from the tandoor was very tasty and moist as it should be.  The service was very nice and since it was a birthday dinner, they also brought out a very nice dessert decoration of rasmalai and gulab jamun with a candle.  The sweets were well made - not too sweet and of the right consistency.  Though its more pricier than some of the other local Indian restaurants, the menu is unique and the quality is very good.

Five years ago, I would have given this restaurant 5 stars.  But since then, the food has continued to drop in quality while the prices continue to climb.  Now I have to say that Ambers is over priced and the food is over rated.  We went on Saturday and had Chicken Tikka Masala (normally my favorite) and Kadahi Paneer.  Both were overcooked and the sauces were thick and tasted more like italian tomato sauce than indian food.  The food has been consistently going downhill over the last few years, and after this experience I think we are finally done with Amber.  We won't be going back.

I have had a mixed opinion about this place. While the lunch buffet here is among the best in the area, I have consistently been disappointed with dinner here. The dinner entrees don't taste fresh and worse are the desserts that always seem stale. I also agree with a previous reviewer who states that the bread is cold. We were here for a birthday party and ended up disappointed with the experience when gulab jamoon, rasamalai and rosagulla all turned out stale. The annoying thing is that there was no one to whom we could give feedback to at the end. I would refrain from going here again.

Best indian food ever! Loved their chicken wrap, we eat here often and their briyani is superb. We usually go to amber cafe(a branch of it). Good for a quick, good, quality, reasonable priced meal.

Not sure about all these good reviews. They have failed to impress me - OK food, OK service, nothing really stood out.

What a disappointment by a place that used to always impress you with their food, taste, and service.  We went yesterday for dinner and paid $35 per person thali for bland dinner with no taste, and this didn't even include drinks!!!...  The only thing really good was their Tamarind chutney.  From someone who knows and understands Indian food very well, Amber has surely become a disappointment when it comes to taste.  The service was too much and felt it was lousy when you have bunch of waiters staring at you through your whole dinner.  They need to better train their wait staff on being discreet and still provide service to the customer.  There were at least 6 waiters staring at us, with multiple coming to us asking the same question.  They definitely need to train their staff on how not to ruin an evening meal.  The food is surely made for "firang" taste only it seems now.  The food had no taste what so ever and no distinct flavors.. Everything tasted the same!!!!..  That is not good when Indian food has so many tastes and flavors.  I will never go back to Amber again.. Will need to find a better Indian place that is classy, has service, but yet offers good food.

After reading the reviews and realizing that I was entering one of the" best 100 restaurants in the Bay Area," my expectations were high - perhaps too high. The four of us were seated at a table set for five (there were several available tables set for four) and the fifth setting was never removed during our seating. Service was pleasant with the high mark (or low mark if one prefers to serve oneself) with three waters serving us the five dishes we ordered (butter chicken, lamb, scallops, navratan korma and saffron rice). The butter chicken was absolutely spectacular but each of the other dishes was no better than that served by the several Indian restaurants in downtown San Mateo which charge about one-half to three-fourths the price. For example, the scallops and lamb were in a good but indistinguishable and identical sauce which was fine with the lamb  but totally overpowered the scallops. The final bill came to $35 per person without wine (we brought our own), including tip.
