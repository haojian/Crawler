I always have a lovely time here having brunch on their outside terrace. The seating is great and the service is superb! Quick, efficient and very friendly. The staff here always makes us feel welcome! The food selection here is the typical French bistro and style. The café has delicious drinks and sandwiches perfect for lunch. On the other hand, the main restaurant serves seasonal cuisine. I haven't had anything here that I wasn't pleased with. Food is always served fresh! Great for every meal of the day! I wish they had more places like this in Menlo Park. Just a warning, be prepared to wait a substantial amount on weekends since they get really busy. Two thumbs up for Mayfield Bakery & Café! I'm definitely a fan.

This weekend we were in Palo Alto and stopped by Town and Country for lunch.  We decided to eat at Mayfield    Here's the breakdown of our experience. Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Food: On this visit we had the Pulled Chicken and Bacon sandwiches and the kids had pizza.  We agreed that the sandwiches were fairly basic (chicken, lettuce, bacon) but put together real well and had very good flavor, everything seemed very fresh.  We also ordered a side of Onion Rings as no side was included with the sandwich.  They were very heavy on the batter but tasted delicious with a side of dressing.  Unfortunately there were only about 5 rings in the order. I had a bit of the kids pizza and it was also very good.   The only complaint here is that you don't get much for what you pay.  $12 for the sandwich and $5 for the side.  But you have to realize it's Palo Alto and it is what it is. Service: After about a 10 minute wait we were seated by the window.  The server was a bit slow attending to us but was friendly.  The food itself was delivered quickly, which is great when you have starving children. Atmosphere: The aesthetics are very basic.  It is modern and loud but also vibrant.  There is great people watching if you have a window seat.  The patrons are a broad spectrum of silicon valley from young and old.  The restaurant has just the right amount of pomp without feeling pretentious. Would I eat here again?  yes

Came here for brunch while visiting a friend in Palo Alto. It was great find especially since the place was very packed for a Sunday early afternoon. When we put our name on the wait list, the hostess told us that it was going to be an hour wait. Good thing we found a few seats at the counter and had our meal there. I had the Chicken Sandwich and fries while the hubby had a breakfast place. Their hash brown potatoes (it's called something else) was great. It was cooked just right and it was tasy too. Definitely a place to go if you're in the Palo Alto area. It's completely worth it.

We've gone here more times and I have to say it's become one of my favorites - perfect CA food - good casual vibe but nice enough to take out of towners. The waiters are great and we like the changing menu. Our favorite part is when they give you bread when you leave. Oh and get the hot chocolate - amazing.

This place makes me happy... Why?  Because it feels clean, fresh, organic, all the stuff I usually find pretentious.  The food is super delicious and the service has never failed, maybe because I go all the time (mainly at lunch).  It's "new mom" friendly which I appreciate since I tend to frequent this place with my cousin and her newborn.  Don't panic though, they tuck us in a way that we wouldn't mess up your experience. At least I hope not?! :D  PS Do have the Pulled Chicken Sandwich.  PSS Eat lots and lots of bread, it's worth it.

Mayfield wasn't bad. We had their thin crust pizza - and chicken sandwich. Sandwich wasn't anything special and pizza was A-Ok. Nothing spectacular or horrible about this place. I'd come back again.

I went to Mayfield the other night with my wife. We go there often. The service this time was exceptional. Mayfield can get very loud and after we sat my wife didn't like our seat. I told the hostess we wanted a quiet seat instead. Not only did she rearrange the seating on a busy evening to accommodate my wife's needs, she asked us our table preference for the future. I watched as she not only updated their system under my personal name and phone, but she noticed my name was linked to my secretary's number and added a table preference to her account too. They usually have a few hosts. If you go in and see a tall hostess, talk to her, she will take care of you. She even held the door for us as we left. It made all the difference to our whole experience.

Came here for the brunch today. The food was just so so and the service can be much better. I ordered the soft scramble egg, the portion was small and they put TOO MUCH cream and butter in the dish and after a few bites, I feel sick..My husband ordered a burger, but they made mistake on the sides and a few items are missing. The waiter doesn't even bother to ask us abt our food and was rude. After all , I am disappointed.

As always the food and menu selection excellent, the waiter offered outstanding service.   I love this place but Why the 1?? The outside seating and the hostess. How many years has Mayfield been operating and they still do not have working heat lamps for outside seating? The one by our table was not operational the one behind was at a low heat level. To make matters worse the hostess instructed the bus staff to move the lamp to another table without asking. I asked why, she giggled. She came out again to make sure it was moved, i told her we were ending our meal due to the lack of heat and were not finishing our drinks or ordering desert. she giggled again as she contunued to make the other table comfortable and ours uncomfortable. Once a regular customer, I will now think twice before returning.

This is a review for breakfast.  I have had dinner here and it was fantastic.  However, that said, I just had breakfast with 3 of my friends and it was by far the very worst service and meal I have ever had, and this is saying a lot given the places I've eaten.  Every piece of food that came out, after a good 30 min wait, was cold, raw, or inedible, we had to send everything back.  I had 2 scrambled eggs, toast, and coffee and it was $15.  Not that this was unexpected, quite the opposite, I knew this place was pricey.  But, I also knew this place to be good.  A quick tip, hire similar staff as you do for dinner and perhaps you can redeem yourself.  Also, when a table sends their entire meal back because it's cold or raw, have a manager come by and see what can be done.  This place is taking advantage of a good name and a good location, it's a shame, we all deserve better.

Met some girlfriends for brunch here and thought the food was just okay for the price they charge.  I like how they give you madeleines for the table to start us off which is a nice treat.  I had the brioche french toast with poached pears which was tasty enough with just the cinammon and pears that I forgot there was syrup on the table but the price point of $14 in my opinion was a bit high for French Toast that wasn't all that memorable.   A big plus is they do take reservations which many brunch places don't.

As I said before, I was working my way through the pastry case (and bread baskets) and I can honestly say there is nothing bad here. Along with the brown sugar biscuits, sourdough, pain de mie, and French loaf, I've had: almond croissant, salted caramel chocolate tart, pumpkin bread pudding, levain, and gilroy sourdough. All good - especially the sweets and soft breads. Really, amazing. Plus a few notes on things I might not have mentioned before. The tea is perfect. Hot comes with a huge pouch of tea leaves - you could probably easily brew a second cup with it if you wanted. And the iced tea actually doesn't come iced - which is great because it doesn't get watered down! Complementary water. Staff is always nice as pie and very helpful.

I'm a real snob when it comes to a baguette!  Mayfield Bakery has the BEST sourdough baguette ever!! I love my carbs and bread (yes I am very skinny)! This place really out does themselves, I drive all the way to Palo Alto for bread so that is really saying something. I also LOVE their deserts, they are delicious. I like the Meyer Lemon Tart and anything chocolate! I tell everyone that they need to come here and check it out, so I am telling you the same thing! Mayfield Bakery is the BEST in the Peninsula! All of their bread is amazing! Check it out!

To clarify - I've never gone to the restaurant half of this establishment, only to the little bakery. The bakery is great; traditional style European bread and pastries apparently without bullshit ingredients.  Except for a piece of frosted chocolate cake which was too sweet and kind of uniform in texture, all the pastries I've tried are civilized, intended for adults. I'm writing this review because of the vegetarian sandwich with beets.  It is an $8 sandwich which is worth every penny.  I don't even like beets, generally - but theirs are pale pink, translucent like sashimi, mild and fresh - not the syrupy nightmare canned beets which seem as if they should be used for dying fabric.  These unprecedented edible beets are set on just the right amount of cooked greens, which are not at all soggy, and attended by a really rich goat cheese.  The effect, when toasted, is a serious culinary experience far above sandwich level.  I couldn't pin down the elusive spice or oil that gave it such a unique savor reminiscent of an autumn-colored medieval tapestry.  A fully orchestrated sandwich that lacks for nothing. Or, if you want to impress a frivolous girl, bring her here for a latte served in a bowl. Very lean people who obviously care for their health come here for pastries - not because it's diet food, but because it's a treat worth eating - or that's my surmise at any rate.   If you're shy you may feel that you can get a bit too much customer service here, but don't let it scare you off.

I went to Mayfield for a reunion with an old friend. We started at the bar, where we consumed a bottle of wine. In no rush to sit at the table, happy to sit and drink, we were nonetheless approached about five times by different staff (waiter, manager, maitre'd etc) to ask us to sit at our table. If there were a line of people waiting for tables, i might understand, but the place was half empty. By the fifth time they asked, we relented and sat at the table. our waitress was brisk. not merely in the sense of the time it took to bring food to the table (generally a plus), but the entire rhythm of the meal. rushing through every step, she did her best to move our meal along as quickly as possible. again, if there were a line of people waiting for tables, i might understand, but the place was half empty. the food was disappointing as well. a beef short rib tasted strange. pasta was left half un-eaten. and the place managed to screw up an espresso. twice. in short, this place looks like it should be great but the reality falls short. maybe the staff gets paid a little extra if they close down the restaurant a half hour early because that seems to be the only explanation for why they would be in such a hurry. and the food was lacking in key respects. i know the staff eats their own cooking, because i walked past a table of waitstaff munching on various entrees, but they all seem extremely young and inexperienced so i can only assume they don't know what good food should taste like. +1 star for the good memory of eating with my friend but otherwise forgettable.

Brunch in Palo Alto on a late Sunday morning? I always see Mayfield in the Town & Country Village, but never stopped until recently. Good thing we made reservations, because the place was PACKED - with a capital "P." I ordered the hot chocolate (which I found out was made with my fav Guittard chocolate). To my surprise, instead of arriving in a traditional cup, it was presented in a bowl...with a spoon!! Different? For sure. Interesting to drink, too. I have to say that I wish it was warmer...it cooled off quite quickly due to the large size of the bowl, I believe. Also, the chocolate flavor was not very pronounced. For my main course, I ordered a dish labeled as: Broccoli di Ciccio and Pine Nut Flatbread, Black Olive, Baked Egg. Normally I ask how things are presented, but I assumed (very incorrectly) that this was a simple baked egg dish presented on some flatbread with pine nuts and black olives incorporated. However, this was no baked egg dish! This was a breakfast pizza for two people -- topped with broccoli, cheese...and a baked egg. Confusing, and also not what I wanted to eat for brunch. Anyway, it was decent and I ate part of it and took the remainder home as leftovers. Overall, Mayfield is a casual brunch place. Keep in mind that nearly every table will be full during peak brunch hours with all sorts of people, so the place gets LOUD.

Overall I love this place.  I stop by often on the to-go bakery side and get Mochas (to die for) and breads which are always great, but I had not eaten at the cafe until last weekend.  The breakfast was fabulous.  I ordered the Camino.  Eggs were perfectly cooked, bacon was thick and crunchy and delicious and the cottage fries were great - little sticks of hashbrowns that are deep fried.  Yumm...I'm Southern - we like our fried stuff. :)  We are looking forward to coming for dinner soon...

2 stars for brunch, because who charges $14 for eggs and bacon and toast???? No comment about accidentally showing up in a plaid flannel top and jeans when that is the waitstaff's uniform. Eesh. 2 stars for the length of time it takes to get a single cup of coffee, and the fact that it is served in a to go cup regardless of where you drink it, even if everyone else at your cafe table gets a fancy ceramic bowl for their lattes. 5 stars for the bread, of course, which is why they get 3 stars-- and they give it away at the end of the night, so if you happen to be eating at the restaurant late...

Cafe We dined here for brunch one day and the food is quite fresh but it could be worked on a bit. A bit pricey for breakfast foods but what do you expect for Palo Alto. The one thing I remember was the smoked salmon brunch pizza with egg was good but texture of the crust could be worked on a bit. Bakery 5 stars for the cookies, croissants and coffee at Mayfield Bakery! Cakes and other items were a bit on the sweet side.

Want organically sourced food? Head to Mayfield! But, head to Mayfield with some extra dough, cuz this place ain't that cheap. My friend and I brunched here a few days ago. For $14 at Mayfield, you can get your standard breakfast fare of eggs, potatoes, toast and your choice of ham or bacon. My friend got some pretty tasty looking soft scrambled eggs with "foraged" mushrooms (I guess this means they were mushrooms foraged out in the wilderness of the Bay Area)? All of the brunch items were priced at above $10 from what I saw (including oatmeal). In total, the two of us spent probably around $40 to get coffees and two brunch entrees. I'm pretty cheap, so this is considered an "expensive" brunch to me. There's not much to dislike about Mayfield, but not much to like. The food was good, but I'm not sure if it was worth the extra $$. If you're a fan of minimizing your carbon footprint, eating locally, and eating organically, this place is probably totes worth it for you. But for me, it just seemed okay. Also, I spent the entire brunch in a confused state because my friend and I got a tray of madeleines with our brunch. Now, the madeleines were delicious. But the confusing part is that all the other tables around us didn't get madeleines-- they got bread! Some yelp-searching seems to reveal that the restaurant sometimes gives you complimentary madeleines, and sometimes they give you complimentary bread. Confusingly delicious.

4 stars for food alone, but with price factored in 3 at best.  (I put spendy because for breakfast, it was pretty spendy) took the kids there for breakfast, so this is only a review of breakfast food.  There was a bit of a wait and open tables around, and we were told there was a 10-15 minute wait.  We were seated prompted, and ahead of the promised time, so that was fine.  Booths are cushy and comfy! The kids french toast is JUST french toast and only 2 pieces.  Granted, it's really thick, like at least 2 pieces of normal bread and possibly three, so quantity-wise, it was fine.  Kids loved it (and I did too).  $5 for a tiny side plate of scrambled eggs that they happily ate, but both asked for more.  Sorry kids.  Side of potatoes were sticks of hash browns and extremely tasty.   I had the french omelet, with fontina cheese and greens.  Turned out to be Kale and Rhubarb, and was really good.  However, it was tiny.  Might have been 2 eggs, but they were not jumbo eggs, so it was pretty small, especially for $14.   And, no sides with it at all.  The side of ham was $6.50 and again, extremely tasty ham but not much for the $$.  It was smoky and sweet, but pretty thin and a single slice.   $3.75 for drip coffee.  Albeit, very good strong drip coffee, but still expensive for what it was.   And, this was minor, but there was a manager or lead cook screaming obscenities at the short order cooks behind the counter.  Was a little distracting. I enjoyed my meal, but did not enjoy the price.  I would come back, but only if I felt like splurging, $50 for breakfast for 1 adult and 2 toddlers is a little bit steep.

from the outside, mayfield cafe looked like a casual but inviting place. i wanted to like it...and hoped that it was promising. just because a google chef opened it doesn't make me want to dine there any more or less. but some people are really into namedropping.. we dined there for dinner. they have many wines to choose from if you would like a glass. the first thing i noticed was how ugly the staff was dressed. the hostess who seated us looked like she was not dressed for work but ready to watch movies on her living room couch. then i realized that their dress code was plaid. but i think you can look better in plaid than that. one look at the menu and i would have walked out if it were just me since it was very pricey given the menu choices. but okay, let's give it a chance... our blonde waitress was a bit snappy/rude with us in the beginning. she asked if we wanted anything to drink. we said that water was fine. she then asked us two more times if we wanted anything to drink in an annoyed manner. we already told her. my mom said that the older guy waiter was very good and attentive last time she dined there with her friends.  she didn't what was wrong with our waitress either with the attitude. complimentary sourdough bread - i actually enjoyed this more than the rest of the meal. lol.. tomato, pancetta, mozarella pizza - it was okay. i was fairly disappointed. at $17, i was expecting more. i did not think that it was even worth $10. mayfield burger - ordered this medium. it came out VERY pink. when i asked the waitress about it. her reply was that i ordered a medium. that is how their medium burger is. i didn't take a pic but if i surveyed a bunch of people, that burger was definitely medium rare. it was just okay in taste also. (price-wise it was more expensive than a burger at father's office...and definitely not as good) pumpkin soup - the soup, however, had great flavor. the bowl is quite big. if you order it, you can have it split for free. we asked for our leftovers to be boxed. the guy who took our plates forgot because it took quite a while. i had to flag him down to remind him. reading the 5 star reviews makes me laugh... maybe people in palo alto expect to pay a lot (for dinner, if you order main entrees, it is easily $$$ which is $30+ pp) for mediocre food. people are fine with it. in fact, they rave about how it's wonderful and organic. this restaurant was quite busy. personally, i will not be back but i would like to buy baked goods next door.

3.5 Stars with the potential of going to 4 stars :) My foodieness and adventurous nature brought me to enjoying a quiet breakfast at Mayfield Bakery and Cafe. The breakfast menu is small but there were a couple of simple but interesting items. I opted for the Soft Scambled Eggs with spinach and sauteed mushroom and what they called "parmesan broth." I also ordered a side of the cottage potatoes that came with creme fraiche sprinkled with chives and a cup of machiato. The eggs: I like soft eggs for breakfast and I enjoyed the lightly salted eggs with spinach, yumm. I still didn't get the "parmesan broth," it was more like regular "egg broth" to me. I asked for a spoon so that I could devour the soup/broth in my bowl, pretty hearty and light. The only complaint is that the mushroom was dead, meaning that they sauteed them too long (not sure if it was intentional) that they were dried out and I could taste the unpleasant burnt ruining the flavor of the delicious "king trumpet" mushroom. King trumpet mushroom tasted a lot like king oyster mushrooms. The portion was perfect, not ridiculously small or large. The cottage potatoes a.k.a. "hashbrown": They were very very lightly salted, nothing special and I did not really get why they served them with cream fraiche...potatoes itself was already heavy, I don't really need the extra calories :). Machiato: It was strong, bitter and tiny (very cute)! They also served complimentary madelines in the beginning of my meal. the cookies were very dry though but the sweetness was really good to go with the bitter machiato. I meant, I drink black coffee but this morning, it was just a tad too bitter/strong for me. total bill: $22.46 not including tip. Pricey breakfast eh?! The restaurant/ambience was very sleek and elegant. I saw some professionals having breakfast there, some elderly couples and a few families. The prices are "Palo Alto Pricing," not cheap. I would like to go back to try their dinner items, the food photos on yelp looked very very inviting :).

This is a lovely brunch place in the Town & Country Village strip mall. Maybe quite a bit higher class comparing to a typical diner, but it's definitely have got quite a few good things to offer. To start, they use a lot of natural and local ingredients. That's always a good thing in my books. And then I ordered the pancake. WHOA, the pancake was literally the size of a pan you'd use at home, completely with a dab of nut butter on top. It was light, fluffy and had a hint of citrus, and was one of the best pancakes I've had in a restaurant. However, due to the gigantic size, I could only have a quarter of it before I call defeat. Blame the bread they served before the meal. In short, this place has some memorable food you'd be talking about for a while. Just make sure you don't mind paying the price.

Having been to Mayfield for a nice breakfast several months ago, we wanted to give their dinner menu a try as it had looked very enticing. Armed with empty stomachs we were prepared to eat a lot. And we sure did eat a lot. Ricotta Gnocchi, Stewed Red Peppers, Marcona Almonds, Smithfield Ham (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - the gnocchi had zero potato or flour in them and were simply made from ricotta, yet they still tasted like the Italian dumpling staple. The red peppers added acidity, the ham gave the dish a wonderful smokey meat flavor note, and the almonds rounded out the texture. Burrata and Heirloom Tomato Salad, Basil, Aged Balsamic (pictured as split portion with the gnocchi) - Always having been a fan of caprese, the super soft burrata and the juicy heirlooms took this dish to the next level. A nice light summer appetizer. Pan Seared Sea Scallops, Padron Peppers, Sauce Vierge (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - Crispy on the outside and almost rare on the inside, these scallops were cooked to perfection. The padron peppers had quite a kick to them and paired very well with the staple French seafood sauce. Crispy Pork Belly, Apple and Radish Salad, Dolce Forte Sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - Pork belly may be my favorite part of the pig, especially how Mayfield pairs it with sweet apples and bitter radishes.   Pine Nut Couscous, Ratatouille, Currants, Chickpeas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - Generally I don't order vegetarian entrees, but this sounded intriguing and it was simply phenomenal. The acidic ratatouille sauce played really well with the sweet currants and there was a great crunch from the pine nuts and the chick peas. Duck Leg Confit, Farotto, Roasted Figs, Mustard Duck Jus (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - By far my favorite dish of the night! The duck skin was crunchy, the meat was juicy and the farotto and figs rendered amazing flavors to the dish. Radishes and radicchio added a bitter note, making this dish pure perfection. Braised Short Rib, Charred Sweet Onions, Grilled Peaches, Horseradish (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - although full at this point, I scraped my plate clean. The rib was super tender and succulent. For my taste the peaches were a little overwhelming in sweetness, so I made sure to cut the fruit into very small chunks for each bite. Triple Chocolate Fudge Cake & Tahitian Vanilla Bean Gelato (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - We asked for the ice cream scoop to be dumped into an espresso, an Italian classic that I love. The cake was decadent, rich, and moist. Too bad I only had room for a couple of fork fulls. The service was very attentive, the manager stopped by a couple of times for small talk and the wine pairings they served with our dishes were great. They even gave us a gigantic freshly baked loaf of bread to take home free of charge. That made for some great sandwiches and grilled cheeses in the following days!

I have had several very good meals at Mayfield in the past, but after the way I was treated last night I will categorically never return to the restaurant.  Something is horribly, horribly broken here. My party of four showed up at 8PM on a Friday night for dinner, asked the hostess how long the wait was, and were told about half an hour.  At the half hour mark, we checked in, and were told there was just one more party in front of us.  A half hour after THAT, we still had not been seated.  If we'd known that it would take more than an hour to get a table, we would have gone somewhere else!  The hostess was very apologetic, and offered to buy us drinks. When we were finally seated (at the worst table in the restaurant, right by the door, cold air blowing constantly), dinner was okay (the pizza was gross, the chicken came with a sauce that was not as described in the menu, and my espresso was rancid), although there was rather a lot of forced, overly-chipper conversation from the server who presumably thought that we would benefit from special attention.   When the bill came (just a little over $200), however, we were charged for the drinks that the hostess had offered to buy us...and the $9 dessert that we all shared had instead been comped.  They even charged us for the two cups of coffee we had consumed with dessert! I don't really care about the money, but I don't appreciate being lied to, or condescended to.  I thought this restaurant had a lot of promise when it first opened, but both the food and the service have gone steadily downhill.

Wow!  Went for lunch and had an outstanding visit.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I had the mint tea, which was very flavorful and served with a teeny spoon and in a pot that did not leak.  The bread and butter were well above average.  Nice freshly made bread that smelled divine and softened butter, served with a real butter knife.  I had the smoked chicken soup, which might be the best soup I have ever tasted.  Rich broth with chicken and tons of different kinds of vegetables in the right size and lots of barley.  I also ordered the salad with roasted beets and feta.  It had very interesting lettuce types and a perfect balsamic dressing.  The pomegranate seeds went well with the fried feta.  Will definitely be back.  I also liked that they print the names of the local farms where they buy their ingredients.

Had lunch here on Saturday.  It was busy and the service was poor, not bad but not good.  The bread was good.  I had the burger and have to say I was not very happy with it.  $14.00 burger?  I was expecting something much better.  It also came with 3 onion rings that had too much breading on it.  My better half had the chicken sandwich not bad.  I have had better.  I wouldn't go there again by choice.

Overall, this place is just okay. But to qualify, I've only been here for brunch. Originally, I was so excited to check this place out because I'm tired of St. Michael's Alley. I think that's also just okay, especially because of the wait, but, thanks to Mayfield, it's definitely gone up in my book. The biggest plus to this place is the nice outdoor seating (some bugs present, but hey, it's outside) and the single adept waiter (who looks like a poor man's Jeremy Renner). Trust me, I really wanted to like it more, thanks to the outdoor seating, but alas, it just wasn't to be. So here's a rundown: - Brioche French Toast: The poached strawberries in syrup were the best part, but they didn't pack enough flavor to make the dish. The french toast itself was a bit bland, and it could've been rich eggy goodness. It was just okay. - Country-style Cured Beef Hash: My first dish at Mayfield was a bit unimpressive. It was served lukewarm (at best) and some of the beef pieces were so hard that I couldn't bite through them. They were left on the place. The poached eggs didn't seem like they were drained well, so the polenta sauce ended up becoming this oddly watery mess. If the flavors were there, it would've been better, but it ended up being this bland soggy soup underneath really salty beef bits. - Soft Scrambled Eggs, Foraged Mushrooms, Savoy Spinach, Parmesan Broth: Probably the best dish I've had, but I thought my eggs were too hard, and the whole dish was a bit wet. The wetness was amplified by the fact that the spinach was still relatively raw and crunchy, so it seemed like the textures were really at odds with each other. Really wet compared to really crunchy, not-really-cooked spinach. Don't get me wrong, the components were fine, but the dish wasn't prepared to express any cohesion. - The Camino Breakfast: Everything was fine. Everything needed seasoning (both salt and pepper). I think the cottage potatoes are fun, and I like the creme fraiche with it. - Giant Buttermilk Hotcake: It's pretty good, and pretty starchy (obviously). It's served with cinnamon-sugar butter, so that's a nice touch. I think it's better to share this with several people at a table, as opposed to just one person getting it (unless you really, really like your starchy breakfast foods). - Mayfield fries: These are the hands-down best thing you can get here. They're served with housemade ketchup and this delicious aioli. Good amount of spice, too. Coffee's pretty good. Beverages can be fun. I still really want to like this place, so I think I'll try for an alfresco dinner. But then, that's it.

Went in for a late lunch. After waiting for 25 minutes, they gave us a booth. When I told them I would need a high chair for my girl, they still tried to put me in the booth even though it wouldn't fit a high chair. After a while, they finally put us in a corner booth while putting a high chair in the pathway. Wait staffs keep hitting her high chair while carrying things. Not a single apology from any of them. When I paid the bill, there was not even a thank you from the waitress. Food is okay but their attitude was unacceptable. Perhaps their business is so good that they reached a level that they don't feel they need to actually care about the customers. In general, not recommended for a family with small kids.

I had a really nice dinner there last night. When you walk in, you are hit with the smell of fresh bread - it's really a great way to start a meal. We sat in a booth which was comfortable, and the service was very friendly. The wine list is pretty good, and the sommelier was helpful. The food was great, too. I had lettuces with herbs, which were a bit too oily and not herb-y enough for me, but it was a good dish. For dinner, I had salmon with a warm frisee and pecans. This, too, was a little too oily, but I managed. Dessert was great - but, then again, I LOVE dessert. It was apple pie - yum. When we were done, the waiter offered to send you home with a bag of bread. I don't know if that's normal for this place, but it seems like a great idea!

I was looking for a casually classy choice for dinner with the fam in Palo Alto, and Mayfield fit my specifications quite nicely! Lots of other reviews down here seem to be for brunch or lunch, but I found it to be a wonderful vibe at dinner. The lighting was low a, and there was lots of charming outdoor seating as well. As for the food, I found it quite tasty but just a bit pricier than I would expect for the fanciness level. I had the summer squash pizza ($17), which was HUGE and featured a delicious crust as well as a nice, spicy kick thanks to the peppers on there. Another favorite was the burrata appetizer. The tomatoes were so fresh and sweet and the burrata so delish that we ordered a second one right away. I also tried a bite of the 'meatball madness' special they had going on, which was $24 for three large-ish meatballs, some angel hair pasta, and a small side Caesar which wasn't really too much to write home about. My mom and husband both ordered the halibut, which they both enjoyed but when I tasted it I felt it was way too dry. The veggies on the side tasted fresh and lovely, though. The service was friendly and attentive - our waters were constantly being refilled by the nice folks wearing plaid shirts. I have to say, I think it's a funny choice for server attire, but it was unique! A nice touch came at the end of the meal when they sent the four of us home with two enormous baguettes from their bakery. My parents are huge bread lovers so it definitely ended the meal on a good note. Again, I'm torn because I did have a wonderful experience and really could taste the quality in their ingredients, but I do think the price points are a bit high for what you get overall. A good once-in-a-while meal but would probably get too pricey to make this my go-to dinner joint.

Was treated here for lunch.  I had the chef's special which came with soup, main and dessert for $18.  The soup was was amazing, never mind me not knowing what it was (green and some kind of root) and for the life of me can't remember.  But let me tell you, it was an awesome surprise! For the main was a beef and bean ragu with gnocchi.  Not your typical potato, tasted more like polenta. Didn't' feel it was a great compliment to the soup. Also it lack flavor.  The dessert was a big chocolate cookie.  I have had better homemade ones.  The surprise of the meal was the table bread.  NOW, that was some light and airy yummy goodness with an ever so slightly crunch to the crust.  I hear that brunch is better and the bakery seemed to have some yummy treats.

Came here for sunday brunch. The food was delish. Started off with the apply fritters, tasted like a light donut with apply bits in it, very heavenly. I got the beef hash, eggs were cooked perfectly, beef was very flavorful. Husband got the chicken sandwich, sounds plain but it was even better then my beef hash. It was so creamy with melted brie and the bread was toasted. Yum. Reason why they didn't get a 5 star? Host Customer Service! I have made a reservation using open table when I arrived I requested for an outdoor table. They said it would around 10mins before I would be seated and offered to call my cell phone. Sounded like a great service. I went for a stroll with the family and was gone for around 20 mins went back to check on the table only to see 5 open tables but no phone call (???) so what's the point of offering a service if you don't use it.  :(

Man. I really wanted to give this place a higher rating, but I can really only give it 3.5 stars at best. Food: 3.5 I ordered The Camino Breakfast: Two Eggs, Cottage Potatoes, Toast, Country Ham or Applewood Smoked Bacon. The cottage potatoes are outstanding! I don't know what else is in them, but they're toasty, not overly oily and they have good flavor. The rest of it was just okay. Bacon: They gave me 2+ slices of bacon. One slice was cooked perfectly, just crisped, but still meaty. The second slice was burnt to a crisp! They layered the pretty piece on top of the burnt piece to hide it! I knew this is true, because the girl next to me happened to order the exact same thing and her two slices came out perfectly. Poached eggs: I ordered my eggs poached. Again, one egg was perfectly poached with a nice, runny yolk. The second poached egg was overcooked with a pretty solid yolk. Perhaps the first egg cooked as it sat longer and the heat from the second egg further cooked the first... but they should be able to plan for this!  There was no flavor to my poached eggs. I salted them. Honey Wheat Toast: They gave me 3 triangles of toast (1 1/2 slices of bread) and they were hard as crostinis! I was really surprised! They were so crispy and didn't give when I bit into it (e.g. the feeling where you bite into a nice piece of toast that has a little bit of softness in the center.). This piece was toasted all the way through and SUPER hard. The strawberry jam seems homemade and it was pretty yummy, though! All in all $17 for one person including tax and tip for the one item. Pretty pricey. If the quality of food was more consistent, it'd definitely be worth it! Service: 3 Ambiance: 4

Sigh this place is sometimes so good and sometimes so bad. I love the open air feeling and the lighting of this place, that they bring you homemade bread (even if it's a little too hard), and that they have a super expensive triple filtration system for the water. My dad loves the burgers here and I really like the onion rings. We used to come for brunch but Tootsie's is just too good to pass up. I haven't seen the smoky chicken soup in way too long, why? :( I seriously used to drive from Cupertino (40 minutes roundtrip) just for that! Dinner is probably the best meal to come for and the fish dishes are all lovely. Come once for dinner and decide for yourself. :)

Had food from both the bakery and cafe and all of it was great! I went to the cafe for lunch and ordered the pumpkin soup which was creamy but not too rich, perfect for a chilly day. The others in my group ordered the gnocchi and veggie sandwich, which they enjoyed. We picked up a lot of treats from the bakery the next day. The cinnamon roll was ok, it had a sour cream taste so it is definitely a hit or miss option. The scones and blueberry muffin were pretty good. But the must get item is the chocolate chip cookies, don't walk out of there without one!!! They are deliciously chewy, chocolaty, and moist, although very rich, you might need some help finishing it. But I'm sure no one you're with will object to that!

Mayfield Bakery & Cafe is a great establishment for brunch! Take advantage of OpenTable when you want to dine here, ESPECIALLY on the weekends. My family and I blazed right on in despite the 30 minute wait because I made reservations beforehand. Who doesn't like complimentary madeleines? They weren't too sweet and tasted like they had a hint of orange - soo good. I had a difficult time deciding between the pulled chicken sandwich and the burger. Per the recommendation of our server, she suggested the burger - boy, was she right! It was delicious. I ordered it rare and the meat was a nice red, which I find hard to find for most restaurants. The meat was super tender and somewhat reminded me of Umami burger. Even though there were only three onion rings, they were huge! The batter smelled and tasted a bit like doughnuts.. which isn't a bad thing. I got to try the pulled chicken sandwich from my sister and I'm so glad I ordered the burger instead. I wasn't really a fan of the aioli sauce they used, but the baguette was good. Our parents ordered the corned beef hash which was served over a bed of what seemed like couscous. I'd opt for the french toast instead. --------------------------------------------------­------------------------------------- Right after brunch,  I really wanted to try the bakery goods - HOLY CRAP. The warm bread pudding is really sweet but may be one of the best ones I've had since Tartine. The peanut butter cookie was also super moist even after 3 days (trying not to get diabetes...).

I have eaten here three times and the food was consistently out of this....galaxy The salmon is exquisite, as is the chicken and the veggie sandwich.

I'm editting this to clarify that I'm speaking of the Bakery, and not the cafe. They are located adjacent to each other, and I wish Yelp allowed separate reviews of the two spaces, as they really are distinct. My husband I and I love the bakery, but have never found the cafe to be to our liking. The staff in the bakery are always super-friendly, and have begun to anticipate our orders the minute we enter. The lattes are lovely, and I never miss the extra shot I add at other cafes. They are especially satisfying slowly sipped out of the large white latte bowls, in fact I won't order a latte there unless I have time to sit and savor it; a paper cup just wouldn't be right. The whole-wheat walnut levain and cranberry "demi" loaves are marvelous, with thick, satisfyingly chewy crusts, and small enough to be breakfast. Their bigger siblings are equally marvelous. I can't praise the sourdough epi enough; fresh and warm with butter, it's practically a reason to live all on it's own! I really wish there was more seating space inside. The three or four teensy little tables that will fit inside the narrow bakery store front just aren't enough on a really cold morning. Spring through fall the outside tables are quite pleasant, and a great place to watch the local dogs and their owners, eaves-drop on nascent Silicon Valley start-ups, or catch a snatch of music as Harmonica Man zips past. Perhaps if they put up those heavy vinyl air-blocking curtains outside, you could sit there comfortably on a winter morning too. My other quibble is with the pastries which are overly-sugary. The scones bear a heavy coat of large sugar-crystals; the brown-sugar biscuits are very nearly too sweet to comfortably bear the name "biscuit" in any American sense of the word; and the sticky buns all too often live up to their name in a way that makes me fear for my teeth. Having said all that, it's still the best Bakery in Town & Country Center.

The service here is really impeccable. I've been here twice and our servers have been excellent both times. It's really rare around here to find consistently fabulous service, so I really think Mayfield deserves a shout-out for this! The food is great, though the menu is limited and quite pricey. I really like their Mayfield blend coffee and their french omelet with harvest greens and fontina cheese. Love the decor -- super airy and lots of natural light (during lunchtime during the summer). If you'd like to sit outside, be sure to make a reservation. It's really beautiful!

Lovely restaurant for a "business" lunch - why do I qualify my lunch review?  because no one should go to this restaurant unless you are on an expense account. This place is pretty pricey and the predominantly VC/Palo Alto money crowd doesn't mind spending $10 for a bowl of soup (tho, the corn chowder was delicious), $16 for a small personal pizza, and $7 for a hot tea. Sitting outdoors in Palo Alto in the Summer for lunch is one of the great pleasures of life and Mayfield makes the experience lovely - so much so that you almost forget about the $13 asparagus salad. But I will come again, because the service was good (tho maitre d' seemed a bit disorganized) and the food was fresh and tasty and I will make sure to bring an expense account (either mine or someone elses)

4.5 Stars!  This place has a few areas which could be improved. But overall, it's one of my favorite's in S Valley.  The pastries in the cafe' are the best in this region.  The coffee is quite good although could use balance sometimes. The restaurant can get very crowded on the weekends or really anytime I have been.  The food is creative and delicious and service friendly, although it can be VERY slow.  Once I did have an undercooked brunch and had to send it back and wait almost 30 minutes more.  So coordination with the kitchen for re-orders could be improved.  Overall though a lovely dining experience with delectable entrees.  Wine list is reasonably good.

I'm giving Mayfield a solid 3-star rating (a 3.5 if I could). My wfe and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile but always seem to end up at Calafia cafe'  next door.  Either way, we made it a point to check it out today for brunch. Cute, sort of country ranch/farmhouse feel to it.  It has a pretty counter/bar area for those who don't mind sitting and eating on a stool.  They also have a pretty extensive outdoor seating area which is always nice. On to the food... I had the Rotisserie Chicken Breast Salad wih butter lettuce, feta, almond romesco and meyer lemon vinaigrette ($15).  I liked it.  Chicken was fresh, lettuce was crisp and the meyer lemon vinagrette was snappy.  To be honest, the salad was more along the lines of something you would get for about $12. My wife had the Pulled Chicken Sandwich w/brie and  applewood smoked bacon for $12.  She enjoyed it.  What's cool is that they scoop out the baguette bread and fit the pulled chicken in it, forming a sort of cozy pocket for all the ingredients.  The dish didn't come with fries so we ordered the Mayfield fries ($6) which were delish...they were fresh out the fryer and seasoned with what looked to be cumin or chili power and a either parmesean or romano cheese. Also a bonus was the fresh loaf of sour dough bread they give you with your food. I thought the host and wait staff were very friendly and antentive.  Perhaps they've made some improvements in that area due to all the poor reviews. I definitely wouldn't mind coming back and trying them again.   Good stuff.

Very cute place for brunch and great place to catch up with friends. The fries are definitely a hit here. I would come back just for that. The rest of the dishes were good, but nothing spectacular. Service was attentive. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but if looking for a decent brunch spot in the area, this should be considered. If you go, get the fries!

This place came recommended by my partner's co-worker who claims to be quite the "foodie." It's not bad but far too expensive for what they give you and the place is way too noisy. We were there at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday and they only served the brunch menu so the majority of vegetarian items were egg dishes which I didn't want. I ordered the oatmeal with fresh fruit (the waiter told me it was apricots, bananas, and berries). My partner ordered a flatbread dish which really was a thin pizza with lettuce greens. They were out of the beer she wanted. The oatmeal came without apricots and maybe a total of 3 cut up strawberries and a half of a banana plus there were huge clumps of congealed oatmeal. All this for $10! The pizza, as I was told, was bland...ka-ching...at $14. My green tea was $6.75. That pretty much blew me away. With beverages and tip it was over $50 and, of course, I was still hungry. It's apparently a see-and-be-seen kind of place in Palo Alto which I can be unseen from for the rest of my existence.

This place is my equivalent of my fav LA bakery, La Brea Bakery in the South Bay.  Their turkey and roast beef sandwiches are delicious.  Hard, crispy, rustic but penetrable bread with melted cheese and richly-seasoned meat.  Quality bread (though I like Acme more), tarts, pie, pastries, good coffee, and decadent hot chocolate with enormous iceberg like marshmellows.  A nice place for a quick breakfast before hitting the road.   As for dinner, I stopped in late one night on the way back from the airport.  I actually got turned away at Calafia next door a few minutes after their kitchen supposedly closed, even though there were still a lot of people there.  I haven't set foot in Calafia since.  Anyways, I had a nice penne bolognese with very friendly service.

I've been to Mayfield both for lunch and dinner.  Both times i walked away feeling underwhelmed.   First, the prices are high for what you get.  With the abundance of competition in Palo Alto, including a fabulous restaurant right NEXT door, it's hard to understand why Mayfield does not offer more competitive pricing. Secondly, the food is just not very tasty.  I recall the pancetta pizza in particular -- it tasted really bad. Third, service is lacking -- waiter did not check up on us and we had to flag down someone to clear our plates and bring us dessert menus.  After dessert menus were given to us, no one came back to take our order for another 20 minutes.  At that point we really just wanted to leave. Lastly, towards the end of the night they offer complimentary bread to their patrons -- not sure if this is the way they go about getting rid of their breads.  I thought this was a very nice surprise, but found the bread to be SUPER HARD right when I got home.  I mean, seriously, no oven or microwave could have made this bread any softer. All in all, Mayfield was a disappointment both times.  I would not recommend this restaurant at all.

First, what's good: My girlfriend loves their brioche-based French toast. Every Sunday we come here, I sit in quiet amazement that it's so good that she eats it without syrup. I also like a Bloody Mary for breakfast; this place has good ones, but quite spendy (see below). And that's about it. There's something about a restaurant whose acme of ambition in life is to be just the most bourgie place in the Town & Country mall. Even if they succeed, they consistently manage to irritate me to the point that I can't enjoy a breakfast there. Here's what's wrong: - The interior is loud. Really, really loud, and despite the open air feel of the tables under glass, it's just not a pleasant place to eat. - The waiters are seemingly instructed to dress as aspiring hipsters. Along with this, service the last three times I've been here has been aggressively horrible. We've been kept waiting fifteen minutes after seating, been sneered at by the staff (over very reasonable requests), and left nearly late for an appointment as we were told a box was en route. - The food is decent, but not worth the price. If you've never had a good fancy breakfast, it feels like a sort of sad set of training wheels for it. Some low points for me: * The bacon. Way too thick, so it ends up being too soft and squishy, when I like it crispy and tasty. * The omelets: I understand the desire for the perfect moral purity of a vegetable and cheese only omelet. But would it kill you to offer an option with stuff kicked up a notch? * The burgers: Decent meat, but they have never properly cooked the patty to my specification. I understand that a cautious establishment might interpret 'medium rare' to be 'medium' for burgers, but it's not ok to bring it to me well done when I ask this way. - The overall atmosphere: There's just something about it. It's sort of got all the *Trappings* of something that wants to be better than it is, but just fails. I feel like it's kind of an imitation of a nicer brunch place in SF, where maybe some people went there and got some ideas, coupled with a weird swirl of the worst aspects of Palo Alto gentrification. It hurts the most because I really DO want a nice, upscale breakfast/brunch place, but this just isn't it for me.

I haven't been to Mayfield for quite a while (probably a year) because of my prior bad experience.   My early experiences were pretty good.  Then there was the day of the absolutely awful chicken sandwich which tasted like boiled chicken w/no seasoning.  It was so bad we couldn't finish it.   Rcently a co-worker suggestsed we go.  I wanted soup and they had 2 choices, tomato or pumpkin.  The waiter suggested tasting a bit of each.  It was tasteless and bland.  The pumpkin was watery pumpkin and ZERO seasoning.  No salt, no spices, and less flavor.  Tomato fared no better.  Tasted like a can of tomato paste with added water and heated up.  I am NOT exaggerating.  How could the chef send that out and not taste it?  I overheard a table nearby warning another table not to order the soup as it was bland.  Bland was a MAJOR understatement.  Baby food has more seasoning than Mayfield soups. Ended up ordering a pizza with was passable but pricey for what it was. I think I'll take another hiatus from Mayfield.   Too many other good places for soup and food.

This review is only for the BREAD. We've heard friends absolutely rave about their bread and wanted a loaf for dinner.  We know a bit about bread - many a decent levain has come out of our kitchen.  So we got their large levain ($6 or $7, I think) to have with a simple dinner. It was absolutely phenomenal!  The crust was nice and crispy, with a tangy and soft center.  I decided we should take their bread to parties and claim it was home-made - it certainly looked it. We will certainly stop back in for more bread and try some of their other offerings.  If anything else we try is as good as the levain this place will be 5 stars.

This is an update to my last review and is based purely on the food and not the service. ----------- After my scathing review in regards to their service, management at Mayfield reached out to me.  After going through my underwhelming experience (twice now), they've taken my feedback for corrective actions. We did a make up dinner last weekend.  Because the service was probably skewed given the reason for me being there this time, I can only comment on the food. The corn soup is great.  Pork belly app was excellent.  It wasn't a huge piece, but it's the perfect size for an app.  I wasn't a fan of the watermelon in the salty balsamic sauce, but maybe that's just me. Once again, the prime rib was delicious.  It didn't have a massive chunk of fat like last time but instead had the perfect amount all around.  I noticed they added salt on top of my piece of meat this time, which I believe was only on the outside edges last time.  Salt on meat is wonderful, especially when you get to the center of the prime rib.  Their horseradish sauce was a great compliment. I didn't do much of the au jus since it was a bit on the salty side last time, and with more salt on my meat, was a little unnecessary for me.  I love the baked potato here. The wine we had that were paired were excellent.  It was nice and chilled, unlike some of the other reviews I read here.  Maybe they're taking our feedback to heart :)  White with pork belly, red with prime rib. As for dessert, their vanilla ice cream is amazing.  It tastes like when we make it ourselves at home, so you know a lot of effort was put into it. The bread pudding was just ok for me, which is surprising because they're also a bakery.  It could be personal preference, but I like my bread pudding sweeter and more soft, not overbaked.  I would like to suggest they try the bread pudding from Lavanda in downtown.  Those guys do it just right for me.  Again, all down to personal preference. I do hope they improve on their service.  Their kitchen is spot on and I'll probably suggest a team dinner here next time my team gets together for an outing.  Then we'll see whether they've really stepped it up or not. Kevin

I expected much better from this upscale cafe. It looks so nice, and is usually quite busy, that I thought the food was probably really good. Mostly, it was really bland. And overpriced. I got pumpkin soup and 'cottage potatoes' - listed as potatoes with creme fraiche and chives. Nowhere did it say they were fried like giant tater tots! The insides were still cold. THey were fried, tasteless potato sticks with a glop of creme fraiche next to them.  For dipping? WHere was the flavor supposed to come from? If an item is deep-fried like that it ought to be listed on the menu as such. The pumpkin soup was nice, but also quite bland. We sat outside because it was a nice day, but a bit chilly. THey had four heaters on the patio, but gave us a table far away from any of them! I didn't realize that till we had sat down. Really, on a 55 degree day, you can't use the tables that don't have heaters. We got colder and colder - I ordered a hot tea to help warm up. It didn't come for at least 15 minutes, after the food had already arrived. THe tea cost 4.50$ but was not very strong. I love good tea and would be ok with paying that much for a pot of strong, tasty black keemun tea. This was loose leaf, and decent tea, but just not strong enough. At least it was hot. I have passed Mayfield bakery and cafe many times while walking around Town and Country, and always wanted to go there. What a disappointment! I feel like I spent way too much money to sit and freeze and have very dull dishes. Just because ingredients are local does not mean they are prepared with a balance of flavors, or any flavor at all.

I made a reservation for brunch for two, but it turned out not necessary yesterday. Plenty of tables at 10:30am.   The server came over with a pitcher of freshed squeezed O.J.  So we said yes. Hubby had the hearty country breakfast and I selected the soft scrambled eggs with asparagus. They emphasize farmer market items so you're eating freshly grown produce. After brunch we went around the corner to the bakery.  Expect a line. Sandwiches and bakery items for sale.  Bought two loaves of their cranberry sourdough bread and a candied ginger scone and a morning bun. We got the last scone. If I had to choose the cafe or the bakery, I'd choose the bakery.  You can grab a sandwich and sit outside alongside the Bakery. Too noisy inside the Cafe for me.  We heard the entire conversation of the couple sitting next to us word for word.

Guys, Looking for a cozy continental restaurant for a casual setting date? this is the restaurant for you!  Plenty of stick to your rib food like ribs and rotisserie chicken in setting that your date will like. Dinner food is better than brunch food. There is a daily dinner special.

5 Stars cannot even come close to how great this restaurant is but because the bakery cannot be reviewed separately I had to deduct a star. We dined here recently on a gorgeous Sunday morning and were able to get a table immediately though they were pretty busy, perfect timing I guess. The service was perfect, we waited for nothing and had no problems receiving whatever we needed. My only complaint is a mild one, I don't like to drink room temperature water even when the carafe is a cute one. I would like to see them find a way to chill the carafe or fill with cold water prior to serving. And the tiny little citrusy cookies they serve were tasty Everything we ordered was divine. The fresh squeezed orange juice was perfectly cold and sweet and delicious. on the recommendation from other yelpers I ordered the pancake and oh my it was heavenly. It is gigantic so I recommend sharing. Crispy outside with a soft almost custard like inside. The taste is remarkable with a strong vanilla citrus flavor topped with a ground pecan honey spread with maple syrup also available. The bacon was hands down the best we have ever had, thick and crispy and full of flavor without the over salted taste of most bacon. The eggs tasted farm fresh and the potato cakes instead of hash browns were the icing on the cake. The bakery next door was nearly opposite of our restaurant experience. It was not too busy yet we were rushed through. We may have bought more had we been given 30 seconds to look. The guy behind the counter loomed right over us to the ladies who came in after us. We chose a few goodies to take home and I asked for a bottled lemonade as written on their chalk menu by the door and available on display behind the cashier with the rest of their bottled and canned drinks. Without even looking she said they didn't have lemonade. The gentleman from earlier saved the day by directing her to a refrigerator directly behind her where they were chilling next to the sodas. The lemon tarts, caramels and peanut butter bites were all delicious, but the service could definitely use some improvements in the bakery only. The restaurant staff was amazing Bottom line....if you want fresh, fantastic food and are willing tonpy for the amazing meal and service you will receive Do Not miss this place. If you want fast and cheap and polyester choose Denny's instead.

Shows the limits of good intentions and good provisions, when nobody knows how to cook. Scallops salted and almost inedible (washed off was passable), Salmon burned, short ribs dessicated, but some did like tomato soup. Sorbet isn't as good as Ciao Bella but edible, the pie was a dry crumble with almost no fruit! A Bakery? Wine guy  was great, wine list an OK Kermit Lynch thing. A disappointing place, to avoid, in spite of their hopes.

With this little cafe just a short bike ride away, it is perfect!  I stopped here quite a few times during my stay in Palo Alto, and it hit the spot! I went to both the bakery and the restaurant.  The bakery is small and intimate.  TONS of freshly baked breads and pastries.  The chocolate croissant was amazing.  They also have quiches, and some sweets.  Along with a full coffee and tea menu, you can't go wrong for a quick breakfast stop.  The restaurant is a little fancy and upscale, but as far as I could tell...what isn't in Palo Alto??? The breakfast/brunch menu was very good and offered some classic breakfast entrees along with some more innovative fare.  I loved how the local farms and ingredients were listed for that days menu.  I opted for the classic breakfast (I wasn't feeling the adventurous vibe that day).  The bacon was the best I had EVER had...seriously.  A trip back is almost warranted for that bacon!  We also tried the Soft egg scramble with asparagus, prosciutto, and Meyer lemon nage.   The menu is pricey and probably a little fancy for every day.  I would like to go back for dinner and see what could be cooked up!

I had high expectations. It looked so promising. A beautiful restaurant with a homey feel, signs that pointed out the locally farmed ingredients. But alas, the food just didn't deliver. I had an asparagus salad and the fish filet entree with peas and beans. The hilight of that meal was the peas. The salad wasn't seasoned quite right. The filet was a bit overcooked. Nothing too horrible, but also not that great either, particularly given its price. Next time I'd like to try the bakery next door instead.

I'm surprised that Mayfield only has 3 stars, I've been here several times and I've been happy with every visit. They always seem to be busy, so I recommend making reservations on OpenTable although they do accommodate walk-ins. Mayfield has a great atmosphere in the evenings, with dim lighting and candles on every table. One Sunday evening when we went, they had a dungeness crab dinner for two, so I believe they have seasonal dinner specials. I've tried the housemade tagliaraini with mushrooms, ricotta, and lemon, which was very good. My friend ordered the braised short ribs and she really enjoyed them. The warm chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream was one of the better ones that I've had! I was impressed. Prices for dinner entrees are ~$20-30, so not cheap but kinda expected for the Palo Alto area. The restaurant isn't fancy, so there are families with children as well as couples and larger parties. I LOVE how at the end of every dinner, they give a complimentary loaf of bread to every person at the table. This is a nice touch and it always makes me happy as I leave the restaurant :D

Went here for brunch on a Saturday. The ambiance is really cute-- i loved it. The burger was great. Nothing out of the ordinary, but quality. And the Mayfield fries were REALLY good. The giant hotcake, however, wasn't my favorite. It was VERY egg-y, and I don't know how anyone in their right mind would want to eat that huge plate of eggy pancake. My husband ended up eating half my burger and we ditched the hotcake because of the subpar taste.

There is a reason why the reviews are all over the map for this place. It is wildly inconsistent. It was easy to get a reservation 2 hours ahead of time for Saturday night at 7:30pm, which sort of makes you wonder why it isn't more popular. Our waiter was pleasant, and the food was good, but it took an hour and 10 minutes to get our dinner from when we ordered. For a restaurant that has been open since 2009, that's pretty hard to understand. They should have worked out the kinks by now. For a casual place, the prices were very high, with $38 for prime rib and $42 for crab. At those prices, it is inexcusable to have such poor management. We ordered the chocolate cake for dessert because we could see the cake plate on the counter, and it still took 10 minutes to get a slice, and this after we had complained about the slow dinner service. The waiter ended up comping us for the cake, but by then it was too late. Scott's Seafood restaurant is in the same shopping center, and by comparison, it runs like a Swiss watch. Mayfield is run by amateurs, if it is even managed at all.

I really enjoyed this place. I came with a couple friends on a Monday night so we were seated right away. I looked over the menu, briefly, but when our server said that the special for the day was fried chicken I was sold! One of my friends also had the fried chicken, and my other friend had the burger which she said was delicious. Fried Chicken - excellently flavored with crispy skin and juicy on the inside. Huge portions, it was about half a chicken, served with gravy, biscuits, collard greens, and a nice salad that was light and refreshing. The burger - came with onion rings that were probably the best onion rings ever! Mini chocolate doughnuts for dessert!? YES PLEASE! We devoured them so fast we couldn't even take a picture! We also enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding which was FABULOUS! Something I had never tried before, so I am definitely glad my first experience was a good one! It is a bit pricey, but what do you expect from Palo Alto? If I was in the neighborhood and had a few extra bucks to spend I would definitely stop it! They also give each diner a complementary load of bread at the end of the meal! HOW COOL?!

I met my sister here for lunch today.  I love their dedication to using products from local farms as well as the bakery next door, which provides wonderful bread etc. for the cafe.  There are so many interesting little shops in Town and Country, and I think sometimes it doesn't get its due because it's so close to Stanford Shopping Center.  There's not really anyplace good to eat at Stanford Shopping Center, and besides this '50's throw back shopping center reminds me of one from my youth with the same name in Sacramento.  It must have been a chain, kind of like the Westfield Mall of its time. I know I say this about a lot of restaurants, but this place it TOO LOUD!!!  We actually spent a fair amount of time people watching out the window because we couldn't comfortably converse.  I went for the farmer's menu, which is a great deal for $18.  It included a salad of beautifully fresh butter lettuce, watermellon radish, marinated shallots and some field flowers napped with a light citrus vinaigrette.  A couple of the the flowers were, well, too flowery for me, but on the whole.  I liked it and it was stunning to see.  The entree was arctic char on a bed of winter wilted greens a few roasted beets and beet jus.  I've never used beet juice as a sauce for an entree.  I thought this was creative, and the fish was perfectly cooked.  On top were three ever so tiny crispy sets of calamari tentacles.  The taste wasn't such a big deal, but the added crunch was excellent. My sis had the dorade ($17, I think), which was also cooked perfectly and was perched on a bed of french lentils with a reduced red wine sauce pulling together the earthiness of the lentils with the delicate nature of the dorade.  I don't know if they did this for everyone, or just because I had a first course and she didn't, but they brought a demitasse of complementary butternut squash soup.  S didn't swoon over it, but she did finish it.   The dessert that came with my farmer's menu was a large very homemade looking chocolate chip cookie, which I, the good sister, split with her fifty/fifty.  I had a coffee, and she had a tea, which was very tasty - green jasmine- but cost $6!  I think it's meant to be shared, and sometime if we stop by in the afternoon, it would be good to share. Food:  28/40 service 17/20*  they were training someone which made it a little disjointed Atm/intangibles:  14/20 (points off for noise level) value:  16/20 Total:  75/100 = C = 3 stars  It's a good place, I will go back.

Brunch-- ok we split the: Country Style Cured Beef Hash,Two Poached Organic Eggs,  Polenta Sauce, Vegetables and Pearled Barley, Arugula-- $14-- half size was a perfect portion- awesome textures/flavors Pulled Chicken Sandwich, Brie, Hobb's Applewood Smoked Bacon-- $12 -- bread is amazing, great sandwich but definitely on the heavy side; I don't think I could tackle one without visiting a medical dispensary prior to attempting. Pomegranate-Grapefruit Spritz-- $5 -- a little on the sweet side, needed a shot of vodka for balance Elderflower Soda-- $3.50 -- must try call for reservations-- especially for weekend breakfast/brunch

Why does this place only have 3 stars?? I had a really pleasant brunch experience here this past Saturday. The menu changes seasonally I believe...love restaurants that do that. Sat at the counter and they started us off with complimentary lemon pastries. Nice! Rotisserie chicken breast salad: looks unappealing but the chicken is really flavorful and moist Pulled Chicken sandwhich with brie and bacon: the bread was perfectly soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Chicken was also flavorful and went well with the brie and bacon! Would recommend! Mayfield Fries: A MUST TRY! I think these were the best fries I've ever had! Yes, EVER! Sprinkled with chili flakes and parmesan cheese, served with a relish remoulade sauce. YUMMM This is cafe food done right, but what really made me give this place an extra star was the service. Our server was great but the barista working that day was awesome! I didn't catch her name but she has reddish hair with blonde streaks. Chatty but not annoying, and I really don't know how she keeps up such a positive attitude with every customer she interacts with. Great job girlie! Stopped by their bakery next door to take a peek at their goodies. Some of their items kind of reminded me of Tartine's in SF...I want to come back and try them!

This place definitely deserves more than 3 stars. My husband and I decided to check out town and country center for breakfast and walked into this place. The menu looks good, so we sat down. I order beef hash and he got a Camino breakfast. For the drinks, we got a Mocha and orange juice. - Beef hash: was really good with lots of greens, carrots, barley (first time had it for breakfast), potato and beef hash, topped with poached egg just perfectly. It's very healthy blend of everything. - Camino breakfast: I had the Han from my husband's plate and the potato hash is definitely more gourmet than what you get at IHOP. - Mocha: was served in a bowl, which seems to be a new trend I'm seeing in restaurants. it was excellently done with a nice motif on top. I didn't have the OJ, so I assumed it was ok. The service was very good. We got seated at the bar, since the restaurant was full. It's good to make a reservation for Sunday. The food came very fast. The waiters were very attentive the whole time, more than I would expect from a restaurant and the hostess open the door for us as we were leaving. Everyone was nice and said good bye as we were leaving the restaurant. Tap with tips was $45 for the two of us. Yes, it is on the pricy side for breakfast, but you get what you pay for. You get much better food and service than say IHOP. It's also one of those places lifted straight out of the city, which you don't find so often down in south bay. If this is what you are looking for and don't want to drive up, it's really as good as it gets.

I am a little conflicted about this review.  I want to give Mayfield 4 stars based on previous experiences (dining with 1 to 2 other people) but Mayfield gets 1 star (because I can't give a zero star rating) for my recent attempts to make a reservation for a large group . . . so I'll sort of average it out. My need was simple: In mid-January of this year, I was trying to make a reservation for a brunch to be held in March for a large group (13 people).  Simple, right?  Ha! First of all, I can't reach the person in charge (Justin).  I leave messages.  They are not returned.  No one else except Justin can help me.  I finally talk to Justin and make the reservation.  So, it's all good, right?  Ha! Justin sends me a confirmation email with the wrong date.  Then (1 minute later) sends it with correct date, but wrong time.  Then sends a confirming email with correct date and time, but wrong number of attendees, and he addressed me as "Susan" (not my name).  Finally, he gets it right.  But I am nervous.   A few weeks later, I need to finalize the menu so I call in and ask for Justin.  Woman on phone "He's not here."  Me:  "Does he have voicemail?"  Woman:  "I don't know." huh??   So I demand to speak to someone -- anyone -- and I am told that Justin no longer worked there.   Well, at this point, why am I working so hard to give this restaurant my business?  SEE YA!  Called Calafia Cafe, got a reservation in 1 minutes.  SO EASY and great experience.   And no, I'm not affiliated with Calafia.  ;)

Mayfield is a good place to have dinner, but it isn't a spectacular restaurant. The prices are on the high-side and the food and service are both average-plus. In short, you aren't going to be WOW'd by anything you find at Mayfield, but you will have a tasty meal. Nevertheless, I'd expect something a little better for the price you have to pay. I just had breakfast with my mom at Mayfield today and it cost us $50 (before tip) for two egg plates, three small OJs, and a side of bacon. The food was great, but it would've been almost just as good and half the price at Hobee's across the street.  We've also eaten dinner at Mayfield on multiple occasions and have had similar experiences where the food and service don't merit the high prices charged. If you can choose, sit outside or on the right side of the restaurant. The booths on the left side are very close to the bar and have multiple mirrors built into the wood paneling that have come close to making me feel claustrophobic. All this being said, the Mayfield Bakery adjacent to the restaurant is FANTASTIC. Wonderful pastries, sandwiches, and drinks for reasonable(ish) prices. Make sure to try the cranberry sourdough bread - it's to die for! I think that the Mayfield Bakery is the real gem.

Shocked at the low rating for Mayfield Bakery and Cafe. This is one of the best places for lunch (haven't tried brunch or dinner yet) in Palo Alto, and the bakery is top notch. Make a reservation, as it is CRAZY busy during the week! Soups are phenomenal -- try the pumpkin with brown butter if they still have it. And if you get a chance, head over to the next-door bakery for: the chocolate caramel tart, the cranberry coffee cake, or the chocolate chip cookies. Don't forget to ask them to warm up the cookies! They're best gooey :)

My favorite pricy brunch in PA. (Dinner's just fine, imo, but I'm a brunch fan and it's for brunch that I want to devote my review). Warning: I think if you try to go healthy here you are DOOMED. It's low fat, low flavor BUNK! This has changed since launch though. They used to have this lovely "Cobb Salad" that was like a half chicken roasted with a chunk of blue cheese and a little bit of lettuce, covered in wonderful bacon. Needless to say, I ordered this salad (which was obviously just roast chicken, cheese + bacon and some garnish), all the time. Less than a year after they started, that perfect "salad" has been replaced with a bunch of lightly dressed greens and the saddest no skin, no bone, no flavor chicken breast. EW. The reason I give Mayfield 4 stars is that the unhealthy stuff (by that I mean the super carbalicious stuff), is SUPERB. Get their flapjack pancake thing. It's lightly crunchy on the outside, custardy inside. I don't even like pancakes, and I would totally make love to this. Plan on sharing unless you just ran a race though, it's like the size of a medium pizza and mad fluffy. Their cottage fries are like mashed potato sticks that are then fried. HEAVEN. All the baked goods are worth your trainer's evil eye: They are buttery, lovely crumb, distinctly flavored. On the meat side- Their bacon? Lord, forgive me, it's like half a pound of fatty, delicious meat. It's a steal! I also think that their bloody mary is the BEST bloody I've ever had, even trumping Zuni Cafe's, and that's saying something. I'm not sure why it's so cray-cray, but I think it's low alcohol, high flavor. Now, if only they would work on injecting some flavor (fat) into their "healthy" dishes!

Why don't the bakery and the cafe have separate Yelp listings?? Very strange. Especially since the bakery is great, where as the restaurant is pretty mediocre. In any case, four stars for the bakery!! The cranberry sourdough bread here is AMAZING. Seriously, I crave this stuff when I am not in Palo Alto. They also make a mean hot chocolate.  And they always put a homemade marshmallow on top, which I loooove.   Don't forget to grab a few caramels on your way out!  A little bit pricey, but totally worth it.

Dinner tonight at Mayfield was superb!!  I love this place and will return when I am in Palo Alto. I began with a pork belly appetizer.  I learned that it is a new item on the menu.  The pork belly was very tender and the greens that accompanied were delicious.  They added some dry cherries to the dish. Next, I had the Mayfield burger with blue cheese.  It was excellant.  The pickles that accompany the burger are homemade bread and butter pickles.  They were delicious! My only complaint was I did not like the doughy onion rings. The side of fries that I ordered were perfect.  They also serve a mayonnaise base dipping sauce (with lots of onion) for the fries and onion rings. For my tastes it overpowers them.  I did not like it. The bread and butter were fantastic!  I loved the crusty bread.  The butter had an excellant flavor. I love exceptional service.  My waiter (Arguillar) was exceptional.  He was always one step ahead of my needs. I can't wait to go back!!.

Very cute restaurant in an unassuming spot! Located in the Trader Joe's corner of the Town & Country Shopping Center sits Mayfield Bakery & Cafe. If you haven't yet been, I would suggest checking them out for brunch or lunch. A good friend made the suggestion to dine here. She's staying in Fremont so it was a nice "happy medium" meeting spot. Be careful if you use Google Maps - they will NOT take you to the right spot. Just go to Town & Country (across the street from the high school) and you'll find it. The menu is comprised mostly of locally-sourced ingredients, which is nice, albeit a tad expensive. Don't get me wrong, I like to know where my food comes from, but $17 for a chicken salad? That seems a little pricey, even for someone who's not on a budget! Plus, side dishes are a la carte, so you could easily spend $25 on lunch, not including tax or tip. Prices aside, the food is really, really good. And service is impeccable. You know it's a nice restaurant when the servers come around mid-meal and remove the crumbs from the table with that razor-looking device. Fancy pants for sure! They also were not in a hurry to turn around our table, so my gal pal and I had plenty of time to visit. Had it not been so loud inside the restaurant, I would've stuck around and taken advantage of the free Wifi too. Four starts, mostly due to the prices and the fact that the parking lot is insane. Anything close to a Trader Joe's is going to get dicey, so just park a little further away and walk.

Saw this place after shopping at T&C.  Thought we'd give it a try for dinner.  Interior was cozy and booths were great, private in a busy place.  Service was so-so, they didn't engage and seemed to not care very much.  We had burgers and the special dinner that night (St. Louis Ribs).  The burgers were ok, nothing you couldn't get elsewhere. Refills for kids drinks were full price.  Ribs were really tasteless and fatty.  3 ribs, overcooked, thick barbeque sauce couldn't save it.  The side, some sort of corn soufle thing was bland also and salty.  The cole slaw side was a disappointment also.  Our dishes were very hot and so was the cole slaw, also had a salty flavor.  Maybe we picked wrong or chose for the wrong meal but no one was satisfied with their meal there.  No bargain either.

Always lovely for lunch, with fresh ingredients and yummy desserts.  I always get the hirloom tomatoe salad, but this time I tried the fresh carrot soup.  I never leave this restaurant without visiting their Bakery next door or ordering dessert.  Great lunch or dinner spot, kids, no kids, business or personal.  Overall highly recommended.

Main meals here have just been ok, but brunch is where it's at. 4.5 stars I'm still dreaming about the monstrous, soft, fluffy lemony pancake. The soft scrambled eggs topped with proscuitto and thinly sliced asparagus and mimosas also sang. One warning about outdoor seating: as it's a nice option esp if you're with kids, even on a sunny day, it's shady and can be a bit chilly underneath a big tree.

I've been here a few times and it's always been a good experience overall.  It's usually quiet and it makes for a nice atmosphere to meet with a friend for a coffee.   Very casual and relaxed.  Service has always been friendly and attentive so I've recommended this place several times and I'll continue to do so.  I especially like their baked goods so I usually pick up a loaf of bread to take home afterwards (scoring points with the fam). The only negative is associated with parking (hard to find a spot a times) but that's nothing to do with the restaurant.  Just plan to spend a little extra time to find a space and maybe to enjoy a nice walk to/from Mayfield !

Went here for a quick bite after church (highway community across the street) and before hitting trader joe's. We spotted the to-go section and it was hopping - lucky us, we happened upon a local favorite. This bakery display was beautiful and we ordered a brown sugar biscuit (good, basically a sugar scone), cranberry baguette (perfect, not too sweet or heavy), and hot cross buns (delectable dried fruit inside, not just raisins) This place is great for breakfast - we saw a lot of local families and couples who looked like regulars.

We just got back from our dinner at the cafe portion and once again I wish we had yelped before trying this place. With all the restaurant competition in Palo Alto this place was clearly overpriced and underwhelming as others have mentioned. When we arrived there was no one at the hostess station. We had to wait and keep moving out of the way while staff rushed around us. We were about to leave when the hostess appeared. She took us to a table by a waiter station and an exit door even though there were lots of empty tables. We asked (nicely) for a different table and she rolled her eyes at us and gave us attitude! I ordered a $31 plate of fish, while my companion tried to order a salad. They don't have any entree size salads, so they offered to bring him 2 side salads. $22 for a plate of lettuce with a light vinaigrette. Vegetarians should avoid this restaurant completely. My $31 fish was small and nothing special. The atmosphere was noisy and hectic. Busboys dropped plates a couple times. We were very disappointed and will not return.

Mayfield has a nice, classy cottage feel to it with its white wood beamed ceilings and large windows all around the restaurant.   I came here for brunch a couple of times and enjoyed it. The first time, they provided compliment bread and the second they gave madeleines (delicious!).  I do prefer the madeleines - it's a different and welcomed change to the bread.   I had their brioche french toast, which has been probably the best one I've had in recent memory.  it came with poached strawberries and in a strawberry sauce that was just sweet enough that I didn't even need maple syrup.  I enjoyed it much more than I thought.   The second time around I decided to go for something savoury, the French omelette.  This was also very, very good.  Light and fluffy, unlike other omelets I've had which were very heavy.  It doesn't come with any sides but it's definitely large enough to fill you up (plus I had the madeleines). Service is great and the menu has a number of different takes on brunch items.

This review is for the bakery only (which is physically separate, but adjacent to the cafe/restaurant). My favorite indulgence lately is their hot chocolate.  Smooth, creamy, with rich chocolate flavor without being overly sweet.  The best part is topping it with one of their house made vanilla marshmallows.  Mmmmm! Their pastry case is pretty satisfying - I've been happy with the various muffins, monkey bread, and croissants that I've tried.  Would not go for the brownies again- very wet and fudgy, not my particular style.   And if you need a quick to-go lunch, the pre-made sandwiches in the cold case are surprisingly delicious.  Well balanced flavors, nice vegetarian option.

This is a review for the attached bakery. I really wanted to LOVE this place. It is in the Town and Country complex near Trader Joe's. They have an awesome assortment of bread and other condiments not to mention delicious desserts. However, the servers seem to be brand new or overwhelmed as it took me forever to get my breakfast sandwich heated up. They were definitely a bit disorganized. I hope to bump up the review in future visits.

Beef hash and french toast were great. Fantastic quality food with impeccable service. My biggest complaint is that everything is totally overpriced. $3.50 for a cup of regular coffee? $14 is on the low end of the main entrees? Yowsa.  Definitely a "nicer" restaurant, so I felt super underdressed in my gym clothes... I love that fresh goods from the bakery next door are brought in before the entrees. We got citrus-y madeleines. Delicious. Regardless, the food was great (though the beef was a bit tough in the beef hash, the rest of the pearl barley and vegetables were incredibly flavorful), and I would consider coming back for brunch (but certainly not on a regular basis!).

The best part about eating here is that Elina's usually behind the bar, so that's where we like to eat. Even if the whole bar is packed, she still manages to make everyone feel special and paid attention to. She is a gem. Her friendly, bubbly personality keeps us coming back time after time, and I trust her recommendations for food and wine. I will happily pay more for drinks and dinner if she's there serving. I wish the other bartenders were half as personable. I've also had Impeccable Service from all of the outside servers. They're both good spots to people-watch. I've actually had mixed service from the indoor table-servers--they seem enthusiastic but perhaps a bit inexperienced, and not as attentive as they need to be. The food is great, a little pricey but you get what you pay for, nice selection of wines by the glass, and the atmosphere is unpretentious. Love the whole "farm-to-table" theme, but I think they've already achieved that with the white-washed wooden plank ceiling, butcher paper on the tables, vintage-look schoolhouse lamps, and warm mentions of farm providers in the menus. Those ugly plaid shirts they've all started wearing bring the whole experience down--makes it seem less special. Please go back to traditional black and white. If you bring your children for brunch, I recommend you have them order from the kid's menu, even if you don't believe your children are fussy. Breakfast items like the giant hotcakes are too gourmet for many children. Wonderful breads, and it's very worthwhile to visit their bakery next door.

This review is only for the bakery, not the restaurant. I like it -- the menu isn't huge, but they have a good mix of items. The whole wheat bread is not too dense or sweet. The croissants were ok, but my #1 thing to recommend to you is the  cranberry sourdough bread. (Try it toasted, you can thank me later.)

Came here with the bf, almost a year after we came here the first time. :) Still yelpable. It's nice that the menu changes (daily? or weekly? i'm still not sure) appies: Chicken vegetable brodo. Fresh Veggies. tasty soup but salty due to the ham hocks presence. they could have done without salting it in addition. or add less ham. Braised short rib with white cheddar polenta. first off, i've never been a fan of polenta. that being said, i totally loooooved this polenta! :) and the Braised short rib was really moist and fall apart tender, with tons of flavor. I'm glad I picked this one. Pan seared sea Scallop. the scallop was amazing! Had to share, but the bf seemed to enjoy it! Tried the bf's arctic char, it was like a Fatty salmon, exactly how the waiter described, not pink like salmon but not quite a white fish either. The dish was served with a bit of oxtail. Oxtail is always my favorite thing to try at new places (perhaps cuz my favorite viet dish is bun bo hue - Oxtail spicy noodle soup) I wish they had more oxtail! :) And afterwards, we asked if they had the fresh bread we had been eating in the bakery so we could buy some on other days, they said of course. and before we got the check, they gave us a brand new loaf for us to take home! It made awesome paninis. :)

The restaurant: Delicious food, no question. I've been here for brunch and lunch and have not been disappointed with the tastiness of my meal. The only downside is that the food is definitely a bit expensive for what you get, and the restaurant's website doesn't clarify when the brunch/lunch/dinner menus begin. I went in on a Sunday at 3 expecting lunch, and was told that they only served a limited brunch menu. Which would be fine, the food's good, but they could stand to specify on their website. Buyer beware- the hotcake and french toast on the brunch menu are ridiculously large, so plan to share these types of items! These foods definitely do not survive the next day reheating stage. They're also very sweet, so try some fruit on the side. (If you're willing to cough up $9 for a cup, that is.) The pulled chicken sandwich and chicken salad are both winners, though, and I may have to go back for them again. The bakery: I've got a sweet tooth, and this place could definitely become a guilty pleasure. The lemon tart and s'more are fantastic, and it seems they have a healthy variety of breads. And if you order coffee you definitely get what you pay for- a huge bowl of it!

Had lunch with my wife and must say I've been here on 3 occasions and I really can't say why I come?  The hostess was good but the server was awful. Hardly a welcome and didn't really sound enthusiastic...forgot my wife's glass of wine..had to flag down the server because she never came back to check on us after we got our main course and it still took 10 mins longer to get the wine?  The only gourmet pizza choice on the menu was awful with the grilled or sauted onions on it with cheese and one other ingredient I can't remember ..would have prefered a pizza margherita if they would offer more than one pizza choice. I can't remember the other entree but it was forgettable.  This place is expensive and to be expected in this nice, high end center but the average menu and dull food underwhelms.  I won't be coming back here.

I give them a five on the food! Everything was fresh, tasty, unique. Loved the table bread ( served hot), the carrot soup, beet salad... Ambience is the only problem... Get ready to yell across the table to have a conversation. If you are lucky you can sit outside where it's quieter. Otherwise I'd be  willing to sacrifice the ambience for the excellent food!

I used to really like going to Mayfield but a recent experience left me very disappointed. One of the waiters Eduardo, was extremely rude and basically treated me and the person I was with like we should have gone somewhere else to eat. He was very arrogant and spoke to us like we would order nothing but water all day. The food itself was good, but it was definitely ruined by the service.

This restaurant is more like 3.5 stars- the food is good and the service is good the food is just over priced for what it is.  I could drive north or south 10 minutes and get a comparable meal and service for 30% less...but hey you pay for location right? I enjoyed a dinner I had here as well as a breakfast...the portion sizes were fair, but again the bill was inflated for what is was.

Stopped in for a quick lunch with my mom.  Loved the complimentary bread and butter.  My hot chocolate came in a BOWL with a huge marshmallow.  So amazing.  I ordered a pizza with onions and capers which was tasty.  My mom got a burger with bacon and avocado added, which she loved.  Our server was so attentive and handled our every need.  We will definitely be back if we're in the area.   Note: weekdays around 12pm, the high school across the street gets out for lunch and the kids walk over to get lunch at the shopping center.  It can be hectic getting out of the parking lot if they're all walking around.

Dinner was delish and our waiter was very knowledgable, although just a bit on the hover-y side. Wait until pay day to come here, and guys, this is super great place to bring a date just be prepared to raise the expectations bar LOL. Food was great, and house brew coffee was exceptional. Came back another day for brunch and sat at the bar (apparently you still should make a reservation even for brunch) Brunch was good but probably wont go back because $100 for two for brunch is just a bit on the indulgent side. (we did have a mimosa) also I'm never a fan of a place that prints your check before you get your food, even at the bar. I bartended for years and the only time I would do that is when i got the "they might dine and dash" vibe. All in All I still give four stars B/C to me a 3-star restaurant is border-line dive and this place is definitely NOT that.

Mixed feelings about this place. There used to be a girl who worked there who was super cool and used to be extremely professional and corteous. Last time I went the people kinda whiffed of, "I know a Stanford moneybag when I see one, and you're not it, so WTF do you want?"....This being said, I would say the coffee and the croissant you get here are still some of the best you can find. This along with the cranberry jelly...let's put it this way, big bold juicy cranberries in a lightly sugared sauce. Ooosh. Forget the idiots at the counter. Great jelly.

We had dinner here on a Stanford Football night. Parking was a breeze (I was surprised). We had outstanding service from our host, waitress, server, and ancillary staff - even when they were busy.  If you can be seated outside it will be more quiet than indoors. It gets really noisy inside. I really appreciated the unique menu choices for dinner as well as beverages, they all sounded so good. I went with the Strawberry Gingerade to start which tasted pretty good but I feel that it was overpriced at $6. Later during our stay I ordered an Elderflower soda which was quite good with a floral punctuation not only in aroma, but in flavor as well. The Elderflower soda was priced more appropriately at $3.50. My lovely wife had the Sour Cherry Limeade and enjoyed it very much. As expected it had a tartness to it that added to the experience. We tried the salmon pate and the risotto, wild mushroom with proscuitto apps and were impressed with both. For dinner we had the roasted chicken which tasted good but was ordinary. The accompanying Italian butter beans and wilted greens were a nice touch. After asking our waitress to inquire about the source of the Yellowtail we were told it is wild caught in the bay area/off the coast of California. I enjoyed the tenderness of the yellowtail and accompanying seasonings but I will say that the lemon flavor was a bit strong. I do enjoy a bit of lemon accompany fish but on this dish it overpowered other flavors. Bread pudding is an excellent dessert choice and the molten chocolate cake was quite pleasing too. Overall a good experience. We most surely will be back.

Four of us for supper at 7:30. When the food arrived, it was excellent. One of us had the Braised Short Rib; it was extremely tasty and tender. One had the Rotisserie Pork Chop; it was huge and very tender and tasty, nicely presented with butter beans. One had the  Bavette Steak, again, very good. The Warm Olives with Rosemary starter was enjoyed by all. In summary, if food were the only consideration I'd give this place four stars, even 4.5. But our enjoyment of the food was reduced by the EXTREMELY high noise level. The room has harsh, bright acoustics so that during busy times it is impossible to talk across the width of the table without shouting, as everyone else is doing. If you have any hearing impairment or a hearing aid, you'll be effectively deaf. The high ambient noise and inability to chat comfortably was underscored by the long wait for food. No bread to nosh on for ten minutes after we'd ordered. A 30-minute wait for the main dish after the salads were done. And the prices are quite high: dinner for four, with only two beers and a half-bottle of wine -- and no dessert or coffee as we couldn't stand the thought of sitting around in the racket waiting for it -- was still $204. With a rather stingy $20 tip, $224. That's a lot for what we got. Here's how to enjoy Mayfield Cafe: go on a warm evening and sit outside. They have several outdoor tables, and once the sun has set over the Stanford campus trees, they would be very pleasant, and the only noise would be from the traffic on El Camino, a church-like hush in comparison to inside.

3.5 Stars I went here with my mom a few weeks back, and I'm going to preface that I'm going to write about my food only. My mom didn't like her breakfast (and she's been twice), so that might explain the mediocre reviews here on yelp, but what I had was actually pretty delicious. We came in with no reservation, and the hostess said  there were no available seats, even though more than half the restaurant was empty. Oh well. They promptly sat us at the bar, and I didn't mind at all, as long as I was getting my food! I ordered the country style cured beef hash with the two poached eggs, polenta sauce vegetables and peared barley. I could already tell that it was very fresh and organic, and it tasted just like that. Even though it was a lot of food and I was stuffed at the end of my meal, I didn't have that disgusting full feeling. It had the right amount of salt and seasoning, and the beef hash was so soft and juicy. Overall, a good experience. Food was good and service was fast. Judging from my mom's pancakes and french toast, I'll probably stick to my beef hash.

We came back for dinner yesterday night (Friday) and were incredibly impressed and pleased. The experience we had this time around was *completely different* from the previous time and we are now certain that the previously mentioned incident was a fluke or just an off day for one server! Our dinner service was totally different from the lunch service and I know for sure that we'll be coming back for dinner time and time again. Great dinner ambiance with a reasonable level of noise with just the right touch of rustic decor--we ate outside last time so I wasn't able to comment then on those points. Our experience yesterday was that the restaurant is put together very nicely (I love hurricane candle vases!) and had attentive staff (I noticed that they even drew the front shades when the sun started to glare through the windows). We had a fantastic server (Jose, thank you for being amazing and for your wonderful stories - we wish you, your wife, and your little one the best!). Jose was super attentive, made sure we had all/any questions answered, and really knew the dishes/wine being served. What we feasted on yesterday was spectacular. - Complimentary country sourdough: delicious. Mayfield's sourdough breads are totally unparalleled and I've stopped buying sourdough anywhere else! - Seared scallops with fava beans and lemon sauce (wine 1): the scallops were cooked to absolute *perfection*. Mine were a little too salty, but the lemon sauce helped to tone it down. Loved the crunchy fava beans that lent a pleasant nuttiness and were a great contrast to the scallops. - Duck leg confit (wine 2): boyfriend is a diehard duck confit fan and never turns it down, so the fact that he says that this was the "best duck confit he's ever had" means quite a lot. Crispy skin and the meat was tender. The poached strawberries went very well with the duck and was a nice change of pace from other berry sauces paired with confit. - Tagliarini with mushrooms (wine 3): I thought I'd miss the meat, but I definitely didn't. I loved the mushrooms and the flavors were perfect--the pasta was a little stuck together so it took a little bit of effort to loosen it up, but was very enjoyable. - Beignets with strawberry sauce (wine 4): Yummmm. Not quite the usual beignet in that these were more like sugar doughnuts (beignets are more akin to unglazed donuts with a powdered sugar topping), but very good. I enjoyed the strawberry sauce (a touch of mint would've been nice!) but think that the beignets were already sweet enough to stand independently of anything else. - Cheesecake with candied kumquats (wine 4): a little bland - could've been a little sweeter as far as cheesecake goes. Still good, but was more dependent on the sauce for some flavor. * Wines: 1. Champagne, Billecart-Salmon NV - very pleasant starter. Absolutely excellent. 2. Denis Jamain, Reuilly 2011 3. An Italian red... forgot the name, sorry! 4. Moscato d'Asti, Saracco 2011 - a sweet, delicious dessert wine. Going to pick up some of this, pronto! The wines suggested for our duck confit (the French rose) and the tagliarini (the Italian red) were spot on - you go, Chris! The French rose was particularly fantastic with the duck confit. I prefer reds over whites and really liked the red that was paired with my pasta - nice frontal palate wine with little to no bitterness. Perfect wine for a non-meat dish as I think anything with more mouth feel would've been less enjoyable. As before, the draw here is that it's a nicer place to grab a meal with locally sourced ingredients that tasted as fresh as could be. Prices are to be expected for a classier dining experience in Palo Alto and with the previously mentioned fact of ingredient sourcing. The management is very responsive and a pleasure to speak with (thank you, Chris! We loved you and hope to see you again soon. :)).

They have a great location in the cute Town & Country shopping center facing Embarcadero, with lots of windows.  They also have lovely outdoor seating with heat lamps.  The service is fantastic, very friendly, helpful, patient, professional, and unassuming.  I love the way it looks and I love the service, so I wish the food were better.  The concepts and presentation of the food is great, but the taste falls short.  I think this place has great potential if it would just do quality control on the taste.  Once I ordered the fried chicken, and it was hard and dry.  So disappointing.  Some of the other items were decent, however.  Come on, Mayfield, get it together!

My co worker suggested this location for our Friday lunch. We all ordered the hamburger, which proves we are carnivores at heart. The hamburger was beautifully deconstructed so you can put it together as you'd like. The pickles, tomatoes, and lettuce were cut perfectly and placed on the side of the dish. The meat was so juicy and delicious, I felt like a slob as each bite dripped down my fingers. I tried to be lady and ate as neat as possible, but I couldn't maintain my manners at one point.

This review is for the bakery and the bakery only. They make really good bread (levain boules and baguettes almost taste like back in France) and viennoiseries. Sandwiches are quite decent albeit slightly overpriced but always super fresh. But the very best thing about this place is the personnel. I have never seen so many cute girls working at a bakery in my entire life, I do enjoy when they're a little slow slicing my bread because most of them are sizzling.

Our hostess indicated a fifteen minute wait to be seated for our party of two and asked if we'd like to leave a phone number and walk around (we did).  Thirty minutes later we came over to check on the status of our table.  It had been given to a party of four with the same name.  No apology.  We were told it would be another fifteen to thirty minutes wait.  No effort made to correct their mistake, they put as back into the queue behind all the other patrons. Another hour later, we seated with our food in front of us at Whispers Cafe in Belmont, still waiting for a call from Mayfield. There are too many other good options to have your time wasted like this.  I recommend you take your business elsewhere.

I had Saturday brunch here awhile back and, you know, it was good, if a little frenetic. The place was absolutely packed, which is great, but the service seemed visibly overwhelmed, and it took at least a half an hour to get our check at the end of the meal. Maybe they've ironed out the kinks since then, because, as I said, it was good! But just good. I'm still looking for a reason to go back and try something else.

This appeared to be a popular place so I stopped in for what I hoped would be a quick and delicious lunch to-go.  There was a pretty limited selection of pre-assembled sandwiches behind the counter, but my House Roasted Turkey (toasted to order in the panini oven) was pretty tasty.  The star of the sandwich was the bread, which I guess is to be expected at a bakery, but the turkey itself was pretty good too.  The cheese ended up being heated just enough to get a little soft, rather than thoroughly melted and gooey like I would have preferred.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed my lunch and the staff there was exceptionally friendly.

Good food but very small portions, noisy, and pricey.  Have given it several chances, and will not go there again.

Very nice ambiance for a peaceful dinner. While they have white tablecloths and candles, he crowd is still somewhat casually dressed and seemingly relaxed. Food was very good. Not exceptional, but very good. My wife and I both had green salads for starters, which had a tasty dressing. I ordered a steak with some duck fat potatoes (I know, sounds weird, but it was actually pretty good) and brussel sprouts. my wife had a mushroom tagliatelle. We shared a warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert. I would have any one of the dishes again, they were that good. For the whole dinner, two starters, two entrees and a shared dessert we ended paying $95 with taxes and tip. Since my wife is pregnant, we didn't drink wine, but add a few glasses of decent wine and the total would have been $130-140. Probably not the best value you can find, but I thought it was totally worth it, and will be going again to this restaurant that is very near to our home. As for something negative, service was slow albeit friendly. We weren't in a rush or anything, but still it felt slow. All in all, I'll recommend the place for a nice dinner.

For my mum's birthday last month, my sister and I took her out to dinner in the Bay Area. We split the difference and ate in Mountain View--my mum and I came up from Monterey and my sister came down from the city for dinner at our favorite Mexican restaurant, Fiesta del Mar Too. What the hell does this have to do with Mayfield Bakery? Well, while I was tasked with paying for dinner, my sister was tasked with picking up a cake. She chose a dulce de leche cake from Mayfield Bakery. Rather than getting a whole cake, she opted for individual slices--a good choice considering we were stuffed from dinner. I was excited to try Mayfield Bakery, since I'd heard quite a bit about this spot and had always wanted to try their food--both the proper savory lunch/dinner menu and the sweet pastry/bakery menu. Sadly, I was rather disappointed in the cake. The cake itself was chocolate, which isn't my personal favorite, but to make matter worse, it was very dry. Seriously, this was one of the driest cakes I'd ever eaten--and that includes leftover birthday cake that's been sitting in the fridge for a week! The frosting was nice, very rich in flavor, but it too was dry and crumbly. And the dulce de leche filling had next to no flavor--it tasted like cheap caramel sauce, always a bummer for me. (Why do so many bakeries think they can just use caramel and call it "dulce de leche"? True dulce de leche is so much better and such a unique flavor combination.) I'm still holding out hope that their proper food menu holds promise, and giving them the benefit of the doubt with a three-star rating. But after this disappointing slice of cake, whenever I do finally make it over to Mayfield for dinner, I'll probably skip dessert, at least any cake dessert. Bummer.

Mediocre place but prices relatively high for brunch food. Hence the two stars. We tried the French omelette -- it was pretty good actually. The buttermilk "hotcake" was disappointing though -- it was slightly undercooked on the inside (too doughy) and tasted too lemon-like. We couldn't taste any buttermilk -- and it cost $13.

S.O. and I have been meaning to try this spot for ages now and every time we would pass by, it would packed and so busy that we ended up going to Calafia next door. Well, this past Sunday changed all of that. We got lucky (we didn't eat until 2 pm) so the morning crowd were all gone... and we got a table. Ambiance: it looked bigger from the outside but really... it's packed in there. It's loud and definitely not a private spot. I didn't remember our server's name but he was friendly and semi-prompt (he got tied up with a big group at the end so he was MIA) I ordered the following: - soy mocha (triple shot) = first sip = wow! I'm just happy that I'm going through a good string of good restaurants with good mochas! - The Camino Breakfast: scrambled eggs, cottage potatoes, wheat toast,  applewood smoked bacon = food came out pretty darn fast. This was just the right portion for me. The eggs were made just right (not runny) and the bacon was thick! It got a little too thick for me half way through but I liked it. The potatoes... it was more like hash browns but not really... wasn't really a fan. Overall... they have a limited menu and a little pricey for me... I guess you definitely have to pay for that "organic" in your dishes!

The Town and Country Village in Palo Alto has another newcomer! Located next to the newly opened Calafia Cafe (from former Google Chef Charlie Ayers) Mayfield, the new rustic American resto from the guys behind Spruce, Pizza Antica and Village Pub, is here, officially opening to the public Monday (bakery on Tuesday). Trust me, if you love any of those places, you're going to love Mayfield. Chef Gordon Drysdale, Chef Andrew Hash and Pastry Chef Nancy Pitta have put together a brunch, lunch, dinner and dessert menu that will be sure to satiate any appetite. Prices are mid-range, which means I'll be coming here a lot more often than I get over to Spruce. Mayfield is casual elegant, with service that is top notch but completely unpretentious. You might find the staff behind the bar or in the front of the house on different nights, and get a peek at the pastry chefs working around the clock through their open kitchen. Everything I sampled was delicious, but standouts included the Niman Ranch Chuck Burger with a homemade poppy bun (it's just as amazing as the Spruce Burger), spit-roasted pork shoulder, potato artichoke soup and beer battered shrimp and Niman Ranch bacon (which comes on one of their salads). Paired with a wine from their collection of 100 varieties or Belgian beer on tap, and you've got a perfect meal. Make sure you don't skip dessert, all made in their in-house bakery, or just stop into the bake shop next door for some delectable cookies, cakes, fresh Italian breads and a cup of their house roasted coffee. Nancy's carrot cake is probably some of the best you'll ever have, and the cheesecake and chocolate torte are simply to die for.

Thank you Yelp and thank you Connie C. for the FTR...Mayfield Bakery and Cafe is a winner and we had a wonderful dinner there Friday night! In this day and age of the recession with mostly half-full restaurants, it's priceless to find a restaurant that is bustling with a lively atmosphere, top-notch service, and fantastic food.   Granted Mayfield has been only open two weeks, but I have no doubt the crowds will not be disappearing any time soon.   With Calafia Cafe and the soon to be opening Trader Joe's, the Town and Country Village in Palo Alto suddenly seems like the newest hot spot.  Given I'm so close, I have absolutely no complaints about that.   We arrived with no reservations and at 8 pm, the wait looked to be about 45 minutes.  Luckily, we were able to snag seats at the bar and eat dinner there after waiting about 15 minutes.  With a unobstructed view of the open kitchen, I'd dare say the bar seats were even better than some of the dining room seats. My interest was immediately piqued by the menu.  Rather than being a copycat of so many others out there, I found all the items on the Mayfield Bakery menu to not only sound tantalizing but be unique.  As someone who hasn't patronized their related restaurants Spruce and the Village Pub, it was something I appreciated and makes me want to seek out those two highly rated places even more.   Even the drink and wine menu was nice.  With a great selection of wines and beers, Mayfield also has great old fashioned soda pop and root beer floats.  I was so intrigued by the Purple and Black Cow drink items that I ordered the Purple Cow.  A chilled bottle of Grape Crush was mixed with delicious vanilla ice cream.  Mmmmmmmmm....  It may have been childish but felt oh so right having such a drink in a fancy and nicely decorated place like Mayfield.   We followed it up with a diverse menu selection and, honestly, nothing disappointed: Smokey chicken soup - those who know me will be familiar with my frequent complaining about lukewarm or cold items.  No such problem here!  The delicious soup at Mayfield is served absolutely scalding hot!  The tasty broth is mixed with an olive oil and features tender, meaty chunks of dark chicken meat interspersed with carrots, veggies, and elbow macaroni.  Perfect.  I make a mean chicken soup but am going to steal a few tips from the version here. Mayfield fries - delicately flavored with garlic and parmesan cheese, this dish is an easy hit.  I may have liked even more garlic, but then my breath probably wouldn't have been fit for company. (addendum: the complimentary bread is warm and crunchy.  served with delicious soft butter) Lamb cheeks with pasta - although I find lamb to be a bit gamey, the cheeks were super tender and the star was really the pasta.  It was obvious the pasta was ultra freshly made and it really matched well with the meat. Spit fire pork shoulder - The pork shoulder was cut into nice slices and was tender.  I expected a bit more fat, but it was still quite juicy.  The sauce accentuated the pork flavor and the entire dish was served with a bed of brussel sprouts mixed with pancetta chunks.  I'm not usually a fan of brussel sprouts, but I loved them here.  I have no doubt that the sauce, separated brussel sprouts and generously sized pancetta chunks made that all happen.   We finished our meal with a s'mores tart.  A unique play on the S'more, it featured a decadent chocolate topped on a graham cracker with a toasted marshmallow layer.  For a non-chocolate fan like myself, I still thought the dessert was quite good.   Sitting at the bar and so near to the open kitchen, I was able to see more of the server/manager interactions than the average guest.  This place is well run and it's no accident.  Attention to detail runs to spots on glasses, whether drinks are filled to the top, and whether plates are spotless when being served.  Despite the hectic crowds, our bar keep kept a close eye on us, recommended dishes, and made sure we were well catered to. It may be early, but I think Mayfield is easily one of the best additions to the Palo Alto food scene for 2009, if not 2008 as well.  (Last year's Pampas was good too, but eventually too one-sided  [blasphemous for a carnivore like myself to admit that])   I look forward to returning to Mayfield and trying their brunch.  Admittedly, while Mayfield isn't cheap ($20 for entrees), the stellar food, service, and atmosphere make it a winning entry.   Mayfield takes credit cards, including American Express.

So Mayfield's been open for a month but they're still working out the kinks.  I ordered a molasses ginger cookie ($1.70) and a non-fat latte.  Surprisingly, they ran out of nonfat and lowfat milk?!?!  The cashier acted like it was his first day there and that he had never seen a cash register before.  It took him forever to figure out how to ring me up.  He should have just asked for help or apologized.   The molasses ginger cookie was fine but too thin.  I like thick, chewy ginger cookies and their version was on the crispier side.  Flavor wise it was good; I like how it had a few but not too many chunks of ginger though.  The other cookies looked thin too.  They also had croissants, dessert bars and bread.  Everything looked smaller than average.  Not surprisingly, the prices are on the high side.   I'd rather have a cupcake at Kara's when I'm at Town & Country Village.

Being "under the weather", my daughter's teacher has cancelled her class for the day. And on my daughter's day-off, I took her with me to Redwood City to drop off some documents at one of my partner offices. She also wanted to meet my co-workers and some of the San Mateo County's workers too. After my short job is completed, I took her to Palo Alto's Town Village Center for a treat. The newest Cafe/bakery has just been opened only a month and has the cafe and bakery separated from one another. We wanted to eat at the Cafe, but it was too crowded with workers and families from nearby areas. "Like really, we don't blend in well with the crowd?" So we just settled with the bakery that serve fresh coffee, decorated and yummy pastries and other desserts. I had a fresh brew of the Mayfield Blend coffee. For $2.00, the small cup of coffee is made drip-style similiar to Philz Coffee. Just by me describing the way the coffee was made, you know my cup of joe is freshly-brewed. And with the powerful aromatic scent, it is a cup, I wish I can have every single morning. My daughter had a cup of Hot Cocoa. For $2.00, her beverage is also made fresh from a nearby chocolate company. She also like the fact, the barista put a heart on the foam of her beverage. We also split a Cinnamon swirl Danish for $3.00. Despite being smaller than some of the competitor's pastries, Mayfield bakes all their pastries at the actual bakery. You also know the bakey is made fresh. I took a couple of bites of the pastry and gave the rest to my daughter. "If you want, you can call me a back-wash bastard!" http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Credit cards are accepted at the bakery, but I paid our treats in cash. I would like to come here with the rest of my family here one day to eat at the cafe.

My overall review of 3 stars is based on the following: Food 4.5 Ambience 4 Service 1 We frequently go to Mayfield Bakery for the bread (amazing) but decided to try the restaurant for dinner tonight on a whim.  Luckily we made a reservation on OpenTable as the wait was quite long by the time we arrived.  Make a reservation on a weekend! We were seated at about 6:30.  We perused the menu and waited... and waited... and waited...  No water - no bread - no drinks (wine please!) order taken.  Nothing!  Finally, we flagged down the host who promptly took our wine order.  But, then we waited for quite a long time before FINALLY getting our wine delivered by the bartender.  Still no waiter!  He kindly explained the specials to us, and then, once again, we waited... and we waited... and we waited...  Seriously?!  35 minutes and no waiter?!  Finally, the host took our order, and we were at least moving towards dinner.  The waiter eventually showed up at our table and sheepishly asked "you've ordered, right?"  Well, we have been at this table for 45 minutes with no glimpse of you, Mr. Waiter, but fortunately, yes, we got our order in.  He then brought us our bread - and that was the last we saw of him until we got our check.  Oh yes, and we ordered an extra glass of wine right before our entrees arrived - and it still hadn't come when we finished our entrees (my poor hubby suffered a burger with no glass of red!).  The host checked in as we finished our entrees, and promptly brought the glass of wine - but too little too late at that point.  Wow - really the worst service that we've had in a LONG time.  Though, I will say that the host and bartender were quite cordial, charming and friendly at least. As for the food, we loved it!  So fresh and tasty.  We tried for appetizers the Sea Scallops (pretty good) and carrot soup (silky smooth and very tasty).  For main dishes, we tried the burger (big - delicious) and the couscous (very fresh and flavorful).  And, of course, their delicious bread - crusty, chewy, delicious.  All fresh and flavorful - highly recommended. Ambience quite nice too.  Indoor and outdoor in Town & Country.  Inside a nice mix of farmhouse white and industrial chic.  Nice buzz, but not too loud.  Kid friendly overall too (though we left ours at home tonight).   So, perhaps the atrocious service that we received was an anomaly (though judging from the reviews likely not...).  In any case, Mayfield has delicious, fresh, healthy food in a lovely setting.  Give it a chance and cross your fingers that you get a good server!

Brunch = REALLY (5 star) good. The breakfast flatbread is my favorite thing to eat, and even better with an extra fried/poached egg on the side. Apple fritter things are also really good. Dinner: 3 stars. The bread is amazing, but I got the scallops and they weren't that great, esp considering the price.

Discovered this place a few weeks ago after having dinner at Calafia and made a mental note to check it out once it had opened. Stopped by today for lunch and ordered their turkey sandwich w/ gruyere cheese (which came with a side of their "farm greens") and a decaf mocha. I love how they served their coffees in a bowl. It reminded me of Rose's Cafe on Union St. in SF (which I totally miss now that I'm down in the peninsula exclusively). The sandwich was delightful with it's delectably toasted bread and enclosed within a meaty portion of sliced turkey and melted gruyere cheese. The side of farm greens was perfectly dressed with a light vinaigrette. I took a gander of the dessert menu and I had to really kick the will power up a notch or two for maximum resistance to the temptation. I've taken yet another mental note to come back another time and try their dessert. On another note: I love how Town & Country Village is experiencing a rebirth with all the new and hip establishments opening up.

The cafe for the Mayfield is always pretty busy on a weekend. Their bakery next door with equally long lines moves fairly quickly. One of our favorite things to do on a easy Sunday morning is to find a table along the pathway of this outdoor mall and just people watch while relaxing over some pastries, coffee, and panini's picked up from their bakery. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) The ham and gruyere panini $6 had a nice crisp crunch, just wish there were more fillings and more flavor. Decent but nothing special. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Their chocolate croissant was just ok. Skimpy on the choc and the layers weren't that flaky with all the texture I was looking for. I guess Tartine just ruined it for all these other bakeries.

I had dinner here on a Sun. night with my husband and MIL. I had called the day before to get a reservation, and found out that even though someone on this site said they take reservations, they actually do not. Although, they do take call aheads. Anyway...We were coming from Portola Valley, so I called about half an hour before we were hoping to get there.The woman I spoke to on the phone was really nice, and assured me it would be no problem to seat us when we got there. When we arrived the restaurant was only about half full, and we were seated immediately. I did note that during the meal, the place filled pretty much to capacity. Our server was young, but very nice He seemed to know the menu well, and was very informative,(without being pretentious.) When my mother-in-law and I admitted we were having a tough time deciding on wine, he brought each of us out 2 samples. Very nice touch!!! We made a decision promptly, and were pleased that there were some reasonably priced wines by the glass. We all shared an order of fries. I have mentioned in previous reviews that I am not a fan of fried food, and rarely eat it...With one exception. Fantastic french fries! Let me tell you, these were definitely great fries,and between the three of us, not one was left in the bowl. We were also brought out some fresh, hot rolls, which were incredibly good. When I eat bread in a restaurant, I prefer it hot, and this fit the bill ,and had great flavor. For my entree I had Arctic char. I'm a huge fan of this fish, and I don't see it nearly often enough on menus. Especially with salmon having the season it is...Come on restaurants! Get with the program! Sustainable fish is the way to go! It was served atop a bed of cracked whole wheat, which tasted a lot like cous cous. It was something different, and I enjoyed it. I also appreciated that it wasn't drenched in sauce, just a light orange juice based sauce, with blood orange segments on the side. The fish was cooked perfectly. It could have used a touch more flavor, but,all in all, a solid dish. I really liked how light it was, and was glad that there was a fairly healthy dish on the menu. As for healthy...It ended when we got the dessert menu. After reading Randy's review of the s'mores dessert, I really wanted to give it a try. My MIL decided to order the Meyer lemon cheesecake, and the three of us shared the two desserts. They weren't huge, so I was able to leave the table not feeling overly full. The s'mores dessert was a little disappointing. It was served with a cannelle of chocolate ice cream that really added nothing to the dish , and wasn't very good. With the rich chocolate of the s'more, there was no more chocolate needed on the plate. As for the cheesecake, I have to admit, I am not a huge fan of cheesecake, it's just a too rich and dense for me. Although, this cheesecake was none of those things. It was light and flavored really well. I actually liked it a lot more than I thought I would. The service was as close to perfection as I've experienced in quite awhile. Even though the restaurant looks kind of fancy, the prices are not those of a chichi Palo Alto place. They do add up, but we always end up ordering more the first time we go to a restaurant. If we came back, our bill would be considerably lower. As we were leaving, the hostess asked if we'd like some fresh rolls to take home. We didn't, but I thought it was a nice touch to offer. In total,it was a pretty good experience. The food was fairly solid, but I wasn't as blown away as I expected. Since we ate there last week, the rating of this place has gone down. I figure, (as with most new restaurants) once they are open a little longer they'll iron out any obvious problems.

If you love Village Pub but prefer a casual vibe on most occasions, Mayfield is going to be fantastic. We had our first Mayfield dinner last week; I say it's going to be fantastic because they are clearly still working out some kinks in the service, but our food was delicious and the atmosphere was a comfortable step down from the fancier Village Pub. I had the Beet Salad, Burger, Strawberry Lemonade and Coffee. All exquisite. My better half ordered Shrimp Crostini, Chicken Soup and Cherry Limeade and also gave rave reviews. The kinks were material (e.g., drink arrives 3/4 through dinner; we were graciously comped cupcakes for desert but then they disappointed because they were very dry; $3 coffee arrived when desert was over), but I'm rounding up because I know they will sort these things out ...so I did leave with a happy overall impression and a desire to come back soon for brunch.

Argh!  Why can't you get your service together by now? We've come multiple times and the food has been tasty but the service has been very spotty.  One time we had to wait 45 minutes to get our brunch food.  A few times at dinner we've waited a long time for food and/or they've messed up our order.  When we've brought up a concern or pointed out something is wrong (very nicely), the waiter nods and then disappears until we have to flag someone else down to help up.  Many times, our waiters are unapologetic and totally apathetic. Yes, there are some good servers but I rarely get seated in their section.  Here's a suggestion -- make sure all your servers are well-trained so it doesn't matter where I'm seated. I am rounding up to three stars because the food is tasty.  It is definitely not my favorite place in Palo Alto.

I'm a huge fan of Mayfield Bakery stopping in almost every morning to pick up a baguette or some other fabulous bread treat.  Acme used to be my favorite, but now it's Mayfield all the way.  The scones are great and the sticky buns are to die for.  The Cafe is pretty good.  Don't go on fried chicken Mondays.  It's not that great.  A bit noisy and always a little too crowded for me.

I am downgrading Mayfield Bakery from 4 stars to 2 after one particular experience that I had that was not pleasant. After I gave them 4 stars a couple of weeks ago, I have been here several times.  My husband has come here even more, and we were extremely happy to become repeat customers of this place. Sure, there were minor faux pas related to the service (they didn't split the blue cheese in the salad from the rest when asked, it took them forever to come and take the order, etc), but given the ambience and food, I was completely willing to let all those go and allow for them to spend some more time to solve it. Well, recently, after a nice bike ride, we were really looking forward to stop by at Mayfield for their lovely breakfast pizza.   What we had originally heard was that "This restaurant is meant to be open all the way from 9am till closing at night so that customers can come whenever they want" (We actually heard this from one of the servers working there).  Well, apparently, this does not apply to weekends. We arrived at 4:30, starving.  The maitre'd was extremely unaccomodating and said "Technically we are closed from 4 to 5 on weekends.  And, when we open for dinner, we cannot serve you breakfast pizza since our kitchen does not have the capability".  She said this after asking the manager. Um, excuse me?  This is not some high-end restaurant that only has a few seatings a day and hence has limited ingredients.  All we asked for was a pizza.  They have another variation of pizza on their dinner menu.  How difficult is it to change the toppings? And, I really don't understand why they have to close the kitchen for one hour (even weirder since they can operate fine on weekdays) - and, there were people actually being served when we went there (I guess they managed to slip in right before 4pm??).   I don't want to be a difficult customer, but I also don't enjoy unaccomodating service for very confusing reasons.  Other places in Palo Alto serve food throughout the day and they are perfectly fine.  (And that is what the Mayfield staff told me that they do, to begin with.)  And besides, the kind of attitude we got is no way to treat a customer, repeater or not. It is too bad because the bakery and the food is very nice here.  But both my husband and I are highly disappointed and doubt that we will be back anytime soon.

I still haven't been back for a meal at the restaurant, but today I stopped at the bakery for a breakfast treat. Twelve hours of fasting for bloodwork (when it turned out I didn't need to) earned me a decadent pastry--at least that's what my low-blood-sugar addled brain told me. I bypassed Douce France without hesitation and made a beeline for Mayfield. Even though my previous pastry experience hadn't been memorable, I thought I'd try once more. The almond croissant I ordered was one of the best I've ever had. The filling was a little thicker than I prefer, but not at all marzipan-y. But the croissant itself was perfect: tender but very flaky and crisp on the outside. Definitely better than Patisserie Philippe's and possibly better than Tartine's!

Dear Mayfield Bakery and Cafe, I tried to love you, really I did. With your brown paper table tops, airy architecture, sparkling glass water carafes, and oh-so-bistro ambience, you nearly had me at "hello." I've been back to rethink this many times. I've tried to see it from your perspective by ordering a variety of dishes, trying to find your individual strengths to love. But, sad to say it, we are at an impasse. I think the final straw was our last meal together. Before we'd met, I'd just started feeling healthier. All that local produce and simple healthy fare was setting in. So when I tried your "roasted turkey sandwich," you can imagine I thought we were on the path to healthy together, dear Mayfield. But, sad to say it, we are just not on the same page when it comes to the good life. It could have been the fried white bread that left my fingers too greasy to ever touch another heart again, the gushing mayonnaise, the sliced deli meat, or the lack of any vegetable at all other than shredded iceberg lettuce. Honestly though, it could have been all of it together, plus the fact that all that fat didn't even taste good without the side of "aoli" (read flavored mayo) that came along to spice up our sagging relationship. Oh Mayfield, I hate to call it quits. We looked so good together those few times. But it can't last. My waistline just can't keep up with the hose-it-in-fat and hope for the best style of cooking. I've left you for Calafia, the boy next door. Who both looks great and knows how to keep a lady healthy. Saddest Farewells, Maggie

A lot of mixed reviews, but it seems like all the kinks have been worked out -- I had a GREAT dining experience here :) Had the Hawaiian Dorado (mahi mahi) -- very good! Perfectly lightly browned on the outside, tender and moist on the inside, and love the sauce on top. Had a bite of the burger w/ white cheddar -- YUM. Diners next to us commented on how good it looked. Definitely tasted as good as it looked! Came with HUGE onion rings. Shared the parmesan fries -- hit the spot :) The smell of shaved cheese on freshly fried anything is pretty intoxicating. Onto my 2 favorite parts: *Orange creamsicle float! I wanted to try the purple cow after reading Randy F.'s review (which is why I bookmarked Mayfield in the first place!), but I have a soft spot for orange soda. It was soooooo good. Although it's a "diner"-type drink, something about the old school glass Crush bottle made it classy & appropriate. I have to come back and try the purple cow next time! *Service: Our server was friendly, funny, and attentive! His name started with a G... boo me, I actually made a point to look at the bill for his name and now I've forgotten. Anyway, service was excellent. Really charming place -- a mixture of laid back, comfort foods done classy, chic, and intimate. I'll definitely be back :)

i love the casual cafe they have next door, but the restaurant itself has never impressed me.  lunch and dinner are just plain bland.  but the brunch is absolutely awful.  i don't mind pricey fare, but i just don't find this place worth it.  too bad, since it's located in my favorite spot in palo alto.

It's the new spot for me and mine.  I'm now a scott sole fan. my dad digs his work ethic. His wife works with my wife. He positively charms swinging through the restaurant, letting you know he's on your side. Ambitious nyc chef, by way of spruce, so be sure he's challenging the suburbs. (marrow last time) fine dine cafe, casualized.  it's cheaper; but, with all the attention that a kitchen can muster.  Craft is there with all the tools and impeccable sourcing. the menu ranges elegantly understated, setting up dishes without ruining the surprise. sides and starters have a family style small plate appeal without portion handicapping. I mean, they'll clip you if you order without thought to price. only indulge multiple mains when subsidized (thanks pops;) safe bettor, safe bettor. a good dinner dollar dodge is starter, cheeseburger w bacon(comes w onion rings), dessert. try the pork as an upgrade.  robust, straightforward and untrimmed.There is enough for two family style. done. Been going to the bar a bunch and trying their non-alcholic drinks.  They're going soda fountain feel. i'll go with that pure old world east coast 50's elegance note. strawberry lemonade. affogato or whatever it's called is also something you see now  more because you got the expresso (yes x) machine and the ice cream. should be a standard and is here. brunch was great.  pop tarts perfect.. Like the whole starters and multiple savory options in each section. Hash, bavette steak. The flow of the restaurant is tough if you knead that dough too much. the bakery takes up a lot of the space. but, I like to watch the kitchen and the bakery from the bar, so i don't mind. but it is close quarters. It's got a new york feel in an economy of space way, willingly suspend disbelief and buy in. Uphill sledding if you need high ceilings or don't like mirrors up close(i don't miss the associated restaurant roar). the hosts and hostesses are great on the phone and in the meet and greet. The entire experience is very hands on. acting like an up and comer, trying hard and not caring if its cool.

I will dedicate my 50th review to this wonderful and cute bakery/cafe! I appreciate small gestures (or privileges) offered by the store to loyal customers! Here is my story: I came here to pre-order a pumpkin pie for a holiday party. After a few days, I called in to change my order from a pumpkin to a pecan pie. There is a $1 difference and I offered to come into the store to pay. The owner told me not to worry about it and since then I have become a loyal customer here (well, I am quite easy to please!). I have tried all the muffins here and they are very fresh and the sweetness is just right on the point. Latte is delicious and the roast beef sandwich is to die for (ask them to warm it up for you!). I like how small and homey the store is and will come visit here over and over again!

This review is for bread only. I didn't try their food (they served breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner).  I love bakeries so I always like to try out new pop-ups.  Their bread is fresh and yummy.  I especially like the crust.  It is just made to perfection. Another reason why this bakery gets a 5 stars is because this is a fun place.  There is a big outdoor area.  Right across the parking lot is Peet's coffee, lots of bikers.  People and dogs who go there are so friendly.  It is a good place to meet dogs and kids.

Sadly, this review is just based on their service (we left before we had a chance to order). I happened to be in the Palo Alto Town Center last weekend and my friend and I decided to give this place a try. It was a somewhat sunny day so both the inside and outside tables looked busy. When we first walked in, there was no line and no host(ess) to seat us. Most of the workers looked very busy, so we patiently waited about 5 minutes until some guy came up to us and asked if we were waiting for a table. We said yes and that it didn't matter if it was indoor or not. The guy told us to wait a moment and he would go see if anything was available. From what we could tell, there were several table open, however those could have been for reservations. A few minutes later another two groups walk in and a different host greeted them. He asked how many people they have and then promptly seated one group outside and told the other one that it would be about a 15 minute wait. He then looked at us and asked if we need anything. We told him that a guy had previously been helping us, however he seemed to have disappeared or gotten busy with something else. The new guy told us that he probably went to go look for an available table and that he should be with us soon. That would have been fine, however we waited another 5 minutes and neither of the hosts ever came back to check on us or tell us the wait time for a table. It's unfortunate because I was wanting to try the food at this place, but if that's a sample of their service, I'd rather go elsewhere.

Not your run o the mill "Cafe"  Guess this is where the latest M&A deals are sealed.  No shortage of those dressed in NYC bankers attire on thurs night and nothing but business.   "light" entrees are of generous portions.  Pan roasted mussels rival those @ Cafe Bastille @ Belden pl SF.  The pizza, the barley risotto, and the burger are all perfectly done. As a big plus the maitre'ds are of supermodel quality :) Yum yum.

Now Im a big fan of Spruce and The Village Pub, so  I was happy to hear the Bacchus Group was opening up a place not too far from home. i'd noticed for a few weeks now that they were doing staff training and even moved back the opening date from the 2nd to the 9th. As we walked in, I'd already seen some familiar faces. One of the floor managers from Spruce, Chef Gordon Drysdale, and I think Tim Stannard and Brannin Beal were at the bar. The space is very long and hidden in the facade of the aging Town & Country center, they've done a nice job in giving a modern sleek look to the interior. There's also a large patio area that will come in handy when the weather warms up again. The servers are dressed more casually here like Antica but the food is more towards  Spruce/Village Pub. It's kind of an interesting dichotomy of casual and elegant. Small plates, pizza, soups, and contemporary entrees are augmented by fun things like house made sodas and shakes. They'll serve lunch and brunch in the upcoming days and of course they'll be the bakery that will be supplying their other restaurants. After getting our beverages and complimentary house made sparkling water we got: - Beet salad with fennel and dill dressing - Artichoke and potato soup - Braised pork shoulder with bacon and brussel sprouts - Lamb cheeks with house made papparadelle - Meyer lemon cheesecake with blood orange - Boston Cooler shake The salad was ok but the soup was quite tasty for the starters. The pork shoulder and lamb cheeks were very good but the lamb portion was on the small side, though the papparadelle made me almost forget that. To finish both desserts were tasty and the shakes were kind of a fun way to round out the night. Good promise to the food and \ are definitely points for my return. The service was friendly but a bit nervous. Spruce had a much smoother debut and even though they've been training for three weeks, you could tell the staff here was on high alert. Food timing was also a bit off but nothing that couldn't be easily fixed. Looking forward to brunch/lunch and future dinners as they get into their flow.

I had lunch at Mayfield last week with my 4-year-old and we both enjoyed our lunch very much.   I ordered the Cobb Salad (surprise, surprise) and the waiter emphasized that the salad was "decomposed", and I said, "yes, that sounds good."  Maybe he thought I would change my mind because it was "decomposed".  It's half of a very tasty rotisserie chicken with butter lettuce, blue cheese, avacado, bacon and a farm egg with a light drizzle of vinagrette.  The quality of the ingredients made this Cobb superior to any Cobb salad I've ever had, anywhere.  Just needed some tomatoes, in my opinion. The kids menu is excellent because it contains the kinds of food that little kids really eat.  My son had the buttered penne pasta, no cheese, and the chicken drumstick from my salad.  That and a warm buttered roll made him the happiest diner in the entire establishment.   I don't usually order dessert at lunch time, but I overheard another guest raving about the carrot cake and that happens to be one of all-time favorite desserts.  We didn't have enough time before we had to pick the big brother up from school, so I thought I would just have to order it next time, but the waiter let me know that I could buy a slice in their bakery next door, so that's exactly what I did.  OMG - mmmmmmmmm....... It was soooooo good.  It's worth the drive to Palo Alto just for that cake.  The Americano I got to go with it was also perfect. I will definitely return to Mayfield and soon.

Wow. What a huge disappointment. I really wanted a positive experience since it looked crowded and the decor was nice, especially for Town & Country Village in Palo Alto. I came here as two couples for Sun brunch, 1:30PM. The place was crowded. Pros: Looks nice Baked goods are good Cons: -Wow, service is S-L-O-W. Our waitress did not come take our order and we waited for at least 15 mins. We did not have bread served. -Bad memory-The waitress did not remember who ordered what. Most of us being vegetarian, she brought out a hamburger to me which none of us ordered. Really poor form. -Bad quality and value of food. My dish was the baked eggs. When I ordred it the waitress said this was "good". Well when I had it, it was dry black beans, not a very interesting salsa, baked eggs (small) literally hidden under all the black beans and 3 small corn tortiallas. All this for $11.50. I would rather had gone to Hobee's for better value and quality of food. -It took another 15 minutes for us to track down a waiter to give us the check -The waiters never came by to refill our water. REALLY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE. Would not recommend for brunch. You're better going off to Douce France, Hobee's or Calafia Cafe.

I suspect the cafe is always packed because, from the outside, the decor makes the location seem like a high-end eating establishment.  Unfortunately, service and food quality did not match the crisp white linens and shiny silverware. The first time I tried going here, we waited for 10 minutes at the for a waitress to even notice us and put us down for a table for 2.  No one showed up, so we finally just left, feeling disgusted. Willing to give this place another chance, the next time we went, we were seated immediately, but then forced to wait extreme amounts of time before they brought us bread, or took our order.  Since we were forced to wait almost 30 minutes for our food, we asked for a second basket of bread from two different waitpeople, which never arrived.  This place somehow manages to look like it's packed with waiters, but apparently none of them are doing anything. I ordered a soy latte and the Florentine Benedict, and my friend ordered fries and a cappuccino.  My Florentine Benedict came out greasy and was nothing spectacular.  The latte came in the middle of our meal (which was strange, because you'd expect them to either serve it before, or after) and I immediately noticed that they didn't use soy milk.  Since I only picked soy for taste and not a food allergy, I drank the beverage, but you can easily see how this could have been a problem for anyone else.  By the time I drank to the bottom of the cup, I realized there was chocolate sitting on the bottom-- they didn't give me a soy latte, they had gotten me a regular mocha.  And given that all the chocolate was separated from the rest of the drink, not even a very good mocha. Disappointing place.  A frustrating experience.

My fiance & i had a pleasant brunch here awhile ago, so we decided to come back for dinner tonight.   Unfortunately, our dinner was pretty disappointing for the price.   My fiance had the burger, which he had seen and been interested in when we came for brunch.   However, he didn't really care for it and said it was just kind of meh.  It looked very dried out to me, although I didn't try it.  The onion rings looked good, but he said they were blah also.   I was surprised the burger didn't have anything on it except cheese, burger, and lettuce and tomato.  For $14, you would expect some fancier ingredients.   I had the tagliarini with mushrooms and ricotta salata ($19).  It was ok, but nothing special.  I could tell the pasta was fresh, which was nice, but overall it was a pretty simple dish and the lemon flavor was a bit overwhelming.   For dessert I had the warm molten chocolate cake with salted caramel chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream ($8.50).  Although I wouldn't describe the cake as molten (it was dense and warm, but did not have a liquid center), it was very good and was the best part of the meal.   I love the sea salt/chocolate/caramel combo and this dessert was no exception.   They brought us a free loaf of bread with the check, which was nice, but the loaf was really burned and extremely hard (so hard that when my fiance playfully hit me with it, it actually really hurt!)   The people next to us got baguettes, which my fiance loves, so he was sad about that. It wasn't a bad meal, but I don't think it was really worth the price.

Wow, just wow. Mayfield Cafe absolutely puzzles me! On the exterior, everything SEEMS to be done just right: The restaurant is clean, spacious, beautiful even. The menu lists the farms each entree's meat comes from, the prices indicate that the quality of food should be impeccable, plenty of chefs in the kitchen... The bread was great (best part of the entire dining experience, sad to say). I don't get where Mayfield went wrong but boy did it go wrong. My chicken was undercooked so much that I worried about eating it. BF ordered a pasta with pesto made from walnuts (handy trick, the cheap alternative to pine nuts) and there was absolutely nothing reminiscent of pesto in that not-to-mention TINY dish!! AND it was around $20! If you're going to make pesto the fiscally conservative way, you better pay it forward and take the price of that dish down AND it better taste like pesto. Blah! My friend ordered a pizza that looked good but she didn't seem enthralled by it. Her husband ordered some lamb dish and his serving was incredibly small. Dessert... I don't even remember what I ordered, bad sign! We all dropped around $30-40 each for a meal that was just terrible! That's wrong, shameful even. When the bread is the best part of the culinary experience, there's a big problem.

Deserves more than three stars, for sure.  My only complaint is that it is definitely pricey.  Coffee for $3.50, you're kidding right...that's the same as what they charge for an espresso.  Bacon is $7, that seems kind of ridiculous. But, what keeps me coming back is that the food is great.  Haven't been for dinner yet, but their lunch and brunch were incredible.  Have been three times.  Their French fries are simply amazing.  My friend ordered them after I'd already stuffed myself...and I still managed to find room to eat more than half of them.  The burger and chicken sandwich are both amazing...as is thte green garlic soup. Haven't even had the pastries here, but would expect them to be pretty tasty.

Oh, Mayfield, I want to give you a 4, but I just can't. I've agonized for three days about my review, but in the end, it's going to be three stars for now. The story: My sweetie and I are big brunch fans and were headed to Hobee's Stanford. At the last minute, I suggested we try Mayfield. Surprisingly, at 2 PM on a Sunday there was no wait; we were in a booth near the bar immediately. After reviewing the menu (and asking about the scrapple), we ordered the blood orange sour cream pancakes and the pork scrapple, with egg scrambled. Oh yeah, and a side of bacon. We also ordered iced tea, which was too tannic-tasting. Hey, Mayfield folks: either brew it for less time, or don't cover it while you're brewing it, if you're doing that. Covering results in bitter ice tea, which is what you all have. My sweetie really didn't care for the pancakes. There was nothing terrible about them, he just didn't like the texture or taste particularly. I don't know that there was anything *wrong* with the dish; he's just determined that sour cream pancakes aren't his thing -- there's something about the aftertaste that he didn't like. On the other hand, he enjoyed the little sourdough rolls we were given. As for the scrapple I had, well, some history. I spent some of my childhood in Delaware, where scrapple is a regional breakfast food. Basically, it's the pork scraps they have left over after making sausage, mixed with cornmeal and seasonings, and formed into a sort of "loaf". By scraps, I mean, like, heart, head, etc. I ate it as a child, but now that I'm an adult and I know what's in it, I don't. Anyway, there was a pork scrapple dish on the menu, so I asked what was in it. The server explained it was pork loin, roasted, then minced and mixed with corn meal, etc. So, it's a sort of scrapple-related, only not as freaky. Yay! Okay, now that I've provided a little culinary lesson, the scrapple and eggs dish was okay. It was *almost* pretty good, but there just wasn't enough seasoning or flavor. Additionally, the egg -- which I'd requested scrambled -- was pretty wet, which I wasn't really feeling. Not enough of an issue to send it back, just -- not fabulous. So, 3-3.5 star food. *Different* food, *interesting*, but just not amazing. Now, the service. If I had to describe the atmosphere of Mayfield in one word, it would be "bustling". I don't know if it was our booth location or what, but it seemed that there were a zillion servers and support staff, and they all circled the restaurant every 3 minutes. *rush rush rush, rush rush* Honestly, my gut reaction was that  there had been negative service reviews and someone had told the staff to be more proactive, check on diners more frequently, be more attentive -- and the staff was doing it, to a fault. It felt a little like everyone was trying just a *tiny* bit too hard. So, here's my suggestion: everyone, take a deep breath. I know, I sound hella Californian, but I the anxious vibe with the service staff could be ameliorated if everyone just took a few slow breaths and centered themselves. (I swear, I don't believe I'm even writing this.) Attentive service is good service, but *great* service involves being attentive without being forced, without being a distraction. It's lovely to have my tea glass refilled just as it gets empty. It's not quite as lovely to be asked if I want a refill every 2 minutes. The elements of a solid 4 star place are nearly in place at Mayfield -- I look forward to giving it another try, maybe for an early dinner sometime. (That burger looks damned fine.) In the meantime, tweak the seasoning, and relax, guys.

Before I get any further let me say this:  I know that accidents happen, even at the best restaurants.  It's how those accidents are handled that makes a giant difference in what I think of you. So I just came back from a business dinner at the Mayfield Bakery.  My entire left side is soaked.  I'm just glad I was wearing dark colors or my business associates would have got to see what color bra I was wearing.   A server dropped an ENTIRE heavy glass bottle of water on me.  Yeah, like the kind they serve wine in.  I have a giant bruise on my hip from the impact and am drying out my blackberry.   Like I said, accidents happen.  But guess what?  The server didn't even apologize!!! He asked me how I was, to which I responded:  "wet and hurt" but he just smiled at me awkwardly.  It took them forever to even get some napkins to clean up the giant wet mess.  And it occurred to no one to actually maybe comp me an appetizer? Unbelievable.  Never going back. Unfortunate.

This cafe is one of several tucked into the Town and Village across from Stanford's campus. We chose it because of its relaxing outdoor seating area. We came here on bikes straight from the gym - there's a bike rack right outside and no one blinked an eye at our gym attire. It looks upscale and the menu is pricey ($13 to $28 entrees), so I was surprised that the food was just average. The shrimp salad was uninventive--big chunks of lettuce, baby shrimp, and cherry tomatoes drowning in some sort of fattening, thick, thousand-island-type dressing. My risotto was al dente, oily and rather bland. My husband's pasta in a "tomato fondue" sprinkled with Parmesan cheese was the tastiest dish. The pasta was lightly toasted on top, adding a nice crunchy texture that complemented the cheesy sauce. I will say that the wait staff was delightful. Polite, attentive, and polished. When we declined dessert, our waiter Gustavo brought us two chocolate-covered strawberries on the house. Total bill for one salad and two entrees: $43.80.

4.5 stars for an excellent dinner! I've already written about their brunch, and everything I've said there applies to the dinner. Succulent food (try the veal sweetbreads appetizer!), excellent local ingredients, and just an all-around solid experience. Their porchetta (think fatty, juicy pork) was amazing, as was their duck rillette (think savory duck grilled inside what looks like a hash brown). Top it all off with a larger-than-expected mocha and an excellent chocolate torte for dessert and you have a fantastic Friday night dinner!

I heard pretty good things about this place but sadly, I was a bit dissapointed. We arrived at 11:45am on a Weds, it wasn't too crowded so we were seated right away. The inside is a nice, simple decor but a lot of unpainted white walls which was a little strange to me. Their menu is simple and small, which I can appreciate. I ordered a coffee, my mom had their Bombay chai - both were pretty strong but very tasty. I started off with their turnip and apple soup - very unique and very good. A little sweet when you first taste it but tempers out to a nice mellow flavor, smotth consistency. I ordered their pizza with basil and burrata (I fell in love with this when I had the smoked trout app at Franciscan - plug, plug ; ) ) and my mom ordered the chicken salad. Our food took close to 40 mins. which was the most surprising part since they know people are usually on their lunch hour and then when our food came my pizza was cold. After thinking about this I actually don't know why this would be since my mom's order was a salad w/ cold chicken so that should have been the easiest to make and then there really isn't a reason that my pizza should be cold.... however the food was decent but for the price and wait I would not recommend it or go again.

Very disappointing. Went for dinner on a Thursday night the second week they were open and was there for TWO AND HALF HOURS for dinner!! They said the kitchen was backed up as they are a new restaurant, but that is ridiculous. Unfortunately the food wasn't good enough to back up that wait. I had soup and salad, both were unremarkable. My husband had the bavette steak which was super fatty (can't remember what his parents ordered) and we had the milkshake and cookies for dessert.- the cookies tasted like store-bought cookies....I thought the pastry chef was from Boulevard?? The prices are super reasonable, under $20 for most things, but I won't be back. Go to Calafia Cafe next door instead, it's way tastier.

To quickly sum up the Mayfield Bakery and Cafe: Serivce: Excellent Food: Excellent Parking: Blah Decor:  Excellent I highly recommend the Mayfield Burger!  The meat is delicious and it's served on their fresh baked bun with some of their huge onion rings.  Very tasty and enjoyable (which eases the pain of the $13 price tag).  Add some of their great bacon (thick cuts with a nice amount of crunch...not too greasy...more like higher end "pork belly or roast pork") to the burger for some extra flavor.  I recommend sharing your bacon and not ordering more than one of the extra toppings because the burger just doesn't need it.  But who can resist bacon?  Share it with your friends...trust me. Unfortunately I haven't had any of their other offerings (hey, it's a good burger!) but I hear they are just as appetizing (rotisserie pork sandwich and chicken sandwich are good I'm told). To accompany these lunch specials I would recommend a cast iron kettle of one of their tasty organic tisanes (aka: herbal teas = teas which don't use actual tea leaves so don't count).  I had the "African Nectar" which was quite good! While waiting for your food...make sure you sample (it's hard to eat a rational amount and not fill up) some of their freshly baked bread.  Their bread has a great tank armor-like crust which I look for.  Great crunch with delicious bread innards.  =) Good food is luckily accompanied by a great (attentive, polite and cheerful) waitstaff and nice decor (mirrors next to your head in the booths are a bit distracting...who wants to see themselves as they gorge on a huge burger?) but do help when spying on pretty ladies (if you're into that!)

No, just, no. The menu looked promising enough of many yummy treats, the surroundings were pretty and full of light, just how I like my Saturday brunches. I wanted to like this place.... But it just SO missed the mark. First off, the service was horrible. Our waiter was really cold, and I felt like I had to raise my hands like an over-eager third grade student for like 8-10 minutes every time I needed him for something. Very annoying. Also, brunches = constant coffee refills... despite having a pretty decent house brew, that was not the case here. I almost felt like I was inconveniencing the waiter asking for refills. Then when I was given the bill, they only charged my card for half the amount despite the total on the itemized receipt. When I pointed out the error to the waiter, I received no apologies or thanks for being honest, and got given a second bill as if nothing had gone wrong. I had to ask and double check that the first charge had been voided. Maybe next time I'll just pay the lower charge and get the waiter to pay for the difference out of his own pocket. Yeah, service was that bad. The food was okay, but for what it was it was very overpriced. I paid $50 for two brunches that were really not all that special (pancakes, at that price?? seriously??). Don't plan on returning, and don't plan on recommending it either.

Had lunch here.  Everything seems very fresh and locally sourced--the menu itself lists the farms that provide the food. The bread they provide during the meal are TO DIE FOR.  When we asked for seconds, our waitress apologized for the delay as they were being freshly made. FINE by me! For the starter, I had the salad which was really just a bunch of leaves and some sliced up olives with a vinegarette?  At $10, I say this was overpriced (but hey, this is local so maybe that is how it is....) Someone else ordered the tomato w/cheese starter and it used hierloom tomatoes with Point Reyes cheese...looked more sumptuous than my subpar salad. For the main entree I got the steak sandwich.  It was sort of like a Philly cheesecake sandwich without the cheese or heavy load of grilled onion. It did have some sauteed bell peppers.  NOt bad, but I felt they skimp on the meat.  It was on a delicious French roll bread. And (as I find in most places around Stanford/Palo Alto), EXCELLENT service). Others had the chicken salad. Between 3 and 4, decide to round down.  On a value proposition,  I think it was a bit pricey given the portions, the smaller cuts of meats, etc.  (Perhaps I need to change my thinking and consider that the local produce may be costing more???  And I just notice some people indicated it was gourmet....in terms of prices or the "novelty" of using local produce. Flavor-wise, hmmmmmmmmmm)

My husband and I met here for lunch the other day. I'd wanted to try this restaurant ever since they re-did Town and Country Village. So it was very busy for lunch-20 minute wait for a table-we sat at the bar instead. Nice, friendly server behind bar. Other wait-staff and hostess friendly as well. Points for that, but the food! I had a hamburger, requested med. well, no cheese. Came very bare bones, no tomato, no ketchup, mustard (had to ask for these). Just pickles and three soggy, nasty onion rings. And some kind of mayo based sauce on the side. And the burger was more rare than done. Husband had a chicken salad that consisted of a chicken breast next to what looked like a caesar salad. nothing else on the plate.  He ate a lot of bread. The whole meal would have been forgettable and not even Yelp-worthy but for the insult of the check. Very overpriced meal altogether, including $3.50 for iced tea (not even re-filled)! I don't care if it is Palo Alto, that's ridiculous.

It took about 15 minutes for us to be seated in a booth when we arrived on a Friday evening at 8 pm.  It was noisier than we expected since the very dim lighting suggested a more intimate dining experience.  The menu was a little limited, but suitably Palo Altan given the restaurant's penchant for organic foods.  Unfortunately, the descriptions in the menu were unmatched by the quality of the dishes that arrived at our table. Although the creme fraiche did smooth out the texture of the velvety golden potato leek soup without making it too heavy, its taste was ruined by over-salting.  The braised lamb shoulder came with fingerling potatoes and chantenay carrots.  The lamb could have been cooked for a little longer, as the leaner parts were still quite tough.  The carrots did add some mild sweetness to distract from the blandness from the potatoes.  None of this would have made for a terrible dish, except that everything was swimming in a sea of oil, probably rendered from the lamb fat during braising -- the taste of the actual food was masked by the film of grease around each bite.  The French green lentils and chickpea fries were unoffensive as sides, but not particularly noteworthy either. The soup and the entree arrived at our table within 3 minutes of ordering.  While the dishes we ordered may have been prepared mostly beforehand, the speed was a little off-putting, to say the least.  It didn't help that our dishes did get cold quickly.  The highlight was the duo of chocolate pot de creme and chocolate fondant cake.  Also, the portion sizes were surprisingly small compared to the average, which meant that they were actually appropriately sized. Ultimately, the food was mediocre and the price excessive.  The one redeeming factor was that, upon leaving, we were offered a free loaf of bread of our choice from a large selection in several different baskets.  The sandwiches we made the next day with some salmon and cream cheese almost made up for our disappointing dining experience.

Mayfield Bakery and Cafe is one of my favorites.  I know they have a lunch and dinner menu, but I only come here for brunch.  They print monthly menus - keeping some popular items while mixing in some new seasonal ones.  On my latest trip, I tried the Egg Souffle with prosciutto and chopped mushroom cooked in red wine accompanied by a salad with shaved Swiss cheese.  I have to admit I was a little nervous about this one, but Mayfield has never let me down.  I am so glad I gave it a try.  It was unlike any kind of egg dish I've ever tried! Love the staff, love the venue, LOVE the food.

4th of July Brunch -- One of my Most Favorite Family Members treated me to brunch here outside under the oak tree. Got here about 11:45 am & were seated & greeted immediately. Now, I eat oatmeal/skim milk/banana for breakfast 5 days a week so I can enjoy a festive brunch every week or so. This did not disappoint! They make and bake everything on site. I ordered the crabcakes benedict (about $15) with wonderful hollandaise sauce. Favorite Family Member ordered the hash brown hill (crispy shoestringy potatoes with little chunks of crisp lean bacon and a dollop of creme fraiche) and a breakfast pizza (crunchy crust, prosciutto, fresh baby spinach, a baked egg in the center). I ate half the potatoes, a pinch at a time. We also enjoyed excellent lattes (me) and mochas (Family Member) served in oversized handleless china bowls. For dessert, we split a warm apple crostata with a modest scoop of vanilla bean ice cream (gelato?). Whatever -- it was perfect. Excellent meal, surpassed my expectations. Excellent service too. Attentive without being obnoxious.

What's with all the negative reviews??? I really enjoyed my experience here! It IS a little pricey, but at least it's for quality food using fresh and local ingredients! I'd much rather fork over a few more $$ for that!! Came here for lunch on a beautiful Palo Alto summer day and we sat outside under the shade of the magnificent oak tree... so relaxing and comfortable! Shared the Golden Beets salad & Tuna Nicoise Sandwich & Chicken Salad with Guryere and Bacon Sandwich with my aunty. BEETS SALAD= win. Can someone explain to me the difference in flavor between golden beets and regular? Anyways, the beets were very sweet and tender, and the goat cheese went perfectly with it. TUNA NICOISE SANDWICH: i actually thought I hated nicoise salads but decided to be open minded about this one... so glad I was. They actually sort of carve out a baguette and fill it with the nicoise... it's like a little bread submarine filled with tuna, olives, capers, egg, artichoke (?? idk the whole thing had a pesto-like tinge to it!) CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH WITH GURYERE AND BACON: yummy! The chicken is fresh roasted chicken breast and goes very nicely with their thick slab of bacon and cheese. Very creamy. Of course since this is a bakery, the bread is always a win. Great success. Only possible downside is the cost, our bill ended up being almost $50 (including tip) for 2 ppl!! But it was a tasty meal nonetheless... Also they don't have ice in their water... it was a scorching hot day, ice please?!?!? But I guess they are conserving energy? All in all, great place to catch up over a wonderful meal on a beautiful day!! Outside seating is the best.

Alright haters, this is my five star review. I have been gluten free for almost a year now and have had no problem cutting out bread until I had bread from the Mayfield Bakery.  I loved this bread so much that I went on a crazy binge and ate almost an entire loaf! They have an array of different sourdough breads, and all that I tried were perfectly crispy on the outside, and soft and flavorful on the inside.  YUM! I have had a couple of meals here and they have been delicious.  Fish, and chicken and beautiful salads with a great wine and beer selection to go along with it. I love this place but I'm scared to go back... I know I'll eat way too much!

A beautiful modern new cafe (wooden beam ceilings, sparkling white tablecloths and uniforms) whose menu has some major highlights: - The $6 double cut bacon: yes, you read that right... it is sinful on a variable number of levels... depending on your religion... do it. - The bavette steak with poached eggs: super winner! - The baked eggs: great, but they don't serve them anymore! Skip: - The brioche: yeah, it was decent, but not life changing... I guess PA is kind of old school which explains why this is so popular?

We've come here twice now, once for lunch and once for dinner.  They have an area in front of the entrance where you can eat outside on the many pleasant afternoons and evenings in Palo Alto.  You have to close your eyes and pretend you're not in the middle of a parking lot though, so we've opted to eat inside both times.   I believe the owners are the same folks that run Pizza Antiqua.  On our dinner visit we elected to split a pepperoni pizza as an appetizer.  It's baked in a wood-fired oven and has a relatively thin, crisp crust and great flavorful sauce.  Maybe not as amazing as Antiqua's, but still very good.  For dinner I felt uncreative and had a burger.  Since Mayfield is right next door to Calafia, it reminded me of my recent experience with a really dry veggie burger there.  Mayfield's (beef) burger though came out juicy and perfectly cooked on a nice bun which was probably baked on site.  Mayfield 1, Calafia 0 in that contest.  E was served a colossal portion of fish for dinner which we consumed in its entirety.  Bread pudding dessert was also excellent.  Friends P and L enjoyed their meals also (great pork chop and a nice bowl of soup).   Mayfield also has a fun selection of old-fashioned and new-fangled soft drink beverages.  Grape Crush?  Not sure how many of those they sell, but it's there for you Grape Crush fiends.  You wouldn't expect to find an orange creamcicle float on the menu here either, but you can get one of those too (I had a root beer float which was a nice treat).   On our way out we were chatting by the entrance for a few minutes as the restaurant closed down for the night.  The manager came out with an arm full of their fresh-baked sourdough rolls and gave them to us to take home, a very nice gesture.   Overall - nice bright clean interior, good service and great food.  We'll be back.

I had a great experience at Mayfield's Cafe when my husband took me there for my birthday.  The hostess, server and other staff were all very friendly and accommodating.  There was a little confusion at first when we couldn't decide where we wanted to sit (outside, inside window, inside booth).  But the hostess totally took it in stride and happily seated us.  Our server made great recommendations on the food and was great at keeping our champagne flutes topped off.    We started with the scallops which were so flavorful with the small peppers and segmented lemon pieces they were garnished with.   For our main course I had the duck leg confit and my husband had the summer squash pizza.  The duck was AMAZING.  I wish I could eat it every week. It was served over farro with greens and poached strawberries.  I was hesitant about there being strawberries in the dish, but their sweetness perfectly offset the saltiness of the duck leg skin.  It was perfectly seasoned. The pizza was very good as well, although a bit spicier than we were expecting. We finished off the meal with the beignets and the Espresso Affogato.   They were the perfect sweet ending!   I highly recommend Mayfield Bakery & Cafe!

Had Sunday brunch here last week and it was FABULOUS. the simple brunch menu incorporates enough savory and sweet choices that caters to everyone. The pastries were so nice, but the most notable mention goes to the Niman Ranch Chicken Salad. Actually, its not so much a "salad" as there were only a few pieces of greens, but the highlight is in the Chicken! It was by far the freshest and best cooked chicken. You can't miss out if you go to Mayfield. Once you tasted their chicken, you will understand why people say good food is a nourishment. I already placed my order with my husband that he is to get me the Mayfield Chicken to go, just as soon as I have given birth. It will be my reward.

Came here for lunch today with some coworkers. I've never actually stopped by Town and Country but it's a pretty cute place. Great location. Luckily we got princess parking right in front so we didn't have to wait around for that, as I know that can be a problem. We got seated right away. I love the decor of this place. So simple. We sat by the window to get some vitamin D ya feel? I started with the Blood Orange Lemonade. It was really good. The bread that came out was still warm and hearty. Always a bonus. I ended up ordering the Pork Sandwich, which was a pretty large portion. We also got the Onion Rings to share. Holy. They were spectacular. They were puffy and hand battered deliciousness. They almost looked like doughnuts. And you could tell the onions were fresh because I could actually cut it and not have the onion separate from the breading. So good. The sandwich was good but I couldn't finish it because it was so big. So I have lunch tomorrow! Yipeee! I will definitely come back to try their baked goods. I'm a sucker for good interior design and I loved the airy interior. Makes eating more fun.

I am going to have to agree with Mark N.  there is just something missing here.  How can you have a fabulous backing with such winners as the Village Pub and Spruce and screw up on this one?  I don't get it.  I still think they have much potential.  I have been there at least 8 times (giving them many chances to improve.)  Thursday night for dinner I had the chicken with polenta (had the consistency and flavor of cream of wheat) with tomato sauce.  It was FLAT.  The chicken skin as mentioned slid right off.  Someone in the kitchen is deathly afraid of seasoning.  Thank god I am not a food critic for Bon Appetit magazine.  So guys, yes I will be back for an umpteenth time, and I will keep giving you my suggestions.  I want you guys to get the 5 stars you deserve.  Right now?  I won't rate you because I like you.

My review is for the small bakery. A friend of mine told me about their "bowl of hot chocolate" that was topped with a giant marshmallow.  So we had to check it out and.....it was amazing.  The hot chocolate comes in a bowl rather than a cup and in the middle they put a big homemade marshmallow.  Because it's the holiday time - we got a peppermint marshmallow.  Delicious!  (And I'm sure a ton of calories but worth it). We also had a hot chicken sandwich which was pretty good too! Next time we'll have to try the sit down restaurant for brunch.

Sometimes I crave high-class, froo froo, sophisticated deli sandwiches, and I happened to pass by this place during the weekend. I thought, "Hey, it's Palo Alto, the place looks pretty classy, the prices are high, so it MUST be good." I wanted something quick, so I went to the bakery to order a ready made sandwich. I picked the pulled chicken sandwich and also a slice of the carrot cake. Since this was a "bakery and cafe", I assumed there were going to be a lot of sweet baked goods, but the selection was pretty small. There wasn't a huge extravagant mountain of sweets to choose from, which was what I pictured, but the desserts that they had did look pretty. The sandwich cost $7.95 and the carrot cake was $4.95 for a small slice. For prices like these, it better be good! The main ingredients in the sandwich were chicken, mayo, and provolone cheese. There was also a thick slice of bacon in the sandwich. Honestly, for $7.95, I expected fireworks going off, like this sandwich is a MUST HAVE - something I would waste my time and money to drive to Palo Alto to buy. It wasn't. It was good, but not great. The excess cost of the sandwich probably went to pay for the rent in this location. The carrot cake was good. The frosting was just the right amount of sweet with the perfect amount of cream cheese to powdered sugar ratio, but probably not worth $5 for a slice. I guess it's the bargain hunter in me that gives this place 3 stars.

This is a two star place, but the prices are so out of line with the service and quality that I am only giving it one star.  Upon entering the restaurant, I was disappointed by the lack of service.  I asked a member of the staff for tissue paper for my running nose.  They directed me to some harsh paper towels in the bathroom.  This is the type of service I would expect from a truck-stop diner.  There is no reason for a restaurant charging these prices to have this level of service. The menu is limited.  In fact, there were only three items that sounded tasty.  Looking around at the plates of the other guests, I was not hopeful.  Also, the restaurant was so loud I could not hear my gf across the table.  The decor was bright and shinny, but the mirrored half-wall behind me kept blinding me.  Also, the butcher paper on the table-cloth was very tacky. There was no shortage of staff.  They seem to have at least 10 cooks in the kitchen and an equal amount of waiters for a tiny restaurant.  But, we had to flag someone down to take our order. The food on the menu was poorly described.  We ordered gnocchi and got gnudi, we ordered a pulled chicken sandwich and got chicken salad.  They were alright.  But, the leek soup we ordered was not edible.  It was just disgusting and had the texture of watery baby food.  The flavors were dull.  Nothing was prepared properly.  The mushrooms were gummy, the chicken had bits of keel bone in it.  The soup was sour because the broth used as a base was probably rancid.   The only positive was the bread.  It was very tasty and had a delicious crust.  I have had the cakes next door and they are not very good.  I love cake.  I have no desire to eat this cake.  I came in with high hopes.  I was very disappointed.  I ended up paying 45 bucks (including tip) for lunch.  I feel cheated.  Oh well.

You'd definitely imagine (or have been to) a place like this in wine country, it feels like you're in a barn with the white wood and ceiling fans. We came here on a Friday morning for a quick sit down breakfast - the place was about half full with Palo Alto retirees. We were seated immediately and started glancing over their rather small breakfast menu. I was happy to see that it was local and organic but was unsure what to get, it all seemed yummy! I finally settled for the french toast with strawberries (I'm kinda boring like that) and was not disappointed! This was the best french toast I've ever had! The service was nothing worth writing home about. Everything seemed super fresh and organic (foodie extraordinaire's bacon looked like they had just taken Babe out back and slaughtered him). Tip: skip on the slightly bitter, fresh squeezed, room temperature (need I say over priced?), orange juice, you won't miss it

I went here for Saturday brunch, and it was really good. The omelet is super buttery - mmm.... and snow pea leaves on top. Really good though. The burger is delicious too, and the fries are pretty good. The chicken avocado sandwich was so good! Bread is nice and toasted, all the ingredients you could taste... I got the french toast. The bread they use is really thick, and it wasn't too sweet. But as I ate more and more, it got sweeter and sweeter... probably because the syrup seeped into my bread. My thick sponge-bread. Yum. Strawberries on top too. They're really nice here too. Town & Country has changed so much. I like it.

We had a lunch here before facials/massages at la belle. Both of us had the chicken salad which tasted good, very fresh, but it lacked a certain seasoning. We had fresh squeezed oh which was fab---little sips of sunshine on a rainy day. We finished off with mint tea (not very minty or hot) and some zucchini bread which was delicious. I picked up a flyer for a kids gingerbread house event on the way out for the +5 set. Cool added bonus!

Wow there's a real bell curve of reviews up in here!  Been to the cafe three times including my excursion today and the restaurant twice.  But, it has always been during times when it was quiet and uncongested.   At the bakery,  I can't vouch for the croissants, morning buns, or muffins, but I can say that the brownies and chocolate tarts were fantastic - and that's coming from a guy who's pretty picky about chocolate products. The oatmeal cookies, and choc- a lot! cookies were also splendid.  If you're vegetarian, you must try the grilled veggie ciabata panini - crispy on the outside and savory and cheesy on the inside. The restaurant is good; well-made classic dishes like leek soup, arugula and beet salad, penne pasta, etc.  Nothing too special & sometimes under-seasoned.  If I had to sit down and eat, especially for dinner,  I'd rather spend my time and money elsewhere (the restaurant is kind of pricey for what it is).  However, the bakery and cafe is awesome.  I always welcome making a side trip to it  on my way to Stanford.

4.5 Stars! Went here after going to the Stanford Invitational to watch friends run. Stanford is so beautiful. Makes me want to go back to school. Anyhoo, I digress. Walked in here and had a very good burger, good service and a really yummy house-made cherry soda. Very lightly sweetened and not overly flavored, it was a burst of effervescence in my mouth. Worth going back. Hint: go on Sunday evenings and they give you a free loaf of bread from the bakery, which we enjoyed during the week.

So I noticed that most of my negative reviews are long and droning whereas my positive reviews are short (yet sweet :) I'm going to try to give this one a good full review. On our drive back down from the Winter Fancy Food Show in SF to LA we decided to take the longer 101-route instead of the 5. Surely enough we were nearing the signs for Stanford University and my mom decided that we should stop there for lunch. I didn't Yelp or search for anything, we just turned into the first plaza that we saw and drove straight into the Mayfield Cafe parking lot. Actually the first sign I saw was of CVS Pharmacy's, cause I needed to stock up on more cold medicine. Anyways, one of the first things we noticed was IT WAS PACKED on a Wednesday afternoon, around lunch time. Wow, we immediately said to each other, "We need to try this place". So we walked in and was greeted by the hostess who asked if we don't mind waiting another 10-15 minutes because they were super booked and had a back-wait of reservations. Or we could be seated immediately at the patio. It was a really nice patio but since it was cold and I wasn't feeling well I told her we'll wait. I immediately noticed how fashionable the men and women were, and even some of the older crowd were nicely dressed. We assumed that most were either part of the Stanford faculty and some students or we just happened to be in a very nice (wealthy) area. 15 minutes later we got to our table, the server immediately brought water and bread and was very friendly. He made his suggestions and then made sure that we got our food in a timely manner. I only ordered the butternut squash soup (which was so delicious I almost licked the bowl clean) because I was just not feeling too well. My mom got the Lunch Special which included a bowl of leek soup (also very good), a tri-tip salad and a cookie from the bakery. I had the elderflower soda which apparently is made fresh daily in-house by the restaurant. The server told me that if I liked the elderflower that I would like the spritz (which is also home-made and he said is their best seller) even more. The server also thought that since I only ordered the soup he would bring out an extra plate in case I wanted to share my mom's salad. That was very thoughtful of him and I liked that he paid attention to those details. Though I didn't really use the plate, it was nice to have cause my mom end up portioning her salad and placed some on the extra plate anyways. The salad portion was quite large so our whole order was really more for 2 people. I tried a little bit of the tri-tip and the greens and WOW what a nice and freshly made salad. You could tell that everyone there paid so much attention to the details of the diner's experience from the front of the house to the back. I liked that they had signs everywhere about their local farm-sourced ingredients that they use for the dishes. The bathrooms were nicely done and upkept. One of my pet-peeves is when a nice looking restaurant has a messy unkept bathroom. One of the smaller details that I noticed was these mirrors on the back rest of all the middle-of-the-room tables so that even if you are seated with your back facing the window you could still see the outdoors from the mirror, feel the nice sunlight and the busy-ness on the patio and sidewalk. It gives the restaurant a more airy and spacious feeling. I hope they keep up the all around great service. I would consider this place a neighborhood gem. If only I lived closer cause I would be coming here alot if I did.

The Town and Country Center in Palo Alto has been remodeled and it looks upscale and posh compared to the T&C of old. I met a good friend of mine for an early lunch and some girl talk. The interior of the restaurant is contemporary and clean. The din can get rather loud as the restaurant becomes more busy during the lunch hour. My friend ordered the crab salad on greens and, adventurous me, I ordered a plain hamburger - burger meat, bun - no cheese and some onion rings. To drink I ordered chamomile tea. The tea arrived in this really cool iron teapot - and it was absolutely delicious! I had enough tea for at least 4 full cupfuls - definitely enough to warm me up on a cool winter day. The food was another story - hmmm. The lunch entrees arrived quickly. My friend looked at her salad and asked "So where's the crab?" She had to move the green around a bit and found some dollops of crab salad beneath the greens. Not exactly what she had expected. My hamburger was cooked more on the rare side than medium. It was plain, but on the side was some mayonnaise, pickles on a leaf of butter lettuce and three large onion rings. The bun was fresh - not your standard sesame seed bun. The onion rings were hot and crunchy. We declined on sharing any dessert - but maybe I'll have to return just to check out their bakery. Between the two of us, including tax and tip, we spent about $20 per person - a little bit on the steep side of a lunch considering we did not have any wine or alcohol with our meal.

I've been here twice. First visit was a 5 all the way but the second was a solid 3 so I'm keeping it at a 3 until I make another visit. Excellent baked goods though the presentation/preparation varied between the two visits and I can't say enough about their delicious cherry limeade. I've only been here for breakfast and the food is good, basics like bacon and eggs, french toast and oatmeal just classed up a tad. The bakery side can be a little disorganized with people cutting in line and people behind the counter ignoring/not noticing certain customers.

After my first scarring experience at Mayfield Bakery, it took me nearly a year and a half and a ton of positive buzz to give it another shot. This morning's experience was probably worth 3 stars, so we'll even the two experiences out to 2 stars. The bakery portion (as opposed to the cafe portion) of the establishment. My ham and gruyere croissant was delicious, and my cousin's brown sugar biscuit looked pretty damn good as well. I found the staff *still* seriously lacking. After the cashier asked us to repeat our coffee orders three times, she completely forgot that I had ordered coffee and seemed incredibly confused when I asked where my coffee was 5 minutes after my cousin's latte (she ordered a cafe au lait) arrived. Also, though there are a few cute indoor tables in the bakery portion, the acoustics are so bad that sitting there isn't nearly as pleasant as it should be. There were four teenage girls standing next to our table to wait for their coffees and their giggles were reverberating so loudly we could barely have a conversation. Very meh.

Enjoyed a dinner here a couple of weeks ago.  I found the restaurant to be visually appealing, clean and simple.  I think I will try sitting on in their patio area the next time. The best feature of the restaurant was the bread they served.  YUM!  Actually had a 2nd helping it was so good. They have a pretty standard menu (fish, chicken, beef).  I had a yellow fin dish and my husband had the braised short rib.  The presentation was simple, the food well done.  Nothing too amazing or unique.  I think this is a restaurant you could rely on to serve a good quality meal each time.   There are SO many restaurants in the area, this one didn't stand out enough to make me rush back right away.  But I'm sure I'll be back one day.

Came here for the first time today and I must say I totally dig this place!  I like the open environment and the high ceilings.  We ordered the corned beef hash and the French omelet, both were tasty.  Also got the hot apple fritters, which were DELICIOUS!!  Must have!!! They are like little doughnuts rolled in sugar with tiny pieces of apples inside. We also got the country potatoes which was like three rectangular hash browns and came with a creme fraiche with chives on it (tasted like sour cream) - more yumminess... and a croissant.  My only gripe is the croissant was not heated and I think it would have been much better if it was warmed up.  I guess I can request that next time.  Also really loved the hot chocolate which was served French style in a bowl with a huge marshmallow floating on it!  LoVe!!   Service was attentive and they were really busy.  The prices aren't cheap here, because you do need to order stuff a la carte (like potatoes or toast), but the environment and quality make up for it.  A real delight!  Will be back soon!

I've walked by this place a few times and it always looked really inviting.  But I guess you can't always tell how good a place will be from its decor.   We came in for brunch with some friends and were disappointed by the food and service.  The salad that came with my turkey sandwich was so salty it was barely edible.  My plate also included a small bowl of mayo that I wasn't sure what to do with since the sandwich had more than its fair share of butter and mayo.  Our server was inattentive and the food took forever to come out even though it wasn't very busy at all. In the future, I think I'll stick with their small bakery instead of eating in the cafe.

On a nice day, if you feel like sitting in a parking lot in the middle of suburbia and have white linen tables with waiters bringing you food, this is your place.   The stone plate donuts are amazing, crispy, not overly sweet with fruit.  My next dish to try is the poached eggs and corned beef hash.   On my list of repeat places in Palo Alto. It is a relaxing place and pace, great after a workout at the Stanford swimming pool.

Came here for brunch the other day. This restaurant definitely reminds me of something in the Napa area in that it tries to have that "down home whitewashed barn" feel but at the same time feels modern and polished, with upscale ingredients. The service was great-we received complimentary mini muffins and they were refilled at least once. The waiter came around with a pitcher of fresh squeezed oj and I decided to spring for a glass (actually it was really bitter..the only thing I didnt care for). I had a hamburger served medium rare (it was a bit too bloody so next time I'll ask for medium) & it came with 4 beer battered onion rings that were light & fluffy. The hubs had the Camino Breakfast with bacon. Ok, wow, I really wanted to steal his "cottage potatoes"..they were hash brown sticks seasoned with salt and rosemary-next time I'm getting a side of these puppies for sure! I would definitely like to come back here for dinner some time

4th time....a disappointment; no respect for wine.... Been here 4 times (maybe 5)....weak service, plain, unadorned and flavorless food; their worst offense is their total disrespect of and for wine.  You'd think a restaurant i the premier spot in Palo Alto with access to limitless capital and VCs who all go on to their third and forth careers in becoming vitners would be able to spend a few bucks and find a well qualified and experienced somelier.   The last time we had dinner at Mayfield we bought a $50 bottle of wine and it was served not a room temperature (which would have been a sin in itself) but alas at over 90 degrees....they explained that they store the wine above the latte machine....how dumb can you get?  they ended up having to take a new bottle (from  the same location) and cool it down in an ice bath and they decanted it...needless to say, it was not pleasing to the palate Last night we also had dinner there and alas I had a glass of Italian red and guess what.?   Same temperature problem and to top it off they gave them the end of the wine because a third of the glass (which was by they way a meager 5 oz to begin with) was fell of the dregs and undrinkable.   So if you want bland food, poor service and a very poor wine experience, be my guest and be prepared to spend $75 for a 3 course dinner.

Brioche French Toast, Vanilla Macerated Strawberries  $13 - probably the worst french toast I've ever had. Barely any batter in the bread. They just tasted soggy. The strawberries were clearly not fresh. Pulled Chicken Sandwich, Brie, Hobb's Applewood Smoked Bacon $12 - Bread was delicious and had a wonderful crunch to the outer shell. The chicken was tender and went great with the thick fatty bacon. I couldn't taste the brie specifically but overall the flavors worked really well together. French Omelet, Harvest Greens, Fontina $13 - Very plain. While the eggs were fluffy and soft, there really wasn't much to this dish flavor-wise. Major disappointment.

I came here with two of my girlfriends and their boyfriends here for carrot cake, chocolate cake and oatmeal and raisin cookie and decided that I have to come back for brunch so I went last Saturday with my girlfriend and it was a very good experience. We got there around 12:30pm and got a table immediately. The waitress came and serve us water and bread while we were trying to decide on what to order. I ordered the Cobb salad and my friend ordered the Brioche (french toast with fresh strawberries and fatty pork.) The Cobb salad is delicious and light, and consists of half rotisserie chicken with  butter lettuce, eggs, bacon and avocado. The chicken is roasted to perfection with the skin being crispy and the meat being very tender and flavorful. The Brioche is very tasty too with fresh strawberries and fatty pork and is surprisingly not heavy at all. Last but not least, we ordered the carrot cake  for dessert and the chef totally ruined it for us by making it too sweet. 5 stars for presention with buttermilk cream, sprinkles and caramel beautifully decorated around the carrot cake. After the first bite, the only thing that came to our mind was that it was TOO sweet. My girlfriend and I both will come back next time and tell them to just bring us the carrot cake itself without any additional toppings or added flavoring. We will definitely be back next time and bring more help with us so we could order the salmon pizza. Food = 4 stars (tasty and without the grease), Service = 4 stars, Ambiance = 4 stars

Review of BRUNCH and child friendliness only Child Friendliness - 5 stars. any place that has paper on the table and crayons and booths is a happy place for my kid Brunch - I love to order off kiddie menu b/c adult portion pancakes are too much food. the pecan sticky bun is soo yummy but a bit pricey at $4, I keep thinking I can have a Kara's cupcake for less than this price... Arugula salad with walnuts, peaches, and cheese. o! so yummy and healthy!!  $9.75 Chicken soup is healthy tasting... macaroni, some carrots, their wonderful rotisserie chicken. the first time I went, the service was slow, they didn't give us some of their wonderful bread, but still it was great food the 2nd time our server Rebecca was great!! soo attentive.

My baseline for judging breakfast joints is the basic breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham/bacon/sausage and a cup of coffee. While I was shopping at Town and Country, I stopped into Mayfield Bakery. I actually passed up Hobee's because I wanted "real" bacon and I didn't want to spend $15 on breakfast. Mistake! I ended up shelling out $24 for a bland meal. Upside: the eggs were cooked just right and I got the most delicious piece of gingerbread (included this day) while I was waiting for my meal. Staff was friendly and chatty. Not so good: One slice of really dry and hard bread was not enough to sop up two egg yolks. The hash browns were glorified potato sticks like the ones Burger King and McDonald's hand out. The $3.50 house coffee tasted burnt. The ultimate no-no: I was given a dirty coffee cup and no one offered me a clean one even while seen wiping dried coffee off the edges. I probably won't return here. The meal was palatable but for the price I expect a little more flavor if not another slice of decent bread. I did give one star for the idea of sustainable food used throughout the restaurant (however in my case, the execution was poor). And the second star for the gingerbread and filling my belly.

Surprised by some of the low reviews because this place had absolutely fanastic service, great food, and an all around good time. Kevin and I both grabbed a burger here. Well, we didn't quite grab it. We sat down for it after going to the Staford Track meet. Drinks (non alcoholic) are amazing, the burger was prefect, and the fries were delicious. When we left, they even asked us if we wanted a loaf or two of broad. Of course we took some fresh bread home and I've been having it for lunchtime sandwiches all week. Will definitely be back next time we're in Palo Alto! SCORE!

Seems like there are a lot of reviews showing a lack of consistency. I had lunch here today for two.  We arrived at 12:40 and were seated right away.  I ordered the Beet Salad & the Roast Vegetable Sandwich with a side of Onion Rings.  My wife had the Chicken Soup & Turkey sandwich.   First, the bread, Pain Epi was great.  There was no better that I've had on the Peninsula.  The crust was crisp but not too hard and the inside was soft and chewy.  Just the way I like it.  With that said, I wish they gave us more of it... The appetizers arrived. The Beet salad had some yogurt dressing and what looked like onions but was probably thinly sliced napa cabbage.  Presentation was nice and the dish was very good.  However, the beets looked pre-prepared so the $10.50 price tag was probably a bit unjustified.  My wife said she liked her Chicken Soup very much. The entrees came shortly after we finished our appetizers.  The server was in a rush and didn't clear our plates before putting the entrees in place.  There still appears to be some service flow concepts that need to be worked out.  The roast vegetable sandwich came served with potato chips and a small helping of green salad.  The chips were normal and the green salad was inundated with salt.  My wife's sandwich came with the same chips and salad (equally inundated with salt).  The roast vegetable sandwich was excellent.  The bread again was the centerpiece.  My wife said that her turkey sandwich was the best she's had in years.  The wait staff was unavailable to fill my ice tea at regular intervals.  I needed to ask but each time the matter was attended to. The side of onion rings didn't seem to make it into our order.  We had to ask the server and she stated that she did not write it down.  When it arrived, it was perhaps the best onion rings I have ever had.  I am a huge onion ring fan.  Each ring was doubled and the beer batter was golden crisp and the onions were perfectly tender such that you bit through the entire ring.  There was no problem with pulling out the entire onion. This is fine restaurant.  The kinks in the process still seem to be there.  Either that or the wait staff needs some more experience.  Will go there again and see if the food holds up....

My father and I came here for its great location - right next to Stanford.  The place has nice atmosphere (very bistro-come-on-in-and-sip-a-mimosa), but that is about all it has going for it.  Yes, we went for a Sunday Brunch, but they apparently had never heard of the concept.  They were drastically understaffed.  We waited 10 minutes to be seated (no problem), then waited another 22 minutes before our server even ACKNOWLEDGED us (though, she never told us her name).  Our order was finally taken (only because the hostess stepped in, finally).  10 minutes later they tell me that they are out of what I ordered.  When our food did finally come (after a very long wait), the serving portions were far too small for the price, even if they are trying to pull off the fancy facade. ... After posting this review, I was very impressed to receive a message from Herb  Harms, the GM.  He was more than courteous in apologizing for the bad experience and clearly explained the steps they are taking in order to ensure that it is not repeated for other customers.  It is my hope that reviews will continue to enhance the dining experience and that Mayfield will receive a 5-Star in the future.  I have increased my rating to a 2-Star from a 1-Star since receiving his letter.

Came here on a nice sunny Monday afternoon for lunch after a very tiring class at the bar method inside the same Town & Country Village plaza. After a workout, I wanted to eat something light yet flavorful, which I got at Mayfield Cafe. I got referred here by someone saying that they make very good gourmet sandwiches and salads, even though the selection is not very big. They were right. My friend and I ended up splitting a tuna sandwich and the chicken salad, which were both very tasty. The tuna sandwich was very interesting. I thought at first it was going to taste like a tuna salad sandwich, but the tuna was actually cooked all the way through, and was wrapped in an interestingly green colored sauce, along with hard boiled eggs and olives in a french roll. It's a pretty interesting creation, but still tasted good. The portion is not big though, so if you're hungry, you'll have to order something else too. The chicken salad on the other hand was a decent portion, and the chicken was extremely tender and tasty. Big fan of the salad =) The decor inside is very simple yet elegant. There is also an outside patio area, which is nice when the weather is nice outside. The menu said "August' on it so I'm thinking that it's seasonal and changes maybe on a monthly basis. Have not tried their desserts or anything from the bakery yet, will definitely have to try it out next time!

I and my family came for brunch and I personally walked away unimpressed.  The selections were limited and over priced.  I had the cured beef hash which came with barley, carrots and some other "healthy" stuff.  For the first time ever, I didn't finish.  The cubes of cured beef were tough and didn't seem to complement the barley and carrots.  This was $15.  My wife ordered a hamburger which was accompanied by onion rings dipped in a heavy donut like batter!  This was also $15.  Total bill with tip for 5 was over $120!  Get serious.  Head west in the same shopping center and get your money's worth at Hobees.  I guess they want to take advantage of all the yuppies who find it fashionable to overspend on inferior food as long as it is "organic."  Maybe I'm old school, but give me my money's worth.  I don't mind spending good money like for dinner at Gary Danko's but brunch at Mayfield's???

Dear Mayfield Cafe, Thank you for a lovely lunch! As a single diner, I expect an attempt to seat me at the bar, and when I insist on a table, be offered something tucked away near the serving station or bathroom. You did neither. I was shown to a lovely, large table by the window, and the rest of the service was equally fabulous. The servers were charming, took my order promptly, and refilled my iced tea before I had to ask. Service was so attentive, that when the check arrived and the server apologized for the problem with my original server, I had no idea what she was talking about. Apparently, he had a family emergency and had to leave while the others took care of my table. I just assumed it was a "everyone covers every table" kind of place. However, I was disappointed to see the menu on the website was not current and the actual menu was a bit limited. I loved the warm, crusty sourdough, although I found it a bit odd that it was just set on the table without basket or plate. My ABLT, had wonderful ingredients, with thick bacon, more of the wonderful whole-wheat sourdough, butter lettuce and a lovely yellow tomato, but the bacon wasn't crisp, the avocado a bit skimpy, and the bread not thick enough to absorb the tomato juices. I had to pull a long strip of uncrisped bacon fat out of my sandwich and the bottom bread on the second half fell apart into mush before i could eat it. But the flavors were wonderful, especially the remoulade. I look forward to returning.

OMG. I just don't get it. Good bread, good atmosphere, lots of potential, management has a track record of other good restaurants, but this place SUCKS. I guess you could say we are foodies, but we don't have to have the fanciest or the most elaborate dishes -- we do expect good taste. We have been to many great places that are creative, but what good is creative if presentation or taste are lacking? We came here for dinner back in February and I had a polenta and chicken dish that was truly horrible. I nicknamed it "band-aid chicken" - if you can imagine the taste of a band-aid, you just took a bite of my dinner. The "rotiserie chicken" had a slimy skin and sat in a tasteless tomato sauce and some rubbery polenta. Not sure what chef would think that was a good idea. We thought it was just too close to the opening, so we decided to give them another shot for brunch today. Bad move. The menu was expensive ($18 for a mixed assortment of bread and pastries?) and every dish had something that was way too experimental and I had a feeling they couldn't pull it off. I went safe and ordered the brioche with braised pancetta and carmelized apples. It was OK but not memorable. The pancetta was tasty but the portion size was tiny. I expect a lot more for the money and from this hip looking restaurant. My wife also went the safe route and ordered the sour cream blood orange pancakes. Sounds good, right? Fluffly and full of flavor, right? Unless eating sheetrock is your thing, stay away. There was no flavor at all, and holy cardboard batman! By the way, if you want killer pancakes, go to Serpentine in Portrero Hill (San Francisco). I would like to think that Mayfield can correct this, but I have been burned twice now, so I don't picture myself coming back. Calafia is right next door and much much better.

Came in for a late lunch and was a little surprised that it was booming with people and traffic.  A great sign that business is doing well. I reeeeeally wanted to give Mayfield 5 stars...the decor was lovely and food delicious, but for the price point they are sitting at (not to mention being related to The Village Pub) the service really missed the mark.  I could not believe our lackluster waiter. I had the beet salad and warm turkey sandwich. Despite the fact that the turkey meat around the edge of my sandwich resembled plastic from it being over-(re)heated, the food had really great flavors.  I also had the carrot cake which was wonderful...that is, until I saw a hair in the caramel sauce!  Blech.  I know stuff like this is going to happen in any food establishment, but it really turned my stomach.  Coffee did not arrive until we were almost done with dessert which was unfortunate.  Actually, coffee service in its entirety was rather unfortunate. Will I return?  Sure, but I think I'll give Mayfield a few more months to work out the service kinks.

I always smell the outdoor grill in the evenings when I walk into Trader Joe's (I think they used to do Wednesday night barbecues?)  I love the patio seating that's blocked off for at least a little privacy, and there are heat lamps outside, too. As Spruce and Village Pub are both known for their burgers, Mayfield is, too. Everyone gets the burger and onion rings.  For something lighter during brunch (served till 3pm on the weekends), get the breakfast flatbread with thinly sliced fingerling potatoes, arugula, a fried egg, and a chewy thin crust.  The carrot soup is actually a perfect accompaniment, as the flatbread is good for dipping in the smooth, orange colored purée.  It's topped with brown butter and curry to round it out and make it very filling/satisfying for a soup. They also have freshly squeezed orange juice and a large selection if beers and wines for brunch.  You can then stop by the adjacent bakery for some breads and pastries. It is pricey, especially for dinner in that location, but it's a nice, convenient addition to Town and Country Village.

Eww. Went here for dinner tonight and got corn chowder and the beet salad. The soup was the consistency of milk, and the corn was blended in, so it was really a corn-flavored milk. The salad was a pile of yellow beets, an oddly bland horseradish yogurt sauce and some chopped chives. The dish tasted like water and plain yogurt. No flavor at all. Shared the bread pudding for dessert, which was cold in the middle and just ok. All that for $30 for my half of the bill, including tax and tip. No thanks. Give me a $5 Pluto's salad next time.

The pumpkin soup really hit the spot after a nippy 3.5 hour hike. The burger, however, was kind of a let-down. Presented on a fresh brioche bun with a side of crispy onion rings, it had all the ingredients for being a stand-out dish. Unfortunately, the patty was cooked well-done when we had asked for medium-rare, and the meat wasn't as warm as we had anticipated. Service was good, though. Our water glasses were never empty and food was brought out in a timely manner.

Actually probably around 3.5 stars (docking the star for the pricing!). Came here with a group of friends for lunch this past Sunday and enjoyed the El Camino Breakfast. Pretty substantial portion of food - my only complaint that it's pricey! The dessert beignets were also good (though no comparison to those in NOLA). Another plus is the location - Town & Country Square is kind of a nice place to wander around on a sunny weekend and there are plenty of other errands you can run after a nice meal @ Mayfield - there is a nice sized Trader Joe's next door and a Sur La Table for those who like to browse homewares like myself.

After returning, he helped another lady walked in after us whom actually referred him I was there first...!  I told thst was fine and offered that she to be sitted first.  But when returned, He did not assisted me again!!  Same to the gal that worked at the front, she asked to assist other customers and ignore me and my family: same thing, another customer said we were there first.

I wish this place had a hipper name to live up to. Hate to judge a book by its cover, but I was skeptical that this would be a typical suburban joint with not much to offer. Came here for lunch on Friday and loved everything I ate. They did somehow screw up our reservation, but were nice enough to comp drinks at the bar while we waited. All is forgiven! The interior reminds me of a nice clean LA restaurant with lots of lighting and there's also an outdoor patio. I highly recommend the golden beet salad, as it is one of the best beet salads I've had to date. I also had the Wood Fired Ham and Herb Pizza which was to die for. So delicious, and large portions! It looks like they change their menu every month, so check online for the latest!

I'm stuck in the trap of giving everything four stars.  I used to be more generous with my five star ratings, but one tangible outcome of my quarterlife crisis was that I started to be more selective about awarding such honors to places that weren't truly in the upper echelon. Kidding. I really enjoyed Mayfield, aside from the prices.  I "get" that this is a great meeting place for the Palo Alto "elite" and for one afternoon, I could wear my nicest Kate Spade flats and put on some a cute outfit to try and blend in. I ordered the lemonade and I sipped it like a lady of leisure.  I ordered the tagliarini with greens and I savored it slowly like I wasn't a starving maniac.  And when the check came, I casually tossed $30 down for a networking lunch. I may as well have lunched somewhere a bit more formal at the price I paid for a plate of pasta (very fresh, seasonal, and generally wonderful, by the way) and a few ounces of sparkling lemonade (refreshing and clean, loved it). That being said, I'd probably still come back.  I loved their menu of seasonal, organic produce sourced from local farms and estates.  The interior was airy and bright and the ambiance was just right. I guess what I'm trying to get at, is that this place is really fantastic.  Just a pretty penny.  Then again, what isn't around here?!  But maybe I was just paying for understated elegance.  And that, friends, is fine by me...

This review is for the bakery only, and let me tell you - Mayfield's baked goods are FANTASTIC and they are the only reason that waking up at 6:45 am on my way to work last Tuesday was bearable. Try the croissants which are almost as good as Parisian ones - flaky and buttery and has the right amount of crunchiness to them.  And also don't forget to grab a morning bun - cinnamon + sugar + dough + butter = heaven in a pastry.   The earlier you get here the better because I hear all those high school ruffians across the street at Paly will clean the bakery out....

Amazing deep-dish pancake, full of buttery flavor with a touch of lemon zest. A bit massive for one sitting, but that just means you have some to bring home and enjoy later. Alas, the remainder of the breakfast, notably the eggs, was just so-so. Recommended if you are in the mood for pancakes. For other breakfast items, look elsewhere.

Came back for another 7 or 8 times after my first review for brunch, coffee, and dinner. This place is as good as it gets! I'm surprised it is not more highly rated. The last time we came, the restaurant even gave out complimentary free bread from the bakery! Notable items are listed in the following: Heirloom tomato salad- ridiculously fresh with amazing olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and fresh basil. Beet salad- fresh golden beets are naturally sweet and great for the summer. Carrot soup- tastes almost like pumpkin soup but not as heavy. Nice for both the summer and fall. Main course: halibut, duck, thin-crusted pizza, and burger. Side: Mayfield fries and battered onion rings. Dessert: the warm beignets (french donuts) are served warm with fresh jam. Coffee: The latte is my favorite.

Came here for brunch this past Sunday-I was pretty surprised we were able to get a table so quickly-if this had been NYC we would have been waiting 45 minutes. Apparently the Stanford graduation was in progress so I am sure when that let out this was insane. I love the interior design and just the whole vibe it is very charming and airy and bright. It kind of has a french barn vibe. My latte was delicious. My baked eggs were good my only thing would be to maybe have some tomatoes or something spicy to add onto the avocado/creme fraiche topping. My companion had the eggs w/ the crab cake which I had a bite of and was very yummy. I want to go back and see what else is going on here. I see a lot of other reviews seem to be about service issues and consistency-our server was nice and got the job done. I thought to order the pastry basket-why didn't i?

My friend brought me here, and I was a little skeptical because I had quickly checked it out on yelp prior to going - and the average of 3 stars was a little discouraging...however...I saw that two of my yelp friends - Patrick H and Maryanne R both gave Mayfield 4 stars...so I decided to try it out. AND AM GLAD I DID!! Mayfield's ambiance is warm, fresh, and crisp. The service was great, and the food was very good as well. The concept of serving food only from local vendors, farms, etc...is a great touch, and you pay a little more for it (which you should!!). They start with bringing a caraffe of water to your table - which is nice so that you can refill it yourself. Also, a small bowl of coffee cake (yum!). We ordered (to share) the chicken salad sandwich, the squash frittata, and a side of fries. We both also ordered some excellent drinks (slightly high priced). All of it came out well-timed, and we were only at the restaurant for a total of 45 minutes... Drinks: Sour Cherry Limeade - $3.50 (good, but very litte in it) Mint  Tisane - $4.00 (very good, refreshing) - this is fresh mint leaves that they pour water over for tea...you get a lot of it too! I refilled my cup at least 3x. Food: Chicken Salad Sandwich - 5 stars! The bread and chicken were very fresh, also had a nice piece of crispy lettuce for a variance in texture. Very good bacon (not overloaded) and some brie. Spanish Frittata - 2 stars. I could have skipped it. My friend liked it, but I mostly tasted egg not the other ingredients so it was pretty bland. This was served with a side of aioli which I had to use in every bite. Fries - WHOA...yum! They are good sized and have parmesan and a slight kick to them. They are served with a really good horseradish sauce and ketchup. We couldn't eat all the fries, but wanted to take them home. I asked for a box, and the server boxed them for me (always a nice service touch). I will definitely come back again, and will bring new people to eat here. I want to try so many of the other dishes!!

Came here for brunch and had a so-so meal.  It was very busy but our party of 2 got seated in less than 15 mins.  We both got the chicken salad sandwich, but my bread was burnt.  The chicken had a smoked flavor and every time I bit into the sandwich, I expected smoked salmon.  We got fries on the side and they were good!  The fries are the only reason why my 2.5 rating of this place got rounded up to a 3. I ordered a plain lime-aid because I wasn't feeling the cherry, mint, sour, or jasmine addition.  Maybe I should have because the lime flavor was very diluted and the sparkling water was overpowering.  Our waiter checked up on us often in the beginning, but it took a long time to get our check when we needed to go.  Nice atmosphere, ok service, overpriced food.

Like some of the previous reviewers have mentioned, service here isn't spectacular.  Our waiter was looking out the window as he was taking our order and it took a while to get a refill on cream and coffee. Took my family here for brunch and the atmosphere and space are nice and the menu is interesting.  They start you off with zucchini bread which was not bad.   The fresh juice and coffee were good.  The best dish of the morning was the smoked salmon carpaccio.  The worst dish was probably the flatbread because the dish description on the menu doesn't say anything about goat cheese and when it came out there were hunks of goat cheese all over the flatbread...not cool.  The hash was not bad.  The frittata came with a tasty garlic aoili.  The scone was good but a little overcooked and dry.   Overall it's not a bad brunch place but not something I'd crave or insist on coming back to.

This place is a nightmare of heavenly delights for a person who is intent on sticking to a non sweets non butter diet....the scones, the croissants, the muffins...oh my!  And mostly, I am a savory person...so the fact that the sweets are so irresistible is amazing to me. The savory yummies are amazing as well.  The garlic cheese muffins and scones slay me.  I think my chin ends up being all shiny from the pounds of butter that get baked into these morsels of goodness. The staff has always been really nice and helpful, making suggestions when I tell them "I hate raisins, nuts etc...". They don't look at me with disgust or hatred...they just point out the non rotten fruit and non nutty pastries... It's also very convenient and close to my office at Stanford, which is a curse and a blessing.  In an effort to not get fat, I only allow myself an occasional indulgence.  That, and it is not the most wallet friendly place either....it is spendy. Go, get shiny, and enjoy.

My cousin and I visited Mayfield for lunch. He being the regular, ordered the cheese pizza and Mayfield fries (topped with parmesan, and I believe parsley & red pepper flakes), both of which were excellent. I as the newcomer ordered their chicken salad sandwich with bacon and brie. I couldn't get through a quarter of it - the dark meat was coated in brie and made me lose my appetite.

I ended my trip to the Bay with a lunch at Mayfield; friends had recommended it and it's a reliable place for a work lunch, especially given the copious parking in Town & Country, but it didn't blow my mind.  The burger I had was tasty and, since I didn't get cheese, minimalistic:  a nice soft roll encasing a good piece of beef.  It was pleasant to not have anything drawing attention away from the meat, and the side salad I got (subbing in for the onion rings that are standard with it) was good, lightly dressed.  The onion rings I didn't care for all that much -- we had an order for the table to share. All my dining companions were happy enough but I left wishing I had gone to In-N-Out again and longing for a cupcake from Kara's.

This review is for the self-serve bakery, not the sit-down cafe/restaurant. Let's start with the positive: Bread: superb, I always get a levain loaf to take home. Pastries: pretty good, though not awesome (see the 3 star rating above? that's about right). Had a chocolate croissant and a strawberry muffin as I take my research seriously and I wanted to make sure I could give an honest opinion on both French and American pastries. Espresso: OK. Not as strong as I would have liked. Overall a good place to stop if you're in the area but don't make that much of an effort to get here.

Pretty good food, but a few minor disappointments detracted. We were served bread plates and bread knives, but no bread ever materialized (until we left, see below). I ordered coffee with my meal.  It tasted great, but I got an uninsulated porcelain mini-pitcher which went cold immediately.  First cup was barely hot enough, second was tepid, third was cold. They charged us $7 for a liter of some special fizz-water that I ordered from the menu, actually served us a 750 ml. bottle of San Pellegrino. The onion rings that came with my dish were way greasy. When we paid the bill we were presented, as were others I noticed, with a free loaf of day-old bread, which was sort of nice.  Good bread, baked on site.  Can't complain about that. I would go back, but I was mildly underwhelmed so far.

This review is for the takeout area.  Great coffee (nearly perfect cappucinos), great baked goods, but they are disorganized in the takeout area and they are expensive.  No shortage of people behind the counter, they just don't seem to have their act together - long lines in the morning, slow to get people through.  Some of the staff are good, but some like to chit chat with their friends with a long line out the door and some seem a little arrogant and condescending.  They would get 5 stars from me based on the quality of their coffee and baked goods, but they need to improve their workflow and I just don't appreciate having to wait in a disorganized cattle call to pay $7 for a coffee and a croissant.

Nice atmosphere and good location. But, Food and service could be better. Our table were missing knifes, when we finally saw our waitress and asked her for it, I expected her to get us the knifes immediately (since we were waiting to use it). Instead, she stopped at our next table and took their orders, instead of letting them know she'll be right back. That is poor service/ judgement. Ice tea with no ice in it. Room temperature ice tea with no ice, too strong and very bitter in taste. We ordered flat bread with smoked salmon and baked pork and beef meatballs with rigatoni (pictures uploaded).  Food tasted so-so only.  I prefer next door's Calafia Cafe much better.

Froofy hope over experience. Went there for lunch with a friend today. He had never been there before and naturally (but mistakenly) assumed if it's a froofy place near his "digs" (he's from Mountain View) it had to be good. I give them the 2 stars for at least using good meats (Niman Ranch). But c'mon $19 for a crappy sandwich? The sandwich doesn't come with fries, but a soggy salad. To top it all, as they got busy, the server kept trying to get us to leave. Not cool, man, not cool! Overall, if you want to say you've been here, go for it, and the consumer spending index will thank you and your wallet..not so much. Otherwise if you want froofy somethings for lunch, try Left Bank at Menlo Park

We were just rushing to find some dinner before seeing a play at Stanford last night. Ran into this little strip mall, saw a "cafe" sign and went in. It turned out to be amaaaaaazing! The service was fantastic and they were prompt without rushing (we told them we were on a time budget). Started with great Prosecco. Crusty bread with butter AND olive oil. Split a simple green salad with just vinaigrette and olives and it was so simple yet so delicious. I had the seared tombo tuna with eggplant puree. OMG. It was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. Very small but delicious. Now I regret sharing one of the tuna pieces with my husband because it was gone in a flash. The eggplant puree was incredibly silky, delicious. And came with a beautiful grilled asparagus spear. PERFECT. I would totally come back for more.

I stumbled upon this place for lunch and was pleasantly surprised!  When I got home, I couldn't believe the yelp of this place was only 3 stars!   What I've Had:  Chicken Salad Sandwich w/Brie, Rotisserie Dinner, Fries, Salad, Bread The chicken salad sandwich was a very top quality blend.  The brie made the sandwich beautiful but I'm not giving it a full 5 stars (it was a 4.5 star sandwich) because white and dark meat was used and I prefer all white meat chicken breast in my chicken salad sandwiches.   The FRIES ARE AMAZING.  Probably the best fries I've ever had with parmesan cheese, chili flakes, some herbs, oil/butter...etc.  If they were slightly more piping hot then I probably would have given Mayfield 5 stars based upon these fries alone.  I've ordered the fries to go and they aren't even as close so make sure to have them there. The rotisserie chicken was also seasoned well and very tender/juicy.  For $28, you get the chicken, two sides (we got chilled corn soup which was good and braised greens which I didn't really care for), bread and 2 cookies which is a pretty good deal.  The salad that I ordered was pretty bland as the champagne vinaigrette just wasn't very good! The inside of this place is very nice and it is definitely an up-scale fine dining type of atmosphere so the bakery name is a bit misleading.  I wasn't expecting to pay $20 for lunch (which is why I'm sure some of the ratings are lower) but it was definitely great food to say th e least and I'm excited to try the Monday night fried chicken and rotisserie dinner.  Great service at the bar as well which is always a plus.

Location, location, location. Mayfield is the perfect place to sit outside and enjoy Town and Country, that's the big draw. If Calafiya had that same great spot it'd get the most customers because the food is tastier and more interesting, and the price is more reasonable. The service is always friendly. They have some yummy surprises up their sleeves like the watermelon gingerade and those peppered french fries! The food is fine. But how you can serve a burger without a tomato is beyond me (yeah, they charge extra for that). It's a bit pricey for what you get, unless you're going for the best thing not on the menu- the location and atmosphere. I guess you know the reason I'm a regular.

This review is for the cafe. Service is *very* slow. The food on one visit was great, but on another was average. Its hard to understand how they have such an extensive staff, yet can't get the entrees out to the table in a timely manner. Very nice folks, but don't have their operations figured out just yet.

Recently went with my brother's family for a Saturday brunch.  When did Town and Country rise out of the ashes and get so busy?  the restaurant was crowded, but you can call ahead and to put yourself on the waiting list.   I think the food here was actually pretty good. They had a manageable menu that had a good mix, but not so much where it was too hard to choose.  The french toast, salad, and eggs seemed to be enjoyed by all.  The pancakes were a little doughy.  The side of bacon we had is probably one of the best around, and I love bacon. The service was friendly, but maybe a little on the slower side.  I will likely come back.   The other positive is that I believe it is also affiliated with Village Pub and Spruce.  This is definitely not the same dining experiences as those two, but it does fit the good food, good atmosphere, at reasonable prices for what you get of the other two.   Ed

Okay so for a restaurant group that specializing in fine dining, I'd expect more...especially from a service perspective, but a las good help is hard to find.  I have eaten here three times total.  Twice for lunch, dine in and once for dinner, take-out. The first time I came I really enjoyed myself, granted I knew the manager then and perhaps she had a better hold on things because the next time I came in I wasn't impressed.  I mean the food was just okay, actually my soup was really blah and my salad was good but not worth the price it cost.   Same with the take out, portion size was a little small and the food just didn't pop. And the service, it's just all over the place.  In fact, I would say there's too many people working there at any one time. I mean, I got my water constantly filled but ask for aoili and prepare to wait.

I am upgrading to four stars based on numerous recent visits that have mostly been outstanding (only a few hiccups).  I find myself eating breakfast here a lot lately, but they have started to deliver on dinner, too.  Things appear to finally be coming together and I couldn't be happier to have this as my little neighborhood restaurant. I highly encourage you to try the Camino breakfast with ham and eggs (over easy).  They kiss the ham with a little something (maple syrup?) that just sets it off... and their potatoes (some lovely blend of what I think is cottage cheese, potatoes, and herbs - compressed into a double Corona cigar shape and then fried) are freaking awesome.  I usually don't eat potatoes, but these things are worth the carbs!  Just try to pass on the little muffins they bring out gratis... I say "try" because those are great, too. :)

4 stars for the morning bun.  Love it, crispy on the outside, soft and slightly doughy/chewy on the inside, and no orange flavor, which is perfect, because I'm a purist (although the morning bun at tartine with a hint of orange can't be beat). 4 stars for the veggie ciabatta sandwich with garlic aioli and melty cheese. 0 stars for the lemon poppy seed pound cake, which tasted stale and more like soggy bread than buttery cake. Overall:  3 stars for having select options of very yummy food sadly offset by an inconsistent variety of decidedly non-yummy food.  With the expensive price tag, a mistake in purchase is wasted calories and punishment on the wallet.  Also, minus points for having a tiny smore that costs $4.50.  Who buys that?

Stopped in for 9:00 pm dinner on Monday night.  1st - it was nice to be greeted this late on a Monday evening by a smiling hostess - usually this part of Pali/Menlo are shutting down my 9 on weeknights. We sat at the bar and were immediately served water and a plate of wour dough bread.  Ordered burgers with E, all of the above - cheese, avocado, bacon and fried onions.  Meals were timely.  OK so, I dig burgers and this one set a new high bar- broiling outside and a slight hint of red in the middle - FINALLY - a chef who get's how to cook a burger MEDIUM.  Bun was fresh, soft and just a bit of taste-complemented the quaity beef rather than trying to cover anythin up.  Veggies were fresh, lettuce crisp, avo fresh sliced and the onion rings that came with the burger - light, tasty and crisp.  Wait staff was spot on.  Beer and wine selection excellent - Lagunitas IPA - gotta love it. If you like well prepared food in an excellent non-intimidating environment, fairly priced ($14 for the base burger + $2 for toppings), check Mayfield Cafe out.

Service needs help. They are friendly and well intentioned, just need training and more staffing. -Wait was told 10 minutes and was 30 minutes -Wait for food was looong -They messed up twice on sandwich order -They kindly offered to remove it from the bill...but then ran the credit card to a wrong amount not shown on the bill. Menu is attractive and food quality was a 4 star, service a 2 star.

I'm not sure about some of the other commenters, but I thought Mayfield was pretty decent.  I went for dinner last week, and thought most of the menu looked quite good.  The prices aren't too unreasonable for some of the dishes, and there's a pretty good spread between the highest priced items and the lowest.   We ended up being seated outside, which was OK until it got a bit chilly and they turned on the outside heaters.  The service was just OK, because it seemed like the wait staff wasn't coming outside very frequently.  The bread was quite good, however.  The next-door bakery made the bread for the restaurant, and it was a pretty good rye that we got.  I haven't been over there to get fresh bread, but I'm sure all of them would be delicious.   I ended up getting a salad and the seared tuna for dinner, which was quite good.  The tuna was pretty tasty, and it was interesting that they used Albacore, because when I picture seared tuna, I usually think of Ahi.  But it ended up being a good choice.  The burger is a little on the pricy side, but it's a pretty big piece of meat and it was also pretty good. I'd definitely come back.

Had some time to kill and was already in the Stanford area. It was a toss up between this place and Calafi Cafe & Market, but since I had already been to the latter before, I chose Mayfield Bakery & Cafe. It was almost 1 on a Thursday and most of the tables were still full so I took that as a good sign that this place was at least decent if not tasty. Plus it looked like I could get a good lunch for less than $20. Watch out for parking during lunchtime on weekdays. It gets pretty packed and busy. The space itself was beautiful. Big windows that let in lots of natural light. Seating area outside (mostly for tables of four) for the great weather we're currently having (inbetween heat waves). Inside there were lots of small tables that could be pushed together for larger groups, as well as tables next to the windows. Perfect for people-watching... and eavesdropping on other people's conversations. Service was great. Even though they left a carafe of water on the table, the waiter still came by to refill my water glass and it was never more than half empty. Waiter was amiable and prompt. I didn't have to wait long for anything and he was helpful in helping me pick what to eat. The bread alone made me like this restaurant. It was still warm as if it was freshly baked. Outside had a nice crunch but wasn't too hard or stiff. Inside was soft and slightly chewy. I could have just eaten the bread and been happy. I ended up choosing the heirloom tomato and grilled ciabatta salad with grilled red onions, green olives, arugula, and goat cheese. Great balance of flavors, and was surprisingly filling. I'm usually not much of a salad person and was deciding between this and the tomato and burrata pizza, but I'm glad I tried something different. Thought about getting some dessert (affogato and croissant bread pudding sounded delectable) but I decided to save that for next time I come back. There were definitely other items on the menu that I want to try, and they change their menu to reflect seasonal ingredients. $15 for salad, tax and tip.

They seem to take their Yelp reviews about this place seriously and I know they are working on their service.  Today, we were greeted very warmly by the hostess and everyone serving us from the waiter to the water refiller were so kind and friendly and prompt to remove the glasswear in front of the 2 year old. I had the chicken salad which instead of being a tossed chicken and greens salad that was mixed up, happened to be served separately which was perfectly fine. My only concern was that the chicken appeared to have a few undercooked spots upon further inspection at home ( I took home leftovers ) and it was of course, too late to tell them it was undercooked or spit back up the raw pieces I'd already consumed...10 hours later, I'm not sick so I guess I'm either tolerant to the salmonella or the undercooked fowl was a 'clean'.   Their bread is so effing good...I'd go just for that!

Mayfield is becoming one of my favorite weekend brunch spots. Brioche French toast w/ caramelized bananas is a safe bet, but most things on their menu are quite tasty. Can get crowded during peak brunch hours (~12pm). I always give kudos to restaurants that serve lattes in a bowl - the way they should be served.

Here's a new trick I learned from our waitress at Mayfield for getting a good tip- never bring back the change. Had my first and probably last experience at this shi shi cafe. I had a breakfast foccacia which is fancy Palo Alto speak for sliced potatoes and a fried egg on pizza dough, made to look not like pizza by throwing some greens on top.  Is your mouth watering yet? I actually bought a sticky bun at the end of the meal- I needed something to revive my tastebuds.  That didn't work either. My husband and I spent on breakfast what we could have spent on 2 bags of fresh groceries from the Milk Pail.  Totally mah experience.  The waitress wasn't a very good recommender- that or they just don't have a good menu.

I came here for a surprise birthday party today.  We took up two large tables and an entire corner of the restaurant.  We had kids running around, people walking around waiting for the birthday girls, changing seats, taking pictures, standing up, etc.  This could have been a disaster for the restaurant, which was packed, but instead I thought the service was superb, they were incredibly patient and accommodating, and the food was a pleasant surprise.   The restaurant even had a special menu printed out for our birthday party with the girls' names, and our menu options.  The waitress was sure to ask every time she came out with food whether there was anything else she could get us.   The decor is very nice - well described in another review as almost wine country like in nature.  Very open and airy with lots of windows, and in fact quite a lot of outdoor seating.   The food was superb.  I ordered a soy latte, which came in a big bowl.  I started with a salmon carpaccio, which had frisee, capers, and very thinly sliced salmon and some thin bread - very tasty.  My friends had the seasonal fruit which came as a beautiful plate of apricot, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, and more, with a bowl of yogurt.  For lunch, I had the roasted halibut with green zucchini curry, and ronde nice squash.  I was very impressed at how tender and flaky the halibut was.  The flavors were really good and there was a hint of lemongrass that really made the dish pop.  A friend had the brioche french toast with strawberries, which looked delicious as well.   All in all, a really nice brunch, ranks on the order of St. Michael's Alley in terms of a more upscale brunch in Palo Alto, perhaps less romantic but great for families and the outdoor patio is a big plus.

Went here for brunch on Saturday with a group of people.  I was happy to know that they accepted reservations (but it might have been because we were such a large group).  Service was good, they split our bill according to the number of people we had and was very convenient. But, their food doesn't line up to the service.  Everyone at my table didn't like their dish, it was way too greasy.  Maybe I'll have luck with another dish if I happen to go here again.

The food at the Cafe is good.  My husband and I go to the cafe for their breakfast/brunch menu on the weekends.  I do enjoy their well proportioned meals and their good coffee.   They also try to use locally grown ingredients, which I like. One thing I don't like here is the service.  The staff is nice, however the service doesn't match the food.   Today we visited Mayfield Cafe again for breakfast/brunch.  We were seated promptly.  We waited for 10 minutes without anyone coming by our table before we asked the hostess if we had a wait staff assigned to our table.  We saw other tables being serviced (ones arrived after we did) in the mean time.  The hostess went back  to her station and looked at something, and looked around, a few minutes has gone by and the hostess didn't give us any update.  We waited a few more minutes.  A waiter finally showed up and we were ready to order everything, drinks/starter and our meal. I would really have to think twice before I'll go back to Mayfield again.  I think we will try Calafia next time for breakfast/brunch to compare.

We walked in on a whim this past Saturday and we were made to believe that they'd been waiting all night for our arrival.  We were seated at a cozy booth.  Our waiter seemed busy with other tables, but before we could even think of reacting, we were very thirsty, Chris Cuneo, the restaurant manager, was by our side making suggestions and quenching our thirst.  As we were not super hungry, we ordered salads and apps.  Chris recommended the Scallops (Pan Seared Sea Scallops, Favetta, Crispy Fava Beans, Meyer Lemon Beurre Blanc) and the Asparagus salad( Asparagus Salad, Pistachio, Crispy Prosciutto, Robiola, Sherry Vinaigrette), both were great.  Also had the pasta, (Housemade Tagliarini, Foraged Mushrooms, Ricotta Salata, Preserved Lemon).  Have Chris handle the wine pairings for you, he's just back from Italy with tons of knowledge.  Fresh farm to table food, wonderfully prepared in a casual atmosphere and Chris! We'll be back!

A high end meal  for less than $40 a bucks a person? That's Mayfield to me. While their menu is limited at times, I've never had a bad meal there and enjoy the atmosphere. It also helps that they are kid friendly. While the lack of a bar that does cocktails is noted, they do have a decent wine and beer selection. Love their onion rings, clam broth app, bavette steak and coffee. Deserts are always good, though they took away my favorite, turtle tart! Brink back the turtle!!!

I really wanted to like this place. My friend and I asked the bartender for recommendations and were disappointed. We ordered the Lamb Cheeks and they were fatty and the food was under salted and the gemolata was overwhelming. Wanted to still give this place a try so we ordered the Carrot Cake. We were disappointed when we received a "deconstructed" cake - 2 triangular slabs of semi-dry cake with a dollup of cream cheese frosting. They need to warn people that it is not your standard cake (which is what I was craving). They really did try though. They took off the dessert, gave us some free glasses of Prosecco and some dry cookies (peanut butter, which is ironic given the Peanut Butter scare). I will try it again in hopes of a better experience. Do realize they are new.

Pleasant brunch menu.   Service is lackadaisical ...do they need more waiters/waitresses?  I don't know and don't care...I just know that at 10am on a weekend morning I want coffee within 5-10 min of sitting down or I'm gonna be pissed.  Don't come by and ask me 'still or sparkling' and don't ask 'caff or decaf'!   Menu is pleasant, but as hubs observed:  spinach should appear to have leaves...even if its creamed.  The poached eggs on sourdough had more cream than spinach...but the hollendaise wasn't bad. The brioche with apples & bacon was an excellent french toast...not too sweet, not too bacon-y (wait, can ANYTHING be too bacon-y?). But really, a great, sunny atmosphere cannot make up for service that is beyond 'relaxed'. I'll return to check out the fantastic looking salmon flatbread...but not for a couple of weeks..it'll take that long to convince myself that the service wasn't THAT bad and everyone else on Yelp is wrong.

I went to Mayfield with a group of girlfriends on a Wednesday night a couple of weeks ago. We shared several apps and entrees, so I got to sample a variety of dishes, which were all good. What knocked the experience down a couple of notches was the service. As some of the other reviewers have noted, it's friendly but bumbling and quite confused at times. After waiting about 15 minutes for a table, we were seated at one of the booths across from the open kitchen (which I would avoid in the future, due to the smell of food lingering on our clothing afterwards). Several minutes went by before our waiter stopped over to ask for our preference of water (still or sparkling, both complimentary -- a nice touch). Then it took another while longer for the water to actually arrive (in two carafes; shouldn't they be ready somewhere for the waiter to grab and bring over right away?). Then, a plate of mussels was delivered to our table. While it's always nice to get free food (and the mussels were delish), we weren't quite sure whether it was intentional or not, since the busboy who placed it on our table mumbled something and left. We decided to enjoy the order, and it turned out to be indeed "compliments of the chef" when our waiter finally stopped by again. Although he seemed eager to please, he had a confused air about him, and wasn't around at all for most of the evening. The food was delivered/removed by what seemed to be an army of different busboys, who didn't quite seem to know what they were serving. But it was generally yummy -- especially the burger and the potato gratin. My only disappointment food-wise was the carrot cake we shared for dessert. It was bland and the frosting wasn't at all the delicious cream cheesy concoction I was expecting based on the menu description. In all, I would probably give Mayfield another shot -- maybe if it looked like they weren't too busy and we could get a table by the window or outside. I also want to try Calafia next door; the hostess seemed to be very accommodating and the dishes looked appetizing (especially one that comes in a mini cast-iron pot).

I must say 3 new food places in Town and Country - wow - something is going on and its good! So, I've been here 3 times (one was take out) Service is good and attentive.  Nice layout of the restaurant with the classic wood and white table cloth decor. The takeout - cobb salad was way too expensive I couldn't believe I spent almost $20 on it.  I felt like I got very little lettice stuffed into a little container.  I must say it was nice they put the chicken in a spearte takeout box. I've had the turkey sandwich at lunch and the eggplant one - both were delicious. Brussel sprouts are my favorite - they flash fry them in something delicious and well I can't describe it - you have to try them.

Should I even bother making reservations? My boyfriend and I made reservations for a Sunday breakfast 10:15am. We showed up on time and waited patiently as they set a table for us.  It wasn't too crowded, plenty of tables.  We waited for about five minutes...I saw empty tables. A family of three walked in, had no reservations and voila..they were actually SEATED before us!!! Unbelievable. I had to actually ask why they were seated before us without reservations. Oh, because we are setting up your table? REALLY? It was set and we've waited. Insincere apologies don't count. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. Though my boyfriend had to keep asking the girls to pour him more coffee..they were walking around checking everyone else but he had to ask everytime they passed him up. I had the french toast brioche, it was YUMMY with the carmelized bananas! My boyfriend had the corned hash and poached eggs, it was actually pretty healthy! Barley, beets and celery roots mixed in there...pretty healthy and yummy! We also had the complimentary mini-muffins...great idea...muffins were dry and cold..I just ate one muffin top. Would I try it again, I'd try it for dinner, you always gotta give it a second chance right? I wasn't too impressed with the breakfast offerings. Calafia next door has WONDERFUL service and innovative delicious dishes!

I don't mind paying for good food.  But can any place justify $14 for eggs, bacon and toast?  Certainly not Mayfield!  No matter how organic and fluffy your scrambled eggs are, unless they come with truffles dusted on top (which these did not), eggs are eggs.  The bacon comes in slabs - one piece of bacon is probably the thickness of 4-5 "normal" pieces.  Which could have been great, seeing as I'm a bacon lover, but the amount of fat on these was horrifying (I am a "crispy" bacon fan, where most of the fat is fried away and not left chewy on the bacon). On the flip side, my husband ordered steak and eggs, and it was a perfectly lovely dish. Then we waited around for like 20 minutes until someone brought our check.  We kept looking around for our waiter and found him chit chatting at the bar, oblivious to our needs. Needless to say, this will not be our go-to breakfast cafe.  Calafia next door still wins hands down!

The husband and I had brunch here this afternoon.  This place was busy.  It's located in the Town & Country shopping center which is usually busy in general.  We discovered you can make reservations...something to remember for next time.  The wait time was 30 minutes but after waiting about 10 minutes the host apologetically noted to my husband that the tables inside were not emptying fast enough so he offered the outside seating.  Fortunately they have heating lamps outside so we accepted the outdoor seating option. On to the food... I had the brioche french toast with a side of the applewood smoked bacon.  The bacon reminded of pork belly and I love pork belly!  The french toast was very good as well.  I hope it's a regular item on their breakfast/brunch menu.   Hubby had a side of ham and the cottage potatoes.  He mentioned that he could do without the sauce that was poured over it and it was cut too thin...he won't be ordering that again.  As for the potatoes he thought it was tasty. One nice touch I did like was the complimentary pumpkin with chocolate chip muffin they served right before we ordered.  I also like how the menu lists the farms where the restaurant sourced their food. I think this is will be one of our regular places; the service was quick and food was delicious minus the ham.  I can't wait to go back and try items on their lunch or dinner menu.

I've been here twice for dinner and once for Mother's Day brunch and thoroughly enjoyed it every time. I highly recommend the roast chicken. There are a ton of servers, so service is usually very good. The servers are very knowledgeable about the menu if you have any questions. And if you go toward the end of the night, you might go home with a complimentary loaf of bread from the bakery next door!

I was recommended to come here by a friend, and at first was turned off by the bartender if that's what's she's called but the overall service from the server to the host to the manager was just on point and that's the kind of service a restaurant should give. The manager chris was great and so apologetic about the service we had received in the beginning and it wasn't that we were asking for anything out of it but was very thoughtful. the food was AMAZING, the rotisserie chicken is a must! The bread is to die for and the coffee is also a must after dinner! Great place to eat at! Definitely recommend coming here, i will come back for sure!

Not worth the high prices. Went there for lunch at 11:45am to avoid the lunch crowd.  Ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and smores.  They asked me if I wanted the pulled chicken toasted and I said yes and then they left it in the panini machine for 10 minutes and when they took it out it was burnt to a crisp.  The guy tried to give it to me and I asked for a non-toasted one which they ended up giving me.  Same thing happened to another girl while I was there.  For the price of $7.95, the sandwich wasn't worth it.  It was just okay.  Best thing about it was the bread.   The smores was great but still very high priced at $5.25. I would love to love this place but I just don't.  Every time I go I am disappointed and vow that it will be the last time.

Just ate here on St. Valentine's Day and had a very good experience.  They have made the best out of an otherwise drab location and the atmosphere is one of sitting inside a classed up screened in porch (but don't let that disuade you...it's actually pretty cool).  There is a nice bar and the tables with white linens and craft paper are a nice touch.  The crowd was more "in" than interesting, but the mood was enjoyable. Awesome fresh house-made bread was served first and it was outstanding.  We each ordered the chicken noodle soup which was a little bland.  I ordered the penne pasta with carmelized and whipped cauliflower and it was quite tasty, if also just a bit on the bland side.  It actually got better as the meal went on and had a chance to "marinate" in the pasta sauce I think.  My date had the "local sole" and my small taste of it was also positive. For dessert we ordered the 'smore which I would not recommend.  It was a designer take on a traditional plate- no top of graham cracker, only a roasted marshmellow.  It was also served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.  Something about the comination of the choc icecream and the dark choc 'smore filling wasn't right. I'd say the servie was outstanding and given a few more weeks of operation this place should have it's mark down.  I'd definitely like to pay them another visit for brunch or just to the bakery.  When it warms up, their expansive patio will be a great place for a drink.

Had a baked gnocci, portobello mushroom lunch.  Very yummy, and the very simple snap pea/radish salad which accompanied it was perfect.  The pasta was incredibly rich, so the salad was a perfect balance.  Was too full from lunch, so will have to return to try dessert. Service was excellent.

I'm surprised by the number of bad reviews for here.  My hubby and I dropped in for brunch, and enjoyed it.  I love how super airy and bright the place was, and it wasn't too crowded.  Our service was good - didn't hover, but was always there when we needed him.  The food, while good, was a little expensive for breakfast. My husband had the crab benedict - one of the best he's ever had.  (Best at the restaurant at The Lodge in Sonoma).  I had their crispy potatoes with gruyere cheese and bacon, and asked for some poached eggs on the side.  And the coffee was great too.

I went for dinner last week and it got so close to being great, but fell short. It has so much going for it. Great ambiance, the chef came to our table, we were offered a loaf of bread each when we left ( a very charming touch) but the meal itself was not on point. I want to love it. I would frequent a T&C restaurant that was extraordinary. But the chef has to taste the food more and the portions need to be a bit more generous. And, after seeing how many bread choices we had to choose from the free loaves at the end of the day, why didn't our bread basket reflect their baking talents? So, keep trying, but don't wait too long to get it right. Keep it simple and tasty and I'll keep coming back.

oh man we really had high hopes for the restaurant because the cafe is pretty good but what a let down!  i swear this place survives on location alone.  a repeat visit for brunch really proves to me that their food is just not that good. for dinner, we started with olives, ricotta gnocchi and then shared the pizza, porkchop, artic char, shortribs and duck.  i also had the onion garlic soup. we also shared asparagus and wilted greens.  the warm bread and soft butter was good!  the olives were warm and yummy as well.  i dont like gnocchi but theses were more like ricotta cheese balls.  so very mild.  the chicory and pancetta pizza was spicy! but the soup was a salt lick!  also the porkchop.  it was so so salty!!!  we had to send it back and the second one was also way too salty to eat! we came for brunch on a saturday afternoon and of course the place was packed.  the server recommended the french toast and the burger so the bf and i shared both.  the bloody marys were super slow to come out.  we ordered 3 which came first and then another 2 which came when we were well into our meal.  the bloody marys are good!  but there is very little alcohol in them onto the french toast.  man.  these are not good.  i tried to eat more than one piece but i think i grossed myself out.  for some reason the thick bread had been soaked in milk?  so every bite i took was like biting into a soggy sponge.  or what i would imagine that to be like.  yuck!  if they wanted to execute this correctly i think they would have needed to soak the bread in a mixture of eggs, milk, and condensed milk.  then give it a good go on the pan.  then maybe into the oven.   this would achieve a custardy centre and crispy outside.  their version sucks i think they need another yelp account for the bakery next door because that is not bad at all!  we ran into mayfield bakery for a quick bite.  i really shouldnt base my experience on a hungry outing but everything here was really good!  we went to the bakery only not the cafe. the green salad is anything but.  even though the name is less than descriptive, the flavors really pack a punch.  it had black cherries, proscuitto, cheese, and marcona almonds.  on the side there was a cherry balsamic and oil dressing.  delicious! i also had a ham and cheese pannini.  the gruyere and ham was perfect!   bf had the chicken sandwich and that was good too!

2 stars, not because it's awful, but because it fails in its aspirations as a fine dining restaurant. This could be greatly improved by improving their service. They have TOO many servers waiting each table, different people taking orders, dropping off dishes, refilling water, bringing your drink - it's distracting, confusing & of course, makes mistakes more common. The food quality is high, but it will miss the mark at times because it's not cooked to order. For example, their delicious burger won't be cooked the way that you asked. Or something you ask for isn't brought promptly, so that your meal & the mighty dollars you spend on it aren't memorable in the right way. At night, dining outdoors is made an ordeal because the light is so poor. It's not just my complaint, either, but my partners & our friends. So if you do chance it, you'd better be in an easygoing mood!

Yummy! I adored this place, although its pricey & I think they're having some growing pains (they just opened). It's located in Town & Country on Embarcadero & El Camino, opposite Peet's. I had brunch & dinner there before. The pastries are to die for. They separately drip coffees per order. I think they have their own coffee bean roasting company? If you get to Mayfield near closing time, they put out their wonderful breads for anyone to take home. In addition to asking if you want your water with or without gas (so Europe-y), they also have old-time-y drinks such as Creamsicles (orange Crush soda & ice cream) - a nice mix to me. The staff is excellent. The owners seem to pay a great attention to detail. The atmosphere is European, rustic & casual. It's noisy in there, but some people may like the "buzz." To mix it up a little more, there's an eclectic & a good choice of music playing in the background such as Rolling Stones Wild Horses.

Of course with their other 2 places in mind, I was expecting something great.  What we got was mediocre. Seriously bummed at this experience. They poured the wrong wine, the service was slow, 2 of 4 entrees had to be sent back because they were cold. They gave us a deal because they realized how terrible it was. The manager was very apologetic and generous. It was obvious that it's been happening a lot. Too bad. I might go back in a few months. There are plenty of good choices in the area so it might take me awhile to get back there. I do need to try the actual bakery. The stuff looked amazing through the window!

Great food, have had the Crab cake Benedict (a delicious English muffin split and toasted each half topped with a yummy crab cake and a perfectly poached egg. Hubby had the burger, perfectly cooked served on a yummy bun (maybe a brioche?) served with awesome onion rings. Daughter had the smokey chicken soup (awesome flavor) and the breakfast pizza with arugula and baked egg. Dessert was also great we had the apple tart with ice cream and the chocolate souffle cake. Both winners. Although I wish the apple tart was heated. Cappuccino's were also perfect. The only drawback in my mind is the place is a bit pricey. However the service, the food and the location have made this our new favorite brunch spot

I had to average out to three stars based on my eating experience at the Cafe but if it were about the bakery alone this would be a solid five stars. The food at the cafe is overpriced and greasy. The wonderfully chic and airy atmosphere was definitely at odds with my turkey sandwich that was oversaturated with mayo and left my hands greasy. The garlic fries were ok. Now the bread, on the other hand, is fantastic! Mayfield Bakery makes my favorite bread on the Peninsula. Their sourdough loaves and epi and the french breads have just the right amount of crusty chewiness and they taste divine with whipped butter. Skip the cafe and just get their bread!

customer service is great at this place.  They really do strive to make you feel important and well taken care of.  I have only been to this place twice, once for breakfast and second time for coffee. On my first visit, I thought the menu was a bit small.  My sister mentioned that they only recently reduced it.  Breakfast was really good, but what stood out the most was the coffee and bread. I would go again, but breakfast is a little bit pricey.  Then again, it is really good too.  So I guess it depends on how much you want to splurge.

We went for a weekday lunch.  I had high expectations of this restaurant and unfortunately it fell short on all accounts.   The service was uneven - our ice teas were late to the table and the waitress asked to refill them while they were 2/3rds filled but never came back when they were empty.  The bill took an extraordinary long time to arrive.  Also, we went with our 2 1/2 yr old and ordered off the kids menu along with our own main courses and the waitress did not warn us that the kids' pizza would be too much for our 2 yr old.  In fact, she robotically asked us if we wanted any sides.  No guidance offered. As for the food, the pizza wasn't crisp, but rather floppy and tasted more like bread, tomato and cheese than a pizza.  My steak sandwich was tough while my wife's pork sandwich was the best, but the mayonnaised-based condiment was too watery.  The coating on the onion rings was excessive and tasted like a weird cross between a donut and an Italian zeppoli. Given the high price of the meal, they did not deliver the value to justify it.

Stopped in for coffee and dessert one afternoon. Very uninviting, loud music, not a cozy comfortable place and pretty pricey - plain coffee @ $3.50, scones/croissants $7-10.00, and not memorable. The music was really unpleasant, and it was too cold to eat outside. I did have a quite lovely, tho' expensive dinner there a year ago.

The 30 minute wait for the table should have been the first clue that this meal was going to be full of waiting. Once we were seated, it was unclear who was our server.  The first server stopped by to take our drink order. Then a second server stop by and ask if we had ordered drinks, when the third server stopped by to ask if we had ordered drinks yet - we began to worry. Finally, we directly asked who was our server because lots of people ask about our order but nothing was appearing. We were told there were several people sharing the patio. I'm all for teamwork, but in this situation, it seemed like no one knew what was happening. During the course of the meal, I observed that the table next to us returned there bill because they were charged for several items not order. One of the servers was very apologetic and explained that he had accidentally combined orders for two tables on the patio. My chicken salad sandwich had yummy bread but was bland. The fritters were tasty, but not as described by the server. I could go on but you get the picture by now... Two hours after being seated, we finally just left some cash on the table for our meal and left. We'd still be waiting if change was going to be needed......

Went to Mayfield Cafe for lunch... and I was pretty excited having looked at the menu beforehand.  It sounded promising. I had the spaghetti with roasted beets and parsley pesto.  It was VERY oily, and lacked flavor and depth.   It really deserved 2 stars, but the pomegranate lemonade was refreshing with pomegranate seeds.  So, the additional start. Probably won't be back.

A solid Three The waiter was so disinterested in serving us. Missed being treated like a customer. Food was beautifully presented so this would be a good place to take people if they wanted a classy-looking place but did not care about flavor. Liked the pumpkin soup but the salad left a lot to be desired. Did like sitting outside, however. Wished they had better food.

My girlfriend and I had lunch at Mayfield Bakery today.  She had the burger which looked cooked well to order and she said it was tasty.  I had the yellowtail which was awesome.  Great service.  My complaint is that I was charged for two Arnold Palmers which is lemonade and iced tea.  Huh?  If I was told by the waiter, I would not have any complaints.  I would have followed up my Arnold Palmer with an iced tea topper.  $6.50 for two AP's?  I think not!  These are the little things that irritate me.  I will think twice about coming back to Mayfield Bakery because there are just way too many solid options to dine in the Palo Alto Bay Area.  Happy Eating....

Would need higher if not so pricey.  $7 for a sparkling water?  Nice pulled chicken and brie sandwich on perfect sourdough roll.  But after first half of sandwich,  it seemed too oily.  Tart thin pickle slices.  All this for $20 before tip.  The food came quickly but had to ask for the check and for it to be re-run.  Nice open big windows, but pricey for the experience.

We've been to Mayfield a dozen times now.  It's an exceptional option on the peninsula for gourmet, organic, local food that works with kids.   Atmosphere is great with a high ceilinged great room and a big outdoor patio.  Lots of light and a nice warm atmosphere.   It's more comfort food than anything else and the baked goods are exceptional.   It's a bit more expensive than average but well worth it in terms of the quality of ingredients and wonderfully consistent taste.   Service is good no great but most mistakes are driven by being overly busy rather than attitude.   A favorite of ours for family dinners and brunches.

Excellent food and service. I went here on a Monday for lunch and got the $18 special, which seems like a pretty good deal. The Curry Chicken was superb, very tasty flavors and the texture was pretty phenomenal with a crisp skin and rich, moist meat. The Endive Salad was good, well put together with subtle flavor pairings. Impressed.

This review is for the small attached cafe/bakery. I keep giving this place another try, as I prefer their coffee over Peets. But the service here is consistently reeeaaally slow. They had 6 people working behind the counter, and only 2 people being served in front of me, but it took them more than 20mins to make me a cappuccino... The breads here are good, but I think they could do with a better selection of pastries/cakes.

Very fresh & light... I had an excellent fish dish with spring onions & poatoes. Also very fresh  nicely composed. I had some lovely Alsace chardonnay with that which was exactly as our helpful waiter described it. Also loved my Meyer lemon cheesecake dessert. Very light and not too sweet or tart, for that matter. All in all, we were very happy and glad to have this new addition to our Palo Alto restaurant choices. We will be back!

Nancy of Mayfield Bakery, made our wedding cake. She did a fantastic job on in, and was awesome to deal with.  She let us come in twice for samples so that we could get the flavor to be just what we were looking for, and she talked for an hour with my then-fiancee, her mom, and me about what we wanted it to look like, and she was not only patient, but also fun & nice to talk with. She also delivered and set it up herself at our wedding site in the hills near la honda, and it looked (& tasted) perfect.  Definitely go here for your wedding cake--by far the best option on the peninsula

I frequent the bakery much more often than the restaurant, which always has a long wait. Usually my sister and mother get a large cup of coffee and cappuccino, with 2 sandwiches. It's always the chicken with something else. Chicken sandwich and turkey, chicken sandwich and roast beef, chicken sandwich and veggie sandwich. Ma raves about the sandwiches, but I think they're better re-toasted the next day. Super crunchy and juicy. We always buy the morning bun and brown sugar biscuit for breakfast the next day, but its always gone before the evening. (by yours truly)

This review is more like a 3.5 stars.  The service was a little slow in the beginning, it took a while for them to take our order and it wasn't really that busy.  Overall nice atmosphere albeit a little cold inside.  The food was excellent. The butternut squash soup is a must have.  For our main dish we had the Tagliarini and Grilled Dorade Filet with lentils.  Both were excellent.

Mayfiend Bakery and Cafe assembles dishes the same way Family Guy writes their jokes: idea balls and manatees.  They take a bunch of things that are good on their own and grill or saute them together to come up with things like banana bread french toast, sour creak pancakes, and breakfast pizzas.  Then again, they could be coming up with their recipes the other way Family Guy is "inspired" to write jokes.....

there should be more yelp love for this place! the folks and i stumbled across this new restaurant when strolling around town and country village. we originally wanted a light snack but that turned into a full on dinner. i started with the arugula and strawberry salad and enjoyed it very much followed by the roasted chicken which was good but i've had better. my dad had the burger and a side of fries -- it looked really good. my mom ordered the whole roasted branzino fish which was the table favorite. i would definitely order this entree again. i love the epi levain bread too. make sure to ask for some olive oil with your bread otherwise they just give you butter. i also love their bakery next door -- so many cookies,  pastries and breads to choose from!

People who is running a restaurant, they should think that not only diners would like to have a great cozy, nice ambience but also great foods.  If I'm paying $11++ for 2 eggs for a meal, make sure that the egg is something special or done extraordinarily well!  Not some eggs I could make in my own kitchen. It's a joke to dine in a place where you pay for the ambience only and not having at least good food.  I give 1 star for the bread.

I haven't tried the restaurant yet, but wanted to compliment the staff at the adjacent bakery/coffee shop.  I went there the other day and had a delicious cafe au lait, served in a bowl, and also had a huckleberry muffin.  I returned another day and purchased a rustic-looking sourdough baguette for dinner.  The bread was a tad too hard (perhaps overbaked a bit), but what a fantastic crust..really enjoyed this baguette.  A nice change from Acme bread.  The staff is very pleasant and knowledgeable.  This is going to be my new favorite coffee place!

Good food, as usual, although tonight we had the world's most aggressive waiter who pushed the most expensive bottle of wine on the menu (which we then bought), told us the appetizers that we'd ordered weren't the ones we ought to have (which we then changed), served me a fish main course that wasn't hot (but never asked if the meal was ok), and then - even though we'd spent a small fortune and the table next to us got the restaurant's signature loaf of bread to take home, didn't give us a loaf.  I think the meal would have been fine without hot and cold service, but the "sell it then abandon them" mentality was actively offensive.

I tried the S'more tart (see my photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ).  Big disappointment.  The chocolate part is good, however, the graham cracker crust is not crunchy enough, and doesn't provide enough of a crispy contrast with the chocolate.  Also, the marshmallow is not toasted enough - it has no "toasted flavor" to it, which is the whole point of a S'more.

Mayfield Bakery is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. We get fresh bread here several times a month just for snacking. I've only tried the restaurant once and was not disappointed. My husband and I came here for a birthday dinner. We ordered this amazing beer, Allagash curieux, that we hadn't seen on the menus in other restaurants. We wanted to try the burger and a lamb dish. Our waiter, Richard, was really friendly and helpful and asked us if we wanted it to come out as courses. We said sure and he brought the burger out first, served on two plates, each with their own condiments and sides. We were so full from the first "course" that we ended up taking most of the lamb home. As we left, we were offered a loaf of their leftover bread, which we enjoyed for most of the next week. ~$100 for two. Included two mains and our fancy beer ($33). We'll definitely be back!

I have lots a reasons to want to love this place; it's local, I love the Village Pub (same owner), comfortable decor, etc. Someone took me here for lunch and I had the meatballs and rigatoni and I thought the meal was good (would have been four stars.)  In fact, it was good enough that I took my daughter back for dinner that night.   My mistake. The restaurant is still going through an extended shake down period.  The place filled up by 7pm.  Our mussel appetizer came out quickly, but it was nothing special.  Then we waited, and waited and waited for our main course.  Finally the waitress told me the two? computer systems they use got one of our dinners lost/uncoordinated.  The result was our main courses showing up after 45 minutes.   The hamburger was good but a bit dry, the Arugula salad was OK. They were nice enough to comp us for the entree, and having an articulate and up front waitress was appreciated, but I would rather wait another 6 months until they get their act together.  BTW, as we were walking out, we overheard another waiter comping another table for some other misfire.

I don't get the Yelp reviews on this place?  This place is always packed so something must be right.  My advice is to sit at the counter so you can watch the cooks in the kitchen and appreciate how hard these guys work.  It is like like watching live Food Network.  We stopped in for lunch and the only seating was at the counter.  The bartender was great.  I had the special pre fixe consisting of a ceviche appetizer and duck confit salad on lentils.  Huge chocolate chip cookie for desert and all for $18.  The food was absolutely excellent.  My wife had a saiad and my daughter had a vegetarian sandwhich.  I gotta come back for dinner.  Seems like a total foodie stop.

The bread that came out was pretty hard. I didn't like that at all. But I DID order a steak salad, and that was amazing. The price came out to be like $18, but I think it was worth it. The place was pretty nice. Perfect for a brunch or lunch as it is located in a plaza. Parking can be a bit difficult to find though since it's a pretty packed area. I'm wondering now after reading all these mediocre reviews, was I just lucky or can I expect the same type of food next time?

Pleasant ambiance/vibe and nice service. Overall a high quality and charismatic cafe w/ white table cloths and candle-light. The food is simple and tasty - really a 3 stars place, but somehow I find myself rooting for the Mayfield Cafe. My wife and I went here for dinner on a Saturday night. We both liked our own dishes but were not blown away by each other's food.  I really liked my farm lettuce salad and arugula-pancetta pizza, but she was not into my pizza. She really liked the pumpkin soup and the squash pasta, but I thought they were just average - well prepared with high quality ingredients, but nothing to knock your socks off. We both agreed that the brussel sprouts were great, and the Mayfield fries (garlic and parm-reggiano) were tasty.   Based on my view of other tables and a glance at the open kitchen counter, next time I want to order the Niman Ranch burger and maybe the lamb cheeks. Overall, I would go again. I am glad they're here and I hope they make it.

We experienced a few service glitches---not very attentive on entry, post-seating, or while eating despite the restaurant being nearly empty at 3:15pm on a Sunday. The food was fine as was the ambience and noise level. Value was poor: one salad, one sandwich, three glasses of wine---$92 including tax and gratuity. There are better nearby options within Town & Country Village and on University and California Avenues.

This review is for brunch only. Things to like: the coffee is great. the ambience makes me feel like brunch in Brooklyn (and that is a very good thing) The food is good and carefully prepared. Cons: Too expensive for what it is. service is hit and miss.  Sometimes it is great!  Sometimes it is...chilly. This is where we always go for brunch with out of town guests.

Yum! I  had a great lunch here with a friend. As she noted, it is a place for "ladies who lunch" and I also saw a fair number of Stanford muckety-mucks there. The bakery made me think the bread would be the highlight of the meal (and it was quite good) but there were other attractions, namely corn soup, buttermilk dressing on my salad, and interesting homemade sodas. I do think most everything was conservative on the salt (which could be a plus or a minus, depending on who you are). I am looking forward to giving it another go, possibly for dinner!

This place is over rated and over priced.  I like the atmosphere and the staff but the food is not jiving with my taste buds.  I have come to place three times and the third time was not a charm.  It was the deciding factor and I will not be going back until they change the menu, recipes or cook.  I don't know which of the three makes the food taste gross but something has to change.  During my three visits I tried the french toast, hot cakes and pizza (during lunch).  Maybe I order the wrong food on the wrong day but who can mess up hot cakes?

If you can get a table, it's a nice place to have lunch outside on a sunny day. I had their steak sandwich, which was tasty. Service is a little slow, so make sure you're not in a hurry.  It also doesnt help that the parking lot at the Town & Country Village is full of tardhats running over curbs, going the wrong way, and backing up blindly into oncoming traffic.  Good luck finding a spot without yelling at somebody.

The food was fantastic. You don't get much for your money though portions are small, but the quality is out of this world. My boyfriend and I had dinner and they promptly seated us next to some very romantic lighting and the server was attentive. They didn't know much about their wine selection and definitively didn't a wine that went well with my food. Over all great place for a fancy expensive dinner for something special.

Skip it.  I've been here several times and I can't find one dish on their menu that I really like.  On top of that it's a pretty expensive lunch option.  The outdoor dining is right in the middle of a busy parking lot next to a big intersection.  The one thing I can commend them on is service, which is always outstanding.

Been here twice now, once for lunch and once for dinner.  Lunch was good.  The chicken, in particular, was memorable.  Really tender and tasty.  Came for dinner last night and was disappointed.  The menu is very limited and the roasted chicken was okay, but not great.  Served on beans with greens, it was a little dry and not flavorful.  Plus the prices are pretty high.  Bill was $50 for 2 pp, no drinks, no desserts.  Probably won't return, at least not for dinner.

I cannot recommend this place at all.  I have been coming to this place since it opened and it has consistently gotten worse each time.  I would avoid the crab cakes for sure--I got a bad case of food poisoning from them.   My last experience was not as dramatic but convinced me that I need to find a better place when in the Palo Alto area.  I ordered soup and salad, and requested it be served as an entree.  The "farm lettuces" was a past its prime red lettuce that was overdressed in oil, and it appeared it had been sitting for a while.  The corn soup was lukewarm and too sweet--as if sugar had been added.  My guess is that even though requested as an entree, it was prepared as an appetizer and left to sit while the other entrees were prepared.   I had planned on eating some of my husband's roast chicken, but it was too undercooked for my tastes--one piece was pink and dripping blood. My son's pricey hamburger was in his words, "forgettable."   Then it came time for dessert.  My son ordered mixed berries with strawbery sorbet.  The sorbet was fine, the mixed berries, the first item listed, were actually three underipe blackberries, more of a garnish than part of the dessert.  My panna cotta was tasty, but runny.  My husband ordered coffee with dessert, but it was not served until several minutes after dessert was finished, so he ended up gulping it while the rest of us waited to leave.   They insist on having flowers with mostly eucalyptus leaves added in, which are highly allergenic for many people.  It seems they have a huge turnover, every time I have been, I notice an entire new set of waiters, even if in the same time frame as the previous visit.  What seemed to be a promising place for fresh, sustainable food has become an expensive disappointment.

I don't know why I've been here so many times.  I've been here maybe 10 times, and the first few times I had a great experience.  The food tasty enough to justify the high prices, the service was passable, and the atmosphere was great.  However, the past few times I've gone for brunch have been absolutely atrocious.  Once, I ordered a lemon pancake, and had to send it back because the outside was burned and the inside was not cooked at all.   The cook stormed out to our table and said that the pancake was supposed to be like that (I've had that pancake 3 other times before that, and they were NEVER like that.  Plus, any decent cook knows that the reason they turned out that way was because he cooked it on high heat.)  He agreed to recook it and of course it wasn't mushy on the inside.  It took him 25 minutes, though.  Another time, we were seated and had to wait 30 minutes for our water and coffee, and still didn't see our food after 1 hour.  We were so disgruntled, we upped and left.   If this place had consistent food and good service, I'd go back, but it's so inconsistent that I wouldn't recommend it.  My toddler loves drawing on  the tables, though.  What a waste of a great atmosphere.

I really want to like this place.  I really want to make this my neighborhood place to go.  But right now, I just can't.  It still feels too new, while next door at Calafia, they have their kinks worked out already.  We love the Village Pub - it is the place we love to go to as often as we can for consistently great food and service.  So we were so pleased that Mayfield opened up just a quick hop away.  We went there three times in the last two weeks - once for brunch and twice for dinner.  And I have to say, it was inconsistent.   For brunch, the prices were reasonable, but the portions were small.  However, it was interesting and flavorful and that was what brought us back for dinner.  We were giving them 3.5 stars for brunch. Dinner #1 was pretty good.  I had the bavette, which was meaty and flavorful and perfectly cooked and seasoned.  My husband's pasta with lamb cheeks looked beautiful, but it was barely warm when it was served.  I guess kitchen timing is still needing some work.  Our waiter was competent and checked in regularly.  Overall, this night was a 3 star night. Dinner #2 was a few nights later - and it was just ok.  The bread they brought out was dry and a bit overdone.  My hamburger was supposed to be cooked to chef's preference - which was medium-rare, but somehow ended up well well well done.  The kitchen did make it right - for which I am grateful.  But my other dining companion's meals were cooked properly and looked good.  Service tried, but wasn't consistent.  This night was a 1 star night.   We will return - and hopefully to more consistent service and better timed food.  At the great prices and location, we are hoping things greatly improve for Mayfield.

We came here after work on Sunday night..  It was a light crowd due to the Trick or Treating, but there was still some steady business.  We had excellent service.  We never had to ask for refills - our server, the manager, anyone walking by was quick to top off our drinks, even the water which was available on the table.   We had an amazing appetizer - the ricotta gnocchi.  The ricotta was amazing.  After that, our group ordered the steak, scallops and bass.  The steak was perfectly seasoned, cooked to a perfect medium rare and the mushroom sauce under it was to die for.  The house made sour dough was perfect for sopping up the extra sauce and juices! I can see where people could have a little sticker shock as the dinner menu is a little expensive, but it's worth it.  One might also think the portions are small, but the reality is that us Americans have inflated ideas of what a portion is supposed to be.  If you feel you need more food, a fresh side should fill you up.   The food is amazingly fresh.  The restaurant has their own farm that supplies a lot of their produce and they have close relationships with other local farms which means that the menu changes often and fresh is the focus. The ambiance is quite nice and there is heated outdoor seating as well.   In my opinion, this place is worth a visit!  Support local businesses who support local farmers..

After an early morning flight from AUS to SFO, Jim H. and I stopped in to a shopping center en route to San Jose (do you know the way?!?!) for a bite to eat. The time zone change and travel made us ready for some food and we decided we would just pick something we found. Boy, were we glad we stumbled upon this. I went for the (l)unch and Jim H. went for the br(eakfast) in our brunch outing. I had the Pulled Chicken Sandwich with Brie (I had them hold the Applewood Smoked Bacon) and the portion was heaping, so much so that I probably didn't need the side of fries the watier talked me into, but they were definitely as good as promised. Jim had the Soft Scrambled Eggs, Asparagus, Prosciutto, Meyer Lemon Nage and cleaned his plate. The food was fresh and well prepared. The atmosphere, while crowded, was not overly noisy. We didn't have reservations (suggest you make them if you plan to go here for brunch), so sat at the bar in some available seats...I would go back if I had the opportunity!

We went on a Thursday evening and were seated promptly.  The service was fine, attentive and speedy, and the environment was very nice, but the food was sub-standard.  I had a pasta dish which was edible, while my partner had salmon which tasted fishy.  Dessert called "warm chocolate cake" was a dried brownie filled with some chocolate syrup.  Neither were warm.  The coffee was the best part of the meal. We were very disappointed with the food and will not return.

Went there for brunch and couldn't wait to go after previewing the menu.  I still regret not getting their pastry assortment as a starter, but thought after the complimentary, fresh baked apple cinnamon bread, I didn't need more carbs.  The bread wasn't anything exceptional, but it was good.  I was expecting a sweet cinnamon roll type thing with pieces of apple cooked (something i'd expect from a hi end bakery), but it reminded me of pumpking bread - flat and dark orange/brown in color.  (i just removed a star) My coffee was ok.  My cup was sitting in a pool of coffee in the saucer.  totally sloppy.   My friend ordered the French omelet which she was very good.  It looked like a real french omelette. I had the beef hash which unexpectedly arrived on a bed of creamy polenta, barley and topped with arugula.  I loved it all, but think the menu shoulda mentioned these things.  The poached eggs were overcooked.  ( I just removed another star) I had a side of the cottage potatoes which were SO GOOD but i think they were overpriced.   The service really needs improvement.  We barely saw our waiter and when we tried to get more coffee, when i made eye contact with another server, he totally ignored me.  Then, they changed servers and the one hwo ignore me was our new server.  I'm glad our meal was over by then. I did go to the bakery next door in hopes of a strawberry tart like their website suggests you do, but they had NONE.  was totally bummed Will i go back?  yes, the entire menu looks good and I'll give it another try.  It's a nice airy space, busy, both indoor and out.  reminded of places in napa.

I really wanted to like this place - they were welcoming and even seated us early when we arrived ahead of our reservation. We were there on a Stanford football night so it was convenient and things started well. Server was friendly, bread was warm and flavorful and a pumpkin soup hit the spot. And they were kind enough to split the soup between my wife and me without being asked. But the $15 burger with onion rings was weak - the meat doesn't seem very tasty or high quality and it came with three small luke-warm onion rings. Fried food has to be served hot - I sense they make big batches of onion rings and warm them up a bit when they serve them - you just can't do that at a place charging these prices - you have to make each batch fresh. I've had better $5 burgers. We ordered some greens that were supposed to be kale but when they came they looked like wilted lettuce: pale, almost white, thin and limp. Asked the waiter and he said it's "Persian kale" - he offered to take them away but we kept them as we'd already eaten some. My wife's pork dish was marginally better, and our friends liked they're pizza and pasta but we won't go back. Ended up spending more than $150 for 4 people, with no desserts and only 1 glass of wine total for 1 person. It's too bad because the concept is good, seanonal local food, but execution could be better.

I came here for dinner with my husband and sister inlaw.  They both had the halibut which they said tasted good but the portions looked tiny.  I had the pork chop which had a great smoky flavor from the wood oven.  But overall, I just wasn't impressed with the food.  Since I Love the fries at Village pub, I ordered them here and they were ok but not the same.  Since we weren't that impressed with dinner, we skipped dessert.  Nothing on the menu sounded worthy of the calories, a smores and a tarte tatin maybe. I've also sampled a bunch of the items from the bakery when they first opened. My friend bought one of everything to sample.  Really, there was nothing very memorable that I would want to go back for.  I recall the cookies being decent but that was it.  The cakes looked and sounded good, but tasted only ok.   Go again?  Maybe to try their breakfast/brunch but probably not for dinner or pastries.

The food is pretty good.  Yes, the appetizers and the entries were quite tasty and the quality was all right.  I suppose when I really thought about the overall food quality and the price, that is where there was a disconnect for me.  Honestly, the food does seem overpriced for the quality or perhaps the preparation.  Now, I am NOT saying that the food is bad.  All I'm saying is that it does not seem priced accordingly or perhaps needs preparation that justifies the high price point?  Also, I think the service is so-so.  Again, I'm NOT saying that the service is bad but simply so-so which doesn't support the high price point.  I am impressed with the restaurant manager and his commitment to improving the customer experience but there is more room for improvement.

This place has tremendous potential, but is perhaps a victim of its over-popularity.  I went for Saturday brunch, and at 10AM there were already people spilling out the front door.  Despite reservation, it was a good ten-minute wait before we were seated.  The conversation was strained due to the VERY LOUD ambiant noise, and service slow probably due to under-staffing.  The breezy, bright atmosphere and sunny disposition failed to salvage the experience.  Not sure the food here is worth the stress of being admist an unruly crowd.

This review is only for the bakery, which is quite fantastic. They really really know how to make bread. By far my favorite is the wheat walnut - dark crusty bread with tons & tons of walnuts baked into it. The walnuts near the crust of the bread get a really fantastic toasted, aromatic taste with a nice crispness, and the walnuts baked inside are soft & chewy. The crust of the bread is hard, & the inside moist. Yummmmy. You will not be disappointed by it. Their pastries are quite delicious (the tarts are filled with a decadent amount of pastry cream that spills out when you cut into it), and they have homemade marshmellows (cool).

Came here for breakfast again and this time, I had the Breakfast Flatbread.  It had egg, potato slices, oregano, and arugula on it.  It wasn't what I expected and I regretted getting it.  Reminded me of pizza, not breakfast.  My husband had the Brioche French Toast with caramelized apples.  I thought the french toast was too dense.  I was expecting it to be light and fluffy.  The caramelized apples were pretty sweet so I barely had to use any syrup on the french toast.  To me, it was like dessert.  Based on the food we had this time, minus one star.

Grabbed a late brunch with a coworker here on a Saturday at 2:30 and it wasn't hard to find a table outside right next to the heater (it was a beautiful day, but still a little breezy). I had the Camino Breakfast which comes with 2 eggs, choice of bacon or ham, toast (sourdough or honey wheat), and cottage potatoes. Delicious! The eggs were perfectly seasoned and even tasted like there was some butter on them, they were so savory. Perfect with the honey wheat toast. I got the bacon, and they were 2 huge, very thick, slices - lottss of fatty parts though, so I didn't finish it all. I wish they offered sausage as an option. The best part of the dish had to be the potatoes. The cottage potatoes are 3 sticks, with a crunchier exterior and soft, mushy interior. Reminds me a little bit of the potato puffs at Gregoire, which I absolutely love. I would love to come back to try their salmon carpaccio - with a side of the cottage potatoes of course! Excellent service, great food, and reasonable prices. Like!

The service has been especially great- super attentive and your water glass never gets less than a third full without a refill.

A local favorite for yummy dinners. GREAT burger and they're not afraid to make it rare. The chicken is also a favorite. The wood-fired oven really adds to the flavor. If you're there late, they put out their neighboring bakery's bread for guests to take home--a really special treat and their bread is awesome! The setting is lovely--a really home and open room, which sets a nice tone.  If you like to people watch, the windows let you see the world go by, along w/the gorgeous surrounding trees, which add to the ambiance. You can bring your own wine for a $15 corkage, which w/tax & tip, can be a good deal. We weren't in love w/the breakfast, but if you like breakfasts that tend toward sweet vs. savory (like pancakes), you'll likely love it.  Admittedly, we've only tried breakfast one time, and returned to our favorite, so not a solid review point.

Ah Mayfield Bakery and Cafe, where to begin? I was first introduced to Mayfield when some family took me there for dinner.  I was unsure of what to expect as the name did not align with the decor and menu.   Right off the bat our table was graced with a basket of hot, fresh bread and a large bottle of purified water.  The bread smelled and tasted amazing!   Just to keep things simple I ordered the cheeseburger, but added a slice of bacon.  Let me just say that the slice of bacon was easily 3/16 of an inch thick (for those that can't picture it that's almost a quarter inch).  It seemed like a crispy piece of smoked, cured ham.  All of the other ingredients on the burger were equally exceptional, from the top quality ground beef (flavor for days) to the fresh produce piled on top.   Also, recommended to me was a bottle of Pliney the Elder.  If you haven't had this beer, it is certainly a must have.  Those that know Pliney will know that they are hard to come by.  Well, Mayfield has had it every time I've been there, which is quite some feat.  I'd say stop in to Mayfield for this alone. The second time I went to Mayfield I stopped in just for an appetizer and a Pliney, but the food was so good I ended up ordering one of each of the appetizers, about a half dozen Pliney's, a desert (salted caramel) and staying from 5 till after closing.  All in all it was a 6 hour food extravaganza.   I can tell you quite honestly that I enjoyed each and every dish that I had that night and I'll be back again soon for another round. The service at Mayfield leaves nothing to be desired.  They are friendly, courteous, and very knowledgeable about food and food pairings.  The chef even took some time during his dinner rush to fully explain one of the dishes to me, including drawing a diagram of where the particular cut of meat came from on the animal.  As a foodie this is something that I consider a major plus. If you would like an amazing meal in an enjoyable atmosphere I'd truly recommend Mayfield Bakery and Cafe.  The menu changes regularly to reflect what's seasonal and available locally.  I've never come across a dish here that I didn't like.

Yum yum yum on the iced americano (hi quality coffee and i actually find it less acidic that Peets.. comin' from a tea drinker, this is hi praise). Yum yum yum on the baked good sampling (if i don't order a cookie, but instead take a few crumbles off their over-burdened hands, doesn't the public service i provide mitigate any affect to my waistline?) Here's hoping... Yet to eat a meal here, but pleased on the components of my intermittent stop-ins.

Good iced mocha. The portions are rather small for the price. We got the blood orange pancakes with blood orange butter. Not enough blood oranges on top and the pancakes were a little cold and a little tough - not fluffy. There were not whole wheat either. We also got the baked egg with black beans, and avacado salsa. The egg yolk was not fully cooked (I don't like that) yet the menu didn't warn about it. It came with three tortillas. The good is that they brought us extra plates for sharing without us even asking. The service was prompt and polite.

I love this place, I can't believe it only has 3 stars! I have been coming here since it opened; since Pizza Antica (Santana Row, San Jose) is my favorite restaurant and it is owned by the same people, so I was all too excited to have this place open in my home town. The food is amazing, and the wine list is great. I have never ordered anything that was substandard. The ingredients are all very fresh and local which is great, and the dishes are amazing. I have had everything from scallops to roasted chicken to burgers and sandwiches here and everything has been wonderful. The wait staff is always friendly and very knowledgeable. The atmosphere is fresh and sophisticated, but still casual. The only negative comment I have is that the food often has 'fancy' names and it is a bit embarrassing to have to ask what things are. It always ends up being something absolutely delicious, though! All in all, Mayfield is a cozy place to get some great food!

This review is for the bakery only.  The sticky bun alone is worth 5 stars; however, the remaining pastries we tried were pretty ordinary.  Back to the sticky bun, the flavor will knock your socks off:  buttery, caramelly, sticky goodness in a roll that doesn't look like it could possibly be this good.  But it is!  The raspberry cheese Danish didn't have enough of either filling, and pastry texture didn't feel fresh.  The apple galette flavor was okay, but again, the pastry didn't seem fresh.  The dulce de leche cake was interesting, but I should have asked questions because the name is somewhat misleading:  It's really a chocolate cake with chocolate icing and dulce de leche filling. I loved the caramel filling, and the chocolate cake was moist.  The chocolate icing was not too sweet, so it's definitely meant to have all three components in the same bite.  $16.50 for all four pastries.

Mayfield served us quality, local, in season food that was tasty and catered to my strictly gluten free needs with advance notice.  to top it off, they made a special, simple yet delicious gluten free dessert for me, as a surprise!  I was well taken care of and the food was tasty.   I'd recommend it.  If you are gluten free, be sure to notify them in advance, when you make your reservation and possible the day before or early the day of.  I don't know if this is a necessity, but it is the way we did it and it worked well for us.

I wanted to come here because I had heard all the hype about this bakery, so I made a quick stop after yoga class on a Sunday morning.  The cafe looked way crowded; I just went into the bakery.  The assortment of breakfast pastries was good and they had some very tempting desserts on display as well.  I got a mini brioche for then and a gianduja for dessert later.  I wish I had also bought some bread because the loafs they had all looked amazing.They have a few tables in the bakery to sit at, but the small space doesn't allow patrons much personal space.

We had a nice dinner out on the patio - each had wine & split the steak special - a prime ribeye w/ a anchovy butter dab with roasted potatoes and a side of dressed pea sprouts - cooked MR as ordered & delicious.  The rustic bread served was wonderful - didn't try any other baked goods but desserts looked good too.  Staff was cordial & efficient, tho' our waiter dropped a carafe of water on the adjacent table & I didn't think it was handled as well or as smoothly as it should have been .  Speaking of water, you get your choice of still or sparkling for the table at no charge.  The steak was $35 - fully priced for sure - but fair for dinner.

After my last review, I was contacted by the manager and received a very sincere apology about not serving us complimentary bread with our brunch entrees at my last visit (after all, they are a bakery.) She even sent a complimentary certificate to return. I have to admit, this was 5 star quality for customer service and I really appreciate this attentiveness and sincerity to provide satisfaction for their customers. I will give them another chance and will write another updated review for next time.

Mayfield is consistently good.  Not great, but good.  Sometimes I walk out of the restaurant thinking that I spent a lot of money for a pretty normal-ish dinner, but it's Palo Alto, what can you do.  I also appreciate that it's quiet, so you can have a nice conversation without having to scream.  The bread is great...once I went to eat dinner kind of late, and they told us to take all the bread we wanted home.  Sweet!

Excellent service, that's the part we enjoyed the most at brunch this morning, regarding food, the poached eggs are done correctly, with a soft center, the arugula pizza is a little too healthy-there is hardly any trace of brie, but the dough is fresh and chewy, the danish in the pastry basket is pretty good, as well as the strawberry spread, coffee is on the light side, tea is individually brewed with loose leaves, fresh OJ.  Excellent service!

What a delightful place to have brunch! I love the ambiance of this restaurant- rustic meets refined- brown parchment covered tables and charming white plateware= yes please. I also really enjoy the pre-breakfast muffins, yum! The service here is great. I really like this breakfast flatbread they have (potato, cheese, and arugula with an egg), and their fresh OJ is awesome. If you enjoy a good breakfast pastery, this is a great place for that too. The only bad thing about this place is that the bacon is too thick (yes it is possible and it is a problem), but other than that I am very happy spending a morning here.

Sourdough bread is one of my greatest joys in life. Anywhere that has made a bit of a name for themselves for their bread I'll go check out. This place I saw by accident next to it's restaurant. I figured fresh bread, might as well try it.  I got a loaf of sourdough and a large round of sourdough.  As I was paying, after they offered to slice the loaf for me, I saw these little batards of sourdough with cranberries. They told me they were their best seller so i had to get one. When I got home and tried all 3 of them I was amazed.  SF has nothing on this little bakery.  All 3 were awe inspiring. This is my new go to place for bread.  I have not eaten at the restaurant so can't speak to that - but for the bakery it is excellent. Not a huge selection, but the bread they have is simply the best!

This is one of the BEST restaurants in Palo Alto! The food is consistently delicious and well prepared, and the service always gracious and attentive. The ingredients are locally sourced and always of the highest quality, so stop whining about the prices, people! You get what you pay for. If you want to save money then go to a diner that gets their meat and produce from Costco. I love how the menu changes to reflect what foods are truly at their peak during the changing seasons.

I would actually give it 4.5 stars.  Went for lunch with 2 girlfriends on a Wednesday.  Service was great - they gave us complimentary samples of soup and even switched out things so I could do the farmers market menu vegetarian style.  I had the special bean soup to start which was so fresh and full of great veggies.  The veg sandwich was awesome - its new on their menu and the gouda cheese was just perfect.  My friend really liked the burger.  Gave a 1/2 star off because the food took a little too long and although the soup was super fresh and hearty it wasn't super tasty.  Will definitely return, like that they have plenty of veg options.

The wife and I decided to skip the dreaded VD dinner and opted instead for brunch on Sunday morning. We chose Mayfield because we're fans of Village Pub and Spruce. To begin the decor is fantastic - clean and modern with exposed beams pained white. The floor looks like it is lightly colored reclaimed wood. The remaining cabinetry is pale birch with a marble countertop running the entire length of the restaurant. It happened to be only their second day serving brunch so there was an army of staff buzzing around taking care of our needs. Likewise the kitchen was filled to a busting point. While I won't be overly critical of the execution because it was opening weekend I found issues with the overall value for the meal. I ordered the Niman Ranch Pork Scrapple with Fried egg and maple syrup ($13.25). As our server explained - everything is a la carte - meaning no sides, garnish, etc. So I also ordered their Skillet Potatoes with smoked paprika ($3.25). The scrapple was three triangles arranged in the middle of the plate. The flavor was nice but it severely lacked its primary ingredient - pork. The eggs were prepared well and the maple syrup was a nice touch. Oh, well at least I ordered potatoes. But they were just blanched potatoes crisped up in the fryer and served in a cast iron skillet with four or five cloves of garlic. The cook forgot the smoked paprika. I inquired with our server and she offered to have more added to the potatoes but it wouldn't have improved the lackluster effort from the original design point - a little sauteed onions, peppers, anything would have helped these. The wife ordered the Breakfast Pizza ($14.75) which had prosciutto, brie, arugula and a baked egg. It looked gorgeous (I would hope so with all of the experience operating Pizza Anticas). The egg was slightly overcooked and the pizza was a little dry. They bake the pizza crust with the brie and egg and add the other components afterwards. It needed a sauce, mozzarella, ricotta or something to moisten the crust. It was a lot of crust - really good crust but still just bread. For beverages they offer still or sparkling water served in a glass bottle. The server did not explain if they're filtering it themselves. We chose still. I ordered a glass of milk ($3.25) and was served a very small juice glass. The wife started the meal with a mimosa ($7.25) and enjoyed it but they  didn't strain out the pulp from their fresh squeezed juice. She then had the Mayfield coffee ($3.50) from their extensive selection. It was quite satisfying (I think they're roasting their own coffee now?). It's attached to the bakery next door and I would have liked to sample some breads but the most expensive thing on the brunch menu is $18 for assorted breads. That seems a little pricey and too much product for only two people to consume. Overall, our check came to about $50 with tax and I was still hungry. I think the service and decor are outstanding. But truthfully, feel the meal lacked value. We've enjoyed the Peninsula Creamery for years and always leave satisfied. I would like to go back for lunch or dinner but am very reluctant after this mornings breakfast...

Love love love Mayfields!   For the bakery:  on weekdays, try to time your visit either before 9 45 or after ... 10 15?  Why?  Because that is when all the Paly kids get out for their mid morning break and storm Palo Alto Center.   I love their morning buns and their butter croissants, even more than Tartine in San Francisco.  They're smaller, more delicate, and more reminiscent of the croissants I had in France.  And never burned.  I asked for a non-burned one at Tartine and the chick told me that is their style.  Burned.  Anyway, that belongs in another review.  Mayfields also serves excellent coffee.  Also popular in my family are the chocolate croissants and the chocolate brioches, as well as all of their breads.  All!  Delicious!   For the restaurant:  yes, its kind of pricey.  But every now and then it is nice to splurge, and splurge I will.  Their weekend brunch menu is more extensive, but they do serve breakfast during the week.  My favorite is the El Camino Breakfast, but I've also had and loved the salmon tartare.  I did not enjoy their French Omelet, but if you like your eggs in a sour soupy thing with cheese, you might enjoy it.  For lunch, I've had their steak sandwich and their pulled pork sandwich, both were excellent.   And there you have it!

Came here for an early dinner. Had the burger and onion rings here.  Burger was OK and the onion rings was so salty and oily that I didn't enjoy it (gasp!), which in my book is almost an impossibility.  Also ordered  a side of grilled asparagus, which thankfully, was fabulous. My friend's chicken dish was pretty good, so may come back and give it another try.  Interestingly, you get to pick a loaf of bread to take home when you leave (they provide a basket of bread for you to choose from).  Took home the walnut loaf...sadly, to my disappointment, the bread was dry and not tasty at all.

The day we visited it was a great day to enjoy outdoor seating. The menu here is sophisticated, yet reasonably priced for those wanting organic & seasonal ingredients. We tried pumpkin risotto, steelhead trout that was cooked to perfection & a signature angus burger on a fresh bakery roll. After all, this is a bakery where fresh bread is baked daily. What wasn't on the menu - gluten-free options other than salad & fish.

We came here for Sunday brunch and had 8 in our party.  I had thought that perhaps the slow service was due to the place being busy or our large party size, but now reading other reviews it seems this has been a chronic issue.  Our waitress was friendly, but I believe it took about 20 minutes just to get our drinks.  Reading the menu, I had high hopes for the food with the all the local purveyors they get food from, but it was just okay.  In fact, I found my hash quite bland and actually added salt which I usually don't do since I like somewhat bland food.  I did like the interior of the place and walking around Town and Country after brunch was nice.  However, if you're short on time and are expecting stellar food, you may need to pass on this place.

We've been going to Mayfield since they opened and we like the seasonal menu, the fresh ingredients and how they make families welcome.  The outdoor seating on a summer evening is fantastic.  But our last few visits, the service has been severely lacking.  Not that we were neglected, just the opposite.  I can tell when I'm being pressured for a table turn, and believe me, I don't like that to start before I've got a menu and a glass of water in front of me.  Our waiter recited menu information like a robot, didn't hear my questions and just repeated items, barged in on conversations and grabbed plates off the table.  No sense of cuing whatsoever.  We'll be back, but the lousy service will be reflected in a low tip.  Its a sorry situation.

I just had lunch at the Mayfield Cafe with one new patron and two returning customers. Based on their enthusiastic comments, I was looking forward to a nice meal. We arrived just ahead of the lunch rush, were seated and given menus right away, but it took at least ten minutes to get water, and it was only because we asked for it. Same for the bread, which at least was tasty when it came still a little warm. When the water came, drinks were ordered and it was another ten minutes before those arrived. I ordered the turkey and gruyere on brioche sandwich and garlic fries. I asked if there was any condiment on the sandwich and was told it came with aioli on the side, but when it arrived, no aioli (which I would have used sparingly anyway, but the lack of it bothered me on principle). So the moisture on the sandwich came from the nice savory turkey, which was good, and the heaps of shredded iceberg lettuce stuffed alongside the turkey, which was bad. The water from the lettuce made my gruyere an unappealing texture and made that side of the sandwich's toasted brioche soggy. Good thing I was hungry and could eat quickly. The fries were served thin, frites-style, and had nice flavor, but were too long in the fryer so were heavier and oilier than they needed to be. The service was generally awkward, as staff came back many times to pour water from the on-table bottle (thus defeating the purpose of having an on-table bottle) and plates were removed after half the table was asked if they were done. The fries, which had largely remained uneaten, were removed without asking (which probably saved us from nibbling on something we weren't that enthusiastic about eating in the first place). Overall, the service needs to step up, especially to handle a busy PA lunch crowd, and the food needs a little more thought. The menu is promising, but the only satisfied customer at our lunch table was the one who got the Mayfield cobb salad, which was very attractive and had a generous portion of roasted chicken. The chicken smelled good enough to make me want to give this place one more try, but maybe they need a little more time to settle in. And I'll give them some credit for offering grape soda on the menu.

I really wanted to LOVE this place as I do the Village Pub. I was thinking it could be my up the street "quick fix" until I'm able to go there again. I have been there twice and feel it fell short both times. I'm not sure if it's because I was tough on them and held them to higher standards being owned by VP or what. First time I had a burger (it was okay) and second time I had a salad (just okay too), the service was not up to what I expected but still okay. I was looking for that VP "experience" with a cafe feel and didn't get it. I would go back but won't bring my high expectations with me.

The bakery is great ~ its baked goods are very nice. I shop there often. However, the kid behind the counter/case is another story ~~ dark circles under his eyes, hickeys all over his neck, a filthy white uniform and dirty finger nails. Button your shirt neck, wash your hands and get some sleep! I am surprised he was not sent home when he arrived. The restaurant ~~ Not memorable... I have eaten at Mayfield Cafe 4 times and I cannot remember what I had. I do remember that a chicken entree had to be returned 3 times because it was not cooked. We ended up ordering something else. Sending a dish back to the kitchen 3 times was too much. Obviously they cared not to fix the problem.

Review on the lamb shoulder entree offered during lunchtime. The dish comes with barley and some carrots and potato. Lamb shoulder isn't an expensive cut of meat so when I was ordering it I had my doubts and made sure to ask the wait staff about it. She assured me that it was very tender and delicious. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed and would have to say I've experienced better. The meat (or what was left ex-fat) was not tender. The barley accompaniment was a good idea but it didn't really deliver. The carrots and potato were a tad under cook (ok I am just being picky on this point). My entree aside, the bread that came with the meal was good artisan, sour dough. And the chicken in the chicken salad was juicy and flavorful. If they didnt brine it, then i would give that entree a thumbs up.

Just moved to Palo Alto from SF and I'm having a very difficult time finding good food at reasonable prices.  I had high hopes for this place as a casual place serving simple fresh food.  Yeah, so I was partly right--it was so fresh that we found a worm in one of the sandwiches.  To their credit, the manager immediately apologized and we did not pay for that dish.  But, that worm has become symbolic of every restaurant I've been to in Palo Alto--high prices and a mirage of "California cuisine" (whatever that means these days), with a worm in it. The bakery next door is a disaster as the service is a joke...waited fifteen minutes for a cup of coffee.  I'm not going back.

I have eaten at Mayfield now 5 times (at the bar, at a table with a large group, with and without kids).  I is consistently excellent food at reasonable prices.  The service is consistently excellent.  The menu's ingredients is all organic, sustainable, locally sourced.  They are a class act (not unlike their parent restaurant The Village Pub - also excellent but much more spendy and flashy).  Awesome all the way, you can wear jeans the wine list is small but good, what more can I say.  it is a must try. But mindful that it is like a cattle call in there before and after a Stanford game.

I decided to take myself to dessert at Mayfield Cafe around 8:45pm on a Monday night (they are open until 9:30 on weekdays).  The interior is an inviting one, with the comforting drone of the open kitchen.  I got the same bar seat that I had when I came for coffee and a croissant in September.  Joel the bartender helped me pick the creme brulee with madeleines, over the chocolate tart. The creme brulee - a very generous portion, certainly enough for two - was excellently smooth, not too sweet, and had a nice citrus flavor and a perfectly thin sugar crust.  The accompanying madeleines, however, were disappointingly dry!  I told Joel about this unfortunate situation, and he immediately said he'd try and get some fresh madeleines, which he did in about three minutes.  The replacements were much better, though not perfect.  Serving madeleines in a restaurant takes courage, because they're ideal right after baking and decent for a little while afterward, but dry madeleines are a travesty. A few minutes after that, the manager (I think?) brought over a plate with a cookie on it, proclaiming, "Here's a warm butterscotch cookie for you.  Again, we apologize for the madeleines."  Quite a surprise, and as it turns out, this cookie was everything you would want in a cookie: a little crisp around the edges, very chewy the rest of the way, and butterscotch/caramel-y without being cloying.  Eventually my coffee came, freshly brewed, and rounded out my dessert feast.  If Mayfield served little versions of their butterscotch cookies with the citrus creme brulee instead of the madeleines, I think that combination would be a knockout. In both of my visits to Mayfield, I've experienced consistency and timing issues with their food preparation and service.  But, in both visits they handled such errors with class and generosity, in addition to being unfailingly polite and friendly.  On Monday night I was only charged for the creme brulee, which was suitable since my coffee had been rather late.  But regardless, I still put down $12 on the $8.75 bill.  Immediately replacing the madeleines with fresher ones was already a very satisfactory move.  The butterscotch cookie was above and beyond what I would expect, but such little gestures are the sort of thing that really help a restaurant cultivate and maintain clientele, and it's heartening that Mayfield treats diners - even solo diners just stopping in for dessert - this way.  That attitude, along with the warm atmosphere, is why I'll keep returning.  The lunch and dinner menus are pricey and not very suitable for my budget, but the breakfast and dessert menus are more reasonable.

My husband and I ate breakfast here the other morning, and we've been trying to remember any other place we've ever ordered eggs for breakfast that served them with ONE piece of toast.  Somewhat ironic for a bakery, no?  The food was OK, but the tiny, thin slice of ham that accompanied my husband's eggs and the two slices of bacon (yes they were thick but also very fatty so not terribly appealing) served with mine made for a pretty skimpy meal.  We asked for sliced tomatoes instead of potatoes and were given three paper-thin slices.  We're not fans of those gigantic breakfasts a lot of restaurants offer, but this was ridiculous.  He ordered coffee and I had a small glass of juice, and the bill was about $40.00.   Now we understand why there were so few customers...

Likes: Uses sustainable and local ingredients, good bread, and ok menu selection. Good roasted chicken. Dislikes: high prices for small portions, especially the fish and pork, uninspired preparations, unimaginative dishes,  mediocre service, and an uncaring and unfriendly host and hostess. As a party of 4, we were seated in one of the worst tables in an empty restaurant. I asked for a booth and they selected the one that 30 minutes later was bombarded with the sun coming in through their transparent blinds. Never said a word before and glanced at 2 of us that were shading our eyes to see our partners.   They must of been saying "We'll teach them!" Has all the potential to be a good restaurant, but fails in its execution. No plans to return considering they lack any friendliness, food is expensive and nothing out of the ordinary.

I have driven by many times and always vowed to partake of their fare; sad to say I did yesterday.  Waiters were less than enthusiastic and mumbled instead of speaking directly to me.  Lots of leering by the staff; come on guys; there are a lot of pretty women in the world (I am not referring to me), stating their attributes and what you would do them in Spanish is inappropriate-lots of people speak Spanish and understand how crude and rude you are being.  Had the burger; good size, wonderful bun-too much pepper in the meat however.  The accompanying sauce contained too much horseradish for my taste (some may like it) and the onion rings were grease city.  Left those behind.  It truly is "the place to be seen" but some folks just enjoy a good burger .  The dessert menu lacks a lemon choice; but that is not unusual.  Got the wrong bill and had to ask for mine twice.  No guys you are not cool and suave; you are waiters.  Will not be back and will discourage anyone I hear wanting to try your fare.

I've tried Mayfield for both lunch and dinner and have the experience went from mediocre to bad.  Lunch just wasn't that delicious, but service was good. Dinner food was better, but it was a 2.5 hour long ordeal (no idea what happened to the food.)  I ordered a pizza and it was covered in garlic.  (Didn't mention there was garlic on it on the menu.) Not my favorite place.

I don't understand the majority of the reviews. Two or three stars only??? Based on my experience this place is first class. The service is good, the food is delicious and the atmosphere & decor is nice. What's wrong with the other Yelpers? What did they order? I cannot think of anything that is wrong with this place. So I went there yesterday for a Sunday brunch. At 1:30 pm we had to wait only 10 minutes to get an outdoor table. This is a very reasonable waiting time. The seating hostess and the waiter who served us were both very kind with us. The epi bread that they give to start with is excellent. Crispy outside and yeasty inside, just the way it should be. Their coffee selection is great. The cappuccino came in a European size not in a huge American cup. This is a plus for me. My husband ordered the breakfast pizza with prosciutto, brie, arugula, and egg. It was delicious. The egg in the middle was perfectly cooked as the yolk was still oozing. The pizza dough was thin, crispy but fluffy on the edge. I ordered the sour cream pancakes with blood orange butter and honey. I gave a small bite to my husband and we were both agreed that this was the best pancake we've ever had. It was so yummy, the first time in my life I managed to finish the three pieces on my plate. The sour cream which was in the pancake batter gave an excellent texture (and taste!) to the pancake. It was delicious and innovative. That's why I go to a restaurant... to try and eat something new. BTW, it was garnished with beautiful segments of sweet blood orange. The honey was also a very good idea, instead of the maple syrup, which would have been too strong with the delicate pancakes. Another nice touch was the carafe of water on the tables. I could refill my glass whenever I wanted without waiting for the waiter to come. I can't wait to go back and try their dinner items. Lovely place with great attention to details.

Alleluia! Finally there's great cafe fare and delicious coffee in Palo Alto. Oh...and the bread? Fall in love...it's absolutely worth it! My favorite bread used to be Acme's. But, I've fallen head over heels for Mayfield's. So...Here's my cred...I've lived all over the U.S. (San Francisco, New York City, Boston, Chicago, Nashville), and in Mexico, Japan, and London. I've traveled through Europe and eaten all manner of food from the incredible to the dismal. I'm a huge foodie, really a food snob as anyone who knows me will attest. How could I not be? I was carried to Caffe Trieste in Northbeach as an infant, when it first opened. That began it all. Every grownup around me cooked (men included) and all loved great food, and especially coffee. Huge family meals were the norm. We continue to be passionate about food. Here's the thing: they are an ardent bunch also, the purveyors at Mayfield's. From the managers to the waiters, from the bakery staff to the busboys everyone seems to love great food, bread and coffee, and to want to get it right!!! And they're doing it! Seven days ago at dinner service in the cafe was awesome. Food came quickly. All staff were exceedingly friendly and engaged. Three days ago at breakfast the same was true. And...I have cappuccino and pastries there almost daily and have to say that the bakery in particular shines! Before Mayfield's opened I was known to beg managers at my favorite "Le Pain Quotidien" in New York to convey to its owners that they just had to open a cafe in Silicon Valley because there weren't any good ones in a town where you'd expect at least half a dozen. I've been doing this to no avail for the past five years. But now I don't care because Mayfield's is here. Yay!

I visited Mayfield Bakery for the first time last week as a belated birthday brunch for my sister.  The food was excellent, particularly giving compliments to the breakfast/brunch pizza dishes.  Service was efficient, exceptional service by our waitress, Emily.  I was especially impressed by the manager (Derek, I believe?) who was very friendly and able to visit our table to see how food and service turnout was.   Next time around, I would like to revisit this restaurant for dinner to compare the quality of food with their breakfast/brunch menu.  Overall,  I'm very pleased with the food, service and overall quality of the Mayfield Bakery.

This past Sunday, I closed the door on my Mayfield forays. Having had a decent lunch there a couple months ago, I ventured back in...this time to the bakery. I was served a stale, soft biscotti with an off taste. Their solution was to give me three more of the same biscotti. These, they insisted had been baked the day before. Is anybody tasting the food? With the stale biscotti, I got them rolling their eyes at me. Not only that, but a patronizing lecture on what biscotti should taste like. (Ummmm??? I may have my failings, but not eating enough biscotti over the years is NOT one of them.) For an outfit that thinks they are "all that" I'd think that some crunchy delicious biscotti would be in order -- not to mention at least neutral service if not pleasant. My husband had a "morning bun" which didn't even hold a candle to La Farine's morning bun in Berkeley...not even close. In today's economy, I'll be looking for better value and a better overall experience.

My boyfriend and I was going to head over to Kirk's but decided to try this place out instead, big mistake that was. We entered and was seated immediately and was handed our menus. I was in the mood for a burger (hence Kirk's) so I got the burger. My boyfriend ordered a milkshake and chicken salad. First off, the milk shake - when people think milk shake, there is ice cream involved, not this one... It was frozen nonfat milk blended into more low fat milk. It was absolutely terrible, I took one sip because my boyfriend really didn't like it and I had to try for myself, it left a bad taste in my mouth to say the least. As for the burger, the burger came with pretty much nothing but lettuce and tomato. I even had to order the damned cheese for an additional cost, but I was what the heck, 12 bucks for a burger and a dollar per additional item on it, why not? Thinking to myself that it had better be worth it. The burger came out and I was disappointed. It came out with 3 onion rings... so much for a side of onion rings. The burger was cooked fine and all but I could have gotten something from Carl's Jr. and gotten the same (if not better) quality and would have paid much less. My boyfriend's chicken salad was not grilled breast on top of salad; it was chicken on a bone. Now, generally speaking, I'm not one to complain about another person's food, but when you're shelling out 12+ bucks a plate, the least they could have done is debone it. The total came out to be around 45 bucks for the two of us. So, there you have it. Now you might be wondering why I didn't give one star instead and it's solely because of the service we received. I definitely don't see myself coming back here.

I absolutely loved the two meals I've had here.  Last night my friends and I shared everything - and every single item we ordered was wonderful.   Arugula Peach Pecan Goat Cheese and Arugula Fig Prosciutto Almond Bleu Cheese salads to start - both fantastic Chanterelle Fondue - good but could have been more complex Sweet 100, Burrata, pesto pizza - possibly the best pizza I have had outside of Naples Ahi tuna with aioli on a bed of corn and bacon - we all lost our minds for this one Smoky eggplant - almost had a toasted marshmallow flavor Chocolate cake - good but was not warm Peach blackberry crisp - delicious and the perfect amount of dessert I really like the Niner Barbera they serve (also at Village Pub). It seems like it might be better for dinner or lunch than brunch from what folks are saying here.... but I will definitely try brunch sometime.

This review is for the bakery, not the restaurant (which I have not tried yet). The bakery is quite excellent, especially for bread.  They make the best baguette in palo alto - great crust with beautiful crumb (and slightly thicker than what you'll find at whole foods, which I like), and have a great selection of interesting breads. Pastries are good too, but the croissants are not quite as flaky as a real croissant should be.

Highly disappointing experience! Had been looking forward to brunch here and went with a group of friends. Location, ambiance and service were great -- it was the food that was bleh, especially since they pitch organic, locally grown ingredients. I've had better food for 1/2 the price as a local diner. We had: 1. Beef Hash with poached eggs -- dish came out cold, tasted insipid -- there was no flavor, just an odd sweetness. Sweet beef? Odd. 2. Frittata - excellent ingredients cooked poorly. A frittata should be gently cooked so that the eggs meld with the other ingredients. This one had been cooked in a too hot oven and the eggs were spongy... 3. Flatbread with organic egg -- Good flatbread with an egg that had been left too long in the oven. The whites were rubbery and the yolk had solidified. Yuck. It said with potatoes, but the potatoes were there in name only... 4. Chicken salad sandwich -- once again, lacking in flavor. The amount of chicken was generous, but bit stringy. The bread was very good. All in all, the only good things were the coffee, and the zucchini bread, that came free...

I've been here for brunch and dinner. Both times, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere just cannot be beat. Location is a bit unfortunate in that it is part of the Town & Country mall, so you have views of the parking lot... But they do light up an old tree at night so that you can look at sparkling lights instead. Beautiful touch. Pick up some bread from the bakery on your way out - I bought a great whole wheat baguette with walnuts and currants that had a delicious crunchy crust. I'm from Europe so I get excited about good bread, and this place definitely has it. If you're going for breakfast, order a latte. It comes in a gigantic soup cup and will make you swoon. All other items I have ordered - oatmeal with dried fruit and nuts, pumpkin soup, etc. have all been fantastic. Total comfort food without having to go the hamburger route.

This is mainly a review of the bakery as opposed to the restaurant.  Being parents of children of picky eaters, we know first hand that not all breads are created equal.  We started purchasing sliced bread from Mayfield about a year ago and have cycled through every single type they - all are winners for our kids.  While they are premium priced, given the quality of the bread, the size of the loaf and the fact that it is made on site, enough to justify the weekly purchase.  However, I still have a hard time convincing myself I need that $3.50 choc crossaint - no matter how delicious.

We came for dinner and overall enjoyed the food.  However, They seriously need to improve their kitchen operations in terms of precision, timeliness, and efficiency. The hamburger turned out near rare when we ordered for it to be cooked well done. An order of coffee after our meal (40 min just for the  coffee) isn't a reasonable time to wait. Unfortunately we probably won't come back.

I first visited Mayfield Cafe and Bakery last year in December... and have now frequented the restaurant twice since.  The food is great quality modern American food.   For breakfast, I have had the "Country Style Cured Beef Hash,   Two Poached Organic Eggs,  Polenta Sauce, Vegetables and Pearled Barley, Arugula" twice because it is a perfect savory breakfast/brunch item with the salty large chunks of hash, hearty barley and creamy polenta sauce/poached egg combination.  It definitely leaves you feeling satisfied for the rest of the morning/afternoon... and great for hangover food, btw.  The latte is served... in a BOWL, so another plus for this coffee lover.  Fresh baked madeleines at the end to compliment the meal. ^-^ Last night, my husband, brother-in-law, (both from Maryland) and I ventured to their winter crab feed.  Now, if you are not aware, Marylanders are very particular about their crabs (blue crabs, crab cakes)... there is no fooling them.  Since we are on the West Coast, the winter crab feed includes 2#'s of dungeoness crabs with fixin's per person.  My husband is allergic to shellfish (sad, but true), but my BIL and I really enjoyed the crab feed and fixin's.  Absolutely delicious!  We didn't touch the fixin's much (not because they didn't look delicious) only because, well, there's 2#'s of crab to get through!  I liked their spicy dipping oil and, though lemony and delicious with the other fixings, didn't really use the lemon aioli for the crab.  That may just be my preference as I think I'm just used to butter/lemon for my shellfish.  The only recommendations for the crab that night was: cook it in Old Bay (that's Marylanders for you) and maybe a hot towel at the end to allow you to wipe off afterwards (that's just me being a neat freak).  I really loved their dinner rolls (likely fresh from the bakery next door)... it was sweet, light, airy with a bit of egg-y quality to it. I have also been to their bakery for the fresh bread and (lovely surprise) salted chocolate caramel.  All in all, the quality of the food at the cafe and bakery is great.  There are good portions, interesting and surprisingly delicious combinations that has that fresh farm-to-table feel.  I'm sure people have complained about pricing, but I think it is to be expected for the high quality food/meals and the location (Town and Country in PA isn't exactly the cheapest place to go).  Though it is in T&C, the staff is always friendly and there is nothing pretentious about the cafe/bakery.  Compliments to the chefs, wait staff and managers for a great meal every time.

Not worth the hype. There is potential here but something is missing. Pros: Location, Decor, Service Cons: Over priced, Food selection I've heard a lot about this place so I took my husband for an early weekend brunch. Of course, being there at 10:30am, there was no wait. We ordered coffee and our waitress told us it'll take 5 minutes because it is brewed fresh. Given that we love our java, it was worth the wait. We didn't realize that a pot (small size, 2 cups each person) of regular coffee was $7. Since the coffee was great, we were expecting the food to be the same. It was quite difficult to choose an item to order. We generally don't eat sweets for breakfast or much dairy. Majority of the items had sour cream, creme-fraiche, yogurt, or cheese. There were only a few items that sounded okay - hamburger, cobb salad, turkey brioche, or an $18 (!!) pastry platter. At 10:30am, my palate was only craving for a pastry so I went for that pastry platter (since I had a good experience at the bakery next door a week ago). My husband ordered a hamburger ($11 Niman Ranch) that included onion rings with a side order of fries. The hamburger was good but his onion rings came cold. As for my pastry platter, I was only able to eat one and it wasn't too bad. For the 7 that I didn't finish, I asked for a take out box. When I opened the box later at home, only 6 of them were in there. I was picking on one of the pastries while I was waiting for my husband to finish his burger. I guess their wait staff  tossed out the pastry I picked at. Granted it was an $18 of pastries, I was not a happy camper. Our brunch bill came to $51 including tax+tip. The coffee and hamburger was good but the pastry platter was not worth it.

I've been to Mayfield three times for lunch and once for take out. The first meal was excellent and I thought that the restaurant was a great addition to the Town and Country shopping center. Since then, each time I've visited, the experience has been worse than before, primarily because of poor service. The restaurant can be quite loud and the tables are close to each other. But, the decor is pleasant and attractive. The food is the strong point. The burger is excellent, much like what the Village Pub serves, with high quality meat. The flatbread with smoked salmon is also very good. The vegetables sides tend to be tasty. I found the cobb salad fine. The turkey sandwich on brioche is pretty average and uninteresting. The last time that we ate in the restaurant the server forgot to place the food order with the kitchen, so it took 25 minutes to get any food. Even after that mistake, my cappuccino was served lukewarm, about 10 minutes after we finished our dessert. Our last experience was an attempt for take out at dinner time. We ordered a soup, a salad, a bruschetta and two vegetable sides. The bartender said that it would take 12 minutes. When I returned at that time, he said the order would be another 4 minutes. Later he claimed that order was being boxed although it was another 10 minutes before any food arrived. In all, it took 35 minutes for a bunch of appetizers. When I asked what the problem was, he made an incomprehensible noise but no apology. Mayfield could be a very good restaurant and a welcome addition to our usual rotation of local restaurants but the service is so bad that it may not be worth the trouble.

Had an early brunch on a Saturday.  No problem getting a table.  They need to serve bread or some kind of baked good when you sit down.  It's a bakery that doesn't showcase that that is what it is.  Food was pretty good but it lacked in amount.  Coffee was great but a bit pricey.  Our server was definitely new.  He really tried to be helpful but lacked that attentiveness I would expect from a place with barely half the tables being full.  It was pricey for the breakfast you get.  Don't think I'll be going back.

I try to write reviews when I don't agree with the average rating.  We came for brunch on Saturday.  I found Mayfield to be a great brunch place.  Great coffee.  We ordered French toast and the beef hash.  Both were delicious.  They also have very tasty french fries with a unique sprinkling of parmesan cheese, chili flakes and a ranch dip.  The menu has a local organic yet American comfort food feeling reminiscent of Serpentine in the City.  They are well staffed and service was excellent.  Frequent coffee refills.  The price of main dishes on average is about $13, which is a little higher than your basic breakfast place.

Warm lighting, happy vibe, wonderful food, superior service. Free bread when you leave which is a bummer for us celiac people, but fun for the family. The chicken and the warm olive appetizer and any soup and good (a little buttery) sides. New favorite place. How can anyone say no a restaurant in a vintage California shopping center and year round christmas lights?

Been there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Fresh ingredients, innovative cooking, good service.  Can be noisy at night, and locals bring their children.  but oh well, it's such an excellent restaurant, I just ignore the little rug-rats!  I enjoy the setting, too - high, big-beamed ceilings, big ole oak trees right outside the window.  But the food is the big draw....

This was a business dinner for 9 people.  We had a reservation for 7.  We were not seated until 7:30, which was inconvenient though not that big of a deal   Once seated, the service was horrible.  They did not bring drinks that were repeatedly ordered, the waiter disappeared for long periods of time, and was generally inattentive.  Again, irritating but not a huge problem.  Several people in our party ordered the clams fisherman's style based on the waiter's recommendation.  This dish was weirdly spicy, like to the point of causing illness by all three of the people who ordered it.  This was odd because neither the waiter nor the menu described it as spicy in any way.  There were giant clumps of red pepper flakes lodged inside the clams like little landmines so that if you got one that had that you literally would cough until you gagged.  All of us like spicy food and all of us were affected the same way.  I haven't had an experience like that with a restaurant before.  I have to think that there was an error in the kitchen somehow because no one would eat that on purpose. The fact that the waiter had failed to bring water and drinks was now a problem.  Three of the party were coughing and no one had water or soda or anything to drink. When the waiter eventually came back and asked how we were doing, we all informed him that there was something wrong with that dish he took it away and offered something else but he had been so slow to show up that now everyone else was already done so there was really no point, plus the whole dinner was running late since they seated us late.  So that point the cumulative effect of the errors -- late start, no drinks, ridiculously spicy food, poor service -- all came together to produce a crap experience.   The waiter took the clams off the bill but it was a business dinner that left three people gasping and coughing.  The $60 was not the issue. I should note that this was incredibly expensive too. My recommendation is go to Calafia.  It's worth the wait to avoid this.

More like a 2.5.  I've been here about 5 times just not impressed.  Food is mediocre, uncreative and service was spotty.  I also bit into an olive pit in the Tuna Nicoise Salad and thought I cracked my tooth.  Management apologized and sent a gift certificate.

Awesome Breakfast!  The Camino is just perfect... Yogurt and fruit breakfast is amazing as well with fruit I'd never imagine served in a restaurant breakfast... and more than I could possibly eat!  We've also had their omelet which was the best we've ever eaten.  We always make a point to eat here when we visit Stanford Hospital for medical trips... crave it when we're away.  Pricey but well worth it for the BF and organic food.  Best ever!

This review is for Mayfield's brunch experience. I reluctantly held a star hostage based on price, but the rest (food, ambiance, service) is a solid 5. Try the french omelet with Fontina cheese or the fruit and yogurt with fresh sourdough bread and a cappuccino... Back to basics, so simple and tasty.

I made reservations for a 5:45pm dinner on a Saturday night with the expectation that we'd be seated promptly and given a reasonably good table while the regular dinner crowd came in throughout the evening. The food was excellent and well worth coming back for, and the full staff were hard working and pleasant, but I'd think twice about my approach on a return visit. Don't make my mistakes: 1. Check the Stanford football schedule.   The entry was packed with football fans in a frenzy to squeeze in dinner before a 7pm game.   It was more like a beer garden crowd with one fan addressing the restaurant with a loud announcement on behalf of his team.  Maybe it was more like a cheer ("Who here at this restaurant is a Stanford fan?!  We're going to win tonight!  Are you with me?!). 2. Have an even number of people in your party.  There were five people in my party which resulted in me being placed in the aisle on the end of a table with about 10 inches between the back of my chair and the chair behind me.  I think I was grazed or bumped no less than 20 times--by staff and patrons--and my long coat was stepped on a couple times too (before the hostess came over to rescue it).  I attempted to scoot in my chair or angle in such a way that I could ignore the constant reminders of my plight, but nothing helped. Room for improvement on their part: 1. They should be given a medal of valor for not losing their $%^# at the hostess stand with the football frenzy, but they need to seat people based on their reservation and time of check in, and not accommodate large parties without a reservation.  I'm not sure what caused the big stack up but something went a bit haywire. 2. Stagger the tables so wait staff and patrons can zig zag their way through the aisle instead of being forced through a virtual birth canal with two parallel chairs nearly back to back. Too late for them to remodel so they need to get creative about their use of space. 3. Pay attention to the diners who aren't in a hurry to get to a football game.  Our waiter was relieved to learn we weren't planning to go to the game.  Then he was so slow in getting our drink order we were ready to order dinner by the time he showed up.  He also forgot one of the side orders we asked for, he brought one person's wine early when they asked for it to be brought with the meal, he brought coffee without cream or sugar and took so long to come back with cream, the coffee started to cool off by the time he got back. 4. Don't crank the music up to the point that it's difficult to hear.  Just when the peak noise level dropped with the exodus of the confluence of football fans, the staff turned up the volume on the music (as if to say "we're done"). But believe me, I'll go back for the food and what I'm sure will be more attentive service if I have a reservation for an even number of people on a non-football game night.

Good quality, reasonably healthy food. But very overpriced. I don't think they could get away with charging these prices in very many places outside of Palo Alto. Decent selection and focus on organics is appreciated. But quantity was half what it should have been for twice the price. Unimpressed. In the end they seem fairly typical in relying on sugar, fats & salt to improve taste. Presentation and service were very good. But those things are simply not important to me... For some people, I'm sure 4 or 5 stars seems warranted. But my standards are just higher than that...

I am as well surprised by the low stars most folks have given this fabulous brunch place! Note: this review is only for brunch on weekends. Usually this place is really busy but in all the times I've been there we've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a table, usually we make an opentable reservation an it's all good! My husband and I r prettymuh regulars here so we've tries just about everything on the brunch menu and never been dissapointed ! everytime, they always start u off with some baked goods from their bakery next door usually yummy. Off the brunch menu, a must is thru spicy bloody Mary easily the beat I've ever had !! Rimed with celery salt accompanying with pickled green bean, olive and pearl onion the best!! U can ask for extra garnish if you're a fanatic like I am about pulled goods and bloody marys... Their espresso drinks come in large bowl size cups and yummy also. Onto the food... The burger is very good, tender juicy and flavorful without the grease. Comes with onion rigs too. All the food they use is locally raises or grown so it makes the food very drag tasting and healthy.  The meat is not frozen ground beef!  The Chicken Brie sandwich is he most worth it item in my opinion,... Girls just eat half and half for dinner ! Very good creamy and fresh with added bacon flavor. My favorite is the camino breakfast because the eggs taste so fresh and the potatoes taste lol fries mash potatoes! The ham or bacon it comes with is usually satisfying as well. The flatbreada are usually good ms very unique flavors ms toppings and the hash is suprisingly healthy because they cool it with barley, not the canned hash stuff.  The French toast is decent but nothing special.

I was totally disappointed with the service I received and the food does not seem to be good value. I've been twice. I went right after they opened and the food seemed promising - the soup was great - but the service was off, with missed timings, missing spoons and a disappearing waiter. the next time the food wasn't nearly as good and the service was just as bad, if not worse. I ordered a salad and entree. my order was posted and then the table next to me ordered. their entire order arrived 10 minutes before mine. the kitchen wasn't busy at all. I asked why my salad hadn't arrived and was told they would look into it. a few minutes later my salad and entree arrived together. the entree was lukewarm and not very good. later, a manager came out, tapped me on my shoulder but before saying anything to me, they talked with someone else who flagged them down. when he came back out to talk with me, I was nearly finished eating so the offer to remake the salad was pointless.  finally, when I was walking out the door they shouted at me to take some bread home because they forgot to offer me any during the meal.

After a friend recommended we try this place, we went today for lunch.  It had a pretty good crowd at 1:30 pm, about 1/2 full, but the MUSIC was awful, lots of hard rock and screaming.  Most of the crowd were in their 40's to 60's.  It is not a teenage place.  Weirdest music given the type of clientele.  Then we sat down.  Very very noisy to talk to each other.  We had to shout the entire time.  The chairs (ice cream parlor style) are terribly uncomfortable. I opted to then sit on the soft leather bench and let my partner sit on the hard chair. He's a nice guy!  White table cloths with brown butcher paper on the top.  They offered regular or sparkling water ay no extra charge and placed a nice chilled jug of it on the table.  Great idea!  The waiter was very nice and attentive.  The bread they served was hard as a ROCK.  I scratched the roof of my mouth on the hard crust.  Butter was nicely served in a small little dish.  OK so far we've got bread and water.  Menu was very pricey.  I ordered the sweet gem lettuces with deviled eggs salad. Only ONE lettuce came and a buttermilk dressing for $11.00.   It had 5 lettuce leaves of romaine, and one hard boiled egg split in half with deviled egg filling. Fine if you're paying $4.00 but ELEVEN BUCKS for that?  Give me an  Effing break.  A total rip off.  Oh, I forgot ... yes it had croutons on it.  $11.00!!!!!  My friend had the Cobb Salad which came with chopped romaine lettuce, crumbled bleu cheese, bacon bits and 1/3 of a chicken with the bones on it.  The chicken was very good, soft and tenter, but it too was $16.00.  Then we ordered the side dish of flash fried brussel sprouts.  $4.50.  A fair price for those.  Sauteed crispy and pretty darn good.  It was $32.80 and then tip $5.00 made it almost $40.00 for almost nothing.  We were hungry when we left.

My husband and I have eaten here four times since they've open. The first time we had "brunch" and the food was quite good, nice flavors. I had the black bean dish which was unique and hubby had a turkey provolone sandwich, basically a grilled cheese sandwich for grown-ups. The service was marginable but since they had just opened we let it slide. Thought the prices were a bit high for what we received. Our second visit was for dinner with another couple. Needless to say we were ALL disappointed with the menu, the service and the price. The selection was sparse, the food we ordered was very mediocre and the price was shockingly high. We only had pizza, which was rather icky, roasted chicken which was dull and the Niemen burger which was only okay and very small. My husband likes this place so he had talked me into taking him here twice since our dinner for that turkey sandwich he likes. One time they ran out?!?! and the last time they had completely forgotten about us all together. Our waitress was aloof and indignant about our meal. The menu hasn't changed since they opened and to me they have nothing to offer. I will never eat here again. My husband still likes the turkey sandwich so he's on his own...The only thing they have going for them is the warm bread they serve on the table.

I like Mayfield Bakery, I've been to the bakery a few times but not the cafe. I love their salads. They use fresh and seasonal ingredients. Their baked goods are pretty good. I love their coffee, they home make their marshmallows and you can order any drink with a marshmallow (makes a really sweet last sip). Their sandwiches are pretty good.

Mayfield cafe was a big dissapointment this morning. Lots of empty tables inside and out but they still made us wait 10 minutes just to get seated. Then, ordered pached eggs and sourdough. Pretty simple order. Toast was stale, and cold. Chewy. Eggs were so overcooked as to be completely hard. No liquid center at all. Coffee rarely refilled. Service was mediocre. Very disappointing overall. I have been once before and it was very good. Haven't decided if it's worth giving another chance today was so bad.

Had lunch here with 3 friends and we were uniformly disappointed.  The food is heavy and fatty, and the prices are quite high for lunch.  The noise level, even at 1:30 in the afternoon, was annyoing.  To make it a really memorable experience, the waitress had an attitudeand she could barely find the time to take our order or pick up the card at the end of the meal.  None of us will return.

This was my second time eating at the restaurant. There is clearly an issue with over salting everything. I actually eat quite a bit of salt but when you have to send back a side of veggies because they are too salty, you got problems.  The grilled sardine appetizer was served room temp and seemed way too greasy. The onion rings are horrible, greasy and sooo salty that my 11 year old wouldn't eat them.  The only thing good about the place is the bread that comes from the bakery next door and the meat dishes. Though again, a bit on the salty side. We had the roasted chicken and a burger at our table. The burger got a thumbs up as did the chicken, though it was too salty. My nephew complained that his pasta was too salty.   All in all, they need to have a talk with their chef about turning down the salt. Oh, lastly though the place has a lovely feel, you can't hear a word said by anyone at your table because the accoustics are so bad.

So we have been to Mayfield about four times since it opened and it has progressively gone down hill. Today was the worst.  We got there around 2:30 pm. It took about 10-15 minutes for someone to come over to our table.  The cafe was not that busy. When the waiter came and took our drink order, it was another 10 plus minutes before we saw our drinks. It wasn't like it was busy. I desperately wanted  a chicken salad sandwich but they were out of chicken salad. Really? They specialize in brined chicken and you can order a chicken to take home. They couldn't make some more chicken salad?  Fine. They were out of several other things and the menu is limited. I have been sick and really wanted soup and a sandwich as I had not eaten  in couple of days. I ordered  garlic and leek soup but they only had a couple of sandwich choices. I told waiter I really wanted a sandwich and he said then order the tuna as that was the only other sandwich. I told him I was allergic. He didn't say anything. My son had ordered off the kids menu and I saw a grilled cheese so I asked if I could order a grilled cheese. He said he would need to check as it was on the kids menu. WHAT?  They were out of everything and had no sandwiches. Its a bakery! I was like forget it. I wanted to walk out. The waiter said,okay you want a grilled cheese. I replied yes. I had to beg for a grilled cheese. Lovely. When the drinks came out, they were fantastic. Kids had sour cherry lemon/lime aide.They loved it.  I ordered a bloody mary and it was the BEST mixed drink I have ever had in my life.  It was incredible.It was a work of art. It is the only reason I gave two stars. When the food finely came, mine was missing. They brought me a cheese pizza. I told them again, I wanted grilled cheese.  Hmm .....maybe the manager rejected my request since I am not under 12. 15 minutes later when the waiter came by, I asked if I could have my soup.  Another 5 minutes it arrived.  It was piping hot so I was thankful for that... It was a solid soup but not worth $9. By this time my family was done and ready to go. Then the grill cheese arrived.  The selection here limited and it is expensive. A family of four, with tip $76 dollars for an omellette, a hamburger, a kids pasta with butter and cheese, a kids grilled cheese, and a bowl of soup, 1 order of fries, 1 bloody mary 8.50 (worth every penny and I would have paid more ) and two sour cherry lemon/lime aides. My advice to the management. You need to expand the menu a tad bit and do a little bit better job of planning. A bakery that has one sandwich option of tuna at 2:30 pm on a Saturday? Really? The service today was marginal.  I felt like I was a Dennys. And if I had been, the entire meal would have cost $20.  But I wouldn't have had that amazing bloody mary! The waiter seemed like a nice guy but the coordination and communication of the team was horrible.This is Palo Alto. I will spend the money for great food, but you better bring on the service and if you run out of whats on the menu, get creative and don't give me grief for ordering a grilled cheese. Sorry- I so wanted  to love the Mayfield Bakery but we will go back to Cafe Borrone.

I am a connoisseur of fine breads, baked goods, and cappuccino. I have traveled all over the world and have eaten great food in the gourmet ghettos of Paris, Berkeley, London's Borough Market. The Mayfield Bakery ranks right up there. The Breads are amazing - as good or better then the Acme Bakery in Berkeley. Cappuccinos are best in town.The desserts are unbelievably scrumptious. Try the brownies, cookies, cakes, or lemon tarts. I've sampled them all. It's hard to choose what to order when I'm there. At last a high end gourmet bakery in Palo Alto!

I want to love the Mayfield Bakery and Cafe.  The food is delicious and moderately priced.  The white with oak decor is simple and chic.  The servers are nice.  It's just that it's SO LOUD, even when the restaurant is only half full that it's distracting and as nice as the servers are, you can sit and wait for a long time for someone to clear plates or bring something.  The food merits five stars, but overall it's a near miss.

This place is excellent for yummy adult food and for kids (the kids menu is truly perfect).  I had two appetizers - the scallops and the roasted asparagus with a fried egg - both were wonderful.  My friends had the rillettes, the burger and the asparagus pasta (the burger and rillettes were pronounced excellent; my friend who had the pasta said it was extremely bland).  Service was great.  Because they also own the bakery they give away left-over bread when you are walking out - the bread is wonderful, too.

Fancy schmnacy with great seafood. The Escobar fish was heavenly. Overall though...very expensive but a great date place oh and they give away their bread after 730pm to guests, which is quite generous as their bread is amazing. Go, but expect it to be quite pricey and also know that there are other restaurants in Palo Alto which are just as good for a lower price.

cute spot to grab a lazy sunday afternoon brunch. the best way to describe it decor is countryside and cozy. favorite part of the meal was the freshly made "pop-tarts",.. i don't think i can ever go back to my toaster heated ones again. as for the food, i got the "poached eggs, house cured beef, vegetable and pearl barley hash." the eggs were slightly overcooked, and the bulk of the dish was veggies. in short, the food has great flavor and texture with just-right portion sizes. this place is perfect for the health conscious diner.

Quick review-I went to the bakery for coffee and goodies. The goodies were nice, the bread was good but the service was slow and full of attitude. A sandwich took 20 minutes to grill ( counter help's comment, there are only 2 of us working" would have been ok if she'd just made eye contact and smiled) and coffee was really slow. Hope service at the restaurant is better...

Great food: fresh ingredients, variety of meats and fish well prepared, presented and accompanied by fresh colorful vegetables.  Dessert offerings were sublime.  A real treasure : great value for a special meal without the pretension of a staid restaurant.  Loved it.

Went for breakfast with 6 people - 3 enjoyed the  food,  omelet,  eggs and  pancake.  3 didn't -  granola, and  strawberrry crepes, which were  under cooked.  Coffee is good, service was fine, but too expensive.  $150 for breakfast?  Peninsula Creamery, Hobee's, Rick's in Los Altos serve better food for a more reasonable price.

I hate to do this to this restaurant but....went there last night for my second time.  Was so excited as first time (2 weeks ago) was amazing.  Then - the service was impeccable, enthusiastic waiter with great suggestions, attentive, water, bread, hot food, crumbs swept.  Amazing.  Last night - not so much.  First, service was slow. I heard around us "it's too late, we are already done with our food."  Also, saw people who had been there longer than us receive food way after we did.  Our waitress seemed very uninterested and uninspired.  I was so sad.  The food was good but when service is not and price is not inexpensive (I gasped when my husband told me) you just expect a bit more.  If you don't sit on a cushioned chair it will be uncomfortable by the time you are done.  Prepare to talk loudly.   So, if I had written the review the first time I would have been glowing.  Which is exactly why I took two guests back last night.  Frankly, I was embarrassed and sooo disappointed.  Restaurant was half full, plenty of servers so maybe we just got someone whose shift had been long.  But for that much money that was very unpleasant!!!

When it came to picking the right place to take my bridesmaids to brunch on the day of my wedding, I immediately thought of this place. It's classy, relatively calm (even on the weekends), and the food is great. I emailed them to set up a special reservation because the timeline was so tight. My group (of six) would have exactly 45 minutes to be in and out of there on the day of the wedding - and it was memorial day weekend. They worked with me to order ahead of time and were so nice and accommodating. The food arrived with perfect timing - quickly but not rushed, nothing cold or poorly prepared. My bridesmaids loved the food and I loved having a great brunch and still having the day be on time! Great job.

I really really wanted to love this place. Unfortunately, I just didn't. They have  A LOT of kinks to work out to get this place on par or even in the same galaxy with their other restaurants. The kitchen should be their first and most critical order of business - then the hosting function - then wait staff. In that order. Seriously. Here are the positives: The decor is very sleek/Restoration Hardware inspired with white, wood and brushed nickel everywhere. The place is buzzing and vibrant, putting diners in the mood to have fun and be wowed. The wait staff is very patient because they are the ones that have to deal with the shortcomings from the kitchen and the hostesses. I found them to be accommodating but they were in a lose-lose situation because of the lack of support from those two functions. And on to their areas of opportunity for changes: Upon walking in, the first thing I glaringly noticed was that the hostess was dressed inappropriately, IMO, with a sleeveless top on a chilly March day.  She was a little too heavy for that top and it was off-putting to me. She then suggested we sit at the counter, only to have a family of four swipe all the counter seats right before our eyes and just as we said yes to the counter instead of waiting for a table for brunch. Uh - WHAT! Well, we had to wait again. Disappointment. So, we get seated at a table that is right by the register for the servers and hostesses. We notice that they are fumbling over each other -- lot of staff but not enough to do. Or something? It was distracting. Ok - whatever - on to the FOOD. After the shock of seeing an $18 basket of breads on the menu, we opted to have croissants sent over from the bakery next door. Unfortunately, they were delivered as just that -- no butter or jams. Mayfield Blend Coffee was totally watered down and at $3.75 PER PERSON for two cups (NOT unlimited refills people!), I at least would have liked the spoon at my table upon delivery of the coffee and not have to wait/ask for it. Grrr. Ordered the food which came out no problem. HOWEVER, pancakes were served WITHOUT syrup (???) and the pasta with meatball dish was literally ice cold. Asked for syrup and they reheated the pasta. Pancakes were just so so... pasta was alright but the meatballs were completely underdone, bordering on raw-ish. Plenty of kinks to work out here. But, please, if the owners are reading this, start in the kitchen. Most other errors can be forgiven, but not mediocre food.

This is my new favorite restaurant in Palo Alto. I moved from SF to Palo Alto 10 years ago and rarely like places down here like I did in SF. The wine service is very good--always willing to give me a taste if it's an unfamiliar wine. Food I've ordered has been uniformly delicious. Great bread and butter. Coffee is *strong* and comes in bowls. Pastries at the bakery are wonderful. I don't have anything negative to say and that is a rarity, ask my husband!

Went here tonight with the bf and we both fell in love with this place. Im surprised to see some of the other reviews because I thought this place was amazing! I had the rotisserie chicken and  thought it was the best Ive ever had. My bf had the short ribs and they were to die for. Everything was well flavored and the meats were cooked perfectly. We started with the greens salad that came with olives and champaigne vinegarette..it was super fresh. I have to say that I really am starting to love that restaurants are promoting more local, sustainable foods. I LOVED that the meat here is all grass fed and local and they have the farm names next to the dish on the menu. The server said their menu is always changing which is great because you know its fresh. We will definitely be back! :) Also, the service was great too, they were always checking on us. Excelent!!

I was excited to come here because I had heard such great reviews about the floats they serve (but i didnt even have a float). I was impressed by the environment, really cute and low-key. Wanted to have a simple anniversary dinner and were pretty satisfied, but it gradually went downhill (kinda). The table was decorated nicely and the bread was really good. Then our meal came, I ordered the branzino (Mediterranean fish) with a side of potato gratin. the bf ordered the roasted lamb with risotto with fresh peas. It was all pretty good, i think we agreed the fish was better, but the lamb was well cooked.  Both the risotto and gratin was a little too heavy, especially on such a warm evening but still good.  THEN i started finding a bunch of scales on the fish and also there was twine in between the pieces of lamb from when they tied it up for roasting.  Oh and also, our waitress didn't even ask how he would like the lamb cooked, we had to bring it up. In the end, i think i was more satisfied than him, but i think its like a "safe bet" restaurant.  A little pricey for a random night, but it would be fine for special or semi-special occasions.  It was a nice atmosphere. However it ended on a better note: they offered us (and everyone else) a free loaf of bread from the bakery (the bread is pretty good so i was happy).

I'm not giving this place 2 stars because of the food, I'm giving this place  two Star because of the waiter helper that kept picking up plates without asking if we were done with our meals, Salads and Desserts. the waiter helper was extremely rude and smart you know what! also a bit pricey for what we were served, almost downtown price's for Town & Country Bakery Noisy Cafe. Although The food was good... I will give it another try as long as the waiter helper is not helping our waiter.

I frequent the bakery (behind the restaurant) and am generally very pleased w/ my experience there--great breads.  But the restaurant itself is extremely frustrating & confusing.  It's a beautiful space with a nice vibe.  Very professional looking. The menu is interesting and I have had some good food there.  But the service is completely baffling.  Given the upscale vibe and the prices I would expect--at minimum--adequate service.  I will say that once or twice when my husband and I have been there a very tall gentleman has been our server & he is nice & attentive.  Otherwise the service is uniformly disappointing.  Last night was the last straw--our date night, we walked in before 5:30.  There were some tables already seated, but it was by no means busy.  The hostess seated us and we proceeded to wait--and wait and wait.  10 or 15 minutes later, no one had come to our table yet.  The hostess had walked by seating another table--if she's worth her salt she must have seen that we hadn't been greeted by our server yet, but she did nothing about it.  We finally voted w/ our feet and wallets and walked out.  I have worked in restaurants, so I understand how a waiter can get slammed and things get busy--but that was not the case here.  There is really no good explanation for it.  If it were a hole in the wall, maybe.  But with what the restaurant aspires to be they can't afford to not have the staff working at a high-level and as a team.  I will still frequent the bakery, but probably won't try the restaurant again--this is not the first time the service has been so indifferent, so it's certainly not a one-off.  I'm giving two stars for the good food we have had, and the nice tall waiter who knows what he's doing.

We had lunch there today.  My husband ordered the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich and would order it again - he really enjoyed it.  On the other hand, I ordered the "Dungeness Crab Salad" at $15.  What a gross disappointment - the crab was 3 tablespoons of a mixture of crab and mashed avocado.  It tasted fine, but there was so little crab that it was a joke.  When the salad was served to me and I couldn't see any crab, I looked for our waiter to tell him he gave me the wrong salad. The woman next to me said, "there's no crab on that salad".  I said, "no - I don't see any."  However, when I lifted up the lettuce, there were 3 small dollops of a crab/avocado mixture hidden underneath.  When a hostess came by to ask how our lunch was, my husband (who never complains about anything!!!), told her the  salad was less than expected and that they needed to put more "Dungeness Crab" on it.  She told us that if they added more crab, they would have to charge more.  After our complaint, the hostess did remove the salad from our check; however, we left a hefty tip to compensate the waiter.  I suggest you don't order the "Dungeness Crab Salad' if you really want crab.  I don't see the need to return. . .there are too many other great places to eat.  Oh well, we tried!

Just didn't live up to expectations.  It looks nice and has an interesting menu, but the food was pretty bland and the service was weak.  Our waitress was nice, but simple things were missed.  The busboy asked if we wanted more bread, but never brought more.  The waitress asked if we wanted ketchup and evidently asked someone to bring it but they never did.  They had a nice touch of bringing me a small cup of soup when my dining mates ordered appetizers and I did not, but overall it was just not that great and overpriced to boot.  Won't go back.

This review is only for the service only since i did not had a chance to try the food. We arrive at the place and ask for a table outside, the host ("manager" don't know) was nice and set up a table for us. Everything was good, while we were waiting for service they seated another table, they were a couple of "gentlemen" that's how the waiter greet them. He offer them coffee, juice, water and left without even looking at us maybe because we weren't dress as nice as the "gentlemen" and though he had a better chance of a tip with them than us. After they hay their lattes he came with us and he offer juice and water, i ask for juice for my son and he make a face and said that he could give a child cup, at that point my husband was very uncomfortable i want it to leave. Still i refuse thinking things were going to be better and ask for a latte, waiting for my latte and my son's juice five minutes have pass and still all the service was for the "gentlemen". so finally i listen to my husband got ten dollar out o my purse and left on the table for the juice my husband got up and left. You know  am one of those person who never complain to the manager for anything that goes wrong or do reviews, but i though this was a little too much. Did not got the name of the server but he was hispanic and had a mark in his upper lip.

Staff friendly and accommodating, but two mistakes made with our order. We ate a side as a dessert because they forgot it, yet still brought it just before the check. A bit expensive, even for a Palo Alto, esp since in a strip mall across from the high school.  Quality of ingredients high, but preparation fair to poor: wood fired pizza wasn't crispy enough, tagliatelle with greens and lemon was drenched in lemon juice, pasta was very tough, and the escarole strangely tasted like brussel sprouts.  Medium well burger, $13, was charred, about 1/3 inedible.

The five-star review is only for the bread.  I like the rest of the bakery items and the restaurant, but would probably not rate them as highly.  But a lot mayfield bakery seems to be about bread.  The variety of breads fill a whole wall.  They're fresh and flavorful.  I used to drive nearly every weekend to buy either the large levain at acme in berkeley (it's better there than any of the other places you can get it) or to tartine.  Now I usually save the trip and go to mayfield.  I wouldn't put mayfield quite in the category of those places, but their breads (especially the extra large loaves) are wonderful and seem to only be getting better.   It's so nice to have something of this quality in the peninsula.

The best Bread Pudding I've ever had!  We went on a Wednesday night, and there was a band in the parking lot, so it was crowded.  The food was delicious, but the service was average. The wait between the appetizer and main course was much too long. We could see that folks at other tables were also annoyed with the wait.  I would say be sure to have a reservation, and go on a night that does not include the outside band event.

First off, I have to warn you. When they seat and offer you orange juice, (and you see everyone around you having orange juice too) it is NOT free. I thought it was free because the waiter poured the OJ into what I thought was the water glass. After it was poured, the waiter came out with an additional water glass and that's when I knew it was not complimentary. I know I was not the only one who thought this way. Whenever people came in, and I saw the waiter coming towards them with the OJ, I saw people glancing around at other tables (like I did) before saying 'yes'. I got the bill and the OJ is $3.50 for a glass that's the size of about two/three shots of espresso!  Also, the waiter said it was freshly squeezed OJ. I don't know what type of freshly squeezed OJ looks and tastes like that. I also ordered a cappuccino for $3.50. It was alright, you can't really go wrong with making a cappuccino. But, the price of OJ that tastes like frozen concentrate equaling the price of a cappuccino? Need I say more? Anyway, I ordered the beef hash with poached egg. It was a bit bland and average. There were a lot of fillers in that. At the price of $14, I expect more beef than the pasta salad that I wasn't expecting, nor wanted.  I also had the brioche french toast with strawberries. The brioche was $13. I thought it would be amazing french toast (you get 4 pieces - 2 slices cut in half) but it was actually kind of salty and mushy. Their markup prices are just ridiculous. I will be honest. I don't mind paying extra for good food. I believe in quality, not quantity. However, I do mind paying extra for food that should be listed at half the price. Average food, overpriced, and might I say a deceiving way to get a customer to pay for OJ.

My husband and I were expecting better. For starters, the waiter served us water  in a nice bottle but it  was tepid. The zucchini, cheese pizza was so spicy we had to send it back. The pasta with tomatoes and zucchini was dripping in a heavy butter sauce and had a scant number of tomatoes and zucchini. The chicken was good but 2 pieces of dark meat had little meat on them. The ambiance and service were lovely but the food lacked a lot. For a semi-pricey restaurant, we were disappointed.

Sorry but food was horrible at dinner, we had the pasta and short ribs for dinner, and the pasta was not even cooked or warm.  The peas were still cold, and the short ribs were only 5 degrees below room temp, and it felt like they had been sitting for a while.  For our $100 + dinner with starters and a few glasses of wine, I really expected better.  Go to Calafia if you want a meal that delivers, we tried Mayfield and hoped for the best, but it came up short of even decent expectations.  The dessert was good, but also took 20 minutes to come to our table.  Really tried to like this place, but unfortunately, I can not recommend it to anyone.

Had brunch here today and there is nothing special about the food.  Not worth $13 - 15 / plate.   As soon as we sat down, the waiter came over with an opened jar of OJ and asked if we would like some without mentioning the price.  That little glass of OJ turned out to be $3.5 on our bill and it is not even on the menu!

Because we LOVE the bakery, we decided to try the restaurant. We had dinner there twice,and the second time our opinion was pretty similar to our first experience. We found the food too expensive for the amount ,variety(VERY few options for vegetarians in the entree category), and quality. The Vegetarian options were too oily and over salted. It seems that the chef knows very little about local and sustainable vegetables- or vegetables in general.  The bread and olive oil were delicious, though. So, I would advise  skipping emptying one's wallet at the restaurant, and saving your money for the bakery!

We've been here twice.  The first time we enjoyed a unique and tasty take on calamari, delicious complementary bread and butter, fish and  chicken dishes, and dessert with good coffee.  We spent about $100...pricey, but the food was delicious, the atmosphere lovely, and service was not bad.  The second time we went, we waited 5 minutes at the door while the hostess finished a phone conversation.  We did not mind as she graciously apologized for that.  Then we were sat around 8 pm and waited for someone to come by to give us water and take our drink orders...and we waited...and waited.  I made eye contact with several waiters and smiled hoping to get at least a, "We'll be right with you."  I mean it was not even busy and there was more than enough service staff around.  But no acknowledgement was made.  We finally got up and left after 20 minutes.  I mean if you are willing to drop $100 on a meal you expect decent service.  As we were leaving we spoke with the manager about his staff's lack of attention.  He apologized, half-heartedly and did not bother to explain or offer any incentive for us to return.  Needless to say we may return someday but this establishment needs to learn more about customer service if they are going to continue to charge the prices they do.

We initially came here for the first time back in January or February. My husband had read so many good reviews about the place + his co-worker had also recommended it as a great place to eat. So we drove up from San Jose with great expectations. There were a lot of people outside, so we figured it had to be great if there was a big crowd waiting. We finally get seated after 30 minutes or so. We had our 2-year-old with us & I think if you're eating inside, it really isn't the right place to bring a toddler. I had ordered the leek soup & just thought it was bland. My daughter loves soup but she didn't care for this one either. My husband ordered the beef hash & liked it. But service was bad. My husband had ordered a mocha & I don't believe we got it until close to the end of the meal. The waiter was never around. Even requesting bread was difficult. So since we had a bad first impression, I let the company know about it. I let them know that I was really disappointed with the waiter & how long it took to get our food. The company apologized & said that they wanted us to return & try again. They even sent us a gift certificate. So, we finally went back this last weekend. We decided to wait until 2pm to have a late lunch in order to avoid the lunch crowd. We had a different server this time & she was pretty attentive to us. I did see our former waiter still around. This time the drinks came quickly & we didn't have to wait until the end of the meal to get the mocha. I ordered the carrot soup which was much better than the leek soup from the winter menu. My daughter had the $5 pancake which definitely had a taste of orange zest to it. It was a darker brown than I would have thought it should be but it was very fluffy. My husband got the Mayfield burger while I got the beef hash this time. Overall the food was good (yet pricey) & the service was much better than last time. We'll come back again but I don't think that this place is a must do when you come to Palo Alto/Stanford.

So I went here with a couple of girl friends. Neither of us had been there before but we heard that the food was good. we had a reservation and once we were seated someone brought us water who didn't say anything to us...we assumed a busser. More than five minutes later no one had come over and we wanted to take our time but we wanted to order champagne. When the busser came over to refill our waters we asked him to get our server. The server did eventually come. He was very cold not friendly and wanted to get away from us as soon as possible.  I think his name was andre. We ordered a bottle of champagne and when it eventually came he poured us each a glass and took the bottle with him! We didn't notice until our glasses were empty...and we couldn't find our server. It is very sketchy that he would do that and there are alot of reasons why he shouldn't do that. but anyways the rest of dinner after we got our bottle back was still disappointing. Our server hardly ever came over. He was completely wrong about what he had told us about the food...I mean his descriptions of the food that  we asked about was way off! I think after the bad service it was hard to enjoy the food and I gave 2 stars cause neither of us could fully enjoy dinner. I want to give them another chance but I'm afraid of who my server might be.

I have now eaten here for lunch and dinner and think the food is very good. I've enjoyed various dishes (although the artichoke and potato soup is quite bland - my colleague order the same thing and agreed). My one big issue with this restaurant is that they don't accept reservations (even though this site says they do). What they will do is allow you to call in and put your name on their list. I did this the other night and found that when I arrived on a rainy night  I still had a 45 minute wait. There is no room for you to sit and wait (unless you want to hang out by the bathroom) and was with my daughter so didn't want to sit at the bar. I now need to take this restaurant off my "go to for a special occasion" list because of this. On a special night, I don't want to wait until they have a table ready. This is one area they can easily improve on. The food was very good and the service was good. Our waiter for dinner was a great guy - very experienced at being a waiter.

This place is terrible.  My wife and I tried Mayfield right after it opened 1.5yrs ago and had mixed views.  We decided to give a whirl again tonight thinking the kinks would be worked out ... big mistake.  My wife never complains about anything and described this as the worst restaurant meal she has ever had.  My first glass of wine was half of a normal serving and bordering on skunked.  My wife inquired as to the waiter's suggestions and was naturally steered towards the special (aka, most expensive) dish on the menu; the rack of lamb.  It arrived a sloppy ball of fat with virtually no edible meat.  The root vegetables were bathed in butter and little else.  I decided to play it safe after the 1st outing and went with a burger - they couldn't even get that right as my onion rings arrived ice cold ... not luke warm, cold.  I asked for a medium well burger and it was charred almost straight through.  I wish we had gone to Jefferies instead and saved our money.  This place has nice ambiance but nothing else ... don't bother.
