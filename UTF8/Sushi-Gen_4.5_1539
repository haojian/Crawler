Lunchtime starts at 11:15am, not 11:00am. There was a healthy line forming before the doors opened. 營 believe there were 20 people in line ahead of us. 燬eating for 2 would be a 30 min wait, so we opt for a couple of seats at the sushi bar. 燭here is a 4 order minimum per person at the sushi bar, which was no problem for us. The orders: Yellowtail - large slabs of creamy hamachi - YUM! Scallops - drizzled with lemon and some special spices Tuna - pretty good grade with just the right amount of fat content Murugai - pretty fresh and right amount of crunch I had not been here since the 80s, when my older sis would introduce me to new sushi spots periodically. 營 remember this place being really good, and this brought back some good memories. Best sushi I've had this year, and I've had plenty of sushi.

After seeing the very high ratings for Sushi-Gen - along with the high number of reviews - we decided to check this joint out for lunch today. We arrived just before noon, and there was already plenty of people waiting outside...so if you are working on a tight schedule, it's probably best to get there a little early or to call ahead and make a reservation. Since we were here on vacation, we could absorb the 35 minutes of waiting around in the parking lot area until we finally got a seat. It's not a tiny place (at least by the Manhattan standards I usually measure against), but it's definitely packed at lunchtime. Service isn't anything remarkable, but they do get you your food quick, and the waiters definitely give the aura of wanting you to be quick with ordering, quick with eating, and quick with paying as well. That said - I was shocked by the amount of sushi you get for your money out here. When I saw the sushi deluxe and the sashimi were each $15, I questioned whether or not this was going to be a large meal - with $15, you might be lucky to get 3 pieces of sushi at some of the high-end sushi spots in NY. Boy, was I wrong...they give you a TON of sushi and sashimi at these prices. And we got the cooked eel over rice with sashimi...so we ended up with a lot of freakin' fish on the table. And to be truthful - the quality was pretty good overall. They don't do exotic types of fish like they do at higher-end stops, but they give you lots of tuna - both the fatty kind, as well as the regular bluefin - as well as yellowtail. The sashimi comes with some tartare-style tuna as well, which was delicious. One highlight was the squid, which definitely was a lot less chewy and tough than I've had at other places. The toro here is pretty well-done - very buttery, very rich flavor, and they present it in many ways (tartare, sushi, sashimi). I wouldn't say that the sushi here is the best I've had, but for the quality and the quantity you get, Sushi-Gen is pretty much a sushi joint that you have to stop by. I do wish the variety of fish was greater, but they are very good at what they do here, and the price is unbeatable. It's probably a better deal than most of those Chinese-run sushi joints that are just about everywhere now.

I got the sashimi dinner. 燭he food was tasty and great quality, but I didn't expect there to be so much of the same thing. 燗lso there was some cooked items, that I wasn't sure what I was eating.

Mmmmmm :) I LOVE coming here. Too bad that I only get to eat this a few times a year when I fly back home to visit family and friends. However, after my last update, Sushi Gen has regained their 5-star throne from me! Lunch is great at $14 for Sashimi Lunch, and dinner at $28 for Sashimi Dinner is equally as satisfying. On numerous occasions, we've come super close to closing time (around 9:15pm and they stop accepting patrons at 9:30!!), and still, the sashimi, tempura, and appetizers are still oh-so-fresh! Love that after all these years that I've been coming here, their quality hasn't been compromised substantially. Will keep on coming here whenever I'm in town! Mmmm yummy!!! :)

Melt in your mouth fish at a good price - no kidding!!!! Came here with the world famous Armanaco N. today. I knew this place had really good Yelp reviews and not only that but 1000+ reviews so we had pretty high expectations. We had to wait a bit to get seated but hey it was the peak of lunch time so that was to be expected. They told us it would be 30 minutes but we waited less than that! The place looks pretty old school/traditional. It looks cool. The tables are kind of old though. You can tell because the surface shows wear. The walls are decorated with cool art but it doesn't really blow your mind. In any case, there is great ambience if you like to see all kinds of people. It's a pretty nicely mixed crowd that you get here. The Naco and I ordered the same combo and some iced green tea. It came out to $25 each with a $10 tip. The combo we ordered includes 2 rolls with three pieces each and 9 pieces of sushi, a salad, and a "wet"salad composed of seaweed and some kind of Japanese yam - as well as a small bowl of miso soup! That's great value really. The chef chooses what you get in the combo which we thought was pretty cool. There are actually places where the chef not only chooses what you eat but also tells you how to eat it and it costs much, much more than you can imagine. The miso was pretty good. The "wet salad" was interesting - we had never had anything like it. It's very sour and is cold. It looks a bit exotic - it has dark green seaweed strands and a white substance on top which is the yam. You are supposed to mix it up and slurp it up! The iced green tea was very, very, really, really ridiculously good! Every piece of sushi was mouthwateringly fabulous!!!! I kid you not, the fish just melts in your mouth!!!! It has a soft fresh flavor to it as well. I have read reviews where people say their sushi does not taste "fishy" and I can honestly tell you I have never experienced anything that resembles that sensation until NOW!!!! I swear, that the Naco and I just stared at each other as we tried each delectable piece of sushi! We were dumbfounded and knew that we would never be able to try sushi anywhere else again and have this experience. It's kind of scary. Now we can truly say we are sushi snobs! Oh, and remember that this is not - I repeat not - terribly expensive sushi. WOW!!!! One very unique thing about this place is that the soy sauce is premixed with wasabi. It comes in a cute little ceramic soy sauce dispenser. The sushi itself already has just the right amount of wasabi on it. Parking is available as the place has a pretty big lot and it is validated but I read that the validation merely brings down the price. It is difficult to get free parking around here unless you are willing to walk more than a couple of blocks. In any case, I can assure you that things will never be the same for us in the world of sushi again - a really, really great price for top quality fish. So incredible it's surreal - somebody pinch me!!!!

Sushi Gen is a sushi gem! I just had to. No really, it's that good. Living in a city saturated with all the sushi your appetite could ever fathom, Sushi Gen stands out for its' quality and authenticity. The wait can get pretty long but if you're not with a big group, I recommend sitting at the bar. I actually love sitting there! Watching the chefs slice heavenly slabs of fish is an art in itself. Okay, I sound like a total weirdo. Not on the menu but readily available, their fatty salmon is no doubt the best I've ever had. And for you uni-lovers, the friend said that was the best uni he's ever had as well. �Take note they put wasabi in each sushi or handroll they make so keep that in mind before you dunk yours in more. You'll thank me later ;)

Sushi Gen is one of the PREMIER sushi bars in the Los Angeles area. It has super fresh, super delicious sashimi and sushi on a regular basis. The fish here is so fresh, they actually keep them alive on life support and carve away at them for each order. 燦o...J/K. 燘ut honestly, the fish does really look and taste that fresh.The quality of the fish combined with the just moderate price makes it #1 in my book. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. We ordered the Uni Dinner with Tempura and the Sashimi Deluxe. For those on a budget date I suggest splitting the Sashimi Deluxe plate. 營t is more than enough food to split between 2 people. 燗nd if you aren't quite full, go home and get boba! +Sashimi deluxe ($35): this comes with a variety of sashimi and other side dishes: salmon, yellowtail, octopus, tuna, fatty tuna, shrimp, and then a spicy tuna, cooked salmon, crab meat, and seaweed. It is a lot of food and very filling! The salmon and yellowtail were my favorite. It is SO buttery and just melts in your mouth. Other items-- crab meat, spicy tuna, cooked salmon-- were just mediocre. It comes based on the Chef's choice. +Uni. boy oh boy. I didnt even want my boyfriend touching any of them. I wanted all for myself. It was deliciously slimy and fresh! It was sweet and the flavors were all there! The prices are bloody insane and totally out of whack with reality. I like how no amounts are listed on the sushi menu. It's all a big "face" scam. Note: don't come here expecting Rainbow rolls, Caterpillar Rolls and all that garbage (which isn't even sushi). As mentioned, the fish is the main attraction here, so sashimi and nigiri sushi are what attracts the real sushi customers and all the Asian customer base. Be prepared to wait, b/c there is always a line here; lunch or dinner, weekday or weekend.Parking can also be a pain. I suggest parking at the JVP parking structure across the street. Come early or make reservations, it gets crowded!!

Delicious! And only a 5 minute wait (which I hear is good). I ordered white fish something for an appetizer and the sushi deluxe. I tried a few things that I've never had before and everything was tasty. Including the complementary miso soup. I'm glad that I finally made it here and was completely satisfied.

Came here last night because I kept hearing that this place was the go to place for quality sashimi. The first step in coming here is to make sure that you have a reservation! The line is pretty long and walk-ins (especially on weekends) can wait anywhere from 45 min to 2 hours. Thankfully, I had read reviews talking about the quality of the sashimi here and that's pretty much all we ordered. We had the sashimi deluxe platter and chrirashi deluxe bowl between three of us. Personally, my favorite was the fatty tuna and the the hamachi. Both of which taste extremely fresh and are cut professionaly so all of it was tender and still maintained the texture that you hope to have in quality sashimi. Prices were extremely reasonable and I think between us 3.. we spent around 25 a person? None of us came in starving so the food was just right! I hear there's an amazing $15 lunch special but given that I work in SD and have a tough time making it there before lunch break is over.. I'll have to settle for dinner prices which are still extremely fair!

Expensive, but very fresh sushi and the service was excellent. It gets packed during prime times -- especially in the bar. Luckily, we never had to wait for a table the last two times we came. Also loved the interior setup, overall, a very clean restaurant. Nigiris are a bit small in portion compared to others (like Hamakawa when they used to be in business across on Central) but again the fish was super fresh. Closed on Sundays, bummer.

You can come here for the weekday lunch special. But you've missed the point of this sushi bar. 燗nd let me clarify. 燭he lunch special is super cheap, great portions and ridiculously fresh. But you have to deal with the line that goes out the restaurant and overflows into the parking lot. 燨r you can sit in the sushi bar. When you sit at the sushi bar, you'll notice a man in the center ordering everyone to do what he bids. 燞is name is Toyo-san and he runs the show. 燞e even taught the Mexican chefs to speak Japanese. 燞ow cool is that? Let's see. 燳ou should order for yourself... 1. Ankimo (monkfish liver) 2. Fried Pompano (you can eat every little bit of real estate on there, including the bones) 3. White Fish (Engawa, Hirame, Aji, Tai, etc) 4. Mirugai (giant clam) 5. Red Fish (Maguro, any variation of their toro, Hamachi, Kanpachi, etc) 6. Uni Now that you've spent over $100 on yourself, you should feel happy that something on you is lighter- your wallet!

I loved everything about Sushi-Gen. We came on the Saturday night with three adults and two kids. Luckily we had reservations, otherwise I think our wait would've been well over an hour. At 6:30, the place was crowded already and people were spilling out the restaurant door. Make sure you show up on time if you have a reservation. When I called, they told me they would not hold the table and that the entire party had to be present. The restaurant has a private lot (entrance on 2nd) which made it easy to find parking. The information on yelp says that it's not good for kids, but they do serve food other than sashimi, so it's all good. We ordered yellowtail belly, salmon, salmon skin salad, beef teriyaki dinner, california roll, spicy tuna roll, and sashimi dinner. The dinners come with miso soup, pickled seaweed, tempera, and rice. I must say that I really enjoyed the soup and the seaweed salad. The tempura was also very good. The rolls were delish and the sashimi were awesome - definately felt like heaven in my mouth. The sashimi dinner came with various sashimi including tuna, spicy tuna, some white fish, squid, cooked salmon, sardines...sorry don't remember/know the rest, but it was good. You never know what you're going to get with the sashimi dinner though, so what I list wouldn't even matter. But I believe the waitress said sashimi dinner will always come with white fish and tuna - the rest is up to the chef. For drinks, we ordered green tea. My sister and I had it hot, and my husband had it iced. Though the tea is the same, the hot was actually $1 more than the cold at $3 a pop. But the green tea brought me back to Japan - tasted like what I remembered it to be at the tea plantation in Japan. Loved it. Thank you Sushi-Gen. You held up to your 4.5 star rating!

Last night, the place was a little busy and the seating at the bar somewhat cramped, but the experienced sushi man was exceedingly friendly and was easily able to keep up with all of the orders. 燭he quality of the fish here is really good, and the only item that I found to be even the slightest bit disappointing was the salmon which is nicely cured here but all farmed from Norway. 燭he fish appears to come from LA Fish down the street a few blocks and is of pretty high quality. 營t is not locally sourced fish with the exception of the uni and the halibut, and while it is fresh, remember that it has been in transit, albeit prompt transit, from Asia. 營 like Shibucho better for my money. I particularly enjoyed the Spanish Mackerel, yellowtail sashimi, and albacore but it was all pretty good but not out of this world good. 營 want to come here for lunch and order the sashimi or chirashi which I saw being prepared on the line behind the sushi bar. 營t looked really good. �I was slightly disappointed to see the sushi man offering complimentary dishes to the Asian people sitting next to us. 營t would kind of be similar if at El Taurino, they gave a complementary side of beans to each Mexican, but nothing to the Korean customers. 營 am sure they would all be wondering what the fuck they were thinking. 燗dditionally, I had just a touch of buyer's remorse after receiving the check (50 bucks each).

Over priced and over rated. My girl and I went here to grab a little sushi and have some sake for a light late night mini-date. The sushi was pretty good, decently fresh, but not nearly worth the price that they charge. I have had far better for less. However, I was ok with the price as long as the service would be good. Not only were we kind of rushed, but as we were enjoying our drinks and conversation while munching on some sushi. We were told we had to order more food because there was a minimum per person. She then showed us the minimum of $10.00 per person which we had surpassed. Although we spent well over the minimum per person, we were told that since we only order one platter we needed to order something else and that drinks did not count. I don't think I should be told how I should divide my spending at a restaurant. Especially when your margins are better on alcohol than on seafood. We were a more profitable table for you with a drinks heavy bill. I kindly informed her that we had exceeded their minimum per person and did not want any more food, but that we would have another round of drinks. She said she had to check to make sure that was ok. It is my experience that if a place has to put a minimum amount spent or charge more if you split something, they usually aren't worth it. If your food is good and your drinks are good, then money will be spent. This place lived up to that idea. It was not very good. Maybe this place used to be good because the reviews are great. That is why we went there, but this was a very bad experience and ruined what should have been a very nice night. By trying to force us to buy more food that we didn't want, instead of having a potential repeat customer, they have now ensured that we will never again spend our money there. There are far better sushi places in LA. 營f you want good, authentic Sushi, go to Sugar Fish. Avoid Sushi Gen, it's really not worth it. Sugar Fish is worth every penny.

Sushi Gen is perhaps the most over-rated and under-rated Sushi restaurant in LA. �The long lines definitely drive a lot of people away. 營t makes the place seem so commercialized, everything a good "traditional" Sushi restaurant usually isn't. 燘ut when you actually overcome your repugnance for the commercial aspect and actually try the Sushi at the Sushi Bar, it is absolutely excellent! �Sushi Gen doesn't have the wide variety of Neta (fish) that's flown in from Japan that some of the top Sushi restaurants on the Westside (Kiriko, Sushi Sushi, Yamakase, Nishimura, etc) have, but the fish that they do have tend to be FRESH. 燛specially basic East coast fish such as Yellowfin Tuna, Snapper, Halibut, etc, are extremely fresh, and possibly the freshest in LA. 營 guess it's because they have such high turnover, that they are never in the position where they have to serve old fish. 燬ome of the more "exotic items" such as mackerel and Uni were not as fresh, which leads me to believe that my turnover theory is correct. 燬o when you go to Sushi Gen, if you order the simple stuff, you will probably be in for a treat. 營f you want to explore into the more exotic flavors, such as Kohada (gizzard shad), different types of squid, etc. you are probably better off at Kiriko. �And finally, as always, I need to be a bit critical about the rice. 營 personally like my rice to be a tad warmer with a stronger vinegary kick, a bad habit I picked up dining at such ultra-traditional and legendary Edomae sushi joints in Tokyo as Sukiyabashi Jiro (of "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" fame) and Mizutani. 燭he top sushi restaurants in Tokyo add no sugar to their rice, whereas many US-based sushi restaurants load the Sushi rice with sugar (in addition to salt and vinegar) to please the sweet-seeking palates of the Americans. 燗s for rice, I do think Sushi Sushi or Yamakase do the best job of emulating Tokyo here in the US.

Classic case of tricked by Yelp reviews... How naive was I? Basically, I expected really good quality sushi after seeing so many reviews. Maybe I ordered wrong stuff, like Uni, Sweet Shrimp (was ok), and Tuna, Sardine, Kanpachi, Surf Clam, etc. Not very impressed... Should I have ordered Sashimi instead of sushi? The best part was miso soup (!) and I feel bad cuz that shouldn't be tastier than sushi. Delicious clam & fish head miso soup :)

I am only writing on a memory, so your experience might be different from mine. First, they won't allow cell-phone. Second, they won't allow your less then half filled water bottle on the table (mind you, we've already ordered the bottle of "Onigoroshi" from there, which was close to $75!) Third, their sushi wasn't that good compare to other places, but the price was really over the top. This was my first and last experience there.

Five stars for the lunch special. For $15 their sashimi combo is an absolute steal and will leave you full and satisfied. It's cheaper and much bigger than Sugarfish. It's a win win. There is a miso soup and bowl of rice served on the side. �I am not a fan of regular tuna (the red kind) but the medium fatty toro which comes with the lunch special is delicious and makes wish all tuna could be this great. 營f they can serve this much toro for only $15 dollars everywhere else is just a rip off.

I went there today as a party of four during lunch hours. A friend of ours told us that this place has a great cost-performance, so we decided to check it out. Looking at the previous yelp-comments, I knew about the average 30-50 minute wait. However, they skipped us and seated a few pairs of people that came after us. Totally understandable because we were a group of four, and there wasn't enough seats for us. But if that happens too much... There's a problem there. All of us ordered a Jyou-Sushi set (About $16) which comes with 8 or 9 pieces of sushi. The neta (fish on the sushi) was fresh and tasty, but the cuts were a little too small. They made the portion of the shari (rice) smaller to adjust to that small neta. Thinking that Edo-mae (Legit Tokyo style sushi) is supposed to be like that, it may not be a problem, but after finishing the meal, I thought I could eat another set. I recommend the teens who eat a lot to get some sides with it too. We asked for some oshibori's (wet-towels) to wipe our hands before eating the sushi, but they said they were 50cents each. Hot-Teas are a $1.50. Extra Gari (Ginger) $1. A little too stingy and miserly. What sushi restaurant charges the customers for extra gari? It was certainly not bad, but was it worthy of all that hype? I really think that Sushi Gen serves solid Sushi, but there are many other places around LA that deserve just as long lines, considering quality vs. price. Because they are not THAT cheap and really not THAT good.Overall, the sushi was good. Not bad. Still, it was a little overpriced, and I probably won't go there again.

i was a regular at sushi gen while living in downtown years ago and still find time to stop by the place whenever i visit the area. i really enjoy ordering chirashi and assorted sashimi, the price is reasonable, one incident i will never forget is that my friend pour his hot green tea into ice water and the restaurant charged him for the price of iced green tea, probably the most hilarious incident i ever witness in a restaurant, still, it doesnt deter us from going back to the place.

So. Many. People. Boohoo. Arrived at 11:30 AM to find a good number of people ahead of us. The bar had open seats, but you don't get to order from the menu if you sit at the bar. Boohoo. We put our name down with our party of 3 and proceeded to wait. Unfortunately, my eagerness to visit Little Tokyo got the better of me, and we took a quick excursion to a nearby plaza in Little Tokyo. 15 minutes later we returned to find that the gentleman had already called our name :c We waited some more (a full hour total), and a table finally opened. At last. We sat down and our waiter brought us our menus. Take note: GREEN TEA is an additional $1.50 per person! Mind you, I did appreciate their use of legitimate matcha green tea, but I didn't know it would cost extra until I saw the bill :c All 3 of us ordered their SASHIMI LUNCH COMBINATION for $15, which includes rice, soup, tofu, and pickled vegetables. And oh my goodness, they include so many pieces of fresh sashimi, along with many other delectable goodies like sushi tartare (not sure if it's actually called that haha) and octopus! On top of that, they let you split the bill, no extra charge! Below is my order of preference (although I have no idea what anything is called, so I used location for placement...): http://www.yelp.com/biz_�Right middle dark pink fish (so soft and flavorful), middle middle evenly pink fish (softer than the first fish, but not as flavorful), bottom right spicy fish mush (fish tartare amirite???), somewhat bottom left raw fish mush, grilled salmon, eel, middle middle white fish on the left, middle middle white-pink fish on the right, crab, octopus, weird white strand thing in the middle, left middle transparent chewy squid square, lettuce :P Service was fast, the ambiance was busy and pleasantly crowded, and the experience was fantastic. Tasty food at a superb price means I'll be back next time I'm in LA! And for future reference, as stated by the front desk staff member: you can schedule reservations in advance for any number of people. However, the restaurant only takes 3 or 4 reservations a day, so you may need to call 3 or 4 days early to book your reservation. Oh, and parking is a beez. But I'm just not used to LA parking. Make sure to get your parking stub validated or sacrifice your meal receipt so that you only have to pay $2 for 2 hours of parking!

If you want some of the best sushi in LA I highly recommend sushi-gen! Parking: Plenty of spots within the plaza and also street parking if needed. Service: Excellent service from all of the staff. Food: Insanely freaking delicious! The sashimi just melts in your mouth and the rolls are also delicous. Price: Sushi-gen is pricey, but is worth every penny. *I highly suggest you arrive 30 minutes prior to them opening if you don't want to wait in line. The first time I ate here I came 20 minutes before the dinner opening and there was already plenty of people waiting in line.

I can tell you that this is the freshest sushi and sashimi that I've ever had. What's even better is that the prices are reasonable. 營 got a sushi platter with appetizer and salad for $26. 燗nd I got a sashimi platter for $30. 營t was an awesome meal. The wait is always bad...If you really want to be seated promptly, then I recommend going in as soon as they open up for lunch or dinner. 燭hey will only seat you if your entire group is present. I can overanalyze the fish ad nauseum, but I'll keep the review short; 燽est sushi I've ever had. 營t's so fresh and flavorful that I couldn't believe I was eating fish. 營f you're looking for a place with great sashimi, check it out.

This is my first yelp review, so I chose one of my favorite restaurants in L.A. Sushi-Gen is one of the best sushi places I've ever visited. When many of the customers AND chefs are Japanese, you know you're in the right place. The bar has a fun environment, but I would recommend a table if you want a quiet conversation or an intimate date. Also, if going on the weekend, prepare for a long wait. Order: TORO!!!! For Real. It's like butta. Yellowtail is out of this world. Crab/Seaweed Salad. Other than those musts, you really can't go wrong. Even the sweet shrimp head is good! Enjoy!

I'm not sure why this place gets all the buzz. I consider myself a sushi snob and I only care about one thing when I go to a sushi place, the quality of fish. My wife and I tried the omakase and I'd have to say, for the price they charge, I'd rather go to a high-end sushi place. The quality is not BAD, but it's not worth the price or the wait. My toro (fatty tuna) was a particularly bad cut and had a lot of gristle. Overall, there are too many sushi places in Little Tokyo that I prefer to go before Sushi Gen.

Back in the day, Honda Plaza was the only thing in this corner of Little Tokyo. 燗cross the street where the Starbucks and Staples and tons of people are... that was all an empty lot. 燗mazing how development happened over time. Sushi Gen has been around in Honda Plaza for all that time. 燳ou could go in for really great sushi, done extremely well... Then head next door to a Japanese hostess bar. 燜orgot what it was called, but it was the type of place where guys go in, a bunch of girls come out to keep you company and serve alcohol and light your cigarettes... At the end of the night the guys get stuck with a nasty bill plus massive tips for all the girls that came to hang out with you. Some of those girls were pretty hot... It's hard being a guy sometimes... 燞ow can you resist really hot girls even when there's not much underneath the exterior? ��But back to Sushi Gen. Came over to catch up with a friend I haven't seen in awhile. 燱ithout a doubt, the food quality is really very good. 燬ome extreme food snobs might find things to nitpick about Sushi Gen's sushi, but from my end I feel like it's one of the best in L.A. �It's pretty damn good. And a lot of people agree. 營 arrived at 11:15 am into the parking lot, and there was a long line of people waiting for the place to open. 營t was like people were waiting a day in advance to get the new iPad or iPhone. 燬ushi Gen normally opens at 11, but today they were late in opening up. Dealing with that kind of demand, I'm sure it can get old if you're the host dealing with it. �But guess what? 燗 crabby host gets old when you've been a customer who's been many times, and has gotten the crabby attitude enough times to remember. For today's lunch, my friend and I waited for 45 minutes. 燭he host came outside and called my name three times literally in 15 seconds. 燘ecause we didn't come running up immediately within 5 seconds he gave away our table. 燱hen confronted, he made it seem like he called me name for five minutes or more, making a stink about how he was calling our name but didn't respond. �Obviously we were in fact there... So after this awkwardness, he dismissed the people he gave away our table to, telling them they'd have the next table. 燗nd my friend and I got to sit down and eat some great sushi. �The wait staff is friendly and good. But based on the host's silliness today and his lack of basic courtesy, I won't be making any effort to return at this point. 燗s exceptional as the food is. 燭his wasn't the first run-in with the host. 燣ooks like it's just too difficult when you're that good and popular.

This is sushi done right! The wait can be daunting, but definitely worth it. Sitting at the sushi bar is a completely different experience than sitting at the tables. If you sit at the sushi bar you aren't allowed to order any food from the menu. There are also no prices at the bar so make sure your wallet is stacked or else you'll be in for a big surprise! You have to try their live sweet shrimp with the option of frying the shrimp head or having it in miso soup. I went for the miso soup and OMG! So gooood!! The kumamoto oysters were by far the freshest, most delicious oysters I've ever had. They are also famous for the toro, which literally melts in your mouth. Other recommendations are the red snapper, albacore, and spicy tuna. Never have I had such delicously fresh sushi! Best sushi around. Hands down my fave sushi place!

Going to Sushi Gen is like clubbing in Vegas for a group of dudes. You have to manage your time wisely, arrive well before the place opens, wait in line, and hope you'll beat the rush and get in. I finally found the time on a random weekday to come to Sushi Gen for the famous lunch special. The restaurant opens at 11:15 on the dot and I arrived around 10:40. I was surprised to already see a few people in line, and I quickly understood why. People seriously start lining up as early as an hour before the place opens so that they can secure a table in the first wave of customers. If you're not in, you'll most likely wait upwards of 30 minutes to an hour. Luckily for me, I got in with the first wave because I was an eager beaver and arrived early as suggested. The lunch special is honestly worth the trip! For only $15, you get various cuts of sashimi, a few sides, and a bowl of rice. The fish is extremely fresh and just melts in your mouth (other than the cooked salmon, which is weird and doesn't belong haha). Sushi Gen also has the best spicy tuna ever. Unlike every other place, they don't cut the tuna finely. They leave the tuna in big chunks and toss it with a delicious spicy sauce that's not super mayo-y. Just arrive early and you won't regret it!

I have no idea why so many people raved about this place and why there was such a long line, it was not like the price was cheap or something. Funny story to this restaurant, we had reservation at 6:00pm and the host mentioned that we can not be 1 minute late. Being that there was a road block near our hotel and taxi took forever, we literally jogged to the restaurant. Worst ever!! Upon arrival, we still had to wait at least 30 minutes, bs!!! We ordered the sashimi combination and uni on the side. The sashmi was fresh, but not excellent quality. 燱e ordred this grilled clams and it was so nasty!!! Just say I don't even recall anything amazing about this place. 燗fterward, we was stil hungry!!

Sushi-Gen is my favorite place for sushi. 營've only been out there twice for dinner over the past year, which is not nearly as enough as I would like. 營 went on a Saturday night both times, and the wait was about an hour long each visit. 營t didn't matter that I went around 8, which is what I consider as a late dinner. 燬o your best bet is to go early like everyone suggests. The parking lot is tiny, but the flow of traffic is constant. 營 only had to wait about 5 minutes for a spot. 營 would highly suggest that someone in your party put in their name down while waiting to find a parking space. 營n order to keep ourselves entertained while waiting to be fed, the boy and I walked across the street to walk around Little Tokyo. 營t reminded me of my trip to Japan years ago, and how I need to make it out there again in the near future. Back to the restaurant...there is a bar section, which may be a shorter wait. 燘ut I always opt to sit at the tables. 營 got the chirashi bowl again, and it was heavenly. 燭he pieces of fish were fresh, melt in your mouth kind of deliciousness! 營 had a couple pieces of toro in my bowl, and that was the winner. 燭he boy got the sashimi dinner combo, which is the most popular according to our server. 營t came with tempura, miso soup, and a variety of sashimi. 營t's a few bucks more than my chirashi, but I think sashimi dinner is the way to go. 燱e both demolished our dinner in no time. 燭he service was superb as well. 燨h, and don't forget to get your parking ticket validated before you leave the restaurant!

Biggest let down by Yelpers to date. This place was mediocre at best. I had edamame (cold, almost raw, and saltless), miso soup (best item of what I ordered), spicy tuna roll (just ok), and CA roll (tasteless). The place was jam packed, which is weird because it is SO unremarkable. So unremarkable that I've said enough already. You can do better. WAY better.

This is one of my favorite sushi place. I wish I can go there more often but it is such a hassle to go to little Tokyo and try to find a parking. I had a sashimi on their lunch special menu. It seems like 95% of customer order that. This is one of the best sushi I ever had and I had a lot of sushi when I went to Japan. The fresh was very very fresh and their price for sashimi lunch is unbeatable. 營 don't think you can get any better sashimi for that price anywhere in Los Angeles. I can't wait to go back there again and again.

Spending $75 on sushi for lunch? Yeah, it happens. But this is SO worth it. I had a total of 20 pieces and 1 roll (uni). So it's actually really good value. The fish was as fresh as you can get.. I had tamago, uni, amaebi, hamachi, salmon, shima aji, scallop, anago, and a bunch of others. This is some of the best sushi I've had in California.

Came here with my friend Steve for the $15 sashimi lunch special. Good thing for me he arrived at 10:15 and was the 3rd person in line. When I arrived there at 10:45 the line was already about 30-40 ppl long. No wait, score! The lunch special included miso soup, a plate of tofu, veggies, bowl of rice, and a giant plate of sashimi (yellow tail, salmon, tuna, eel, spicy tuna, squid?). The quality of the sashimi is super fresh and they serve it to you pretty much right away since I'm sure they have a lot of these plates ready for the lunch rush. Possibly the best sashimi value you can get for $15 bucks. I'm probably not going to come here again though because I don't think I would want to line up for 30 minutes or longer for this special, as good as it is. But if you have a friend who would get in line for you, then by all means DO IT!

I recommend calling in ahead of time to make reservations because this is a very popular sushi joint, known for their high quality fish and freshness. A line does build rather quickly during prime lunch and dinner times, so if you're going to walk in without a reservation, be prepared to wait for up to 45 mins to an hour. Parking can become very limited in the small and overpopulated lot, so there were times when I would just park in the JVP structure and conveniently walk over. I always order a plethora of different types of Sushi and Sashimi: Uni (Sea Urchin), Albacore, Unagi (Fresh Water Eel), Salmon, Hamachi (Yellowtail), Yellowtail Belly, Spanish Mackerel, Toro (Fatty Tuna), Sweet Shrimp, and every morsel I've eaten here has been supremely fresh and absolutely delicious! If you don't want to order individual orders of Sushi or Sashimi for lunch/dinner, I would highly recommend their Sashimi Lunch Special, Sashimi Dinner, The Chirashi bowl, or their Sashimi Deluxe. The 5 stars given are for their fresh fish, authenticity, superior taste, portion sizes, efficient and attentive service (from personal experience), and despite how insanely crowded it gets, I still think it's totally worth the time and energy to come!!

Sushi Gen is my absolute favorite place for delicious and fresh sushi. The lunch deals are outrageous, and everyone seems to know about them. Get ready to wait unless you get there right when they open (and even then, there will be a line of people who showed up BEFORE the doors are open). I always get the sashimi lunch for $15. It is such an incredible deal. As you can tell from the pics, the portions are very generous. In addition to the huge platter of sashimi, you also get a bowl of rice, a bowl of miso soup, a little dish of pickled veggies, and some really good braised tofu. The quality of the fish is suberb. I'm also a fan of their combo meals on the days that I can't handle all that sashimi. Their chicken teriyaki is pretty tasty, and it comes with a little plate of sashimi. I am also a big fan of the chawamushi (steamed egg). It's loaded with delicious bits of seafood. If you come in for dinner, there is usually little or no wait. The prices are a little higher, but if you don't want to wait an hour for food, its not a bad compromise. Remember to get your parking validated! I believe parking is $2.50 for 2 hours. The parking lot is pretty small, but like other yelpers have mentioned, people are always coming and going.

I really rate this place 3.5 stars. Food is 4 stars. Service is 3 stars. I have been here several times, but I can't rave about it like everyone else does. I've sat at the sushi bar and had a $180 (after tip) meal for two and thought it was great. I've also sat at the sushi bar and had a $200 (after tip) meal for two and thought it was ok. So I've had good meals and have also been disappointed. One thing I don't like though I've given in to is ordering things when you don't know the cost. The sushi list does not show the cost which bothered me for a while but I guess I eventually got over it. If you're on a budget, this may be quite annoying. You don't want a surprise at the end of your meal. Also, last time we were here, the host was extremely rude. I literally stood in front of the host stand for 5 minutes to try to leave my name and was completely ignored, which explains why it was the last time I was here. They may have great business and think they're the greatest, but honestly, there are a lot of excellent sushi places in Little Tokyo that have been more consistent (food taste-wise) than them, so I just haven't gone back. In short, the sushi has been mainly but not always fresh and they do have a large variety of sushi, but I don't care for the service. Prices are cheaper than places in Beverly Hills, I guess, but are more expensive than others in Little Tokyo such as Sushi Go 55 and Sushi Komasa. I prefer these other places as their sushi has been more consistent and cost less.

Thank you Yelp for being in existence otherwise I would never have known about Sushi-Gen and missed out on one of the best sushi experiences I've had. We arrived just in time to grab a seat at the Sushi bar. I later lived to regret it somewhat (I've learned this is the most expensive option) but I'm so happy we were seated within 10 minutes of arrival. There was a constant line the whole time we were there. We sat down to one of best experiences and made our trip to LA so fun. We keep talking about it even now. We weren't sure what we wanted and were up for some experimentation. We ate what our neighbors were eating and seemed to be enjoying including the freshest tuna sashimi we've had, scallops in a shell, yellow tail nigiri, etc. We really enjoyed our experience and our sushi chef even added in an item he thought we would enjoy. Nicest gentleman, so we lucked out. I paid for it in the end but so worth it. I only come to LA once or twice a year, so I highly recommend this restaurant. I plan to come back again and experience the sashimi lunch next time I come to town.

The place is always crowded. Just accept that it is and be done with it. The line goes out the door, especially during lunch, since this place has amazing lunch deals. That said, if you're going for pure sushi, the wait'll be significantly shorter to sit at the bar. Very fresh foods. The chefs are more than happy to tell you the recommended fishes that day. Quality matches the prices, so expect to spend a bit more. : Validated parking. Drop by the bakery, Frances, next door on the way out. :)

Doesn't look like all that much when it comes out, but boy, everyone at the table was stuffed and we all got different things. �2) Tempura and Sashimi: I thought I'd get a great deal out of this because I wanted something fried with my fish, but it was more like fish with something fried. 燭here was a large plate of tempura and then 3 different types of sashimi (two piece each). Comes with the same sides/rice like the first. 3) Chirashi Bowl: This one looked pretty good also. This had an assortment of sashimi in a bowl of the sweeter sushi rice, egg, and eel. 營 would want to try this one also after the Sashimi! mmmmhmm. This one doesn't come with all the sides and miso soup, so expect to be sad when all your friends get soup and tofu but you don't. :( Everyone was satisfied with what they ordered, I cannot wait to come back!! Lastly, service was great, the host was friendly, the servers were very good with water, and the ladies apopolgized profusely for bringing one dish later than the rest. But no need, we were still happy :) ***We arrived at 11AM -- exactly when they're supposed to open. There was a line going across a few of the neighboring stores/restaurants! COME EARLY! When we got in line at 11, and the place opened at 11:15, we STILL had to go on the wait list, wait for the first people to finish their meals, then wait til it got to us...at the bottom of the waitlist... CRAZY. That tells you something about what kind of food you get here! Ahhh this review made me crave it all over again. 營TS WORTH THE WAIT!

I really don't have to say much more; Sushi Gen is one of my favorite sushi places EVER. Not just in LA. Ever. First time I came with Todd O. about 3 years ago because it's one of his favorite places and I totally could see why he likes this place too. One word will do it all when it comes to great sashimi: FRESH. The hamachi just melts in your mouth and there's no nasty stringy cuts in your fish ever. We got sashimi combos for dinner at that time. To be honest, I'd pay more than just the $15 for the lunch special for those combos too. Huge FRESH plates of sashimi with soup, salad, a variety of tempura, until you're super full...and those were under $30 too. Of course the $15 lunch specials recently have blown this place up even more than it used to be. Lines are always ridiculous, so come with some good company and time to spare because you'll be waiting if you don't get there RIGHT as it opens. (or before.) Lunch special is amazing for what it is...you'll probably never find a fresher, cheaper, yummier sashimi deal anywhere!!! I loveee Sushi Gen!

One of the best sushi places in LA. Uni, sashimi, nigiri are all good quality seafood at a good price. My must-order item: Sashimi dinner The portion is big with good variety of fish. Fresh tempura with ponzu sauce is tasty, not greasy. A bowl of hot sushi rice....yum.... Uni is also another great choice! A big box of fresh uni!! you can taste the sea in your mouth!! Quick Tip: try go to their lunch time, you will pay less and have same quality and quantity of food!

Occasion: Lunch with Rich (before spontaneous drive to Venice Beach!) What I Had: Chirashi Deluxe ($15!) Food Review: Good, but not as great as Sugarfish for sure! All of the fish and other seafood (e.g., squid, octopus) were tasty. I will say that on second thought I should have probably gotten the lunch sashimi platter, which is also $15 but seems to have a larger quantity of fish and a side of tofu. The rice was well seasoned and true to a proper sushi restaurant, they paw out the warm rice with a slightly damp cloth so the rice grains don't get crushed. LEGIT. Service Review: Nothing in particular about the service. Venue Review: The restaurant is extremely well kept and classy! While we were waiting for a table I went and checked out the sushi bar. Everything is kept immaculately clean in and out of the display case, almost like a museum for sushi meats. There are seats at the sushi bar, at tables, and also at booths. There is parking available in the private lot in front of the restaurant, but we found street parking across the street without any trouble. Overall Impression: Solid sushi at a bargain price at lunchtime! Maybe I'm just obsessed with Ponzu sauce, but not as great as Sugarfish. With that said, again, bargain sushi deal for lunch!

Lets just say that when anyone talks about sushi that this place comes into my mind first and foremost! Have you ever tried a fatty tuna that melts in your mouth? Yellow tail belly sounds interesting, right? Well it has a very interesting and unique texture that leaves your mouth watering for more. Sea Urchin is tricky business, but not at this place... So fresh and tasty, that you will be begging for more. Also, sweet shrimp is sweet as can be. I ordered mine fried and it had so much flavor to it. THE KEY THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT EVERYTHING IS FRESH AND CLEAN! You indulge so much, but it is so worth it. Location is in the heart of Little Tokyo and the wait is not too bad. Friendly waiters and hostess, who help you understand the menu and food you have questions about. If you are looking to suppress that sushi craving, please try this place and you will agree that no other place will suffice! Can't wait to go back!

We sat at the bar (and you should too) and ordered Omakase. We were paired with a fantastic sushi chef who made the whole experience amazing. We started out with mackeral, then had some of the fattiest, most amazing toro I have ever seen, then some delicious snapper, some unbelievable salmon that practically melted on your tongue, amazing albacore, fantastic yellow tail, giant clam, and then we ended with a great piece of eel. The entire meal was truly amazing. Delicious, fresh, and extremely well prepared by a great sushi chef. Worth the hour wait and more than worth the price. In fact, we were surprised at how cheap the bill actually was; they could totally get away with charging more for their omakase because its worth it. This meal earns a spot in my top 5 best meals I've had in LA. I cant wait to return.

I do LOVE the sushi here and I'm a guy who's worked around Japanese culture (including 8 months in Tokyo) so I'm decently experienced in that field. 燭he long lines, ambivalent wait staff, over-priced saki, and poor beer selection brings it down a bit.

The best sushi restaurant in Little Tokyo hands down. �Toyo-san keeps the menu simple and rather traditional versus all of the sushi restaurants that you see around town. 燭he freshness of the fish speaks for itself. 燦o gimmicks like the conveyor belt sushi places, just good food. 營f available, we always try to sit near where he is at the sushi bar. �Their a la carte menu isn't too extensive besides the usual items found at a Japanese restaurant like edamame, chicken karaage, miso soups plus some other items. This place is always busy which shows you that the food here is really good. 燳ou often see people waiting outside prior to them opening both at lunch and dinner. 燭he parking lot isn't very big and also has other restaurants so it does fill up rather quickly. �I really like their food and is one of the last real Japanese restaurants in JTown.

S uch good sushi. U rchin of the sea, yummy. S almon is my favorite. H ands down best sashimi around. I nstantly melts in your mouth. G enuine sushi chefs. E xcellent service. N ever disappoints. Thinking about how good Sushi Gen is gets me a little delirious, as you can see by my sad excuse for a poem above. But, really, it's legit. Love the atmosphere, the warmth and friendliness from the chefs -- and most of all, love their sushi. Now, I love how warm rice tastes with sushi (Sugarfish) but Sushi-Gen makes me feel at home. The cuts are phenomenal, the fish tastes fresh and almost melts in your mouth. Great fish:rice:wasabi ratio + great service. Easily a favorite spot. Worth the wait. GO. The end.

After hearin everybody talk about dis sushi joint on yelp, i knew that it was gon' be good. But the best sushi restaurant in LA? Nuh-uh. Wherever that may be, I sho as hell haven't found it yet. The sashimi lunch platter is worth it for $15. But it came with cooked salmon, wtf? I wanted sashimi not no gad damn cooked fish. It also had some weird fish/green onion pate type stuff that I didn't care for. The service aint bad or good, but I can live with dat. You can't expect to go to any asian restaurant and get good service now, lets be real. The inside is kinda run down and dark, but you aint in lil tokyo for the ambiance. For parking, just use the lot for convenience and pay 2.00 for lunch time. 燭here were so many unemployed people up in that joint for a Monday afternoon.. You know what they say... No one in LA works.... well it's true, and i'm just tryna get by on my EBT like the rest of em. Ya heard?

Best sashimi in LA. Gen is both overrated and underrated. There are some bad qualities of this place but when you encounter sushi this good, you forgive and forget right? There's nothing fancy about this place and you have to go through a lot to get a seat. Service is always bad and you are rushed from the moment you sit down. I have had a forgetful experience here before but that was because I ordered other things besides their sashimi. The bottom line is that Gen has amazing sashimi and nothing more. The good news is that it is light years beyond most sushi joints. Gen doesn't serve pseudo-fancy rolls and instead gets down to the core of cutting premium fish. At Gen, you will eat the best sashimi you have ever eaten. The sushi actually does "melt in your mouth". You leave the place wondering where the heck they get their fish shipments from. Gen will merit a spot in any sushi-lover's top 5 list. Go 15-20 mins early before lunch hour opens to get in nice and easy. Highlights: 1. Lunch Special sashimi : Great price �2 . Yellowtail collar 3. Toro : You come here for this. Get some.

This is my go-to place for sashimi lunch on a weekday. They're closed for lunch on weekends, and their best deal is the sashimi lunch. If you look around, 7/10 people order that, and it's not surprising. They have a decent amount of raw fish and everything is fresh because of such high turnover rates. You don't get raw salmon, which sucks, but you do get like three variations of tuna, hamachi, grilled salmon, and octopus. I mean, the plate comes full, and it's very satisfying. The best part is it's only $15!! Oh, I forgot they also give you miso soup, pickled cabbage, and tofu. Their tofu is by far the best tofu I've ever had. I don't even like tofu, but I can eat this for days. It's pretty much stewed in soy sauce and sugar. The texture is so soft and literally melts in your mouth. It's SO yummy!! If their sashimi wasn't such a great deal I might have to come just for their tofu! People who rate this place lower than four stars probably don't come for the lunch sashimi, which makes me sad their missing out on such yumminess! People, that's why we read yelp reviews before we order!! Lastly, I deducted a star just because I've been coming here for at least five years now, and they've definitely taken advantage of their popularity. First, they've repeatedly increased their lunch sashimi price. I started eating this at $12.50 a plate, and now after two increases it's now $15. Still a deal, but leaves you wondering when they'll hike it up again. Also, they used to have a complimentary pickled seaweed dish along with the stewed tofu. I used to eat that with the rice, but now it's completely gone. Finally, green tea used to be free, but now its like $1.50 or something silly. C'mon, you're an established Japanese restaurant. Please serve tea for free!

I have two favorite sushi restaurants in LA and this is one of them. The fish is always fresh and has solid flavor.

After much research, my gf decided to take me here to celebrate my bday. I was really pleased that we got seated right away despite how some restaurants still make you wait 10-20mins even when you have reservations. We ordered the sashimi deluxe plate, the yellowtail collar, soft shell crab and uni, sweet shrimp, toro sushi (way too much food for two). The food came out promptly and the service was excellent. For the most part, everything tasted good (all the vibrant colors made the food taste even better). The sweet shrimp (loved the fried head) was top-notch and the toro was exceptional. However, the salmon, yellow tail, and the tuna tasted a little off. I have been eating sashimi long enough to know what each fish should taste like (plus I just had it 3days ago with coworkers). Against my better judgement, I still ate it (talk about being a top candidate for the Darwin award). Oh my, what a mistake that was. Within 30mins of concluding our dinner, I had one of the worst stomach aches in my life (this ranks among the top 5). Instead of cutting/ eating my bday cake, I spent the rest of the night in the bathroom. Its safe to say this ruined the rest of my evening. Since we ordered way too much food, we took half of it home. Well that half is going straight into the trash can; a $160 dinner. Thanks for the memorial birthday Sushi-Gen. Now if you can excuse me, I need to go chug Gatorade to replenish my lost "fluids".

I've eaten here more times than I can count. I've only been disappointed once but everyone has an off day. Overall the quality of fish is very fresh. The only thing I don't like here is the sashimi combo because it's just alot of tuna. So I normally order sashimi or sushi by the piece or the sushi deluxe combination. But I'd recommend the Okonomi Sushi your choice sushi or Okonomi Sashimi your choice sashimi. Even though Sushi-Gen is super popular to be honest I'm not that impressed by it. Don't get me wrong, it's good and I still eat here often it just doesn't "wow me". I still think Asanebo is way better, even though it's not as popular. It might be because I feel like Sushi-Gen is a tad bit overrated. There's always a long wait here as well. If you're visiting LA and you want to try a popular sushi spot, this is definitely one of the places to go to but I'd still recommend Asanebo.

I've been coming here ever since I can remember. My parents love sushi, so they use to drag me here as a kid. Of course I didn't really appreciate sushi till I was much older. When I was younger I would get an order of California rolls, and gobble them all up. Now it's a mix of sashimi and sushi, everything from uni to salmon, of course there is always the occasional California roll to remind me of my childhood.

We had 6 in our party, and had called well in advance, but still ended up waiting at least 15 minutes out front. 燱e were seated in a very cramped 4 person booth that was quite uncomfortable. 燙lose table, poor legroom. 燭he sake was served quickly. After we carefully coordinated our 6 orders and placed them, the waitress returned 3 separate times to inform us that they had run out of hamachi toro (our most desired selection and the impetus for our visit), spanish mackerel (another favorite) and the grilled hamachi collar (when done well its a revelation). 燬adly, the snapper collar I ordered instead was both uninspired and overcooked. 燬till good, but nowhere near what it could have been. After we lived down the disappointment of being unable to enjoy our favorite selections, most of the meal was quite enjoyable. 燦ot the best I've had, but certainly delicious and of course fresh fish. 燭hose who ordered hand rolls were disappointed when they were served what were essentially uncut maki. 燱ith none of the delicious, unique textures of a proper handroll, it was a unanimously unsuccessful portion of the meal. The service was quite acceptable, but unremarkable. 營t is hard to judge attentiveness when most visits by the server bring terrible news from the kitchen. 營 appreciate being informed immediately when something is unavailable. 燭he waitress may have done her best, but the result was a constant series of disappointments. 營 felt bad for her. 燫eading other reviews, it appears that running out of choice varieties is not uncommon for Sushi Gen. Finally, nothing prepared us for the moment when the bill arrived. 燭his is the most overpriced restaurant I have ever visited in my life. 燱e certainly didn't help by ordering a la carte style, rather than taking advantage of one of the sashimi or sushi combinations. 燦onetheless, for the amount of fish that we were served, the price was outrageous. 燱e were overcharged by $27, requiring an irritating process of going through the bill line by line with the server to make sure nothing else was amiss. 燘ear in mind that budget was not an issue for this party in any way. I personally find the sheer value proposition at this restaurant offensive. 燭his is not the best sushi any of us had experienced, but it was most certainly priced that way. Don't believe the hype.

Sushi Gen was the first sushi place I tried when the SO moved to Los Angeles. I started out as a Sushi Gen noob, meaning I was one of those people outside of the restaurant at 10:30am waiting to get a table during lunch. My initial perception was WTF. Why would anyone wait just to eat lunch? **Pardon my boorishness - this was maybe 6 months after I moved from the rustic land of hicks and I hadn't really acclimated to LA yet.** I also wasn't acclimated to the fact that it is OK for old Asian couples hold places in line for the 5 other friends they plan on having lunch with that day. I understood the reason for the wait almost instantaneously and I haven't looked back since. Sure, the lunch plate-thing is awesome, but big pieces of fish are ever better! Whenever the hubs and I go to Sushi Gen now, it's the bar only. Well, minus the times where I have a borderline-crazy craving for the Uni Platter. Since I'm not picky and love almost everything, we always go for omakase with additional pieces of yellowtail belly and yes, uni. The uni they serve is from San Diego and is most likely the same kind that Sushi Ota in San Diego serves. As a former San Diegan, I believe the uni (well, the sea urchins) are harvested from the Point Loma kelp forest. I'll just talk about the uni a little more. PERFECT texture, "tastes like the ocean" and is served at the PERFECT temperature. Love it. Love it. Love it. Oh yes, also try the yellowtail collar if they still have them available. There are only so many Japanese Amberjack collars available per night. While the price point is a little high for my regular consumption, there is no stopping me (not even a line, which usually there isn't for bar seating) when the SO OKs my choice for dinner. If you aren't giving this place at least a 4, there is something SERIOUSLY wrong with your taste buds.

I used to eat here quite a bit when it was on my way to work back then. 營 stopped coming here because of the stupid hype and the ridiculous lines. 燱ell, I also found fresher sashimi elsewhere too. 燗nyway, today I happened to be in the area, so we decided to drop by for lunch. 燱e arrived 10 mins before their lunch hours starting at 11 am. 燭here was already a line forming. 燱e didn't mind the line much as it was close to 11 am. 燱e waited 'til 11:15 am before they started seating people.

Made last minute reservations for Friday night at 9 (with the amount of people that were there, I'd say reservations are necessary! So crowded!) and was super happy with the food! We had the edamame that came with a separate dish of salt so you can control the amount of salt sprinkled on top. We also had an order of the sashimi deluxe (~$30-$35) that had a wonderful variety of sashimi! There was the usual tuna, salmon, yellowtail but there was also some squid, octopus, crab, shrimp, tuna poke, tamago, spicy tuna, grilled salmon, and some brown, salty, earthy/flavorful fish mmmmm! There was a lot of sashimi on that plate. I also got an order of small tenpura that came with two shrimps, zucchini, potato, and eggplant which was all very tasty. We also ordered off the sushi/nigiri menu, which all came with two pieces: Japanese red snapper, uni, aji, yellow tail belly, toro, octopus and two bowls of rice. I was full and my date was uncomfortably full because he ate the bowl of rice and demolished the sashimi plate. I, on the other hand, wanted rice to accompany my tenpura so I was okay. I probably missed an order or two off the sushi/nigiri menu, and our bill came to $106. Our server was a sweet, older lady that helped me choose the best fish to try and on the way out, the hosts asked if we needed our parking validated so that was very nice :) We will definitely be back for the food and the service!

Three and a half stars. I usually go here for lunch since I work downtown. This place is well known and get very busy at lunch time. expect long wait lines. the service is good, the place is fine. They have other stuff besides sushi, but you know what, when you go to a sushi place, it's best to get the sushi. You know what I'm sayin? Now, I know people love this place, and everyone gives it five stars, but to me this place is good, but not great. The Fish is good. The cuts of fish are pretty good. This place is solid; It's good, but not super great. And this place is pretty expensive. for what you are paying I think you would expect a little more. check it out.

So a coupla years ago some journalist did a piece on them and bragged how they get the freshest cuts at the fish market -- so now everybody that eats here thinks that only Sushi-Gen gets the freshest cuts at the fish market. 燱hat the hell is wrong with you folks -- you think there's only enough fresh sushi in the Pacific Ocean for one sushi restaurant in Los Angeles? 燫eally? 燨kay. �First time here, waited forever to get seated. 燱e sat at a table because the bar wait was much longer. 燭he atmosphere here is not one that caters to a culinary experience -- now, their sushi is not on a conveyor belt , but as a customer, I was. 燛ating here was much more like eating at a Chinese dim sum restaurant: 燭hey rush you in, serve you quickly and try very hard to rush you out because they have so many other people impatiently waiting for a table. 營t literally felt as if they were slinging the sushi at us without having to stop; I had to stand up several times to get our server to stop and give us some attention. �Most of the crowd here liked that quick pace movement because customers were also hustling around the restaurant; pushing their way through. 燝oing to the restroom was much like being in a bumper car; it was actually fun -- it was the best part of Sushi-Gen. 燝etting up to go to the restroom was so much fun, I did it twice. 營'm telling you, it was a very punk-rock-mosh-pit like experience. 燬o the quick loud IHOP pace here made me realize that this wasn't going to be my type of place. 營f I'm in the middle of a bustling area of the city, you go into vibes like this to grab a coupla bights, but why even bother having seats. 燭he place should just have a bar all the way around, where you just stand, eat quickly and walk out. 爐he problem is that it is not a bustling part of the city; it is in a nondescript mini mall on the east end of Little Tokyo. 燨kay, okay -- yes, you can tell I was very bothered by this... the last thing I'll say on this matter is that when I go out to dinner and expect to pay over 100 bucks for dinner, the service better rock and I'm gonna want to sit there for two, three hours and drink a bunch. 燨kay? As far as the sushi is concerned I'll make it as quick as my experience. 燦o Bonito, no Mackerels, no Anchovy, no Sardine, no Shad, no Octopus, no Jellyfish. 燭here's Red Snapper, but you can't judge a sushi restaurant on it because everybody serves fresh Red Snapper -- good, fresh, red snapper is not hard to come by. 燭he best Sea Urchin in the world is caught off the coast of Santa Barbara, so that is always going to be California fresh too. Sushi-Gen had a 爁are variety of tunas (by the way, Atlantic Bluefin Tuna is endangered and is not fresh on the Pacific Ocean -- BECAUSE IT COMES FROM THE ATLANTIC! 燱TF! �Serve some fresh Pacific fish!). 燦ow, they only had one variety of Salmon. 營 asked what it was; our server didn't know... hmm. �A while later.... hmm, hmm.... later, 爏he came back and said it was Atlantic Salmon... 爃a ha ha. 燦ow Atlantic Salmon is not from the Atlantic Ocean; it is what they call 'Farm-raised'. 燭he only thing farm-raised Salmon is good for is for skull-fucking (because of its high-fat-greasy texture) or feeding to your cat (Not nearly as tasty and nutritional as wild caught and they have to dye it pink because farm raised salmon uses so many antibiotics that its meat is always a sickly white; not the traditional pink of real salmon -- So much for the freshness test = fail). 燬he must have noticed the look on my face because she didn't wait for a response and quickly offered me some Yellowfin or Albacore. 燦ow I usually don't even eat Salmon or Tuna unless it is really a rare or excitingly fresh catch (Tuna is fish for people that don't like the taste of fish, it's good, it's crisp, it's not a challenge to the pallet, it's the chicken of the sea... but I like fish), because they had nothing else for me to eat, these were my only options. �The truth is that this place is about as fresh as a Las Vegas Prostitute in a state of rigamortis from two days stuffed under the mattress. 燫eally! �It's a joke! 燭heir fare is generic and their service is crystal-meth induced. 燦o thanks. P.S. � months after this first experience, a friend convinced me to try it with him again -- that sitting at the bar would be a better experience. 燭hey had more choices of fish this time, but I was not impressed with the quality. 營 enjoy my friends company, but this place gets one star.

Like all mediocre reviews, I will start by saying "I don't understand what the hype is about." I've been here three times: twice for lunch and once for dinner. For lunch, I have tried the sushi bar and the sashimi special (to go). The only thing that had the WOW factor for me was the red snapper (it is twice as expensive as other sushi joints though), the amaebi (sweet shrimp), and the toro. But I can't afford to order red snapper & toro everytime since those two things cost already $20 and that's only 4 pieces. I still need to eat another 6 or so pieces to get full. You order the ankimo (fish liver) and you are only presented with two pieces or mediocre stuff - it's not even silky smooth as it should be. The Salmon Skin salad was horrible. On top of a skimpy salad are pieces of rubbery and soft pieces of what should be "crispy salmon skin". For dinner, it came out to about $50 per person without ordering toro. For lunch, it came out to be $80 per person when order toro and all the good stuff. So you can make your own judgement call. Personally, I would prefer other places but I'd like to keep it a secret so it doesn't get as packed as sushi gen is everyday. :)

everything that needed to be said about sashimi/sushi at Sushi Gen has already been said. I shall add my two cents about the salmon dinner/with teriyaki sauce (photos uploaded) first off, it came with sashimi(7 assorted pieces), miso soup, a couple of side dishes, a bowl of rice (BEST rice i've had at restaurants), potato salad, and some lettuce salad on the side with a slice of oranges. onto the salmon, it was really really well cooked, flavorful and i loved the teriyaki sauce with it. all this for $24, i actually think it is VERY reasonable priced, for the quality of the salmon, and the sashimi alone. I would definitely come back!

This is absolutely one of my most favorite places to go for sushi. 營 originally read about Sushi Gen in the LA Times a few years ago in the food section. 營 felt like I had discovered my secret go to place for sushi. 營 had NO IDEA how famous and popular this place is. �The quality of the fish is outstanding, fresh and tasty....never, never fishy or foul. 營 usually do not sit at the Sushi Bar and have table service. 燭he servers are 100% Japanese. 燭hey do an adequate job taking orders and bringing food to your table. 營n addition to the sushi I can recommend any type of tempura you like. 燭he shrimps are large and taste delicious. 營f you order a Sushi-Combo Dinner you will get a side dish of some of the best seaweed salads I have ever had! (Well I have not had that many seaweed salads....but here at Sushi Gen it is out of this World!) Sometimes if we are going to the Music Center or Disney Hall for a show we order food and pick it up before and have a truly special meal before the show.

Came on a Saturday approx half an hour before opening time. There was already a line forming! Glad we got there early, by the time they opened the line was huge. Staff is very friendly. Try the Sashimi Deluxe platter. Its huge and a great value. I've shared this and a side of rice with another person and it has been more than enough. Sashimi Deluxe: http://www.yelp.com/user� Toro- So fatty, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. Hands down, favorite. Yellowtail belly- Delicious, not as fatty as toro Albacore- Soft and very buttery Spicy Tuna- Very good here Closed on Sundays. There is always a wait, and the wait is always WORTH IT!

This place has the best lunch sushi/sashimi plate ever. for $15, you can get sashimi lunch with various sorts of fish, miso soup and a bowl of rice. They are pretty large in size and will definitely make you full. I tried their uni, toro, and unagi separately and man.. i gotta say their fish is very fresh. Pros - very fresh sashimi/sushi - $15 killer lunch sashimi deal that comes with rice and miso - servers are quick with your orders and attentive - nice interior decoration and friendly environment Cons - long wait (30min~1hr) - $15 sashimi lunch special doesn't apply on the weekends - parking can be hectic sometimes.

If you don't eat sashimi... don't come here. Seriously. For awhile I was not a fat of sashimi at all, just rolls and such since I wasn't a fan of cold fish sliding down my throat. So when I came here my first couple times, I was not the one to be judging this place, since it really isn't that friendly in options for non-sashimi eaters. It's like going to an American restaurant to order a quesadilla, you know? Just not worth it. But as a fan of sashimi (now, hurrah!), their $15 sashimi deluxe is such a GREAT deal. So fresh that it just melts and of a large variety, the TORO (yummmmm) And really, it's not hard to tell if its lacking quality--trust, its not. You can tell by the crazy lines, always, outside the door. Convenient with parking, if you're in the area, this is definitely one of LA's must trys.

3 1/2 stars. It's a 5 minute drive from Silver Lake which is an absolute plus. 營t was our first time here last night and we were really excited because we still can't seem to find amazing sushi on the East Side. Sigh. So, off to Sushi Gen we went, where we waited 40 minutes for a table. We got there around 5:45 on a Saturday hoping to beat the rush, but this place is so popular, the rush was already in full swing. The ambience is cute, super authentic in a little strip mall in Little Tokyo. 燭he sushi was 爂ood, not amazing to us. We got the: albacore tataki white fish ponzu shrimp tempura tuna nigiri salmon nigiri halibut nigiri snapper nigiri yellowtail nigiri baby yellowtail nigiri spicy tuna roll Of all of the above, the yummiest was the snapper. 營t had sea salt and lemon and was really refreshing. 燭he rest of the sushi was good and fresh, much of it melted in our mouths, but I went in with such high expectations... We liked it. But the price was also pretty steep. 營 dunno, I don't know if I'll be rushing back. 營 still prefer some other spots West of La Cienega to Gen, unfortunately for the mileage in my car.

Wasn't the biggest sashimi fan before Sushi-Gen but I'm sold now! Went on a Tuesday lunchtime and the wait wasn't long at all. The lunch special is where it's at anyway! The portion for the lunch special is huge and it comes with a nice assortment of fishies. All things considered, if you want a large, filling portion of sashimi at great quality for a reasonable price, do the lunch special! Can't really speak to anything else though :).

Another reviewer says, "Don't tell anyone about this place". Well. Considering that the line at lunch is about an hour or so of wait time, you get the sense that that piece of advice may no longer be pertinent. I lived across the street from this spot for 4 years. So you can say that I had my fair share of Sushi-Gen (pronounced with a Hard G) experiences. Let me give you the rundown. 1) Sushi: SOME of their fish is fresh. Not Tsukiji market fresh, but ok. Some things that are not so amazingly fresh also happen to cost a bloody fortune here like UNI (sea urchin) and O-TORO, CHU-TORO, (Tuna). I have even had salmon here that was lackluster and a little fishy. It was honestly better at Nijiya. It's funny, because when the chefs serve it up to you, they have this little guilty look in their eyes that sort of says, "it's not my fault, the owner makes us", and that's probably true, while not an excuse. As you sit and order, you will notice most of the customers asking for "Spicy Tuna Handrolls", "Spider Rolls", and the like. And if you know what kind of sushi chefs rejoice in drowning their fish in mayo, siracha, etc. - you know where you're eating. 2) Why so busy? A long time ago, I heard that this place was run Japanese-style and built a great rep, excellent service and the chefs made the call on the fish. Reputations - good or bad - can last a lifetime. This one floats on it. No longer Japanese style, but perhaps owned by one - this is kind of like a Dim Sum experience without the cart ladies and MSG. It's a buffet line of pushy/shoving people, and mostly frequented by Taiwanese, Koreans and "in the know" Gai Jin that are ignorant enough to consider this good. Japanese stay away for the most part as the service is often sub par - meaning that the whole etiquette, and beauty of the Japanese dining experience doesn't really exist here. And of course price is relatively high unless you get one of their cheapy special lunches which many people line up for 1 hour to munch on. God knows why when they could get this from Hisa-san at Toranoko for about 15 bucks: http://www.danconiacreat�First time I came here, I made the error of ordering 4-5 pieces of sushi. When the bill came, I couldn't believe it - 25 bucks! Wow. I mean, that's not too cheap for a little snack at lunch. Then the waitress came back with my credit card receipt...um...75.00, not 25!!! I could not believe it. So yah. Order the specials if you must go here at lunch. On rare occasion, some poor fool friend of mine who heard from his buds that this was somehow "authentic" (whatever that means), and we had to go. They all learned their lesson. And then once or twice, I convinced myself that I must of just had a bad experience here 6 times, and should try once more. On the last attempt, after dropping 200 on enough food to feed my goldfish, we went to Mako sushi just to have a better memory of the evening. Bottom line is that this place runs on hype/steam mostly from people who are used to Korean-owned fake Japanese restaurants, or faux-Japanese like Kagaya. They come here and taste something pretty close to what sushi should be. But then, it's a miserable fail in comparison with Mako just up the street. But then at Mako, you need to invest a few trips until he knows and love you. All in all, if you want a one stop wonder - try Kimagure in Pasadena. Likely the best overall newbie Sushi experience in North America.

I've seen this place everytime I go to Kagaya and always wanted to try it. My buddy recommended it and I gave it a shot today. For $50 along with a 15% tip I was able to get the following: Spicy Tuna Hand Roll Yellowtail Sushi Albacore Sushi Salmon Sushi Grilled Yellowtail Plate For the freshness $50 is a great value. 營t was amazingly fresh. It's no wonder there is always a wait here. I sat at the sushi bar to bypass the line. The only problem is that I didn't have access to their lunch menu...which restricted what I could order at the sushi bar and made my bill higher. No worries because it forced me to test out how fresh the fish was. It passed with flying colors. I barely used any soy sauce becuase I didn't want to miss out on the great fresh taste. Definitly in the top 5 for sushi spots in LA. The attmosphere is old school sushi restaurant. No frills but old school japan feel to it. You can also validate for 2 hours in the parking lot for $2.

Been here twice since my first visit; Once for lunch and once for dinner. As usual, there was about a 30min-45min wait in each occasion but that was expected. You can always walk around if the wait is too long since Little Tokyo is really nice. I got the sashimi lunch and dinner respectively. The lunch sashimi is a bit smaller than the dinner, but for the price and the quality of food its a total steal. The dinner sashimi comes with some more slices of sashimi and tempura. On both occasions, the fish was melt in your mouth fresh and the food was delicious. Service was good. This place never disappoints. I will be coming back whenever I can.

I have worked behind sushi bar and worked as server at sushi restaurant, and this is the best sushi in southern california. Price can be very resonable if you just want a bowl of chirashi, which is the definition of The Chirashi, chirashi other than is is pretty much junk. But price could go up too, last time I was here was a day after Valentine's day. (Valentines Day is one of the most busy day in sushi industry.)

1417 Reviews....make that 1418 now. Ridiculously (so ridiculous i don't even know if i spelled that right) good deal! Sashimi Lunch Combo ......$15. Mostly tuna, but high quality and fresh. You can taste the "sweetness" in the fish, that's how good it is. They slices are nice and thick so you can fully appreciate the texture of raw fish. So why 4 stars and not 5? Lunch Sashimi Combo: Great great deal, but lacks variety you would expect from a "combo". It was literally tuna prepared 4 different ways. I would have liked if a larger variety of fish was in it. Ankimo: Monk fish liver is prized for being very creamy, but this was not the case. It was rather dry and hard. Albacore: Sear on it wasn't tasty, fish itself wasn't that great either. Giant clam special: clam was great, except half the dish was mushroom :( Impressed at the price point for the Sashimi Combo, and the quality of the fish.

I never thought I'd see the day people line up to eat sushi at 11am. I mean, I was super skeptical at first, but once we got inside and quickly ordered the Sashimi Lunch, my mind was forever blown. Like WHOOOOOOOOOOSH on the fly. The quality of the fish was fantastic. Super fresh and oh so tasty. And they don't try to skimp you; you get a whole lot of sashimi with your order. Oh, and you also get a side of rice, tofu, salad and miso soup. All for only $15! What a deal. I would seriously suggest getting in line by 10:30am. Anything after that, you might be waiting at least an hour for a table when it opens. Recommendation: Sashimi Lunch Special

Awesome all around. Crazy busy. Didn't have reservations so waited with a pile of other people and had an amazing meal. A fun place if you are not an LA native. I really enjoyed waiting in line and talking to people about how good this place was going to be. Not like the more sedate upscale places in Chicago or New York, but one of the best fast placed sushi experiences I have ever had. Yum, yum, and yum!

Yes, Yelp Rating says it all. Meh. I've had better. I don't understand why this place is so popular. Good quality fish. Good atmosphere. but does not justify the price. 燦othing special. with amount of money they charge, I should get better service and better sushi. Maybe lunch is better & cheaper?

I love sushi and I've been to a lot of different places, but this place beat all of them. Their sashimi is so fresh it melts in your mouth!! Very authentic.

This place has, in my opinion, the best and most freshest fish in the LA area. (sashimi style) The sashimi is fresh, flavorful, and decently priced. I ordered the sashimi combo for dinner and it was HUGE! There were at least 20 pieces of thick sashimi so it's definitely meant to be shared. Also, I tried their calamari and fried tofu which were also pretty good. Although the lunch specials make it more worthwhile, I still believe the dinner is well worth it for the quality of the fish. On the negative side, the wait can be pretty long so be sure to make a reservation at least a day in advance. Also, parking can also be somewhat difficult since the plaza is pretty popular and fills up fast. However, there are plenty of street parking around the block as long as you're willing to pay for the meter. This restaurant is definitely worth the price and wait for the quality of fish so if you love fresh sashimi, definitely check out Sushi-Gen!

Lunch is served!!! :) My boyfriend and I came here because he knows I love me some good 爏ushi/sashimi/fish (even though he can't stand fish). And although a bit pricey for a typical lunch date, Sushi-Gen is as good as I remember it. The only thing I ever order from here is the Unaju + Sashimi combo... but it's so yummy! I'm such a sucker for eel-over-rice dishes, especially the good ones that have no fish bones and aren't smothered in sauce. The sashimi is impeccable-- so good. Foodgasm alert. My boyfriend got the chicken teriyaki and he liked it just fine so woot :) Maybe more lunch dates to come ~!! I want to try that sashimi lunch special soon. Definitely cheaper than my Unaju + Sashimi combo. Things to note: *line is LONG. LONG LONG LONG. must anticipate at least a 30-40 minute wait, especially so during lunch/dinner hours. * parking lot is available. with validation = $3.00 * all parties must be there to be seated.

By far, the BEST sushi. Lunch or dinner, I'm having a full tray of uni. 營 had the uni and sashimi combination lunch. 燭hough it costs $32 for this lunch order, you have to consider what you're receiving: 爃ot tofu, miso soup, a little salad, a bowl of rice, mixed sashimi, a tray of uni, a little tuna tartare, sliced cucumbers, and STILL more! 燛verything is extremely fresh, they're generous with the portion of sashimi, and you finish your food wanting to go back every day as long as you can afford it. 燭he service is friendly, and the food comes out quickly. �Note: 爐his plays STAYS busy from the time the doors open. 燭he wait can be 20-30 minutes relatively quickly. 營t's worth the wait, the money, and the drive to have this sushi.

This is most definitely my favorite sushi spot. 燭his place doesn't have the atmosphere of those trendy "sushi" places, but there is a reason why you will always wait for a table even with a reservation and you are excited when you're name is finally called. Hands down the best Sashimi and Uni I have tried, even the chicken teriyaki is well done. 營 do not recall seeing the Americanized rolls here, which to me is all presentation and nothing special. This place is not cheap. 燦ight out for two typically sets me back close to $150-175, depending on how much I drink. Absolutely make a reservation here.

Very fresh and tasty. We tried reputable sushi/sashimi places for long and this place is at the upper tier for food but still reasonably priced. Service was good and decor was simple and clean. Sit at the bar for Omakase and let the sushi chef serve the fresh delights. It can escalate the bill quickly but is well worth it. Make sure to make a reservation (especially for bar seating) or arrive earlier than opening time on the weekends.

I made it back here, this time for LUNCH because I was dying to try their $15 sashimi lunch combo which by the way is a STEAL! I came with 3 other friends. They ordered the chirashi bowl which is sashimi on top of rice in a bowl. It's pretty much what I got but mine had the sashimi on a separate plate, and mine came with more sashimi, and more rice, AND miso soup AND salad AND this mini tofu dish. This is what I mean by a steal! The $15 price is seriously too good to be true. And the sashimi quality is amazingggg! SOOOO FRESH!! I'm salivating right now thinking about it. I also ordered 1 albacore sushi separate because I love albacore and they seriously do it right here! Amazing! So if you want in on this, make sure you come at lunch for the $15 price and order the SASHIMI lunch combo (not the sushi combo). Service was also spectacular! Our waitress was super sweet and took good care of us. This is still, hands down my favorite sushi place EVER! Nothing else beats it! :)

A HELLA LONG WAIT...well 40 mins. We can there when it just opened like literally just opened. There was already a line forming. I recommend being there at 11 or best 1045. There is a parking lot that cost 2 dollars with validation for 2 hours. Not too bad, but if you are stuck waiting then you better eat fast. Though the guy seemed really chill since we went over by 10 minutes and he still just charged us 2 bucks. Got the Sashimi plate. Kind of felt smaller than the picture but hey you get a lot of variety for 15 bucks. Sad that it was not raw salmon but rather baked salmon. I wish they told you what you were eating, but what is the surprise about that. The fish does taste fresh. and it comes with rice and soup and tofu and pickled carrots. The other stuff, looks good but it seems people come here for the sashimi plate. Also if you sit at the bar, you can't order the sashimi plate. Sashimi plate is for lunch only :(

If you're looking for fresh sashimi, this is the place to go. That's if you're willing to wait in line for about 45-70 minutes. Their portions used to be a lot bigger (3-4 years ago) but I'm sure they're affected by the economic downturn.

I don't know about you, but I don't know of another sushi place that has this quality of FRESH fish at these prices, especially during lunch. This place is a little more expensive for dinner, so come for lunch!!! The "special" that makes this place so special is the $15 sashimi. It comes with a variety of sashimi, not just plainly sliced ones, but also spicy tuna mixes as well. The platter really depends on the season and what fish is available, which I love because you know you are being taken care of when the chefs are so thoughtful. The special also comes with miso soup, salad, handmade tofu side dish, and rice. Talk about a deal! Now parking is a little bit of an issue. You can park in the plaza for $3 or park elsewhere and walk. The wait for lunch is usually around an hour. In the beginning of the year they also give every table a calendar for the new year!

Probably some of the best quality sashimi I've had in LA. Ordered the deluxe platter and got a nice assortment of the traditional stuff, nothing too adventurous. We ordered the fatty tuna and yellow-tail on the side as well, and like the tuna and salmon in the deluxe platter it just melts in your mouth. But for the price, I would expect this much. That being said, if you're looking for rolls, go elsewhere cause their menu is very sparse on the crazy sushi roll concoctions you might find elsewhere.

My dad told me about this place, so I brought a friend who is from japan to eat some sushi here. We sat at the bar where the japanese sushi chef and my japanese friend struck up a pretty personal conversation since it seemed they had a lot to talk about, I did not understand since they were speaking in japanese but they got a long very well. He was very satisfied and was so happy I had brought him that he insisted on paying for the bill which was not cheap since after we ate a lot of good sushi. We ordered a lot of toro, ama ebi, uni, unagi, and he ordered some octopus and squid which I did not like, but my favorite is the toro and uni. Everything was so fresh and tasted orgasmic. My japanese friend just kept making these faces of pleasure whenever he took a bite, LOL. After our first great experience here, I started bringing other people here. This places gets really crowded, but if you go early, the wait is not long. I have brought several dates to this places and it is a great place to bring your girlfriend or boyfriend. I hate oyster and never liked it until I tried the oyster here.. it was so fresh and delicious, also the sake is high quality as with everything on the menu, my girlfriend always orders the oyster and sake. Now if my japanese friend who has great taste, wealthy, and born and raised in Japan in the city of Sendai approves of the sushi here, then you can't go wrong coming here for "real" sushi.

Lunch special is great, get here before 11:30 if you don't want to wait (yes, even though it opens at 11:30) Got there at 11:50 and there was a 45 minute wait for a party of 6. Luckily, turn over is rather quick. Sashimi lunch special is AMAZING and only $15. Was enough to fill 3 guys, too. Lunch special comes with tofu, picked cucumbers/cabbage (flavor is different from suonomono though) and a big bowl of rice. Fish was super fresh and melts in your mouth. I also liked the seaweed that was served underneath the squid and sashimi. The host is super friendly as well. Make sure your whole party is there because they can't seat you until then. I have been here for dinner before and it gets rather pricey because the fish is so good you just keep ordering more!!! Don't waste your appetite on sushi/rolls if you can help it. The sashimi is too fresh and too delicious to pass up!

Sushi Gen is good. It's a really reliable sushi spot in LA but always, always busy! The vibe is very Japanese. I wouldn't say this is the best sushi ever, but it is consistently good. I would stay away from the sushi dinner and go with either the Sashimi + rice bowl or Chirashi. I was surprised that neither the Sashimi dinner, Chirashi or the Sushi dinner included salmon as I feel Salmon is one of the staples of any combination at a sushi joint. 燨ther people that dined with me felt depraved of salmon and put in a side order...only to say it wasn't very good. The waitress did mention in the beginning that the sushi chef will choose the freshest ingredients for the combinations so maybe he didn't include the salmon on purpose. They did however, include toro in all the combination dinners. I had a side order of the Spanish Mackerel at the suggestion of Yelp, and it did not disappoint. It literally melted in my mouth so I was happy. Sashimi dinner is A LOT of raw fish. I think you can safely share it between two people if you just add a bowl of rice. Be sure to make a reservation, and also be sure that all your party is there on time. Sushi Gen is a huge stickler for the right amount of people being there on time for their seats. They made this clear over the phone but we had someone who wanted to come last minute and the host made sort of a fuss over it. I completely understand since they were super busy and made sure over the phone about our party, but my friend wasn't having any of it...haha. Also, there is a 10 dollar minimum per seat so don't come here with 6 people when only 1 is eating.

If you want great quality sushi, you should try this place. This is by far my favorite sushi joint in Los Angeles. My girlfriend finally got to try this place for the first time and she enjoyed her sushi as much as mine. Note, if you sit at the bar, you will not be allowed to order the lunch special and be prepare to spend $$$ for quality sushi. I ended up paying $125 for sushi but the quality was really good. The sushi chef was very attentive and recommended us to something new. If you do not know what to order, ask what is good and the chef will make something good. Service was great as usual. The lady kept refilling our green tea without us asking for it. Definitely a place for 1st timer if you are willing to shell out the cash. If not, arrive early...I would say aaround 11:15am to wait on a table to order the lunch special.

I can't recall how many times I've been here....but lets just say it's a lot. And yet I recently noticed that I've never wrote a review about them? Probably because I rather not reveal that I've been cheating on Angotei and Nana San...but hey, this place is in LA. I guess it's ok for me to have a ritual Sushi Bar in LA then..right? I hate to admit it, but the quality of fish at Sushi Gen rivals (if not supersede) that of Nana San (which i thought was impossible). The lunch scene is always chaotic..mainly with folks that want the lunch box/value meal, which is only served in the main dining room however if you're just interested in sushi, there is usually NEVER a wait...they'll seat you immediately at the bar. There is a minimum order at the bar during lunch (4 orders/person is nothing....that's an appetizer - oh yeah, ONLY sushi at the bar - don't even think about ordering a rainbow roll here) Here are a few must have's if you go: - Otoro: the best part of the tuna belly and most fatty. Better than sex. You will want 2 orders - Hamachi Hara: again, the belly of yellow tail. it literally melts in your mouth. - Fresh Scallops: usually they have 5-6 for lunch. Grab one before its gone - Fresh Takko : this is amazing..don't be fooled by the boiled version that every other place serves...once you've tried this version, the rest pales in comparison.

First of all, shoutout to my friend Joyce H. for treating me and Andrea P. to a wonderful meal!! :) Thank youuu!! 15$ for a sashimi platter lunch combo is a really great deal. Included in the meal is some tofu, a picked salad, and miso soup. Tofu was quite good, but I think it would have been even better if they had used soft/silken tofu. Mmm... I also really enjoyed the miso soup. The platter is very significant. I was so full that I couldn't even finish it... and I'm a girl that can eat! (also the reason for my stretchy pants) So that is really saying a lot. I typically prefer sushi/nigiri over sashimi, but I felt it was a better deal (and I'm Asian so I can't turn down a good deal). Anyway, I wish our waitress had described the lunch sashimi to us though. From what I could tell, we had some cooked salmon, blue fin tuna, hamachi, squid, bbq pork? (it tastes like char siu!), cooked crab, a spicy tuna, another seasoned fish, maybe a red snapper? and two other things that I couldnt make out but tasted like yellowtail tuna. Haha, I probably should have asked. Anyway, all the fish was extremely fresh, and all were cut extremely well, except for my possible red snapper that was a little roughed against the fibers. For a place like Sushi-Gen, I kinda wish I got a little bit more variety in the raw fish, but at $15, that is a price that can't be beat! :) If I am ever in downtown LA again I will try their sushi platter or it at the bar. Overall, this place doesn't totally blow my mind, but it gives you good quality sushi and doesn't empty your wallet. For parking, just park in the lot -they give you 2hr validation for $2. It's much easier than trying to find something else.

Everyone raves about the Sashimi Lunch and I have to agree that it's an incredible deal at $15. 營 bet that if it was priced at $20, 50% of the customers would disappear and if they raise it to $25, 90% would be gone. 燝osh, how I wish they would increase the price because one hour of my life is worth more than a couple of bucks. 營 literally waited for 60 minutes before we were seated and then we chowed down the meal in 30 minutes. 燭here's definitely something wrong with that equation. Anyway, the lunch special itself is worthy of more than 5 stars. 燛verything tasted super fresh and the variety was awesome. 燭here was even a small piece of grilled salmon that was excellent as well. 營 think you either need to arrive a few minutes before they open so you're in the first seating or be prepared to wait hours. I clearly don't have the time to make this a regular weekday fixture but it's fun once in a while.

One of the most expensive sushi restaurants I've been to but it's definitely one of the freshest sushi in La. The sashimi is deliciously tender and seriously melts in your mouth! Staff was very accommodating. Traditional Japanese decor to set the sushi styling atmosphere. �Worth the wait and good luck on finding a good parking spot!

I heart heart heart Sushi Gen....except for their long waits which is like all the time! I've been coming here for years now, never had their omakase, but always left with a huge smile on my face. A reliable place to fill that sushi craving - my bf and I used to order sushi on end and the sushi chefs would always look at me like "really, more", but now that we've become regulars, they know my sushi belly and they just smile and offer us the best of the day. Yup, I eat just as much as my bf and sometimes, maybe more �Besides always being reliable for good fish, I think that their ameibi sweet shrimp miso soup is the best I've had. I always look forward to ordering the Ameibi nigiri and then when they ask what to do with the heads, we'd get 2 fried and 2 miso soups please. 燜or some reason, the soup is just so flavorful compared to other places. Also, the chefs here can accommodate to your taste buds quite well. 燬ometimes, I ask for 'easy rice' when I'm feeling like I'm getting a little big and I need to control my carb intake... they just chuckle a little and say no problem without asking any questions. Verdict: This place makes me smile. 燱hen I'm in a bad mood, having a bad day, just plain cranky, my bf knows to take me here. It doesn't hurt that I work close to sushi gen and yes, if u don't sit at the bar, the lunch special is a great deal if you're feeling for some melt in yo mouth sashimi!!

I am in LOVE with Sushi Gen. Every time I think about the $15 Sashimi lunch special, fireworks go off in my head and my face and eyes light up like a little girl on Christmas morning!!! They give you so many different types of sashimi and it's all super fresh and delicious. I also really enjoy the salmon collar - SO GOOD. Try it. I think their portions are just right. It's definitely more worth it to come for lunch because the dinner menu is almost essentially the same but the prices are higher for dinner. I came here for dinner once with my family and it got pretty $$$$ so if you can come for lunch - DO IT! I wish it wasn't so busy all the time because there seems to ALWAYS be a wait, but I guess that's a sign that it's worth it and truly yummy! I will always love Sushi Gen. The end.

This Place has changed currency for my husband and I. We now compare purchasing EVERYTHING to SUSHI-GEN. Example "Damn, That shirt costs 2 SUSHI-GENS."

I have been going to Sushi Gen for at least 9 years and most times that was for lunch. They have an excellent lunch specials menu, for which people line up before the restaurant opens. They open at 11:15 am and if you are not in line by 11:10 or earlier, you will have to wait at least 40 minutes for a table. That is unless you want to sit at the sushi bar. The reason to get a table at lunch hour is simple. The lunch specials are very reasonably priced. Although I long for the old days when the sashimi plate lunch special was less than $11 and green tea was free with it, even with the $13 or so for it today and extra for tea, it is still a great bargain. The sashimi lunch special includes little dishes of tofu in some kind of meat broth, which is delicious (and I don't even like tofu otherwise). It also includes a small cabbage salad, miso soup and it used to include seaweed salad, but recently I haven't seen it. So even before the main dish, you get a few little "appetizers" that taste great. And then you get the sashimi plate itself (and a bowl of rice which I usually barely touch). The sashimi is rather a generous portion and has several kinds of fish (e.g. tuna), little octopus, salmon and teriyaki something. The contents vary slightly, but the fish is always super-fresh and portions rather generous. I did try the lunch specials with rolls and nodi maki were good, but not as glorious as the sashimi plate. So needless to say, I always got the sashimi lunch and I have been there at least 150 times in the last 9 years. The parking used to be free, but is now $1.50 with validation from the restaurant. And if you get there after 12pm, there might be no parking available. So come early and get in line.

Alright alright I finally went back, waited the painful 30 minutes to be seated at lunch, and tried the famous sashimi lunch. It was good. Great value, good quality. Worth a try if you haven't already. They should leave out the salmon and teriyaki beefy stuff and just add more fish, in my opinion. Maybe some sweet shrimp or ikura? Also got a side of uni which was great, but $11 for two pieces? Sort of crazy when they had just handed me a massive plate filled with thick cut slices of tons of different fish for $15...... hmm....

It is stupid to comment here about how good this place is cuz it will only make the waiting line longer but the line is already long so WTH. I will make this short. The best sushi place in LA hands down. Go during the lunch time cuz the lunch menu has good prices (dinner is expensive). The quality of sushi is days in days out very consistent n I think that's what separates this place from every other restaurant. I have had 100 dollar per person sushi course n they didn't impress me but their 20 dollar sushi delux makes me smile every time.

This place merits its reputation as one of the best sushi restaurants in LA. Of course the sushi is great, but so are the tempura and miso soup. Of course you couple the great food with a nice room and the result is a crowd. An all-over-the sidewalk and out-into-the-parking-lot type of crowd. Its worth the wait, though.

BEST SUSHI PLACE IN TOWN!!! Their fish is so fresh, and they give you thick thick thick pieces. If ordering sushi, they give you a lot of fish and less rice, just the way I like it! I ordered the sashimi and sushi combination, and the sashimi one definitely blew my mind away! Each fish melt in my mouth...especially, you guessed it, TORO! We got several pieces of this, and this is probably the best tasting toro I ever had! Just chew it, sit it on your tongue, and let it MELT in your mouth. Also, the sashimi came with 3 different kinds of tuna made as a side like spicy tuna, etc. Those were unique and new to me, so props for that. Small parking lot and no reservations, but worth all the price and all wait in the world. GET THE TORO!

1200+ yelp reviews and 4.5 star average = mandatory try. Some of the best sushi in LA. 營t blows away the best of Hawaii. 燛verything (simple ambiance, great sushi chefs, great food) comes together perfectly to make an incredible dining experience. Every seafood ingredient from the large selection is fresh. 營'm not going to comment about each individual item suffice it to say, if you want to try the freshest example of something, just order it. 燩ortions are generous. The rice is very good. 燦o broken grains. 燩erfect seasoning. 燩erfect amount of moisture that allows it to lightly hold together Omakase is exceptional. 燗s with most top sushi bars, the chefs present each nigiri sushi with the appropriate relish or sauce. 燬ometimes overly creative making the sushi difficult to eat without loosing the garnish but always accentuating the flavor of the seafood and never overpowering it. �Eat your sushi with your fingers not your chopsticks and you won't have any problems). The chefs behind the bar do an excellent job engaging you in conversation and keeping you entertained. Prices are very good. 燛xpect to pay $50 per person. Note: 營f you are looking for creative, inside out rolls with 15 kinds of fish deep fried with 10 different sauces, go elsewhere. 燭his is sushi for the purist. Highly recommended.

#427 Yeah, it was good. Yeah, we had to arrive 30 minutes before the place opened. Yeah, I would come back. But, I really would have been happier getting a 5-star experience from Sushi-Gen because that's what 1000+ reviews led me to believe. But, lesson learned. The service was rather rushed and, though understandably so, I would have preferred a personalized experience, rather than an efficient robot. I wasn't impressed with the sunomono salad. But the miso soup and tofu were surprising standouts. The tofu was infused with strong flavor, which is rather rare. The miso was clear, with a subtle hint of flavor - exactly the way it should be. The Sashimi Lunch (still $15) itself looked rather impressive. But, the flavors just don't match up to the presentation or the hype. I really only enjoyed the tuna tartare and the halibut; though, the fatty tuna was an interestingly new experience. Not sure if I would order it anywhere else though. In the end, I was underwhelmed and, after spending $33, I was craving Shoboo Kitchen's generous $30 Sashimi Coombination A. Too bad for Sushi-Gen and their paid parking ($2 with validation for the first 2 hours).

BEST sushi/sashimi place I have ever been to in the east and west coast. Great prices and quality of fish. Pretty curious as to where they get their source from. It seems like it is a family-run restaurant, because I always see the same host and you can tell he is more than just a host. Lunch sashimi special is amazing... $15 for a VERY generous portion of fish, including toro. On top of that, they give you miso soup, pickled cabbage, and tofu as appetizers. I've come here for dinner as well, but prices are a bit higher and no sides. I've also tried the grilled mirugai (clams that seemed to be baked in foil).. very tasty.. everything I've had there is delicious. You can't go wrong!!! There will be a wait, but well worth it!!!!

Make a reservation. Sit at the bar. Let the Omakase begin. Besides being served top quality sashimi, you really can't beat the friendliness of the sushi chefs. Our chef asked my bf and I what the occassion was (and who was paying) before he crafted our Omakase meal. I love eating slow.

And all this time, i've been thinking that GEN was going to be one big let down. Whenever i get my hopes up about a good restaurant, especially ESPECIALLY sushi restaurants, it never quite lives up to my expectations. 燦ot only did Gen prove to be exactly as good as it was described to be, but it's sashimi deluxe dinner pretty much looked me right in the eyes and said: Oh, you silly girl, look what you've been missing all along.. Now i know why Gen has thousands of reviews, most of them 5 stars. Who wouldn't give this place 5 stars? Melt in your mouth sashimi and great service. $35 for a sashimi deluxe dinner and $15 for the lunch equivalent. 燱HAT A FRIGGIN STEAL. The down side? the wait. Seriously, the wait here is no joke. 燛xpect to wait for 1-1.5 hours to get a table. Another downside is that, like most japanese restaurants, they close in the middle of the day. So: 11-2pm, m-fri, is there lunch hour and they open back up at 5-9 or 10pm for dinner. 燦ot open for lunch on weekends! Be mindful of the wait and their hours and you'll be set. There's a ton of bars walkable distance from Gen, so don't be afraid to shy away after putting your name down. Be sure to come back 15 min before the est. wait time and you'll be set. �TANOSHIMU!

I honestly think Sushi-Gen is a bit overrated. Like literally everyone in LA brings up this place when they talk about "great sushi in LA". It's good but really??... I don't know about 4.5 stars. They have a wide variety but at times it can taste like the fish was frozen and just defrosted. Prices are not too wallet friendly either.. I'd suggest going for lunch. But okay aside from playing devil's advocate, I'd say it's not bad sushi (i might have been harsh). It's a decent spot and you can probably not worry about getting sick from eating non-fresh sashimi. Wouldn't put it on the top shelf list though.

I have been here quite a few times and the sushi is good. 燭he memorable items that I have enjoyed is the toro, uni and live shrimp. 營 especially enjoy the shrimp heads in miso soup. 燭he sushi chefs are nice and if they warm up to you give you complimentary pieces of sashimi. So, why two stars? 營 usually walk out of this place paying $175-225 for two. 燜or that price, I would prefer to pay a few bucks more for an omakase in the LA area.

We finally went to this place for dinner early on a Friday night. Yes, there was a wait. We sat at the only island table in the room, which colored my experience (as I hate island tables). I think if we had sat in a booth or at the sushi bar the ambience would have been better, but we were hungry and wanted to try the sashimi so didn't protest. The sashimi dinner comes with a lot of food. A whole plate of tempura that's a meal in itself, a huge bowl of rice, miso soup, and the sashimi, lots and lots of it. I'd probably come back for the sashimi lunch special, which I here is just like the dinner special only ten dollars cheaper. We also ordered nigiri -- We asked for recommendations and weren't disappointed, though the food came out all at once and some of the fish seemed to dry out as it sat at the table. Still, we did our best. We tried. The fish was delicious. Fresh. If I came back, I'd probably call ahead and make a reservation. I don't like waiting, and there was definitely a thirty minute wait. Service was friendly and professional, she offered suggestions when we asked. No one was drinking in the room, mostly families, which made us a little uncomfortable. Still, we ordered hot sake and my boy also ordered beer. Mwa ha ha. Peace out little tokyo. We'll be back for sure.

I been wanting to come here for over 2 years and every attempt was a failed one, I think I made reservations for dinner on a Saturday 5 times and each time some unexpected event would pop up which prevented me from coming here for dinner. 營t really sucks that they don't open for lunch on the weekends nor are they open on Sundays. 燘usiness is THAT good. 燬o this past Friday my hubby told me that we should head to Sushi Gen right after work and just sit at the sushi bar since they were fully booked for dinner. 營 was really happy to finally be able to try them out. 燱e arrived at around 6pm and were immediately seated at the bar. 營 was wondering why the bar wasn't full because there were people waiting at the front. 營 then found out it's because you can't order their sushi dinners at the bar. 營 would definitely want to sit at a table next time because seeing those plates of sushi and sashimi prepared at the bar made me want to try them even more. 燬o this is what the hubby and I ordered at the bar: Toro - Oh em gee, the toro was the fattiest I've ever had. 燤y eyes rolled back. 燱e had 3 orders of them. 燤elt in your mouth delicious! Sayori- this was recommended by the chef. 營 had it w/o soy sauce or wasabi, it had a uniquely delicious texture, so yummy. Albacore - soft and buttery, again, delicious! Sake - so fresh, the fish was glistening, it had the perfect texture. Scallops - very good, scallops could be a little bigger though but they were very fresh Tuna - fresh but I did had to spit out a small piece of chewy tendon King crab handroll - It was good, made w/ avocado and cucumber, but I wouldn't order it again. 營 prefer blue crab handrolls but they don't have that. Overall Sushi Gen is delicious and very reasonably priced. 營 will definitely return. 燭hey should really consider opening for lunch on the weekends!

At last, I've managed to get away from crunch rolls and spicy tuna. Even if you've had better, there's no questioning that Sushi-Gen does authentic Japanese right. The sashimi combo is perfection--fresh, fatty cuts of raw fish for a kickass price. Most of it is tuna, and I can do without the cooked salmon and eel, but for $15 I feel like I'm getting away with highway robbery.

Delicious but not the best sashimi/Japanese food I've ever had. Found this restaurant on Yelp and had higher expectations when we arrived to find so many people waiting outside the restaurant. My boyfriend and I put our names down and walked down the street to do happy hour at a nearby Japanese restaurant. After an hour and a half wait, we returned and were seated. We ordered the salmon skin salad, fried chicken (bf's impulse want), the sashimi dinner and the charishi. The salmon skin salad was just okay. It tasted like something I can make myself at home. The sashimi in both the sashimi dinner and charishi were both delicious. It was fresh but not the best I've had. Not sure if I'd come back especially since the restaurant is pretty pricey. Located in Little Tokyo, I enjoyed walking around on the streets and dining here but feel like there's better out there!

I recommend either going really early at 11 or at the end of lunch at 1:30 pm. The sashimi plate comes with a mixture of raw and cooked fish. The raw fish (tuna, yellow tail, squid, octopus, spicy tuna, and toro) is so fresh! The cooked fish is not as exciting but it's still really good and complements the raw sashimi very well. The lunch comes with steamed tofu, miso soup, cabbage, and a HUGE bowl of rice. I've been here for dinner too. It's good quality sushi but it is pricey (you pay for the freshness and quality). I'd give 4.5 stars for their dinner, docking that half star because it's a little expensive and not too spectacular.

It's kind of funny that I have just finally written a review about this spot when half of my friend list has already written theirs. I recommend this restaurant very often and people rave about it after, so Sushi Gen must be doing something right. If you're a roll kind of person, well sorry, they don't have too many options. They are great for sashimi. You can taste the freshness in every bite. It's always busy, so plan ahead and make a reservation. They don't seat you if your entire party hasn't arrived. Only negative thing I have to say is that, THEY CHARGE FOR GINGER!! $1.00 for a small dish of ginger. Fail. Minus 1 star. Enjoy.

3.5 stars. They are super strict about reservation time. If you're late by 5 minutes, they'll give your table away. Service is slow- they need to improve that since the waits are very long get a table. At closing time, there are about 15-20 people outside still waiting! Some of the sushi is really good (uni, chu toro) some of them were okay (hamachi, albacore, spicy tuna), some were awful (spanish mackerel, monkfish liver) - it's all across the board. Sasabune in LA is still my fave sushi spot. Hamachi kama (yellowtail cheek) and Salmon ochazuke (porridge) were both good.

It was pretty good but not that great. I was not overly impressed by the presentation or the quality of fish. It was definitely not worth the long wait. update: i think it's actually quite good but they charged extra for ginger. WTF?

7:52 pm - almost at Sushi Gen. Took about 45 mins from Santa Monica. Not bad for a Thursday right? Passed the plaza on my first pass via Alameda. Entrance is on 2nd. $3 for parking ain't bad given there are currently no free metered options on the street. 7:59 pm - gotta wait for a table... and we didn't wait very long. Place is kinda packed with old and young folks. Sushi Gen's got a lot of hype coming in from all directions. I've given it 5 stars for now based on the hype alone. 8:01 pm - waitress came with moist towels. 2 large Sapporos please! I'm here tonight with Cousins Reno and Josey - always fine dinner companions and they've already commented on whether I'll be buried in my phone all night. 8:05 pm - going the a la carte route. All sashimi with a side of rice. 爄've just learned from Reno that omakase is only available at the sushi bar. 8:08 pm - took a quick potty break. I've never seen so many flowers and plants in a men's room before. 8:17 pm - soup's here! Nice bowls (they've got lids on them). 8:22 pm - time for squid tempura! Looks nice and crispy. Very tasty. 燦ot too much batter, but squid is one of those food items where you can't bite it off. 燬o you just gotta pop those suckers in. 8:25 pm - fried sweet shrimp heads! Lost an eyeball, but damn good (miss the ponzu sauce on these things though). 8:27 pm - food is coming fast and furious now. Might have to do a cumulative review afterwards. 8:31 pm - one of the best sweet shrimp sushi ever. 爏ome sweet shrimp I've had in the past had a lingering aftertaste... this one was aftertaste-free 8:32 pm - the monkfish liver tastes mostly like the nori wrap. 8:44 pm - had to stop eating and mention the salmon. I don't usually like salmon but this salmon sashimi is BOMB! 燼 bit saltier than most off the bat. 9:04 pm - Sooo full. Really thick pieces of sashimi. 燬almon was delicious. Toro and octopus were yummy. Yellowtail belly, and yellowtail were ok. 燱e also had mackerel, but I'm not a fan so I can't really judge. 9:16 pm - ordering a la carte, pretty much 100% sashimi set us back about $215 for the three of us, not including tip. 爊ot bad for quality sashimi. 9:24 pm - don't forget to validate! Otherwise it's more than $3 on exit.

I'll give it 5 stars for LUNCH only For $15 dollars you get a generous amount of raw fish. For what you pay, its an amazing deal.

Had lunch here recently. Was super crowded, but I was alone and sat at the bar. Wasnt what I would call "cheap" or "average" but I did just tell the sushi man to just start making me whatever he wanted. �Fish was super good, really fresh and some of the pieces just melted in your mouth.

This is one of the best places in L.A. to get traditional sushi in my opinion. 營 just had dinner here recently on a weeknight and first starting come here in the mid-90s, so it's been around for a while. In addition to the high quality of the fish, I feel what sets them apart from other sushi restaurants is the quality of the sushi rice and right amount of rice vinegar they use. They take reservations, but be sure your entire party is on time. 燨therwise, you're not going to be seated. 營 recommend eating here on a weeknight when it's less crowded. Located in the Honda Plaza strip mall in Little Tokyo...2nd St. and Central Ave. 燳ou'll have to pay $3.00 for parking. Bathroom is clean.

Fantastic! Heard about this place through a few friends who heard I was moving up to the neighborhood. 營 always need a handful of restaurants to choose for lunch when I am post call. 燬ushi/Sashimi lunches superb value for great tasting fish. I arrived around 1130 and of course there was a line. 燱e put our name down and noticed some open seats at the sushi bar. 燗fter inquiring about those seats, found out the bar was only for a-la-carte orders. 燱ait was about 10 -15 minutes for table. Menu simple, I went for the "Sashimi" lunch. 燭hey also have another selection of Sashimi that was considerably more expensive, but from what the server said, it's considerably a larger portion with more varieties of sashimi (next time!). 燤iso soup, pickled cucumbers and bowl of rice came with my order. 燬ashimi portioned well for the price and the fish very fresh. 燭una varieties were fabulous with melt in your mouth texture. 燦othing but simple straight forward great tasting sashimi. 燬ervice attentive, fast and on point. 燩erfect for lunch. Left the place stuffed even with the smaller sashimi portion. 營 would not come here for anything other than sushi/sashimi. 燙ome during lunch for the ultimate value, but expect a wait. 燱ill I return?

If you are craving for authentic, fresh and delicious sashimi/sushi and aren't afraid to burn a hole in your wallet then I would recommend this place! This restaurant truly lives up to the motto, "you get what you pay for". This is the only place where my taste buds had experienced the most freshest sashimi/sushi. I brought my boyfriend and friend here and they both loved it! We came here for dinner and dishes were relatively $20 and up. But it was totally worth it. Words can never express how much I enjoy dining here. I would highly recommend making a reservation first because this place does get packed for dinner. The parking lot is extremely tiny and we ended up parking a block away in the Little Tokyo Galleria parking structure (which wasn't too bad).

I wouldn't call myself a sushi snob. All I know is that is I hate rolls fried and drenched in sauce. My up-to-par standards start with a nice slab of soft, hefty, buttery bite of fish. Is that too much to ask for? :O) By the quality of the fish, I could tell I could easily rack Sushi Gen up to 5+ stars if I tried their omakase (next time!). I ordered their sashimi deluxe and everything was soft, fresh, and delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_�I thought, "no way I could get full off this" sharing with a couple girls, but we were pretty darn full with a side of CA rolls (not my decision, don't judge me!), cucumber, spicy tuna, and salmon skin rolls. And the rolls were nowhere near drenched in sauce, while they were pretty simple, plentiful, and kinda cute! http://www.yelp.com/biz_� http://www.yelp.com/biz_�I devoured my order of uni + quail egg sushi in 2 seconds. It was damn delicious. Although I love runny yolk, I'd hate to see that it costed the ratio of uni to be smaller (as expected). Will order a tub of uni by itself, next time! I definitely recommend this place, but had to knock down the star because the wait was ridiculous, which usually indicates the restaurant is popular and great. HOWEVER, the host was really rude. We were told that we were "2nd" after the next party, but failed to mention we were the 2nd of the list for "table for 4." He impatiently asked us to wait outside as we saw 10 more parties filter in. And icing on the cake, he practically bulldozed my girlfriend over without an apology. �- Perhaps it was a bad day for him.. If you don't mind waiting (a long time) for good sushi. Go to Sushi Gen!

This is the treasure-trove of sushi-goodness! One of my sushi-crazy friends brought me here at 10:30am on a Thursday for lunch- I thought he was crazy, when I found out the restaurant actually opens at 11 am! but we weren't even first in line... we were second, &by 11am, there were literally 40-50 people behind us. They also opened the doors at 11:10am. OH THE SUSPENSE. This took longer than waiting for a disneyland ride. The sashimi special was good. At $15, you get a great variety of fish! &it's all pretty fresh. they also give you 3-4 slices of each kind &I was really full by the end (I didn't even touch my rice!). I don't know why I would even consider another place for sashmi after this. *scratch that* I would only go to a different place if I can't wake up in time to get ahead of the line. In this case, the early bird gets the fish.

By far, the BEST sushi meals I've had in Los Angeles have been at Sushi-Gen. 燙an you say uni?? �Lunch or dinner, I'm having a full tray of uni. 營 was there for lunch yesterday, and I had the uni and sashimi combination lunch. 燭hough it costs $32 for this lunch order, you have to consider what you're receiving: 爃ot tofu, miso soup, a little salad, a bowl of rice, mixed sashimi, a tray of uni, a little tuna tartare, sliced cucumbers, and STILL more! 燛verything is extremely fresh, they're generous with the portion of sashimi, and you finish your food wanting to go back every day as long as you can afford it. 燭he service is friendly, and the food comes out quickly. �The iced green tea is a little strong, but I like it that way. 燤AKE SURE you get your parking ticket validated -- the parking is crazy expensive if you don't. �Note: 爐his plays STAYS busy from the time the doors open. 燭he wait can be 20-30 minutes relatively quickly. 營t's worth the wait, the money, and the drive to have this sushi.

I usually do not review restaurants after only one visit but this has to be an exception. Never before have I had such fresh and delicious sushi. From San Diego to San Francisco, Sushi Gen is by far the best sushi I've experienced. The Toro melted in my mouth. I almost cried. Even their wasabi was made so much better than other spots. The Wasabi! Great atmosphere. The sushi chefs were artists in the truest sense. Fast service at the sushi bar. One downfall is the price. But...you get what you pay for, that's for sure.

As I walk through the plaza to go to Raku, I always wonder... "Why are there so many people waiting in line to get into Sushi-Gen!? It's so, so-so." I guess you can say Sushi-Gen is the standard for sushi in Los Angeles. It's fairly priced and the quality is alright. There are those sushi bars that go for the high-end approach, and they should be providing you with great sushi. Then there's the rest which I won't get into... But I've had better sushi further out from central LA for the same price, for better quality of fish (or better cuts of fish), and with better execution of sushi. OK, the last bit is subjective as people have their preferences of how loose/tight the rice should be, fish to rice ratio, etc. �But Sushi-Gen is so... average. It's like buying a Toyota - reliable but nothing special about it. It almost reminds me of the takeout sushi I had as a little kid in Tokyo. Of course, it tasted so good back then since you're just a kid, but you go back as an adult only to find out that it was just OK. So Sushi-Gen deserves an average A-OK, at least in my books.

I am so use to going to a sushi restaurant and all the chefs and servers are Korean. Its actually quite refreshing to visit a sushi restaurant where it feels authentic , Japanese food made by Japanese people.. ( not trying to offend any Korean people, i personally believe my mommy makes the worlds best Sushi ever and shes Taiwanese ! ) anywhoot- I called in to make a reservation for 2 to celebrate my best friends bday. When we arrived it was packed with people, so it was a good thing i made that reservation! My Best friend ordered the sashimi dinner and that plate comes with so many things he was overwhelmed with what was on his side of the table. He had a cup of miso soup, some noodle thingy, sauce, rice for the sashimi plate and some fried tempura. He said everything melts in his mouth literally and was full at the end of the meal, surprisingly, as it was sushi!! I, the vegetarian- not to down play my side of the table, i had ordered vegetable roll and avocado roll ( a requirement to order at least 2 items if you just want simple rolls) . I wasn't sure what it was that made my rolls taste so good, something in it was extremely soft and yummy..even for a simple roll like the avocado roll. o we also ordered Red Wine, they only had one choice for red wine, thankfully it was tasty and a creeper. At the end of the night they brought out a green tea ice cream to wish my best friend a happy birthday! Glad they remembered it! Even though the options are low for vegetarians ..i was happy my best friend enjoyed his dinner which is why i am a Fan! =)

Their sushi is amazing. $15 for a sashimi lunch special that includes a little bit of everything, but is still extremely filling (I tried to enjoy the sushi, but I was so hungry after waiting for an hour that I kind of just inhaled it). However, their service leaves much to ask for. They brusquely set down their menus and the food, and the check comes out when you're not even done eating (not even close to being done eating) because they want a faster turnaround. Extremely turned off by that, especially when I pointed it out to the host, who just blankly stared at me and said, "That's how we always do it." Seriously? Yes, your sushi is good. Yes, your lunch special is amazing. But keep up that kind of attitude, and Sushi Gen won't be the "it" spot anymore. 燭here are plenty of other restaurants in Little Tokyo that have similar prices, better sushi, and MUCH better service (like Restaurant Komasa) -- they're just not as well known. 燗s reviewed previously, their service is still mediocre, if not almost to the point of being rude. C'mon, Sushi Gen. Step it up, and stop being so rude to your customers.

One of my favorite japanese restaurants. Pricey but it expected. Sometimes there is a long wait but you can sit at the bar. I believe there is a minimum order at the bar though. Everything here is fresh and good. If you pick sushi from the list, it will come out a lot for sure so I suggest just ordering a sushi or sashimi combination and maybe one or two additional sushis on the side that is not included. It's a little cheaper and still satisfying.

Authentic, authentic, authentic. Came for dinner on a Sat night. No substitutions for any of the dishes and no soypaper! Was a little sad about that. Made reservations, but came well before 5pm. There was already a line outside, so make sure to come early! Parking Lot parking. 3 hours for $3 with validation. Seating&Decor Typical home-like Japanese restaurant. A lot more space than I thought.. bar and table seating. We were the 1st ones seated for the night, but the place filled up VERY quickly, and there were still lines when we finished our meal. Service Quick, considering how incredibly busy this place is/gets. I'm sure you'd get your food much quicker sitting at the bar. Food&Drinks Sashimi Deluxe- a variety of sashimi on a plate. Literally melts in your mouth. Quite glorious. Spicy/Regular scallop handrolls- Spicy, yet you could still taste the freshness of scallops. Salmon, albacore, yellowtail, yellowtail belly, toro- The yellowtail belly and toro were my favorite of the night! Eel and avocado roll- The sauce wasn't overpowering, and the eel was warm and fresh. Sapporo and sake- Good, but I'd rather fill my tummy with food! Price Rather pricey, but def worth your buck if you love sushi! I think coming for lunch would be really great, since the lunch combo is so affordable. I would def come if I didn't have work. Prepare to spend here! Loved this place, but found it a little too authentic from time to time. Menus were mostly in Japanese and weren't very descriptive. Wonderful experience, but I def need my fusion sushi fix now!

Our USUAL sushi-eating experience at other fine sushi establishments in the larger LA area (Hama Sushi, Ichi Sushi, O2 Sushi, Sushi Komasa) involves us sitting at the counter, ordering sushi, watching the sushi chef slice up and place the mouthwateringly fresh pieces of sashimi on well-made sushi rice, devouring the sushi chef's magical creations, and sighing with content. Here, none of that really happened. What went wrong? - Since we were a table of 4, we didn't get a chance to sit at the counter (not their fault, we were a "large" party). The service outside of the counter area was slow and unenjoyable. Our waitress didn't really know too much about fish... though that might have been a language barrier issue. - The taste of the sushi was... fine. We found that the pieces of sashimi on the sushi weren't actually cold. - The portions were ginormously tiny and thin compared to other places. The sushi was ridiculously expensive for what we received. A vegetarian in our group ordered a vegetable roll, which cost more than $15 - what we received were 6 unbelievably small pieces of a cut roll, MUCH less than an inch in diameter. We spent almost $200 for 4 people and left hungrier than when we went in. We actually went to have a satisfying second dinner at Hama Sushi down the street. Tip: if you have a vegetarian in your party, go to Hama Sushi down the street; their miso soup and vegetable roll (and I believe tofu) are of good portions, flavorful, and really well priced. Now, I did take a look at what other tables were ordering--sashimi platters--and they did look good. So in summary: DO NOT ORDER THE SUSHI DELUXE OR VEGETARIAN ITEMS HERE - go only for the sashimi platters (which I will try next time). Better sushi experience at the counter can be had down the street at Hama Sushi or Sushi Komasa.

One of my new fav sushi joints in LA. The thought of their scallops, hamachi belly, uni, salmon and toro still make my mouth water. Came here for a catch up session w/my cousin - spent about 2+ hours and a tab over $200+. We have HUGE appetites for GOOD sushi. None of that California Roll bs. We were lucky to get a reservation right about 30 mins after they opened on a Sunday, sat at the sushi bar (the best way to go). When we left, the line was still ridiculously long. Def would go back.

Came here for the lunch special. Having to wait twenty minutes to get a table for two definitely was too long, especially when two people came in after us and got seated before us (no, my hungry tummy did not impair me from catching that). Fish was definitely good quality and a good price, and came out really fast once we finally got seated. Didn't really like all those pickled veggies that came with it but then again I never like pickled anything. If I come back I would sit at the bar and just order sushi. There are a zillion other places in Little Tokyo that have good quality fish.

Hello good sushi. This 80 style sushi bar, has all the charm one would expect in Little Tokyo. 燭he staff is super helpful and on point. 營t can get a bit crowded, but if you manage to get a table, you'll be in for a treat. I had a birthday dinner here. The food was amazing, the drinks always flowing, the fish fresh, the cooked dishes well seasoned. 燘ut the price was a bit high for the quality/ quantity of the food. �It's good. 營 would go back.

DELICIOUS, awesome value for lunch. About $15 for a HUGE plate of ultra fresh, assorted sashimi. The quality is comparable to Sushi Komasa, except the atmosphere is faster-paced and they're open for lunch. It gets very busy here for lunch, so show up early. You can only sushi a la carte at the bar, which is annoying, so wait around, grab a table, and order one of their lunch specials. Validated parking. Credit card accepted.

Five stars from me. 營'm having a stay-cation this summer and I want to eat here every day. 燭he lunch special is fantastic. 燝et the sashimi plate. I have noticed there is some variety in the types of fish that come with the sashimi lunch but they're all good.

Plan to arrive at 10:45 to que up for food. 燳es there's a line. 燳es, it's of value to be in the first seating. 燜ood comes fast. Service is not attentive, I hate sitting with an empty water glass but when they're busy, they're busy.

The $15 Sashimi Lunch Plate was pretty deceptive looking, at first. When it came, I thought I would probably eat it all in just a few minutes. It didn't look like a whole lot of food. But it actually is a great portion, not too much to make me completely stuffed, but definitely enough for lunch. The best item, I thought, was the 3 large slices of albacore tuna. Very good, rich and fatty. I'll admit that I don't know a whole lot about sushi, but I definitely know this was fresh stuff. It was amazing quality, and for a good price too. I DIDN'T like the cooked salmon, it had a very ocean-y after taste and was pretty tough. They give you three pieces of tofu, a tiny salad (3 bites and it's gone), a cup of miso soup, and a large bowl of rice with the lunch special. Overall, it was very good sashimi. But next time I'll just order the pieces I like and not get the plate.

For lunch specials, hands down the best place to enjoy sushi. we had sashimi special and kenpachi head special. the kenpachi head, may not be so pretty but very good. it also came with sashimi appetizer. the service was pretty good. may be little slow but the ladies are friendly and try their best. got there around 12:11 and there were 10 tables before us already. waited about 30 mins. don't forget to put your name. left around 1:30 and still many people waiting outside. Get here early( they open at 11 am) 爋r be ready to wait. validation is good for 3 hrs for $3. walk around little tokyo and enjoy!!!

Jackie B is spot on; I do love this place. 燙ame here every week with my mom several years ago. 燤y god...I've had almost evey item on the menu. 營 must say everything I've had tasted freshly killed. My favorite dishs are pretty simple: salmon collar (speaks for itself), tempura (not too much batter, not at all greasy), and toro sashimi.

Review for dinner. The 1st review was for lunch. Dinner menu is pretty much the same as lunch except it's more expensive but at least there is more sashimi. Karage: - 2 fried chicken balls - not the best I've had but it was still pretty juicy probably from the oil Chirashi comes with soup - takes a bit longer to prepare for some reason - sashimi over sushi rice - comes with large fish eggs that squirts - fish selection is different from the sashimi dinner Sashimi dinner - similar to the sashimi lunch - comes with more tuna than the sashimi lunch - instead of the cooked mackerel it's cooked salmon Service: not as good as it was during lunch. Then it again it was dinner and the restaurant was packed. Parking: being noobs I thought parking was the same price as it was during lunch which is $2 with validation. It turns out at dinner that doesn't apply. We aren't quite the ballers like all the people parking in the Honda Center with their ostentatious GTR and Porches. As we pull up to the place thinking we were only going to pay $2ish the parking attendant tells us it's $9. We exclaim in disbelief "9 dollars?!" Then I quickly look and we were too excited to eat that we just didn't want to walk. Oh well, we were ballers for a day in a Camry. Overall, lunch or dinner is a good option but lunch is cheaper. Park in around the area unless you want to fork up $9 in addition to your meal. Also please don't order Teriyaki chicken/salmon or whatever that is not sashimi unless you are planning to be pregnant or are pregnant. Yes I'm judging you. It's a sushi restaurant with tons of fresh fish! If you want a teriyaki rice bowl go to Yoshinoya it's a lot cheaper.

I grew up in LA and love pretty much everything about it. 燤y boyfriend, born and raised in NorCal, appreciates LA but still prefers his hometown. One day, we were arguing over where we will live and raise our kids if we get married. 燭o his credit, he made some good points. 燦orcal offered more job opportunities, better schools and a less materialistic subculture. 燬o when it came my turn to speak, I knew I had to come up with something good. 燬o I pulled out my trump card. 營 said - "If we live in Norcal, we would have to FLY down whenever we want Sushi Gen." He was silenced. And that, girls, is how it's done. MUST ORDER: Sashimi Dinner with Tempura - For $26.00, you get a HUGE plate of fresh, fat slices of fish + tempura + miso soup + pickled vegetable sides + a piping bowl of rice - Melt-in-your-mouth tuna & yellowtail... big, thick slices that are fresh + delicious - Great spicy tuna + spicy yellowtail as well - Generous portion of hot, fresh tempura - Best deal for really good sushi in all of LA Sashimi Deluxe - For $35, you get an even larger plate of sashimi. 燗ll sorts. 營ncluding Toro. 營've never seen so much sashimi on one plate. 燗nd such fat, juicy cuts too! 燗bsolutely delicious. 燳ou really have to see this plate to believe it. - I would recommend this only to extreme Sashimi lovers who are prepared to eat. - If you love sashimi, then this is a BARGAIN. - If you like sashimi (and don't necessarily LOVE it), I would stick with the Sashimi Dinner with Tempura. - If you have leftovers, you can always pack it. 營 know leftover sashimi sounds gross, but trust me, Sushi Gen fish is so fresh, you'd be mad at yourself the next day for not packing more. Uni Dinner - For $38, you get TONS of fresh uni. 燗nd I mean tons. - Again, only order this if you can tolerate extreme levels of uni & only uni. Great deal for uni lovers though. - TIP: I personally love the combination of uni with nori. 燭his uni dinner is just uni over rice, with a tiny bit of nori. 營 would order an extra side of nori and make my own uni balls. Amaebi: - The sweetest, plumpest amaebi I've ever had. - TIP: Make sure to ask them to cook the head in a soup. 營've never had this before anywhere else (they usually just fry the heads), but the soup is absolutely delicious. 燭here's an incredibly rich flavor that is just to die for. 燜rom what I can gather, it's part miso soup, part chicken broth and a lot of shrimp brain, all mixed together with some refreshing green onion. 燗nd there are still the 2 heads in it for you to munch on. Squid: - If you're a squid-lover like me, you know how heinous squid can be (in taste & in texture) when it's not fresh. 燦ot a problem here. 燬ushi Gen's squid is absolutely fresh & crunchy & sweet. 營t is still squid though, so if you hate squid, don't expect to like it here. Tuna: - There's no where else that has regular tuna like this. - I love the yellowtail & toro (I know, technically tuna too, but I did say "regular tuna") & salmon & albacore here too, but those are naturally fattier fish, so they have a higher chance of tasting good anywhere else. 燘ut tuna is so lean, it can be virtually tasteless if it's not fresh (*ahem* frozen tuna). 燗nd after eating the tuna at Sushi Gen, I just can't taste the tuna anywhere else. WHAT NOT TO ORDER: (note: it's not bad, it's just that I've had better in other places, and if you're going to a place like Sushi Gen, you're better off ordering what they're really good at): - Sauteed Sole - Monkfish Liver - Fried Chicken - Sea Cucumber - Lunch specials with teriyaki... I mean, it's just teriyaki. Nothing special. You can get larger portions for a better price somewhere else. This is only the 2nd restaurant I've given a 5 star rating. 營t pains me to give 5 star ratings, because to me, 5 stars mean perfection. 燗nd perfect restaurants, like perfect places to start a family, are few and far in between. 燘ut there's no debate about Sushi Gen. 營t is absolutely and without a doubt, perfection.

Food was great. But the wait was crazy. I don't know if it's really worth the wait given that I had equally delicious food from Oomasa just the day before too. I ordered Chirashi sushi from Sushi-Gen. So the deal with seating: you can only order sushi if you are sitting at the bar. Usually this includes chirashi because it's really just a bunch of sushi on top of a bed of rice. Oomasa let me order chirashi from the bar. But nope, not at Sushi-Gen, because they are super busy. If you want anything from the dinner menu, you have to wait the super long line to be seated at a table. I ended up ordering to go because I wanted chirashi, but I didn't want to wait an hour for a table. The chirashi from Sushi-Gen included slightly better quality sushi. I am not a sushi connoiseur so I am only judging based on the texture and my preference. The chirashi from Sushi-Gen comes out a little ahead, but not 爀nough to justify the wait.

Sushi Gen is a very popular spot for lunch and this place closes it's doors at 2:00P.M and then reopens a little bit later. So if you are coming to this spot you better arrive early to wait for a line. I wasn't that shocked about how many people were here at lunch. This place has some good sushi. :) I ordered a sushi plus salmon skin salad. The salad was pretty healthy I would consider it having lots of dark greens and purples. Which is always lovely! The sushi was a lot !! I didn't finish all of mine due to the fact that I was already pretty full from the salad. My friends really enjoyed the sashimi plate and I think this is going to be our new lunch date ! Woohoo I'm glad I came and tried this place out. I been meaning to and after Cesar R has been raving about how good it was..I decided to finally try this place out! You really can't go wrong with a place that gives you fresh sushi, faster service! They are doing something right and I hope many more people check it out!

Phenomenal sushi, sashimi and traditional Japanese eats! Been frequenting this establishment since the early 1980s. 燗wesome, fresh sushi that remains excellent. 燭ruly as good as it gets. Won't belabor other points fellow Yelpers have made 燼d nauseum. 燡ust wanted to throw in my rating for this excellent place. 燬ushi bar is top-notch sushi; dining tables are also good for standard fare. Best values: 燬ashimi Lunch or Sashimi Dinner. Cost: 燱hat you'd expect for excellent sushi, but not absurdly expensive. 燡ust be prepared to fork out some bones. Wait: 燫etarded waits during busy hours. 燱hile they take reservations, sort of, you might as well be prepared to wait, too. Parking: 燬ucks. 燦ow you have to pay for parking within Honda Plaza ($3 with validation), which is yet another deterrent for eating here. 燩arking in the local environs can run upward of $8 or $10 at a local lot. Request/Recommendation: 燙ome here to eat, enjoy, and then get the 'eff out ... so that others can get in and eat, too! �-)

Doing research on this place I hear the words, over hyped and overpriced quite often from reliable Yelper's. To be fair my review is for their famous $15.00 Lunch Special. We arrived just before they opened for lunch, was a short line. Once opened the wait wasn't too long, but it had a very rushed, stampede like feel to it. Once seated I wanted to relax have a Sapporo, maybe ask a few questions about the menu selections. I could notice that the wait staff, although very efficient were somewhat overwhelmed. I made a couple of queries but just decided to try the famous lunch special. I also opted for a Kumamoto oyster appetizer. The oysters arrived, very small but very sweet, I think it was a (5) count. If I remember correctly the price was around $20.00 for the app...too much!! I was surprised that their inexpensive lunch special came with four courses including a nice side of rice. It started with a small salad, Hiyayakko, nice bowl of miso soup and the main course w/rice. The sashimi selection (similar to what everyone else has pictured) was very fresh and had a great selection. It was not the best sashimi that I've ever had but was still very good. For $15.00, this is the deal of the century!! One slight let down was the sake was lightly cooked already instead of sashimi style. Overall a great meal. Reading a lot of recent reviews I'm kinda hesitant to return and order from the sushi bar, I don't feel like getting raked over the coals with so many other sushi options in the area. But if I find ever myself with just $20.00 for lunch ...Sushi-gen to the rescue!!

1000+ reviews? I don't know if it's because I've tried much better sushi at Japan, Korea, and New York, but this place was okay. Great for the price, (other places ran $300 for a couple), but definitely not the best and the most fresh sushi I've had. I was a bit disappointed because I had expected something on a Sushi Yasuda and Sushi of Gari level in NY due to the amazing 4.5 reviews. But then again, major difference in price so it isn't fair to compare. Came here for lunch and waited an hour. It was longer than expected. Lunch Sushi Deluxe menu was only $15. So cheap! Would only come back if there is no wait.

Was able to try their lunch sashimi plate. My mom ordered the sashimi and uni lunch. The fish is still fresh but not top quality as you would get on Omakase. The uni looks beautiful on the wooden plank but it isn't fresh. If you want a fill of sushi/sashimi order the lunch special BUT if you want REALLY GOOD sashimi, then you HAVE TO GET THE OMAKASE! The omakase is a solid 4 star, fresh, buttery fish! minus the freshness of the uni and minus the quality of the amaebi. I think I am spoiled on those two dishes because I ate very well in Japan.

My friend and I were wandering around downtown LA when we eventually got to Little Tokyo. And what else is there to eat there besides ramen and sushi, right? Ok fine there are plenty of other things, but those are the top two that come to mind. Nevertheless, I pulled up my phone and was led to this place. 1200 reviews and what more needs to be said? I looked at the pics and off we went. Yes, we could have gone somewhere else, but I was counting on my yelp mobile phone app to not lead me astray. Plus the long line and 30 minute wait was surely a good sign, right? We were eventually called and seated. The waitress took pretty good care of us. We saw a bunch of people getting a pre-selected dinner sashimi plate, but we kinda wanted to choose for ourselves. And I actually like nigiri. So we went down the list and selected a few things. They came out relatively quickly and then we went back for round two. Service was good, quick and friendly. Most importantly, the fish was great. The only complaint I had was that there are no prices on the sushi menu. So I have no idea how much each individual piece (well, pair really) of sushi cost. For about $65 (split check & including tip) I got: 2 toro 2 uni 1 monkfish liver 1 yellowtail belly 1 jack mackerel 2 king crab 1salmon 3 unagi 1 sea eel 2 japanese red snapper warm sake and green tea Doesn't get much better than that! So worth it!! I would gladly come back for more =)

My friend Stephy S. needs to give this bad boy of a sushi joint another try! So after 1209 reviews, the place has 4 1/2 stars, over at least 6 years?

When it comes to Sushi, that's half the battle. 燭he salmon sashimi, for some reason, is better here than anywhere else. 燳es I did say salmon sashimi, sue me. It's that good.

Definitely one of my favorites and it's worth the wait every single time. Came with my boyfriend at around 1PM hoping to grab lunch before his interview, waited for about 30 minutes which is perfectly logical. Right before we went in to be seated for lunch a woman and her friends storm out saying,"You're going to regret this. You're going to get a bad review." I hear her mumbling about minimums and not being told and I just thought to myself,"There's a sign sitting on the desk at the front 'Bar Seating (minimum 4 orders)' I'm sure you were staring at it while you waited 45 minutes-an hour." A bad review? I don't know if a bad review can really hurt Sushi Gen, the quality of their fish is the best and I have never been let down. Cockiness? I think a restaurant that has earned it is definitely allowed to ask for respect from their customers. Anyway, back to the review about FOOD. I ordered my customary sashimi lunch and the boy ordered the uni & sashimi lunch platter. The food is ALWAYS too much for me, but I always gobble it up in happiness. The quality of the fish is delicious, melt-in-your-mouth happiness. Always, always worth the wait.

By far this is my favorite sushi restaurant... fish is very fresh. 營 had to work on Labor Day and drove by thinking i can enjoy some good quality sashimi after a hard day's work. 燭hey were closed... so I went again on Thursday. 燬urprisingly, I discovered they closed at 10 pm. 燬o one more choice I can go when I have to get a light, late night dinner. Fish is fresh as always. 營 ordered the $26 sashimi dinner, which came with tempura and rice. 營 did try to ask for changing the tuna to salmon (I am a Salmon fan) but no good. 燦o problem. 營t is still one of the best deal in town. 營f I am here, it's either this or the sashimi deluxe (came with toro). 燨ccasionally if there is a large group we'd also order the uni dinner and share.

I love Sushi and Sushi Gen is reasonably price for the quality of food that is served. 營t's not the best Sushi I have ever had but it is a very good. This is my go to place when I'm in LA, in the mood for Sushi and I have to do a quick hit and run. 燭he Sashimi dinner is a good example of a reasonably price menu item. 燳ou get a good portion of Sashimi, Tempura, Rice, Salad, Miso Soup and a choice of Beer or Sake. You are looking at about $26.00. The restaurant is small and fills up early. 燭hey do take reservation to make the wait a little easier. 燤y tip is getting in early if you can. 營 usually make my reservations for 5:30PM and I done by 6:30. 燭hen I'm off to do what I came into LA for. 燤ost likely I'm going to a concert or some type of entertainment in the City. �A good way to try this place is to get there for lunch. The lunch menu is very good and the prices are a little less.

Decided to eat lunch here since I wanted to visit Little Tokyo.... Found parking, then walked over.... see this mass of people standing outside the restaurant. 燱e waited about 50 minutes for a table at the sushi bar.... We ordered directly from the sushi chef. 燰ery traditional and we ordered our sushi one by one. 燭he fish was FRESH and enjoyable. 燭hey just 'melt' in your mouth.... even the Unagi was very moist. 燰ery good, yet, very expensive. �Bring your christmas funds if you wish to have sushi here.... We had hamachi, japanese mackerel, salmon belly, uni, ikura, toro, spicy tuna roll and unagi.... I would go here again for certain, if invited.... =)

I had a sushi adventure today. Since I'm the last person in LA to try Sushi-Gen, I decided to go solo to try the famous $15 sashimi lunch. The plan is to get in line around 10:30 am. If there's a lot of people in line already, I'll try again tomorrow. That's the one perk of working in DTLA, I'm here practically everyday anyway. Got there by 10:45 am and there was a group of seniors waiting in line already. Before I know it, the parking lot started to fill up and the line was at least 20+ deep by the time the restaurant opened at 11:15 am. Apparently, everyone loves Sushi-Gen. There were all types of people in line, from a chatty senior group to serious business types to a singing duo. Yup, the two ladies behind me decided to practice singing while waiting in line. An elderly gentleman in the group in front of me made a comment in Korean and his wife slapped him on the arm. I bet he had a smartass remark about the singing. I don't blame him. LOL When the doors finally opened, the staff efficiently sat everyone and the meal was on. I must of had sashimi written all over my face because as soon as I sat down, my server brought the menu and asked if I wanted the sashimi special. Yes, ma'am! As many Yelpers stated, the sashimi special includes miso soup, tsukemono salad, and a tofu appetizer. The soft tofu cubes were accompanied by a light sauce with scallions on top. It was a simple but delicious dish. With 4-5 sushi chefs working furiously behind the sushi bar, I got my sashimi special quickly. There was a good variety of sashimi, sliced thick and nicely arranged on the plate. My favorite was the squid that was sweet and tender. It just melted in my mouth. Mmmmm.... 營 almost felt bad enjoying the deliciousness while people stood in the waiting area watched me eat. I caught this guy staring a few times. He must have been really hungry or maybe just weird. Haha! I'm usually picky with sashimi and only eat albacore, salmon, and spicy tuna but I'm proud to say I finished everything off the plate. The fish was so fresh and delicious, it was hard not to. I even ate the one oddity which was a piece of grilled salmon. I hate cooked salmon but Sushi-Gen did something magical to it because it didn't have that cooked fishy taste and odor. Portions were just right. I was full and satisfied but not stuffed silly. I look forward to visiting again with friends who are sushi enthusiasts so we can invade the sushi bar.

Um wow...this place BLEW my mind. The sushi was super fresh, the fish totally melted in my mouth. The flavors were simple yet very effective and DELICIOUS. I definitely recommend this place. The one downside - LOOOOOOONG wait on a Friday night. I mean LOOONNNG. And it was cold waiting outside. Definitely try and make a res (not sure if they take them). The tempura was super light, fresh and delicious. I can't recommend this place enough, will definitely be returning. Oh, and another down side - because they were so crowded, we were asked to leave after out meal. We were just winding down from being so full and shooting the sh**, but then homedude came up and told us we had to go. LOL! The end.

Sushi Gen is still the lunch sashimi choice for many Japanese and Korean patrons in the downtown area. I do feel though the sashimi lunch special has deteriorated in selection and value. Price has gone up from $10 years ago to $15 today. Service is still very decent. Food appears 10 mins after order and green tea is strong and tasty. Try iced ocha on a warm day.

By far my fav sushi digg in LA. 燭here are fancier/more expensive places but the quality here is top notch. 營 love family owned restaurants; the owner mans the sushi bar every day and his son runs the floor everyday. 燭hey are the epitome of what LA should be, rather than what LA has become. 燭hey treat the regulars well and they move an amazing number of people in and out nightly as we crowd the entrance drooling for some fresh cut fish. Sushi Gen never disappoints. I heart you Sushi Gen. 營 will continue to give you my paycheck weekly! Don't bring kids, don't bring large groups, don't bring people who order chicken terri off the menu! 燨ther than that, get ready to grub.

Came here for lunch on a week day and it was super packed. There was a 45-min wait so we sat at the bar. 4-item minimum order per person at the bar. We each spent approx $25. Really fresh and delicious. Service is a tad below average. Not sure if the wait is worth it since there are other sushi places in Little Tokyo that are just as good and not as packed, but I would def come back.

Ive been coming here for years...probably just when it first opened. Many of the chefs are the same and for that matter the waitresses! I really like this place, however I do feel it is 燽ecome a bit average from too much word of mouth or Yelp! The fish is fresh? 爐o me that should really a given a sushi bar..... if you don't have that than what else? But can you tell fresh fish from frozen? flash freezing fish from japan and other countries is a must. Its 爐he quality of that particular fish, where it is from, and the expert way they cut and serve it. �They do have some of the best selections here, however that has changed somewhat over the years . They used to always have their name on the best fish at the fish market ( yes i do know) and the 爐ime and effort to make each piece has fallen a bit. 燭he assembly line of the "tuna sashimi plate" has taken over. Now please don't get me wrong I love this place.... i guess i'm just a little bitter everyone else does now too! I do get the sashimi deluxe platter, and i sometimes even eat at the bar like old times. They serve high quality traditional fare. everything is usually very good ! I cant say that it is the best anymore, but its above average and very good. 營 guess i like to talk to my chef ,look at all the fish choices, maybe get something special.... share some beer. its just now very hard to do with such a wait and an army to feed every day!

Dang this place gets packed! It is well worth it, especially during the weekdays for lunch! Such a great deal for the lunch sashimi combo. I think it's like half the price of the dinner price (so I heard). Another good dish to try is the yellow tail collar. Delicious! Of course, gotta come here during lunch time but come early because the line starts before it opens and the sashimi is unstoppable here. Sushi Gen rocks... hands down!

The atmosphere of this place reminds me of the Sushi places in Studio City (where I grew up) and thats a great thing! White/asians packing up the sushi bar....Completely unlike any other sushi places in lil tokyo-- im speaking architecturally and the environment. Albacore sashimi and sushi were soo delicious and flawless. Of course it is a bit more expensive... 2 people came out to be a $100 bill. However the couple next to us (tourists) got away with like a $26 bill for a roll and 2 pieces of sushi (Why did they come here?) Not a fan of the Giant clams. Also the chicken dinner-- too much sauce. My new fav sushi place in Lil tokyo. Expect a short wait, as this place is ALWAYS PACKED with white and asians.

I really wanted to go here, eat all really really good sashimi and give them 5 stars. Instead I came here, ate SOME really really good sashimi and decided to give them 4 stars. We arrived nice and early due to the legend of the epic lunch crowd, and boy was that a good idea. There was 1 man seated outside when we arrived and so we took a seats next him and soon after an endless flock arrived to the point that when they opened the restaurant every table was filled and people were still waiting outside. We sat down as the staff bustled around in automation. We knew we were going to try the Sashimi Lunch so there was little need to look at a menu, we ordered right away and before we knew it miso soup was served with 3 large medium tofu cubes and a small plate of salad. I myself placed the tofu in the miso and ate them out of there, yum yum, and then drank the miso, very good. Basic but well flavored with a nice consistency. Then very shortly after, even before my gf had time to finish her miso, the "Sashimi" (it wasn't all sashimi) arrived. At first glance it did not seem like much, but i was full by the time we were done. Now I'm going to make an attempt at listing what was in it (sp = speculative). Fresh Water Eel (Unagi) : Grilled to perfection. So good, I could eat it all day. Lightly Grilled Salmon : Slightly cool and good, although I would have preferred it be sashimi. Octopus (Tako) [sp] : Best I've had to date, but didn't make me a fan. Squid (Ika) [sp] : Interesting texture, not my favorite. Clam [sp] : Never really liked Clam sashimi, but it was okay. Unknown [sp] : White stick of something that flakes, didn't taste great, not nice texture. What was it? I don't know. Krab (Kani) : Its imitation crab... whats to say. Not-spicy Salmon [sp] : Tasted like the scallions more than salmon, hence I wasn't 100% sure it was salmon. Spicy Tuna : Pretty good, very scallion-y but at least you could tell it was Tuna. 3 types of tuna: Yellow Tail (Buri/Hamachi) : Very delicious, up there with the best Akami : Chopped into smaller pieces than usual, and not the best I've ever had, but good regardless. Toro of some grade : I'm not sure what cut of toro this was, probably Chutoro (medium fat), but it was absolutely delicious on the first bite, and every bite after that I had to question whether or not I had just put a sliver of fish flavored butter in my mouth. It literally melted on my tongue. Very delicious, but very fatty which is why I'm wondering if it was even possibly close to regular Toro (fatty), or Otoro (very fatty). If it was just Chutoro I fear what true Otoro tastest like in ones mouth. I failed to ask exactly what everything was, and it would be great if someone could and then post a review on the exact contents. Anyhow. I think the primary issue with this restaurant is what I ordered.. too much of a sample and not enough just good stuff. I think if I had a plate of toro, unagi and salmon I would be I would be dead happy and slip them 5 stars without even trying it. Worth the wait? not sure it. Worth the price? Questionable. I'd actually like to try them one more time, but with only fish of my choice.

Absolutely one of the best in this city! I've literally waited across the street at starbucks for 5:30 pm to hit, so I could run to the sushi bar as soon as gen opened. I was craving sushi gen's red snapper in a very serious way. They put a tiny bit of this insane salty-bitter-umami delicious seaweed pickle on top of the snapper, and it's one of the best things I've ever tasted. That seaweed pickle takes me right back to Tokyo, and I would happily eat their red snapper sushi every day of the week. If you're planning on eating at the bar, come with an extremely empty stomach! I went once with my boyfriend when I had eaten kind of recently, and it's just a miserable experience to see all that glorious sushi and not be able to consume. The red snapper, like I said, is a must. You really can't go wrong though with any choice. The Spanish mackerel is delicious, as are the halibut and albacore. Their miso soup is also awesome, and just emphasizes how authentic this place is. It's so flavorful, and doesn't fall flat like many miso soups do. We were pretty adventurous the last time, and tried the live abalone, which they literally kill right in front of you...not at all what i was expecting. I'm not even sure I knew exactly what abalone was...but now I'll know forever. I'm glad we tried it, but I could live without having it again. I haven't tried anything but the sushi, but when I see the entrees coming out of the kitchen, they look pretty amazing. You can't go wrong with sushi gen, it should definitely be your number one if you want sushi in little tokyo!

If you're a UCLA student, the only sushi places you might know are Amis and Yamato in Westwood. 燤y friend told me he wanted to get sushi and was craving Yamatos saying the sushi there was great... 營 didn't know if he was joking or not, but after I realized he wasn't, i told him we would go to a REAL sushi place. 燞e didn't understand since he thought that all fish tasted the same, but I told him thats because he hasn't had real sushi yet. I took him and 2 others who were sushi noobs and we sat at a table because we are poor college students. �When I came with my parents we sat at the bar and I did my duty and went all out). 營 made a reservation earlier for dinner so we only had to wait 5 minutes even though there was a huge wait to get in (8PM Friday night). �We were all starving so we ordered a bunch of food: Sweet Shrimp w/ the heads fried Fresh oysters 2 orders of Sashimi Deluxe 2 orders of Sushi Deluxe (comes with miso soup) 2 orders of Uni and four salmon skin handrolls As soon as the guy earlier ate the sweet shrimp, it was game over. 燞e knew right away that this was simply a different level of seafood. 營 watched everyone closely as they put a piece of toro sashimi in their mouth, and I saw everyones eyes light up. 燭hey couldn't believe how soft and full of flavor it was. 燛verything was great and I was happy everyone was satisfied. �The bill came out to $260 with tip but then again we ordered a good amount. 燭he real experience would have been the sushi bar but since we are college students, I'll save the bar for when I come with my parents or I get a job after I graduate. 燭he sushi bar will run you more, especially if you get "omakase" (chef, its up to you). �Anyways, for sushi in LA Sushi Gen is the place to be (if you are willing to shell out the $$$)!

Wow over 1k reviews and 500+ photos. What else is there to add?! 4.5 stars!! I'm definitely with the reviewers that praise this joint and I've finally got a chance to experience it. First time here was great. Despite the 20min wait, the service was good and attentive. The chefs are friendly and helpful. Food.... omg, the food. I come for the food! Here's what i ordered * toro sushi - was fresh and really good... toro ftw! * smelt fish sushi - chef recommended "no soy sauce, big bite" and so i did, the fish melted and the flavor was really good w/ a little kick of spice from the drop of the topping * spanish mackerel - the best mackerel i've had! * monkfish liver - was surprisingly very good, i enjoyed this one a lot. the chef suggested adding this green (seaweed?) to the dish and it gave it some body as well as texture to each bite. the monkfish liver had a creamy, flan-like texture to it and didn't have the overly "livery" taste i was a little sketch it may have at first. * soft shell crab - one of the items i always get at a japanese restaurant. this was pretty good and the dipping sauce added a nice flavor. this little guy was meaty to. crispy outside and tender meat. yum! * oyster sushi - was good with a light flavor, 爉ore refreshing than savory. was the last dish I got so it was a nice ending can't wait to try this place again... definitely wanna try the sashimi deluxe or omakase! :)

You can't go wrong with the sashimi here. Freshest always! Get the chirashi deluxe or the sashimi deluxe. I can still taste the tuna melting in my tongue. Even the chicken teriyaki is pretty good if you want to preserve the leak in your wallet when you come here. There's always a line here and it's no surprise. My family and I often will travel 25miles to get here before 11AM (their opening hours) so we can be the get in the first round before the line really builds up. The service is excellent. The waitresses come back often to check on us and refill our tea/iced water. They always remind us to get our parkig ticket validated. Unfortunately, even with parking validation, we usually still end up tithing to the Honda Plaza. So... I park at my own secret spot now. =P

If you're looking for legitimate sushi/sashimi, go to Sushi-Gen. 燳ou're welcome in advance for the recommendation. �I would highly recommend calling in to get reservations, as people are willing to wait an hour plus for what I consider the best sashimi you can get in Lil Tokyo...heck, the continental United States for that matter (and I can speak to waiting over an hour for a table). The sashimi deluxe ($35) comes with a variety of sashimi pieces so fresh you'd think the chefs went fishing right before your visit. 燭he sashimi dinner with tempura ($26) is another great deal for those who want something other than sashimi. I'll note that in all of my visits, I've never actually had their sushi...why get full off of rice when I can just eat fish all day long =) Once again, you're welcome.

No arguments here, the sushi that is served here is as fresh as it gets. I mean if want it any fresher, you might as well be eating the fish while it is still swimming.

Hyped up. Yes, the fish is fresh and the wait is insane, but I've definitely been to better sushi places around LA. Maybe it's my taste buds, but the fish were OKAY. They didn't entice me like Sushi Go 55 or Sugar Fish. I had the sashimi dinner and my boyfriend had the nigiri sampler. Nothing really stood out except for the salmon and albacore. Of course, everything was good -- but nothing's making me want to come back here. The prices are expected, so no complaints. However, I wish it wowed me. I had always been dying to try it out due to rave reviews, but I can say that my curiosity was disappointed. I went here on a date with my boy, and it was a great spot. Lots of couples and families were there. The environment is nice, and the service is great. However, if you've never been here, go try it for kicks. You may like it as it does have the quality meant for sushi. My boyfriend liked it better than me too! For me though, Sushi-Gen didn't leave its mark :(

Sushi's difficult to review. 營n addition to the different types...nigiri, rolls, sashimi...there are so many fishes that its really difficult to go yelp a sushi restaurant and get an objective opinion. �So my review is based specifically on the sashimi (and a few nigiris). �bear in mind that they don't have many rolls - a sign of a more authentic sushi restaurant). 燞ad their sashimi deluxe, and...5 stars. 燜or a decent price, had a wide variety of fish. 燗ll there fresh and well-cut.

As if this place needs another 5 stars. . . This is one of my favorite go-to sushi places. I don't normally come here for dinner just because lunch is so worth it. They open at 11:15, but I make sure I'm there by 11. By 11:10, the line is so long, you'd probably have to wait about 30-45 minutes so if you ask me, I say being early is worth it! Like everyone else, I get the sashimi lunch. so fresh. so good. so cheap. A lot of people complain about the sashimi lunch consisting of mostly tuna. I personally prefer it that way just b/c I love tuna. And the amazing part of it all is that the tuna here literally melts in your mouth. The uni dinner is also very worth it!! I'm not sure if this is the lunch or the dinner price, but it's only about $38 for so much uni. Honestly, this place is as good as it gets! One thing I do have to complain about is the service. I sometimes want to deviate from the norm and order other things. But the lady makes it impossible. She's ALWAYS coming to ask us what we want. I get it. People come here for the lunch special (that's why if you get seated first, it comes out wihtin a minute or so because they were already preparing for it) but if I tell you I need a couple more minutes. PLEASE GIVE ME A COUPLE MORE MINUTES.

I do love sushi, and I love a real sushi restaurant. 燜or those expecting to find trendy cut rolls to fill your American appetite, try somewhere else. 燭his is a Japanese sushi restaurant.

Oh man; I've heard about this place since freshman year! And if you just look up sashimi or sushi near downtown LA, Sushi-Gen is always on the list! I finally went for dinner one night during finals week, and the two of us split the sashimi deluxe for $35. It was so GOOD, and the best part was that we were STUFFED by the end as well! Generally, I can't imagine being full by eating raw fish, but with this stuff, it's possible. I don't remember what was on the dinner menu, but I've gone back for lunch multiple times. 燤y sashimi platter came with grilled salmon (at least I thought it was grilled), toro, tuna, yellowtail, halibut, squid, spicy tuna tartare, toro tartar, glutinous yam slices, and some salted/smoked tuna. My favorite was the toro, so I always save it for last :) It's so fatty and delicious! I always intend to get there at 11, but I usually get there by 11:30...And then the wait is almost an hour... So I'd say get there just before 11 if you don't want to stand around and wait. Once you sit down, service is so freaking fast! (Which makes sense considering what you're ordering) And I got lucky this one time with a waitress who consistently refilled my water glass. Not so lucky with a different waiter... but I'd say service better than just acceptable.

It's been years since I've been to Sushi Gen. 燭he wait is usually way too long for my hungry tummy. So, I typically leave for another restaurant. We scored with a 30 minuite wait the other night. �Sashimi is as fresh as you can get in LA. I could only wonder how it is to have it straight from the docks. I ordered the sashimi with tempura dinner, albacore tataki, and an order of hiyayako. I swear that albacore melted like butter. I could eat albacore tataki every day if I could. I ate at Sugarfish in DT a while back. In comparision, it's great also but I left there still hungry. �Sushi Gen is very traditional. You won't see much creative rolls on the menu. There's no need to cover up the flavor and quality of the fish with sauces and add ons. Can't wait to come back here again. It's hard to go anywhere else until I probably try Urawasa.

Came for dinner last night. Experience was magical, as usual. =) Started with snapper, uni, ikura. Had a couple firsts: Otoro sashimi - I DIE!!! This cut of fish is similar to toro, but closer to the neck? Yeah, I think that's it. Hell, it tastes so good I wouldn't care if it was near the anus! Or even the A itself! It's slightly lighter in color than toro, and more marbled. Served slightly lukewarm/room temp, the oils had "liquified" perfectly and texture was incredible!!! Anago - salt-water eel. Perfectly sweet finish to a satisfying meal. Ankimo - steamed monk fish liver served in ponzu sauce. Foie gras of the ocean. Yummers! Can't wait to go back!

THE BEST SUSHI I'VE EVER HAD (yes, it does deserves capital letters). I know that there are places where you can spend $500 a head and probably get better sushi, but for the price we paid this really was a phantastic experience. I'll keep it simple, we ordered: - Sushi deluxe plate (which came with Toro to my surprise!) - Sashimi deluxe plate - Tempura - 1 diet cokes - 1 White rice Total: $85 We were both completely stuffed. The only downside to this place is the parking and the wait, both of which were a pain in the ass!

This is my favorite lunch place in Little Tokyo. 燭hey have really good sushi/sashimi lunch combinations at reasonable prices. 燭he fish is always fresh and the daily crowds that gather there are always hungry, so expect a wait. �I always order the sashimi lunch. 燭he meal starts with a tiny plate of tsukemono (pickled cabbage), some silken meat-stewed tofu, and a miso soup. 燭hen you get your plate of tuna-FIVE different ways, Hamachi, Halibut, crab(mixed with imitation crab), grilled salmon, seaweed, and octopus. 燳our plate does vary slightly from day to day depending on the availability so don't be distressed if it does.

They are super generous with their portions. 營'm usually hungry after a sashimi lunch but I'm STUFFED after eating it at Gen. 營 find myself trying to give away my fish away! 燱hat a value at $15 bucks! �If you don't like sashimi try any of their other lunches. 燳ou won't be disappointed. Their bar is pretty darn good too but it can add up to a pretty penny. �For a while this used to be my favorite sushi bar.

Heard a lot about this place but never had a chance to go until recently.. Went on a Friday at around 1 and it was packed as expected but after only about 15 minutes my party of 3 got seats at the sushi bar. *Make sure that if you put your name down that you and your ENTIRE PARTY are very close by because if not the host will go onto the next group with the quickness* My only complaint about this place was that although I can definitely discern quality and freshness when it comes to sushi, I do not have a connoisseur's knowledge in terms of variety and therefore I know I 爉issed out on a lot - 燼lthough I specifically asked the chef what was good, the ONLY recommendations he gave me were amberjack and toro and the rest I had to ask for. I thought it was pretty odd given that every other sushi spot I've ever been to the chefs try to get you to eat everything on the menu.. oh well. The quality is undoubtedly top notch but it's not the only place you can get fresh fish.

Arrived at 11:45a on a Friday. No wait for lunch if you go to the sushi bar. Traditional and pricey if you don't do the lunch specials. Good hard to find fish that is VERY fresh. Had (kanpachi) amberjack for the first time, firm and deliciously buttery, not as "fatty" as yellowtail. Yellowtail belly and Japanese snapper was delicious as well. Japanese mackerel was meh, never really liked the slightly chalky texture that mackerel has. If i come here next time and sit at the bar, I'm asking the sushi chef for omakase because that seems more economical to get a tasting of all that is fresh that day. Also, note that all the lunch specials are made by "sous" chefs, and not the pro sushi chefs that man the sushi bar. I have yet to have the chance to try it, but it seems very popular. You have to be seated at a table to get the specials, they are off limits at the sushi bar.

Along w/ Sasabune, Sushi Zo, and Urasawa, I think this is the best sushi bar in LA. Well worth the drive to downtown. Nearly Tokyo-level quality. Gen has the best UNI in town. http://www.yelp.com/biz_�Great toro, too. http://www.yelp.com/biz_�The red snapper with lime and salt is among my favorites there. Their yellow tail belly is a can't miss. Ask for the SIA roll (pronounced see-uh). http://www.yelp.com/biz_�It's a secret concoction named after one of the sushi chefs, which only a handful of regulars know about. If your sushi chef doesn't know about it, ask him to ask his coworkers. They will be impressed. It's a hand roll consisting of spicy tuna, uni, ikura, toro, and several other "secret ingredients" that really differentiate the roll. The Sia Roll comes together in a perfect soft, spicy, savory, salty collection of bites. God bless you Sushi Gen.

I am not a fan of sushi and sashimi but I have to admit this place rocks. I often perfer rolls whenever I am eating out at J-restaurants with my friends. However, Sushi Gen does not have many roll options, so I was limited to a few choices. Well, I think it was destiny because in fact it gave me the chance to try out their delicious sashimi deluxe combination. Sushi Gen has an outstanding quality of sashimi. Very very fresh! Even though the food is quite expensive, I believe it is worthy with the quality. I will definitely come back. Parking is $3 with restaurant validation.

We ordered the Uni Dinner with Tempura and the Sashimi Deluxe. First thing that came out was the Uni. It came with a wooden block of a bunch of uni laid out, a big bowl of rice, and some packs of nori. This is a dish for people who enjoy Uni a lot. Next out was the Sashimi Deluxe. There were a lot of different types of sashimi on the plate. Toro, Salmon, Tuna, Octopus, Squid, the best spicy tuna ever, surf clam, and a few others. The fish was super fresh and super delicious.

Sushi Gen has been a family favorite for years. My dad's been going here for over 15-20 years. The quality is still the same. Superb quality that is. The fish is always fresh and you always know you'll get the highest quality food for the most reasonable price. Having gone to japan a handful of times, i would definitely say that its comparable to real, honest, traditional Japanese food. It's rare to come by these days. 營f you eat at the bar, prepare to eat omakase style which'll run you about $120 a head.

My brother loves this place. Loves the sushi bar and green tea. I'm also a growing fan of this traditional Japanese restaurant. And the bakery next door, Frances, is great. My mom and I went in for lunch - it was very busy. There was room at the sushi bar, though, so we sat there and had sushi and sashimi. First thing I ordered was fatty tuna. I love toro. And it's so fresh and good here. Dab a piece in wasabi cut with soy sauce... delicious! The sushi chef in front of us was preparing a whole meal for a guy sitting near us. We asked him what exactly he ordered... He explained but I didn't really understand. I think it's called omakase. It's like "give me whatever you, the chef, suggest." Everything he received looked really good. I got toro, yellowtail sushi, unagi and avocado roll, a spicy scallop hand roll... and lots of iced green tea. It's pricey.

Possibly the best sashimi I've ever had. Whenever I have family in town, we always take a trip to Sushi-Gen (pretty much everyone in my family is a huge sashimi fanatic). I must've been here at least 10 times! Even with a big party, we will tough out the no reservations rule and wait for an hour. At least parking is $2 with validation! Although the sushi here is a bit pricier, it's absolutely worth it. Sashimi deluxe is big enough to share, good variety of fish, they often change it up. Sashimi lunch special is a great deal for $15, comes with rice, miso soup, pickled veggies, and tofu! Not a fan of raw fish? Do not fret! There's good cooked food here too! I love the yellowtail collar and the salmon collar. Their cooked fish is ALMOST as good as their raw fish! Their softshell crab is typical, as is their tempura. Steamed egg custard is small but I love the stuff in it - plenty of seafood. I like my avocado, don't like their avocado roll, I think it's tiny. If I remember correctly, their beef teriyaki is nothing special.Their green tea is wonderful. I personally don't enjoy sitting at the bars; I'd rather order their entrees and platters.

Sushi Gen has become me and my coworkers' go-to spot for sashimi in LA. There are six of us, and we get 3 sashimi deluxes and 6 bowls of rice and we are good to go! The sashimi deluxe plate screams quality, presentation, and variety. Its like I took a pen and checked off the entire sushi list. The deluxe can easily fill up two people so it is perfect for groups or couples. I once starved myself for the day in an attempt to eat one deluxe by myself for dinner. I failed. To conclude, this place is a great deal and a must try.

I can't believe I've never written a review for THE BEST sushi place in Los Angeles, hands down! Why is it the best place? Their sashimi is the freshest most wondrous fish I've ever tasted in my life. It's cut perfectly, it melts in your mouth, and comes with an abundance of seaweed. I've been here both for lunch and dinner and usually get a combination of cooked and raw - the cooked salmon and sashimi combo. Even the cooked fish is wonderful. The potato salad is also very tasty. Only thing about the entree I would change is the salad (shredded iceberg with creamy dressing) - but I don't really have much energy to spend on the salad anyway. I have so much fresh fish to chow down on that I'm not focused on salad. As for the sashimi - I think my favorite is the tuna. HEAVEN. Also, the prices seem to be pretty low for the quality and amount of food you get. Not only does the food taste good, it looks good. The sushi combination platters always look so artistic and filling, although I've never ordered one. Everything is attractive and fresh. My kind of place, really. I would love to try the Omakase because those sushi chefs certainly know what they are doing. The only downside to this experience is the inevitable wait that comes along with it (oh yeah and the crowded parking lot). It's a popular place with a bar and a small dining room. Service has always been very efficient, though - and you can make a reservation - so that sometimes makes it easier. It's totally worth it, though, for the best sushi in town. I usually only get to eat here once every few months, but I seriously dream about this place!

On a recent trip to LA, my wife and I came here twice: first for dinner, and then a few days later for lunch. We did this not because there isn't good sushi at home in Denver, but because we've never seen good sushi this cheap! The definite winner of both trips was the sashimi deluxe platter. It has a great sampling of sashimi and other delicious morsels (e.g. tuna and salmon tartare). The red snapper off the ala carte menu was probably our favorite. The wait can be pretty brutal at dinner, so definitely call ahead for reservations if you can.

Hands down the BEST sushi I've ever had in my life. Boyfriend took me here for our anniversary dinner. We arrived right when they opened the door for dinner & there were lots of people. We ordered beer and plum wine for drinks =) Food: tempura, salmon sushi, albacore sushi ( i love albacore!!), and the famous sashimi deluxe. EVERYTHING was amazingly fresh melt in your mouth deliciousness. must try! Service was great, everyone was nice. Food was excellent. No complaints :)

It is one of high end sushi restaurants in LA. You can eat very rare stuff there. Uni was so-so though. These places get fish from the same market, so you know, NOT much different from other high-end places afterall...

$15 for a huge sashimi lunch, comes with stewed tofu appetizer, pickled cucumbers, and miso soup. I couldn't believe the low price for the huge assortment of fresh sushi! Wait was around 30-40 minutes; park in the lot the restaurant is in for $2.50 with validation.

When I want more variety of fish than Sugarfish has to offer, this is my sushi spot. Although they don't serve sushi over warm rice, the quality of the fish is excellent. The sushi men are really polite, and the service is good if you sit at the sushi bar. The sushi bar is the best place to sit at this particular restaurant. The sushi is a bit pricey, but it's worth paying a little more for fresh fish. I also enjoy their seaweed salad and their agadeshi tofu. This place also gets packed. Make a reservation or be prepared to wait, because this is one of the best authentic sushi places in Los Angeles, and it's no secret.

Finally got the chance to try it, and it doesn't disappoint! A bit sad that we didn't get to try the lunch special, since the wait for a table was ridiculous, we decided to just sit at the bar. Basically, everything we tried were fresh and tasty. 燭he only disappointment was their Uni, the serving was so tiny! (maybe I just got spoiled by Rokuan's serving). 燭he toro was just amazing, literally melted in my mouth - was tempted to get a second...but it ain't cheap. 燗ll the other sashimi we tried (salmon, tuna, albacore) were very fresh as well. �I will definitely be back to try their lunch special.

We had plan to have a sibling lunch with my sister and brother. 燤y sister was craving for Japanese so I suggested lunch at Sushi Gen. 燯sually I like to go to Sushi Gen super early and wait for them to open the door. 燘ut my brother works graveyard shift and cannot wake up that early. 燱e got to Sushi Gen around 1:30pm, and only had to wait for about 20 爉inutes for a table. We ordered 3 lunch entrees. 燛ach entree came with a bowl of miso soup, small plate of sunomono, and tofu. 營 remember the tofu I had before had a very tasty stew sauce. 燘ut this time, the tofu was rather bland. 燭he sauce had no flavor at all. We ordered 2 Sashimi. 燤y brother had his own, and my sister and I shared one. 燛verything on the plate was super fresh and delicious. 燤y brother came to Sushi Gen before and had sushi set. 燞e didn't think the sushi set was memorable. 燘ut he said the sashimi not only tastes better, but it's also a better deal. 燤y sister tried Sushi Gen for the first time. 燬he said she will never have Japanese food in SGV area again. 燗 lot of the Japanese restaurants in SGV are not Japanese owned, and the fish is not as fresh. We also ordered Grilled Salmon Collar to share among the 3 of us. 燭he salmon came with sashimi appetizer. We had to wait a little longer for the Grilled Salmon Collar, but it was well worth the wait. 燭he collar had so much soft and tender meat. 燭he ponzu sauce with scallion and daikon was a perfect dipping sauce for the meat. 燭he citrus flavor in the sauce was a perfect balance to the fattiness of the fish. 燱e all love this dish. Delicious and healthy lunch! 燱e enjoyed everything.

Sushi Gen is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles for sushi. 燡apanese cuisine is so healthy that I could eat out often. 燭he only limiting factor is ones monthly dining allowances. 燱hen I feel like splurging I find myself in Honda Plaza parking the car out front of Sushi Gen. �Just the other night when I was there I found out that they were celebrating more than 30 years of operation. 燗ll I can say is Wow!. 營t's no wonder why they have been going so strong for so long. 營t's the quality of the fish that is one of the most important factors in making a successful sushi place. �Inside the restaurant you have a choice of seating either at the medium sized sushi bar or sit at a table and have your food brought to you. 燛ither way the service is perfect. 營 always feel that the waitresses are sincerely interested in making your dining experience one that will be memorable. 營f we are dining before a show at the Music Center we are always finished in time to make the curtain for our show. 營f we just walk in we know that we will have to wait at least 30 minutes for a table. 燗nyway, it is always worth it. �In addition to sushi, the tempura is also a delight. 燬hrimp tempura comes with a sashimi dinner and usually we can't finish the entire portion. 燱hat else can I say that has not already been said about Sushi Gen? 燡ust GO THERE and try it, you will LOVE IT!

This is a great place to go with a group to get sashimi or the big bowls assorted cuts. If you are into thick rolls with a lot of fish this is not for you. I am too American in the tastebuds!

Like what others said, their sashimi and sushi are fresh and delicious. I got their sashimi deluxe, and it was amazing! Their toro (fatty tuna) sashimi is so good that it just melts in your mouth! YUM. The sashimi deluxe was also big enough to fill two people, and if you split it, it is fairly cheap! They have uni sushi,but I didn't get a chance to try it. Next time! Wait can be long, but if you have two people, then it usually takes 15-30 minutes. Their service is good, and our waitress kept coming back to check up on us. You can also sit at the sushi bar, but they only have a la carte menu and boxed dinner/lunch. They have a parking lot, but it can be full pretty quick. It also cost around $3-4 to park there (be sure to validate)! There's also metered parking around that area. Overall, a good experience and I will definitely come back again to sample other sushi and also to get their sashimi deluxe again.

Sushi Gen = sashimi heaven! This is definitely one of my favorite sushi places in L.A. 燭he sashimi is super fresh - my favorites are the toro and yellowtail (you get a good amount of them when you order the sashimi deluxe platter, it's big enough for two people to share). If I were just rating this place on their sashimi I would definitely give them 5 stars, but I had to knock down a star because some of the other items on their menu were only okay. 燭he chicken teriyaki was only mediocre, a bit on the dry side. 燳ou should definitely come here for the sashimi experience. The only drawback to this place is that there is a really long line every night - but that's already expected since this place is so great!

Ate here for Dinner a while back, everything was awesome we ate at the bar had couple bottles of sake between 4 of us. 燤y most memorable was the Spanish mackerel! try the bar sometime. Went here very recently with my best friend from back home and we sat down for lunch, I had the sashimi lunch (15$) amazing price, came out with miso soup, steamed tofu, rice and a platter of different sashimis and a piece of cooked fish, that day was salmon, but the waiter told me every day its different. 燗ll in all it was really satisfying and just a great experience for my friend too. 爓e also got kumamoto oysters, my friend had only tried oysters once so I wanted her 2nd experience to be great, I remember it took me a handful of times to like oysters, maybe cause I only had mediocre ones, but she was in love and I think it was her favorite thing there! �I couldnt believe how packed they were, they open at 11:15am this was a tuesday, we got there around 11:20am, i made reservations, we had to wait! wow. just opened and packed already lol. luckily we waited for max 15 minutes. 營 will most definitely be back!!

I love this place. Simply put, it's fresh melt in your mouth sushi. It's cut correctly, served at the perfect temperature and everything that sushi is supposed to be. My favorites are their sashimi combinations (which you can only get at the tables but its the best bang for your buck), the uni and the japanese red snapper. I've tried almost everything on their menu and while everything is great, I say stay away from the teriyaki dishes and the chicken karage. They are good but not worth the cost that they charge for these dishes. Besides, they are known for their sushi and not their bento boxes. Be careful at the bar, you could easily get lost in ordering sushi and sashimi and ultimately walk out with a healthy bill. Not a big deal for what you get but if you are expecting a $40 bill and walk out with an $80 bill, it dampens the experience. One of our favorite sushi places.

Simple is sometimes better. And at Sushi Gen, this couldn't be more true. If you're looking for specialty rolls, this isn't the place for you. Sushi Gen is all about high quality, traditional sushi that literally melts in your mouth. Portions are small and pricey (there are no prices on the sushi menu but expect to pay anywhere from $8-12 per single order) but well worth it for the flavor and quality. I haven't found another place in LA that does traditional sushi this well. Another component is the rice, the amount of vinegar they prepare the rice with is perfect and compliments the flavors of fish that are paired with it. Sushi Gen is a busy place and expect a wait, sometimes very long, during peak hours. The space is small, simple, and clean - just like their brilliantly made sushi and sashimi.

Hospitality not given here. The staff seems pretty full of themselves. I was told by the sushi chef not to eat rolls because there was too much rice and I should be so happy to have a professional chef behind the counter. Hmmmm. I thought to myself okay, but right now I don't want just sushi or sashimi, I want a roll. Needless to say, I was with 2 other friends and was forced to sit at the sushi bar and only after done with our meal was told that we didn't buy enough dishes to sit at the bar. We waited in line for 45 minutes to come here for lunch and there was never a minimum discussed with us when we were seated. I don't mind spending the money, its the principal. I will never go back again. They should be so gracious to have their business, cockiness will shut you down in seconds!

What's the best place for burgers? Pasta? Tacos? Even desserts? It's always hard to choose THE best restaurant for a particular dish. There's never a consensus because people are different and so is food. But, I think I can put this to rest when I say the best sushi restaurant is Sushi-Gen. This place is found near the outskirts of Japan town. If you're lost, look for a long line outside the restaurant before it's even open. I have been meaning to come here for awhile now but, for some reason, there has always been an excuse. Today was going to be different. I came here an hour early, and we made it inside on the first wave when the doors opened. We ordered two sushi deluxe. It was an assortment of sashimi for only $15! I wasn't going to celebrate just yet because I have been disappointed many times by other sushi restaurants' commitment to "low cost, high quality" propaganda. �The sushi deluxe included maguro, salmon, mackeral, octopus, squid, toro, and much more. ALL this for only $15! Everything was fresh! It was hard to believe that all three factors came into play: quality, quantity, price. It was definitely worth the wait, and I could never been happier with a meal. Don't make excuses. Just come. Thank me later.

If you don't mind 爃aving a meal in a super crowded and busy restaurant, you will like Sushi-Gen. For me, having Japanese food not only is a treat to your taste buds, to your eyes, but also to your mind. I don't like to have to shove my raw fish down hurry and leave because I could hear my neighboring tables' conversations and almost could touch their elbows. The food is alright. I have had much better raw fish as well as more creative Japanese cuisine. This is more of a straight up sushi place. It's just okay for me dawg.

Don't think this place needs another rave review of it's food, so I'll just offer some tips. It seems like the main issue here is the wait. I've been here numerous times and never had to wait! One time was a on Wednesday night at 6pm, and every other time was weekday lunch at 11:15 (right before they open). The lot outside the restaurant gets filled up sometimes, but there is plenty of street parking one block south on 3rd between alameda and central. Best sushi restaurant in Los Angeles.

If you are looking for delicious traditional Japanese then this is the spot. Bring a magazine or some friends because you will wait about an hour to be seated (party of 6 got seated in an hour which was not bad at all.) The food is worth the wait.

My most recent visit here was on a whim. Going here solo I requested sitting at the sushi bar, the hostess made note that I had to order a minimum of 4 items. I laughed in my head because that would be no problem for me. Right as a sat down Chef Masato greeted me with a warm welcome and got down to business. As I was thinking of what to order, unexpectedly I said the one word that shocked myself and Chef Masato....OMAKASE....I've been here a couple times before but it was my first time ordering omakase here and I was excited for what was in store. I told Chef Masato not to hold back on anything and here's what he dished out to me in order... - Toro Sushi - Sayori (Needle fish) Sushi with fresh grated ginger - Spanish Mackerel - Jack Mackerel - Red Snapper with yuzu - Giant Clam - Uni - Salmon Roe - Yellowtail Belly - Kanpachi Everything was so fresh and delicious. My favorites were the toro, yellowtail, red snapper and kanpachi. So good in fact I ordered more of it in addition to sweet shrimp and a toro hand roll. Yup, that's the way I handle things at a sushi restaurant...I mean business! With the sweet shrimp I had the option of having the head fried or in a miso soup. Today I picked the soup and it was served piping hot. Overall experience was great, omakase was great but not the best I've had. The best by far for me has been Sushi Ota in San Diego and Sushi Sasabune next. 營 still need to try Sushi Zo and in the faaaar future Urasawa!

There may be other places in LA that offer better ambiance with their sushi or serve more gourmet sushi, but if you want the most authentic and fresh tasting sushi that come from various cut of fish and seafood, then Sushi Gen is a must. They offer the same items for lunch and dinner. Lunch can be a bit more packed so expect to wait in line for a bit unless you come a few minutes before the restaurant actually opens at 11. 營f I sit at the table, I'll usually order the sashimi deluxe plate which can be shared with two people. 燭hat should satisfy even the biggest sashimi fan's craving for a while. 燭he kumamoto oysters here are a bit small but is so fresh and is paired so well with the sakes they have in the house which makes it hard for me not to order this combination as well when I come here. Service is ok considering how busy the place can get. 燭he servers don't really do a good job helping you select a dish or a bottle of something if you ask for their advice so come here knowing what you feel like ordering and just get it. 燭here really isn't a wrong choice for choosing something at random either. 燭he selection of sake and beer is limited. 燗t time they run out of stock of a certain bottle and will ask if you want to order something else. 燨ne time my server told me she doesn't drink sake at all so she wasn't able to help me select a bottle. 燱hen I picked something that sounded promising based on how it was made, she came back and told me they don't have that bottle but how about I get this other bottle which was double the price because she said she liked having this bottle of sake with her food usually. Umm, ok... just a bit earlier she told me she didn't drink at all so how would she know? That was probably the only time I was ever annoyed at the service of this place. 燘esides that time it's been fine. If you're short on time and can't get a table, you can always get seated at the sushi bar in front of the sushi chefs. 燭his is your opportunity to go omakase style and let the chef prepare your meals for you if you so desire. 燗ll of the items that are made omakase you can order from the sushi list if you were sitting at the table, so don't expect to try fugu for the first time here or something fancy like that. 營t's just an opportunity for you to try something you might not order on a routine visit or have interaction with the chefs. 燨makase was a fun and delectable experience albeit the pace in which you were served a new dish was a tad slow for me.

You know this place is authentic by walking in and realizing that you're one of the only 5 non-Japanese people there. It's not only the atmosphere that gives the authenticity away. The food definitely does too. I didn't realize just how Americanized most sushi restaurants are before I tried Sushi-Gen. There are none of your usual rolls like the dynamite or the crunch roll here. No, not even close. They basically only offer regular sushi (fish with rice on bottom), sashimi and a few other rolls that come with seaweed paper but merely contain fish, avocado or one other ingredient. I guess the simpler the sushi is, the more authentic it is. We ordered the baby yellowtail, toro, eel and albacore. 燛verything was very fresh, but definitely not the freshest I've had. Maybe I'm just white-washed but I just couldn't get myself to love the food. I like my sashimi but I also like to order my fried rolls with eel sauce and baked scallops mixed with mayo and all the other yummy generic rolls that most sushi restaurants in LA offer. And even if I don't feel like ordering them that day, I'd really appreciate it if they were at least on the menu.

I feel like I can get good salmon almost anywhere so no need to come here just for that. 燭he sushi deluxe was $21. � salmon pieces were $5. 燭hat wasn't bad at all. 燬weet shrimp on the other hand was $18. 燗 bit pricey. �I was also able to try the salmon teriyaki. 營t was decent. 燭empura was decent too. 燦ice batter but dipping sauce wasn't that good. 燗lthough the people there are nice, I noticed them ignoring my glass of water. 營 had to request it from them. 燭his place is tiny and gets very busy. You can make reservation up to the morning of that same day. Otherwise, you will have to wait. 燭he wait wasn't too bad. $3 PARKING with validation.

I used to love this place 20 years ago. I would have given it 7+ stars back then. But now it's overrated and overpriced. I guess that's what happens sometimes when your place becomes a local legend. All the hype goes to your and you become arrogant and cocky. Pros: sushi is pretty good, but I had better at the $1/plate kaiten sushi joints in Japan. Ok I'm not being fair... 燘ut if your gonna boast then step up to the plate Cons: host is rude or clueless and plays favorites, long wait, rest of food on menu is mediocre. If I was rating on food alone I would give this place 3 stars but the rest of experience subtracts 1 star

YUM YUM YUM! Sushi-Gen is a small hidden spot in Lil Tokyo DTLA, but with FRESH seafood everytime we go. We usually order: Live Shrimp, Abacore Sashimi, SPICY TUNA HAND ROLL, and Red Snapper! This is the sishi spot if you love fresh sushi! Planning to go to Sushi-Gen? expect 20min to 30min wait until you'll be seated. It's always pack! BUT well worth it!

Finally had a weekday free to go try their $15 sashimi lunch. 燤any reviews say to get there early, so I got there 30 minutes before they opened and there were already 10 people in line. 燘y the time they opened, there were like 30 people in line. I been wanting to try the sashimi lunch for a while now so I ordered the sashimi lunch. 燱hile waiting for my food, I looked around and it seem like everyone ordered the sashimi lunch. I don't eat sushi that often so I didn't know half the stuff on the sashimi plate. 燭here was tuna, salmon, albacore, and 5 other things. 燭o me, half the dish was pretty good, the other half was ok. 燘ut for $15, that's a pretty good deal.

I love Sushi-Gen, they serve the freshest sushi ever! I always go to this restaurant every time when I'm at Los Angeles. 燚uring the dinner rush, the wait could be a bite long, but it worth await. This is authentic Japanese sushi. The workers are really nice and pleasant. We like to sit at the sushi bar because I like to see how the chef cut and make the sushi. We ordered Nigiri only, so the bill was slightly high but was acceptable. Specially, with the quality of the sushi were served. Below are my personal flavor Nigiri: -Sweet Shrimp -Scallops -giant clam -toro -tuna -Japanese Snapper -Yellow tail

Sushi Gen rocks. 營 went twice this week: 燨nce for lunch and once for dinner. 燭he line is insane if you come at the wrong time. 燜or lunch, we made sure to arrive at 11:15 for the first seating, and for dinner around 9:40, just before closing. �For lunch, I ordered the sashi lunch special. 營t comes with a giant plate of sashimi, including maguro, hamachi, salmon, and ika. 營t also comes with a tofu appetizer, a small salad, and miso soup. 燜or $16, this is simply unbeatable. 燭he quality is top notch, too. �For dinner, Sylvia and I started with a salmon skin salad, and each got an order of asari miso soup. 燭he salad was light with crispy pieces of salmon skin mixed in--just how I like it. 燭he miso soup had four tender clams packed in, and hit the spot--especially for a chilly Friday night. �For our entree, Sylvia and I shared a sashimi plate and ordered ikura, hamachi, unagi, and tai sushi. 燭he ikura was perfect, not too salty. 燭he hamachi was the best I've had in a while. �We finished the meal with an order of tamago sashimi for dessert. �The service was excellent, as usual. 燤y tea was refilled every time it was half empty. �My only complaint is that they charge for ginger. 營 just don't get it.

Mmmm, Sushi Gen...I'm a huge fan of Japanese food, so really anything will satisfy me. Sushi Gen was truly unbelievable though. We arrived at 5:00 and were seated immediately. It's probably best to come early because when we left at 7 the place was really crowded and there was a line outside. The interior of the restaurant, although nicely traditionally decorated, is kind of small and squishy. The food: I had the dinner sushi deluxe combo, which came with miso soup, salmon skin salad, seaweed salad, sushi. For dessert: green tea mochi ice cream. The salmon skin was crunchy, which was nice. As for the seaweed salad, I've never tried anythign like it and it was interestingly slimy. I don't think that it's for everyone. The sushi: wow!! Sashimi is very obviously fresh, the meat is so soft and squishy and just plain delicious. It really just melts in your mouth...ahhh, My favorite of the sushi is probably the unagi eel which was very crunchy and savory, plus I still prefer the cooked sushi over the raw stuff. They don't have too many rolls, I think they are more famous for their sushi/sashimi. It's also kind of pricy compared to other places, but I assure you that it's worth it. Nevertheless Sushi Gen is very authentic and definitely a restaurant worth visiting/revisiting!

Please don't throw sushi rice at me, but this place was a real disappointment. I've heard so much about this place and even my parents say it's awesome. But I have to disagree. First of all, I feel like I am at a fast food restaurant with the service. Okay I could understand it's super busy, but when we ordered, the waitress was talking super fast and when my dad asked if we could substitute some items in the "sashimi deluxe," she said "no" and didn't give any alternatives. So we ended up just getting that and tempura since she seemed like in a big rush. She didn't even ask us for anything to drink so we were sitting there parched for awhile until she came back and apologized that she forgot. When the sashimi deluxe came, I was appalled at what were were getting. Really distasteful chopped up fish in piles. Some of them were in nice slices, but mostly random (as my dad would call it: "cheap crap") and non-sashimi items like a small piece of dry grilled salmon. Why the heck would you even call it "sashimi deluxe"?? Everything was below average in terms of taste except the fatty tuna, but of course anything that's fat, drenched in butter, or fried is good. The tempura was good but not spectacular. Also ordered 4pc spanish mackerel that came out to 12 dollars!! There were no prices on the menu, so I had no idea.. but you'd think... $4-5 for 2 pc. It was good but definitely not worth $3 a piece. It wasn't even nigiri! The other odd thing about this place is how they charge you for everything. The ginger is $1, rice $1 (ok that's normal).... i'm surprised they didn't charge us for soy sauce! At the end, the waitress quickly gave us the bill without us asking, subtly signaling that she wanted us out quickly. The second I signed the card, another lady took it away so fast I didn't even have time to blink. Would NOT come back unless I had to (like a birthday party).. I think there are way better places in little tokyo or elsewhere. Not worth the trek, especially with the rushed service and feeling like you're at a $ restaurant. I get better service at In-n-out

Sandwiched between several other Japanese restaurants in a relatively quiet plaza sits Sushi-Gen, a cozy yet "happening" sushi spot that delivers good sushi to the local Los Angelonian masses. Don't be fooled by the place's tranquil facade- once you enter the restaurant, you'll be submerged into an atmosphere that is buoyant with multilingual conversations and as bold as the bright red-painted walls that encloses the quaint, yet clean space. The sushi was relatively fresh. To my (and most definitely my sinus') surprise, they pack their Tuna and Salmon sushi pieces with a little more wasabi than normal. Their spicy tuna roll and fresh water eel were particularly good, and their Ankimo was excellent but must be eaten fresh. Considering how busy they were, I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent service. Our adorable Japanese server was incredibly attentive, and she would come by every 5-10 minutes to refill our green tea. Parking hint: Though they usually place a "Lot Full" sign in front of the plaza parking lot, if you drive up to the entrance, the guys will usually move the sign for you and tell you there's a spot. $3 for parking with validation.

As most reviewers has stated, it gets packed before opening, it surely does. Friday, July 22nd, arrival to Sushi Gen was 10:45 AM. Thought they opened at 11, but the restaurant changed opening time to 11:15 AM. Two people were waiting ahead of us. By the time it was 11:10, i counted over 20 people arriving and waiting in line. By the time Sushi Gen allowed everyone in, the place was instantly packed. Yes, I did count! =) Took my cousin from out of town here, along with my bf, and I. My bf, a Sushi Gen fanatic, and I ordered and shared the Sashimi Lunch (exactly on the menu) and the Salmon Collar Lunch Special. Both $15 each. He has mentioned that the Salmon Collar was amazing. Tried it and OMG,it heavenly melted in my mouth. I, not a big fan of ANY salmon skin, was actually able to eat this. First time ever eating salmon skin from the SALMON COLLAR LUNCH. I tried to switch lunch plates with my bf, but we ended up fighting for it. Not only does the Salmon Collar lunch comes with the usual miso soup and salad, but it also comes with a sashimi appetizer of 3 pieces of tuna I believe, 2 slices of unknown, and two more of another fish. What a deal! Definitely want to go back for this entree. I ordered the Sashimi Lunch, if you love raw fish, this is the best! Worth the price. I was definitely in fish heaven after seeing all the pieces of delectable fish I can eat. Ate 3/4's of the plate, it was A LOT. Ended up giving the rest to the bf to finish. My cousin ordered the salmon teriyaki lunch special, which too came with a sashimi appetizer. Tried some of her food and it was delicious too. Service was excellent!! Worth the drive. Can't complain about the food at all. Best recommended for sushi/sashimi/raw fish lovers! Or for authentic Japanese food. Dessert, we walked to Beard Papa's for Cream Puffs.

I HEART sushi-gen!! I have been frequenting this gem for the last 5 years. Every single time I come its worth the wait and the money. I went tonight, Friday night at �pm. The wait was not bad at all, but that might be because 4 parties on the waiting list before us were absent. Yayyyy!! Haha So to the important information... THE FOOD!! Sashimi Deluxe $36 ( big enough for 2 hungry girls) ...aka bombskies. I particularly enjoy the fatty tuna that they give you and the large assortment of fish that comes with the dish aka tuna, spicy tuna, salmon, squid, octopus, yellow tail, cooked egg, cooked salmon, and tiny sardines. Since its sashimi it does not come with rice. And what is odd is it also does not come with GINGER!! They charge extra for that. However absurd, I can forgive them only because the quality of the fish is so great. Green Tea ($1.50 per person) One disclaimer you should know is it is really expensive to order at the bar. Its a much better deal to sit at a table and order the sushi combo, sashimi combo, and other stuff. Granted sitting at the bar is a whole different experience but those sushi pieces add up easily to $50 a person!! So to be friendly to you wallets get combos or the deluxe and share.

Sushi Gen was where I first tasted sushi sashimi. 燗fter that experience, my life has never been the same. 燣et's just say that if there's one place you want to be to get sashimi de-virginized, it's at Sushi Gen. 營'll also say that if I had a choice, Sushi Gen would play a big role in my last meal on Earth, someway, somehow. While sitting at the bar precludes you from ordering off their lunch or dinner menu, it does give you more facetime with the jolly chefs who make you feel very special merely by a respectful bow, smile and enthusiastic greetings (Arigato gozaimasu to you too!!). 燬o that's what we decided to do with a 4 order minimum per person. �Full review w/ photos here: http://www.doahshungry.c�###Soojin S.

Sashimi lunch special for $15. I don't even like sashimi (I prefer sushi, the rice makes it that much better for some reason), but my mouth is watering just thinking about the yellowtail melting in my mouth!!! My only complaint would be that the wait was long (over an hour for a table for 4) but it was definitely worth it. I just walked on over to the bakery, as my yelper friend Suji C. recommended in her review, and bought some macarons, which I ate as an appetizer for my lunch. The lunch special came with rice, miso soup, and a small salad. I also ordered a sunomono, which is a marinated cucumber dish and that was superb as well. But how could that go wrong. All in all, it was a fantastic lunch that started an awesome day in LA with friends (:

Definitely my favorite sushi place in Los Angeles, hands down. Located in the heart of Little Tokyo, the restaurant faces fierce competitions from its fellow Japanese brethren; but the quality of food that it produces makes it stands out among the other restaurants. This is the place that I always bring my girlfriend to for special occasions. Parking is definitely a minus here, as the parking space in the lot is very limited (there are about 10 other eateries in the same tiny plaza,) I often find myself parking on the street about a block away. If the lot is open, however, be prepared to shell out ~$2 even with validation. Wait time can also be very long; even on a Tuesday afternoon at 11:30, my girlfriend and I had to wait for a good half hour before we were seated; during busy hours you're probably looking at a 40 minute wait (depending on your party size, of course.) But is all the trouble finding a parking spot and waiting for a table worth it in the end? It definitely is. Sure, their menu can be intimidating in the price range (ranging from 25-35 for dinner,) but the sashimi that they produce is top-notch. My favorite is the sashimi combo- they give you a VERY generous amount of tuna, hamachi, snapper, spicy tuna, and other breeds for $15 (lunch) and $26 (dinner)- it's a STEAL for lunch. I have tried their beef/sashimi combo as well, and the amount of beef that they give you is pretty generous as well. Don't forget to get your ticket validated on the way out!

5 stars to the most important thing that matters, FOOD! The sushi is fresh. I repeat, the sushi is FRESH! It's amazing of what you can actually eat and enjoy when the fish is fresh. If you're brave enough, ask the chef to prepare you his choice of "rare" fish. ;) I don't really care for the other side dishes to be honest. I'm only there for one thing. The wait can be brutal, but you're going to have to wait at any decent restaurant in the area. Just make sure you get your valet ticket validated.

Sushi Gen is the perfect place for sushi! The restaurant is situated in the Honda Plaza in J-town. There are other sushi restaurants close by, but Sushi-Gen appeared to be the only place that was bustling with people. -Apparently, it's always busy, so my advice (as always) is to get there early! We arrived there at 5:30pm on a Saturday and luckily, we just beat the crowd. The wait wasn't too bad and we were seated pretty quickly. Service was fast and our drinks and orders came out promptly. -Nice! We ordered various sashmi and sushi items for 6 people and chicken terriyaki and tempura combinations. The combination dishes came with miso soup, noodle tofu, and rice The sushi is melt in your mouth amazing and the other dishes were simply delicious! Everything was super fresh and the portions were large. It was all in all a great dining experience and we are planning on another visit in the near future!! Incidentally, the types of people that ate at Sushi-Gen that evening were from the very hip to the traditional Japanese crowd. It was a nice mixture of people and good ambiance. Go try it! Just wanted to add: The evening we visited 100% of the proceeds from that evening went to the Japanese Relief Fund. I think that was very, very generous of the Sushi-Gen owners. Other restaurants were only giving 20% -30% of their proceeds to charity.

I made some good friends with Sushi men there, and they are very friendly and helpful on choosing dishes. I like seating at the sushi bar better than the table. Their sushi is always FRESH and I espcially love their Uni & Snapper (ask them to make it with Lemon Salt sauce) which I can eat all Day and all Night!!

It's located inside the Honda Plaza. I went to see what all the raves were about. So I came here w/o ressies for dinner on a Saturday. The wait was about 30-45 minutes. Once inside there's a long sushi bar on the left and table seating on the right. We were seated by the door. Anyway, we ordered: 1. SALMON SKIN SALAD Mixed greens with bits of salmon and salmon skin. Only complain is the skin needs to be crisper. 2. SHRIMP TEMPURA You'll get 3 pieces with ponzu dipping sauce. The shrimp is butterflied, so it's not as meaty. 3. SUSHI A LA CARTE (2 pieces) From the sushi list we ordered: giant clam, tuna and yellowtail w/ginger and scallions. 4. SUSHI DELUXE COMBO Spicy tuna roll, yellowtail, tuna, and halibut. The sushi was good, but not "wow-zers." I've had better and fresher fish. Like Smitcha B. says, "I'm not saying I wouldn't come back, but I'm saying that by the words of others and all these 5 star posts, I was a bit let downed." Cost for party of 2 for 4 dishes and 1 Asahi and 1 ice green tea is about $70 w/o tip.

Ever wanted to find sushi perfection? It's here in a small spot in J-Town in Los Angeles. I found my way here from Yelp reviews. My first indicator that it was going to be good: it's in J-Town. Second indicator: patrons arrived 1 hour before dinner time to stand outside to get in line. Dinner was at 6 pm, we were outside at 5 pm and we were not the first in line! Third and final indicator: the menu is in Japanese and there are no prices next to the specials. The parking lot charges you to park in it so if you want a decent spot, arrive early or risk walking and parking in the surrounding area. I ordered their tempura and cucumber roll. I was in SHOCK that a damn cucumber roll could even be so tasty! My bf ordered some toro (fatty tuna) sashimi... I had to convince him not to order another plate because it was gonna be another $30. We are definitely going to make another trip down to L.A. just for this place. I can't believe I didn't write this review sooner but yes, I am willing to drive/fly/roller blade or row a boat down to SoCal from the Bay for this place. - That's how good this spot is!

I don't know what they eat. Probably they eat something before they come. Everyone said food is good. I know it is fresh. But really can not tell the price and quality difference can be matched.

20 minute wait for lunch wasn't too bad. The service is quick and friendly. I had the tempura and sashimi lunch combo and we split the sushi deluxe. The sashimi cuts were very nice and firm, yet melted in your mouth. The tempura wasn't the best I've had in Little Tokyo, but I guess that's just MY bias--it was a little heavy and I wanted more variety of vegetables (no sweet potatoes!? no broccoli!?). Miso soup, green tea, and pickled veggies were all tasty, too. I'm not big on tofu, so that side wasn't my favorite. I will definitely come back here and compare it to other places I've tried, but thus far, it may be just a hair below the others. Great place to come for good quality, fresh sashimi.

OISHII!!! =) 燤Mm.. where do I start? This is one of my favorite sashimi places in Los Angeles. My favorite item to get is the sashimi entree with the tempura because it comes with soup, rice, and a pickled cucumber side if you make it a dinner combination. I would make a reservations ahead of time because if you don't, you will be waiting outside with the other hungry people for a very long time! Service is pretty fast because they want you in and out for the other people waiting which almost felt a bit rushed if you are the type to linger at a table but not the point where I didn't feel like I couldn't enjoy my meal. Sashimi platter will include tuna, yellow tail, spicy tuna, and other tasty sashimi delights! Fish is always fresh and slices are pretty generous. If you want to go all out with your sushi gen experience, order the nigori cold sake with your sashimi entree. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. ;)

So many good sushi joints in L.A.! Sushi Gen is one of my favorites. I don't care about the parking (yes, sometime it's full) the crazy waiting time to be seated during rush hours or other little things people find annoying. I come for the food. The best, freshest sushi in town. I usually seat on the bar. You cut the waiting time but limited to sushi menu only. The hand rolls are heavenly. My favorites are the crab (real), spicy tuna and spicy scallops. I didn't like sea weed until I had Sushi Gen super tasty, crispy see weed (they don't have soy paper). Their sashimi is quite amazing and will melt in your mouth. Again, fresh fish is the name of the game. If you don't have high expectations because it's so highly rated (I overheard this gal waiting outside; "they better have Jesus christ himself make my sushi") you'd love this place!

Apparently this place has the best sushi ever. My friends consistently spend almost $100 every time they come here with nary a complaint. So why just 3 stars? At the risk of everyone coming after me and killing me, I have to admit that I do not eat sushi. I know. Gasp. In my defense, I was dragged here by sushi-obsessed friends who forced me to sit at the sushi bar. WHY?! But the experience was worth it. The sushi chef was so nice and understanding. I ordered the eel avocado roll (yum!), sweet shrimp, and salmon roe. All very delicious. It was pretty amazing seeing him prepare all the different sushi items - I can kind of understand why people wait for such a long time (we had about a 40 min wait) to eat here and for so much money. I must say, however, that my wallet was very happy that I do not eat sushi since my total came out to be $20 whereas everyone else paid $80-110. KEKEKE. In conclusion, I would say that if you are a sushi lover, you should come here at least once. If you are a faux sushi lover like me, don't come here unless you absolutely have to. Thanks!

Excellent. The sushi rice was warm and delicate. I indulged in one of everything. The Kanpachi, Surf Clam, Uni, Ikura, Toro were all exceptional. I see why the place is stacked on a Tuesday evening. No question about it. Eat at the sushi bar. 4.5

While eating dim sum for lunch, my friend tells me about this place in Little Tokyo that has a ridiculous $15 sashimi plate for lunch that is probably worth more than what I'd pay. I'm like...dude, that can't be serious. Well, he was serious. Very good sashimi at an epic price. Salmon, yellowtail, tuna, spicy tuna, albacore, toro...I'm probably missing something right now, but for around 25 pieces it's worth its weight in value and then some. I don't even mess with the soy sauce on something this good. Granted, parking is kind of a pain in the ass (it's L.A. after all) and the wait took about 30 minutes at lunch. But for this deal? I'll wait gladly.

My bestie wanted to meet for sushi in little tokyo, somewhere neither of us has been before. 燬ince I've always wanted to try Sushi-Gen but have always been taken aback by the long wait (I don't want my food-deprived-passed-out-limp body to be carried to the table) I've never paid my sushi patronage here. So we've decided to stick it out no matter how long the wait would be just to try it...at least once. 燱hoa....surprisingly there was no wait for the sushi bar!! Score....air kisses!! We ordered ankimo to start and the sashimi deluxe dinner to share and also ordered the yamagobo (mountain yam). The quality of fish is super fresh. 燯nlike some places, they don't douse the sushi in ponzu sauce, but instead lightly drizzle some so one can truly appreciate and enjoy the taste and quality of fish. Sushi-Gen, check. 燨ne satisfying trip indeed.

Sushi Gen is one of those restaurants where I have to stop and really think over the meal, trying to figure out if I liked it because of its popularity and the thrill of trying something new or if it really was that good. We came here for lunch on a weekday to celebrate our monthly anniversary (yay!) and enjoy something different. We found metered parking across the street and walked over ($2 for 1 hour, quarters, dollar coins and credit card only) but there is a parking lot with validation...it just doesn't have a lot of spaces and is always crowded. When I went in I was immediately reminded of Taiko in Irvine which has that same decore style and even menu. Although it had a little more on the sushi & sashimi side, something about Sushi Gen just didn't make me love it. They have decent lunch specials, prices ranging from $15 to $30+ depending on the combination of ingredients. I picked the uni and sashimi combo ($32) which came with a tray of fresh uni and a small bowl of 8 pieces of sashimi as well as rice and a bowl of miso soup. K ordered the sushi deluxe, which was a round tray of a variety of sushi. ($17, I think?) The fish was alright, it was fresh but after the initial piece, I kept thinking that it wasn't...wow. It just didn't have impact. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't...great. The flavours weren't memorable to the palate. I did like the uni, tasty and fresh, K and I omnomnomed our way through the tray, plucking at the sides like seaweed and mixed tuna salad that decorated the plate the tray arrived on. K really liked the cooked tofu side, which didn't fall apart on his chopsticks. The meal was okay for the price we paid, which was already cheaper than our meal at Toro's last week and tastier at least. But if I was given my choice, I think I'd rather pay less at Oomasa or drive to a further restaurant for a cheap omakase than drive to Jtown just for Sushi Gen. Decent but a let down in my opinion. My fishie cravings will continue to search out other places. A puzzling thing...there was no salmon in either of our dishes. None at all. I don't know if they ran out or this is just not part of their repertoire for the dish but I thought that was a bit strange.

I have been wanting to try this place, since it has high ratings. We waited about 50 minutes to be seated, which was fine the first 30 minutes because my girlfriend and I were talking, but after 30 minutes I ran out of things to speak about. Sat down, the service was good, not great. Ordered miso soup which was amazing! Next ordered the sushi deluxe and tempura, it was good nothing I would travel 30 minutes to go back too. We also had the spicy Tuna roll, they do not have rice paper so seaweed was my only option and I don't care for it. The roll was alright,they had this really good hot sauce I wanted to ask for tortilla chips because it would have been so good. Last we had greentea ice cream, average. This place does have fresh fish, other then that I could take it or leave it.

Yay I am a definite fan. Took a trip to my husband's dermatologist today and inquired about a good sushi place. 燢inda hard since his dermatologist is located in Little Tokyo but Sushi-Gen came highly recommended. We were 1 1/2 hour early so we decided to walk around and finally decided to make our way there around 10:55am. 燝ot there at 11:00am (since they open at 11:15am) and there was already a long line out. Lesson #1: GET HERE EARLY. GET HERE 20-25min early for a table guarantee. 燭able=lunch special. And their lunch special was great. Had the combination salmon terriyaki and sashimi and it was made just right. The salmon was not too salty, the sauce was just right. And you can never go wrong with their sashimi. 燩ossibly the best have I've by far. It melts in your mouth. The lunch special comes with rice, salad, tofu and soup. I hear that at night the prices bumps up to almost $100 for the sashimi...I heard. �Anyway, definitely worth a try and a trip when around downtown L.A. Ohh and this place runs pretty efficiently though so even if you are waiting, table shouldn't take too long before one opens up.

I'm always baffled by the great reviews this place gets. I've been 3 times over the last 10 years or so, and every experience has gone the same... friendly staff, good drinks, mediocre fish. Sure there are always a few delicious pieces of fish - like the Spanish mackerel I had last night. But then the salmon and snapper were both awful, and everything else was just average. I won't bother naming the far superior Little Tokyo offerings, but I kinda feel like you're hard pressed to find something more average... VENTURE OUT PEOPLE!!!! Seriously, any person who has eaten truly excellent sushi would not even give Sushi-Gen 5 stars on it's very best day. Many people cite the long lines and glowing reviews as proof of how great it is. Well in terms of lines, think of the lines at Pink's hot dog stand. Need I say more? That place SUCKKKKKS! And yes there are a lot of positive reviews for Sushi-Gen, but I can't tell you how many times I have been told by self proclaimed "sushi snobs" how great some place is which turns out to be very average. It's a common problem - most people simply don't know the difference between good and great. I find the same to be true of wine. If there is a big fat rating from Robert Parker, most others jump on the bandwagon and say they love it. But if they find out the review was lousy, they suddenly don't love it as much. Typical. Anyhow my FOOD rating is 2 stars, based on the Yelp description of what 2 stars means "Meh. I've experienced better." My gut was to give it 3 stars, however I cannot call Sushi-Gen "A-OK." So there you go. I'd give the staff 4-5 stars. They were so accommodating and friendly. Can't complain there!

came here on a weekend and we got lucky and only waited around 10 mins. The service here was pretty good. The place was super packed and the line was pretty long. We both got a dinner plate and those things comes with a bunch of stuff. Our table for 2 could barely fit everything that we got. The sashimi was super fresh and melts in your mouth. Yes, this place is $$ but the quality is really good. The only thing I didn't like was the shredded yams, too creamy for me. Overall, for yummy fresh sushi, I definitely recommend.

I went with the sashimi dinner plate, a side of rice, and one order of the umeboshi roll. 燭he boyfriend had the chicken teriyaki and tempura combo dinner, which came with a variety of side dishes.

Sushi Gen is hands down my favorite sushi restaurant. 營'll be blunt - I love sushi. 營've eaten at just about every sushi joint in Orange County, and quite a few in LA County. 燦othing compares to this place. 燭he freshness of the fish (salmon, tuna, yellowtail, you name it) gave me this tingling sensation of unparalleled satisfaction...and no, it's not because I ate Fugu. My favorite entree is the Salmon Collar. 燭he outside is perfectly blackened, encapsulating a sweet, tender, juicy and succulent center that tastes like no sea creature you've ever sampled before. 燗fter staring blissfully with a distant smile on your face for a few seconds, you realize that you're simply eating salmon. 燭he businessman sitting across the restaurant gives you an awkward look because you may or may not have been inadvertently staring at him during the dreamy moment of the first salmon collar bite, but you don't care. 燳ou have an entire plate of salmon collar in front of you waiting to be finished! �Couple that with one of their sashimi lunch specials and you're in for one of the best Japanese lunches you'll ever eat. 燣ast time I went, they were out of salmon collar, and a part of me wanted to cry on the inside...but that's cool. 燭he beef's pretty good too.

Sushi Gen is one of my favorite sushi places in Little Tokyo. This place is always packed by 7 PM and the wait becomes an hour long so going right when it opens (at 5:30 PM...) is highly recommended. They also seem to have fresher sashimi available earlier on in the night. We ate: Uni, Toro, Albacore, Soft Shell Crab Soft shell crab: This is amazing. Once you bite into it, you feel like you're swimming through a medley of flavor. I can never share this - always get your own order. Delish. Sushi: Sometimes you get lucky and the sushi chefs pile on the uni- othertimes, you get a mere single slice. The toro is usually consistently good here and isn't too veiny or oily. As for the albacore, Sushi Gen is my favorite place for it. Just the right amount of green onion, ponzu and ginger!

A sushi restaurant that lives up to its hype. Unforgettable otoro + expert fish-cutting skills. For the best experience, sit at the sushi bar (even if you have to wait 60-90 minutes). The bar is very cramped but worth it. In a sushi restaurant, I look for two things: Expert fish cutting by Sushi Jedi Masters and sourcing. Sushi Gen fared well in both. As contrary as it may sound, it's not about freshness (fish can be aged) but about sourcing. In every industry, there is a pecking order - unless you have connections, the "new guy" isn't necessarily going to get the best stuff. Sushi Gen commands high-quality fish. I had a few pieces with overly warm rice but I overlooked it. Additionally, the service is VERY unsatisfactory but I blame this on management - the restaurant is just too busy. If you order fancy smancy sashimi plates (dining tables), chef assistants make your order as opposed to a Sushi Jedi Master so sit at the SUSHI BAR! MY HIT LIST (18 nigiri pieces and 4 maki pieces): Sapporo (large, bottled) Sayuri nigori sake Otoro (3 pieces): Sublime (look at the pic); at $8/piece, savor it slowly Amaebi (1): Standard (but delicious) sweet shrimp Hamachi belly (1): Creamy, intense fatty flavor Tako (2): Octopus was okay; small and a bit dry Tai (2): The red snapper was beautiful with a tangy accompaniment Ankimo (2, nigiri-style): It was a bit dry but flavor was intense Kohada (2): Salty goodness (it's a 4-inch gizzard shad) Shiro maguro (4, not orders, maki-style): Buttery and flavorful Tamago (2): Simple but excellent Anago (2): The "dessert"; perfect, happy ending To finish your palate, complete your sushi dinner with tamago, anago or unagi...or all three ;) May the Spanish Bluefin toro would be you. Cheers.

WOW. One of the best sushi places I've eaten in California so far! I've actually been looking for a good sushi place, cuz I simply L-O-V-E SUSHI!! It's my favorite food out of any other out there. I am seafood's greatest enemy (: I went here today for early Christmas dinner with my fam bam. Good thing I made a reservation because as soon as I entered the door, there were a lot of people standing there waiting to be seated! I couldn't find Sushi-Gen as I was driving on E. 2nd St. But as I cornered the other side of the plaza, Sushi-Gen was hiding in the corner with a blue sign that read "Sushi-Gen." We were seated inside, not at the sushi bar since it was full. The waitress was really nice and at first I wasn't really sure how the menu worked, because they didn't have any explanation to it whatsoever. So we decided to order lots of sushi because I wanted to eat sushi I love! So here's the list: -Sweet Shrimp(THE BEST RAW SUSHI EVER) -Uni AKA Sea Urchin (This was very very fresh) -Tuna -Clam -Octopus -Yellow Tail -Spicy Tuna Roll -Eel Avocado Roll (The rolls are really small, unlike the ones you get at places that have happy hours) They were all very delicious. I didn't want the fried shrimp heads since I am on a diet, but they had another choice you could get: Shrimp Head miso soup. YUM! That was delishhhhhh. I ordered diet coke. I wasn't sure and am still questioning if refill of it is free... The cup was so tiny. But that doesn't matter because one cup of diet coke was enough (: Little Tokyo has so many sushi places, but so far, Sushi-Gen is my favorite! I have to read some more Yelp! reviews and try some other good rating sushi places. Our bill came out to be over $200 with tip, but it was all worth it for a special occasion. Christmas! (; I'm gonna try some other great sushi places and see if I'll come back to Sushi-Gen or some other place. I was also trying to go to Urasawa, but their reservation was full ): So I'm guessing their sushi is REALLY good. Most def. try this place out, cuz you won't regret it!

It totally makes sense since they have to restock quite frequently. 燗nd let me emphasize that experiences may vary depending on who your sushi chef is. 營 usually sit at the bar and prefer the animated older (grandpa-type) chefs. 燬ushi is an art, and the older chefs have the advantage of having had more time to masters at their skills. 營n Japan, the people tend to work diligently their whole lives, mastering whatever their craft. 營 love the animated chefs because their sushi becomes animated as well. 燳ou really can't ignore the heart that goes into how your food is prepared. �The UNI and AJI were PURE JOY on my palette. 燭he uni was so fresh that it melted perfectly over the slightly warm rice and seaweed in my mouth. 營t turns actually sweet after 2 seconds in your mouth, and I couldn't help but eat 3 more. 燤ay I say it was the BEST AJI I'VE HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE. 營 usually enjoy the Aji at Sushi Gen but last night's was truly the BEST. 燱e also ordered hamachi (rich and buttery as usual) and ankimo (sooooooooo good). 燫ED SNAPPER is also one of the best. 營 love the jalapeno relish garnish on top which brings out the clean taste of this fish. �We ended the meal with a spicy tuna handroll, the best way to end a great sushi meal. 燭here wasn't too much rice and the coldness of the spicy tuna went perfectly with the warmness of the rice. 燭he nori was also perfectly crispy. 燛VERYTHING WAS PERFECTION! Oh yea their green tea is so good! Real authentic Japanese green tea. :)

came here with my mother for lunch on a tuesday around 11:30am. we thought that since it was pretty early, there would probably be not be many people waiting to eat but when we got there it was VERY crowded and for a party of two, we waited for 40min. i feel like the wait is the only downside to this place parking is very practical. the plaza where sushi gen is has its own parking lot and upon entering, u take a ticket and wait for a spot. since this little plaza consists of many restaurants, people are constantly leaving and arriving so its not difficult to land a parking spot. REMEMBER TO GET YOUR TICKET VALIDATED! ($2 with validation, not bad at all) my mom ordered the lunch special chicken teriyaki & sashimi combo ($14) and i had the lunch special sashimi ($15), both were YUUUMMMYY (: !! $15 for the amount of sashimi i got was DEFFFFIIINITELY worth it AND it lived up to all the hype. and if u want more rice, they offer free refills which is a plus.

5 stars for the lunch alone. Sure it's packed. Busy. Cramped. It is worth it. Fish is fresh. Service is nice and swift. The lunch special has so much much. It's kind of ridiculous. Basically like most reviews state, there's about a 20-30 minute wait, but you get your food fast and you are literally done a little over an hour. Parking is validated for a few bucks and can be a pain, but there are places close by to park and if you have time, just walk around. I love the consistency of this place. Never had a bad meal yet.

DDDDdrrrrrOOOOOLLLLL!!! I have never tasted such fresh sashimi before in my life! My sister & her bf have been debating and arguing which sushi restaurants reign number one. First pick by the bf was Yoshi's...it was great! Can't complain. Now it was my sista's turn, & her poison was Sushi Gen. Me??? I just let both of them feed me :) This place was bumpin when we arrived, but thankfully, we got a seat in seconds by the entrance. We started with hot sake. Smooth, hot, and just right. We started out by ordering the [Sashimi Dinner] and couple rolls of albacore tuna, fatty tuna, yellowfish, salmon, Ikura, and I forget the others. When the Sashimi Dinner arrived to our table, we def got the curious stares from our neighboring diners. The two ladies to my left immediately asked, "oh my..what is that dish called?? that looks delicious!" Yes....it was delish, fresh, melts in your mouth, and I was left speechless guzzling down smoked salmon & tuna and washing it down w/sake. Then we got our sushi pieces. The Ikura (big fish eggs) was just as we remembered it as lil girls...fun to eat and a burst of happiness in each egg. I ordered the fatty tuna and told my sis to try it. She was shocked at how it melted in her mouth like a dream. The rest of our feast was....a feast. I didn't have the heart to give it a complete 5 stars because I felt our waitress had a hard time communicating with us. We asked her about a sushi we didn't recognize and she got someone else to answer our question. But other than that... this place met my standards and exceeded my expectations. Sushi Nirvana tucked in heart of Little Tokyo.

Does this place live up to its reputation? Certainly. Sashimi combo is hands down-best dish to have when you are having biz social drinking. I think they have at least 10+ sushi chef behind the sushi bar. Must be super organized. Will have my business. Try to go here around 9- line isn't too bad.

Why is this place at almost 900 reviews and averages 4 1/2 stars!?!?!?!? It's that GOOD! Tucked away in the midst of Downtown LA right in Little Tokyo, Sushi Gen is more like a GEM! While we were waiting to be seated a saw there was a NO Cell Phone sign. I must admit, it was a first and I didn't quite understand the meaning of it. I took a look at the bar and saw many business men eating, thinking this must be difficult for people like them. Anyways, we were seated right at the bar where all the excitement is! This is a LEGIT Japanese establishment. They serve straight nigiri and several rolls that are very traditional. No fancy shmancy rolls names after the chefs, just fresh fish and wonderful appetizers. The sushi chefs were amazing nice and funny! There is a minimum of 4 orders per person so be aware of that. I'm thinking that is why it becomes very pricey. Yellow Tail - Yes it's been a while since I've tasted fresh yellow tail. Scallop - juicy and mild tasting Spicy Tuna Roll - surprisingly good since this is something I do not order quite often Unagi - can't beat the flavorful taste of fresh eel Snapper - tender and meaty Salmon Skin Roll - small but sufficient Salmon Collar - they pretty much gave us an entire piece of salmon.. I for one did not complain :) Japanese Mackerel - one of the faves. Not salty at all! This place works hard to keep the tradition alive and I'm glad I've experienced it.. FINALLY! Now I know why this place averages 4 1/2 stars.. can't beat it... no way!

Go for lunch! It's cheaper and the sushi still tastes deliciously great! I got the Grilled Collared Salmon with a sashimi appetizer. It came with rice, soup, and a small plate of salad all for $15. Might I say they offer a generous sized salmon. It was tender, juicy, and matched great with the light green onion soy sauce. The combination was fantastic, healthy, and satisfying. +good service & definitely a clean place (host kept trying to keep a persistent fly out while still managing the seats)

Have read RAVE reviews about this on yelp. And I am totally a believer!! Best freshest tasting sushi I've ever had in my life. We decided Omakase was the way to go, so we took a seat at the sushi bar. Our sushi chef was awesome, he really blew my sushi mind. He would give us advice on which pieces to avoid the soy sauce as to truly attain the flavor of the fish. And here's a first, fried shrimp heads, yep, i'm a newbie and had no idea on how to begin devouring this fried goodness. Luckily, the couple next to us were super friendly and gave us some pointers. 燱hen I was down and off that sushi train, the BF kept going, being presented with amazing new fish and delicacies. When we were both sufficiently satiated and happy, we got the bill. This place is decently expensive but the relatively cheap house sake evens it out ;)

I blame Ben G. If you read some of my first reviews on yelp, this name comes up ALOT. "Spent the whole day shopping at an Italian specialty stores, trying out truffle oil". all ben's fault. "omg...wally's tent sale... so amazing, free tastings -- wine for breakfast". ben's fault. And if i'm not mistooken, I'm sure more then a few yelpers have mentioned this mr. connoisseur of all things lavish in their reviews. So when we went on an adventure for sushi (after a whole morning and afternoon of wine, truffle oil, fatty meats, breads and cheeses). figure, it's slightly healthier right? So far-- the best sushi place I've gone to is Sushi ZO (located in culver city). It had a fusion of french food in it's flavor, which I enjoyed. After this was Sakura, located on Centinela, where their huge hunks of salmon always keep me coming back. I have to be honest. When they sat us in front of Kazu-san, at the sushi bar, I was not remotely hungry. We had omakase, and I'm still dreaming about the meal. The toro was, a tour de force. Something so fatty and succulent, it enraptured my taste buds, while slowly enveloping in my mouth. It melted slowly, while the perfectly cooked rice (still warm), fell apart in my mouth. and THAT was the first order. I had seawater and freshwater eel, side by side. Never had I gone to a sushi bar, where the chef made this distinction nor, took the time to describe it. I personally like the freshwater eel better, though I would have happily, swallowed up the whole ocean to get more of those eel goodies. There was albacore with added zest and a hint of mint, which shook my senses. (I usually dislike any hint of mint like substance next to my sushi, but this worked). I apologize I don't know the exact name of the japanese herb, but hey- i'm sure Ben knows! We had Uni, unlike any other uni ever. The orange goodness was literally overflowing from the crisp seaweed (excellent seaweed!!), and I think I was actually drooling WHILE I was eating. we didn't talk much. there was just a lot of mmmmm, and oooohhhh, and whhhhhaaaaa. The fried shrimp heads were DELICIOUS! not too oily, or heavy, and it came with also shrimp heads in soup. Be careful, those little suckers will stick in your teeth all night! The bill came out to be about 98 a person. We had 9-10 orders (can't remember, food coma-ing at the time), and I walked out, knowing that I will never go back to anything less. Kazu-san, thank you so much for taking care of us. We weren't hungry, but you somehow made us into hungry hungry hippos with your magic. Will I be coming back soon? ppshhh. yeah! Note: come before 6 pm, to beat the traffic and wait. If you do come after, please don't BITCH and COMPLAIN and give the poor host an attitude. Really grinds my gears. (for all your family guy lovers). We love you ben! but we still blame you for our waistline...

Short Review: As far as I know... Food: 100% (clean and large portions for price) Drinks: 100% (as far as I know) Service: 100% (kind service people and they operate quickly) Parking: 80% (toll. stamp needed to get out for cheap-er) Wait: 70% (if you choose to sit at table that and considering the toll) Price: 80% (some items are absurdly expensive) My father introduced me to this awesome restaurant on a random weekday. From what I can remember, the guy who helped me made it seem like lunch specials are where they get a lot of business. My dad and I chose to sit at a table because he wanted to introduce me to their lunch special plates. What we got: $15 plate of lunch special sashimi 營'm not sure what different kinds of fish were on there, but I can say they were all raw and looked extremely delicious and tasted that way. 燱e ordered water, which was fresh and was constantly refilled. 燱e were visited frequently enough about how we were doing, so we never had to call them over. 燩arking was a bit difficult to manage with a truck, but we got it to work. Also, we got our entrance card stamped. The toll can vary, so never pull out and show them a lot of money. The wait... that was the most annoying part. We waited outside against the wall for at least 30 minutes. Don't get me wrong, the place was pretty much packed because everybody wanted to sit down at the tables. Sushi bar only serves sushi (kitchen vs sushi bar), so there were frequently seats available. Only sushi items at the sushi bar. The menu is small, but you can customize some things for your personal preference. Oh, and of course, they give an awesome bowl of miso soup. Careful, it's hot.

If there's ever a time to live by the words 'Early Bird'....think Sushi-Gen! This tiny little hole-in-the-wall (isn't most in Little Tokyo tiny already?) is a GIANT when it comes to Sashimi. One of my friends raved about this place up and down for years, but for some reason or another we never made the time it would take to make it to the door fast enough. Whenever this place was mentioned it was usually followed by a 'But we have to get there at the crack of dawn!'....for lunch.... Well...the time came. We finally made it early enough. I was able to lose some sleep one morning with the mission of getting to this place early enough. But why so early? and what time is early enough? The suggestion of the locals, according to my pal, was anytime before 11am.... I know 11am doesn't seem like early, right?, but when it comes to Sushi-Gen, 11am is too late. The line starts forming about 10:30. If you get in line at 11am, then expect to get lunch about 12:30, if you're lucky! What is so special about 11am in line for LUNCH, you ask? well. plenty....They have this hidden gem of a lunch that will have you camping out the next time you decide to go for sashimi here. Talk about bang for your buck! the lunch of choice for most everyone before the noon hour is the same reason you go there early. The Sashimi Lunch special. You know this one is popular when even before the door swings open, you see all the trays of sashimi waiting to take flight to each table. The serving is the most sashimi I would ever imagine for as little as $15. (see the pic). They serve you at least 5 different types of sashimi, accompanied by a tofu/miso, and a cabbage/cucumber side bite. Did I mention $$$$15. Good luck finding something comparable to this! Since my first time in this place I am prepared to set up at least 2 alarms and leave my house early enough to avoid that line (see the other pic). All for the satisfaction of diving into that sashimi medley. the Sashimi Lunch is only offered Monday - Friday. Plenty of Parking in the strip mall. (Make sure you validate for a discount) *try not to park in front of the restaurant as some late-arriving 燾ustomers find it ok, as they wait outside, to sit on your car hood. Can be annoying. Just remember the 11am rule and you'll be in for a treat!

I'm sure this place does not need another review. 燘ut here it is... As far as sushi goes, you're not getting the best of the best. 燘UT you are getting great sushi at an amazing price-- their $15 lunch specials are amazing. Of course the sashimi combo is great, but we also had the himachi collar (?) amazingly buttery and mmmm. 燨f course you have to have some chopstick skills to eat the meat around the collar and fish head. 燳ou can practice your chopsticks skills here.

Sushi-Gen has been on my list to try for the longest time. I first heard of Sushi-Gen from my roommate, Kaylie D.. I came here for lunch just before noon on a weekday and already saw a line out the door. Wow, they looked like serious sushi eaters! Luckily, I didn't have to wait, since I chose to sit at the bar. The bar has a nice, unique set up. It was almost like an open kitchen. There were a lot of fresh, beautiful flowers (Peruvian Lilies) around the room, even in the bathroom. That was definitely a nice touch, especially since I love Peruvian Lilies. There were a lot of sushi chefs for a lunch time crowd. I really liked how all the sushi chef are all fun and interactive with each other and the patrons. The waitress gave me a menu, but I ended up not using it. At sushi restaurants, I typically order a negihama, negitoro, and any other recommendations from the sushi chef. I noticed the other patrons at the sushi bar knew what was good, so I asked them for recommendations. The other dishes I ended up ordering was the sweet shrimp with the deep fried head on the side, Muzuku with Nagaimo (an appetizer that consisted of seaweed and taro), Snapper, and Spanish Mackerel. I was really impressed with the sushi. The sushi was so good that I didn't need to dip it in soy sauce or ponzu sauce. It was really fresh, the sushi rice was perfect, and the presentation of the sushi was just like a beautiful art. Exquisite. I was more than satisfied and my tummy resonated with me. My total bill came out to be $53. A bit pricey, but definitely worth it. I would definitely come back - often!

i'm a little torn between this review but it's a good place just not what i was expecting but nonetheless i will give it's rightful rating of 4 stars out of 5 FIRST what this place is NOT this isn't an american style sushi place...MEANING there are no typical rolls we have come to love such as (CRUNCH ROLL, DYNAMITE ETC) THIS IS TRADITIONAL SUSHI meaning simple tradition sushi rolls (literally around 5?) which were california roll, spicy tuna roll, tuna roll etc the menu is VERY LIMITED BUT this place is DEFINITELY FRESH...there's no denying it! the raw fish literally melts in your mouth! i swear it's like they're fishing back there and cutting it up for us! my boyfriend who's not into the whole raw fish thing (he cant stand the texture) actually enjoyed it 爃ere. DO NOT order the rolls...the price aren't on the paper (i'm assuming it's based on market value) but they're TINY 6 pieces and not worth it! we order like 3 and it was 30 bucks for just those! I HIGHLY SUGGEST you order the combo places or the bentos or whatever i forgot what it's called...well worth it...same price but way more food i got the sashimi combo (I WAS IN SASHIMI HEAVIN! will post pic later...it came with a side of tempura (yummy as well) big bowl of rice, miso soup and two side vinegar dishes...it was GOOD! boyfriend got the typical beef teriyaki...portion was big..he liked it out bill was around $90 or $115 after tip it was my birthday so i ened up yacking it all out =( due to friends forcing me to drink insane amounts of alchy =( overall go if you want good sashimi DONT go if ur looking for rolls...there arent' any really

I knew I had stumbled onto something good when I saw the crowd waiting outside Sushi-Gen. 燣ike previously mentioned, make reservations or expect to wait! 營 noticed a good percentage of people were ordering the sashimi dinner, so I ordered it also and it did not disappoint! �After, my boyfriend and I walked to Mikawaya, the home of ice cream mochi. 燢now the ice cream mochi they sell at Trader Joes? 燭his is where it originated and was first sold in America. 營n addition to the standard flavors of ice cream mochi they mass produce, they have gelato mochi in flavors like peach, mint chip, cookies and cream, pistachio and coconut, to name a few.

why hands down? HANDS UP! This place serves the best sushi, out of all the sushi served restaurants that I've been to. The place is small, but gets really packed really fast. Even with reservations you will probably need to wait a bit. I ordered their chirashi which was about 18-22 bucks from what I remembered. *thumbs up-hands up!* tuna everywhere! theres no site of salmon which I wished they had in the chirashi because salmon is my favorite. But omg they had unagi in this, and it was mother freaking good. I mean what on earth have I been eating this whole time? This is where it's at! Salmon sashimi, *thumbs up-hands up!!!* It tasted like the salmon just swimmed out of fresh water, de-skinned itself, de-boned itself, sliced itself, and jumped into my mouth. I don't care how dramatic I sound. I'm paying for the fish, so I can say whatever I want. The best salmon I've had. If you plan on visiting, be ready to drop some $$$ because these people aint playing. banzai

I have been going to this place for over 10 years and have found their sashimi to be of consistent quality. �They have the best sashimi lunch deal in town. You can tell by the long lunch lines that extend up to a 30 minute wait outside. I don't mind the wait because the raw fish is melt in your mouth. In terms of their sushi, it is above average, but can get pricey. Be aware that this is a traditional Japanese restaurant., so don't expect rolls or fancy setting. I wouldn't recommend straying too far from their Sashimi Combo, as everything else is slightly above average and far more expensive. Don't even bother with dinner, because lunch is where its at. If you are looking for high end sushi go to Beverly Hills. The Sashimi Combo used to cost around 11 dollars in the early 2000's, which made this large plate of assorted sashimi and a bowl of melt-in-your-mouth rice a crazy deal. If there is one thing that has been decreasing in quality, it has been the bowl of rice...its melt in your mouth quality has decreased over the years. Not sure why that is... In recent years, they have raised the price of the combo a few dollars, but it still remains the best value in town, beating out many high end locations for sashimi offerings. Just know that the sashimi assortment consists of cheaper cuts and fish, but they are perhaps the best of those cheaper fish, which is better than average high end fish...if that makes sense. They gots the ocean in their backyard! Sushi Gen is situated in the middle of Little Tokyo amongst a strip mall with parking provided. It is near Frances a good cake place in the same strip mall. Go there!

Let me start off my saying I've been going to this place since it opened. 燗lways liked it and even referred all of my friends, and had many dates at this place as a first date (girls, we know how important the first date pick is and I actually did like this place for a first date) 燘ut today, I was not only disappointed but offended. We ordered the things we normally do, sashimi, mozuku, some sake. 燭he Ebi taste like crap but ok, we ate it hoping it wouldn't be so bad. 燭he yellowtail belly, giant clam and salmon sashimi came. 營t was cut like crap and tasted like ass, so of course, we told our waitress we can't eat this. 燬he looked at it like, yeah, I see what you mean. 燬o she took it back to the kitchen. 燭hen we see her talking to the front guy person who I assume is the manager. 燤inutes later, we were going to order the yellowtail collar. 燬he walks away to put in the order but then comes back and says if you order it, you can't send it back. 營'm like wtf? �Apparently, my guest had been there before and had sent it back for being too burnt to eat. 燭he manager remembered I supposed and told the waitress to tell us we can't send anything back anymore. 燬o we fingered for the manger to come over. 燞e was like, and i'm quoting, "I'm sorry, we are not accepting anymore complaints". 燤y guest was like "What?, not accepting complaints?, we've been here for so many years, always liked it, but if something is bad, you can't force us to eat it? 燛specially at the price we are paying." 燞e said, "you are the only ones who ever complain." 燭hat's when I jumped in and said, "I know that's not true. 燗 restaurant should know how to handle complaints better." 燞e was like "then maybe you shouldn't come here anymore". 燱TF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As customers, in this economy, restaurants should know better than to piss off paying customers. 燗nd for the prices this god forsaken place charges, we should always have the right to send things back if the food is bad. 營 understand there are the types that complain about everything, but we've been here since it opened and have been loyal customers, we expect a standard for what we pay for and shouldn't be forced to eat that is terrible, let alone pay for it. 燭o quote Alan J. from a couple days earlier, today's Sushi Gen is over-rated, and yes, today, the fish totally tasted like it was frozen and defrosted....don't even go for lunch. 營f you go, you will need to accept that you can't send anything back, if its burnt, taste like ass or is terrible, better be willing to eat it/pay for it. If you've been offended or told the same thing by any restaurants, specifically Sushi Gen, you need to voice you're opinion. 燭here are many other restaurants in the area who know their manners and how to treat their customers, and more deserving of our business. 燬ushi gen does not and I will be damned if I, or any of my friends should ever come here again. I recommend Komasa or Hama Sushi. 燭hey have equal quality food and at better prices. 營ts a little bit more dive-y than sushi gen but at least they know their manners. 燭hat's a big win for me!

Favorites: - tamagoyaki: sweet, skillfully rolled egg, unpredictably tasty. - unagi: crispy edges (perhaps, a little overly), but still so good. - tuna: fresh, goes down easy. - hamachi: fresh and good. Only thing about the nigiri is there's a little too much wasabi between fish and rice-- takes away from the sushi taste and experience. Busy, busy all the time. Prepare to wait or make reservations.

Just exceptional quality. The albacore sashimi was the best I've had. The salmon, tuna, and the toro were also amazing. It's definitely a little pricey but when you get quality like that, I don't mind paying. Well worth it.

Great place. Food is definitely tasty and the constant lines of people waiting for the sashimi lunch special definitely proves it. Don't be an idiot like me though. I ordered the Unagi rice + sashimi comb (comes with pickle salad, tofu cubes,and miso soup). Definitely not worth it compared to the sashimi lunch special. (Sashimi lunch is the huge plate filled with sashimi while if you get a combo + sashimi, the sashimi is only like 7 pieces).

Sushi Gen is pretty bomb when it comes to fresh sushi. 營t's best to sit at the bar and order as you go. 燭he fish are fresh and delicious! �Among my favorites were the uni and monk fish liver. It's really hard to find good sushi places that serve up a nice cut of monk fish liver and fresh uni that's not brownish green in certain parts. 燭he basic toro, yellowtail, red snapper are amazing as well. Make reservations if you can or prepare to wait for an hour or so.

The first time I ever had Sake with shiso (Japanese mint leaf) and seaweed was here @ Sushi-Gen in the late 90s. �To me: salmon is a somewhat smelly fish, the shiso is strong enough to cover the fishy smell but yet not strong like the American or what we get here @ the American market, and the thin piece of seaweed is sweet you can't even tell it's seaweed. 營t is a great way to have raw salmon or the first time you ever want to try Sake sushi. 燨nce you try this combination, you probably won't want to eat Sake sushi without the shiso and seaweed. 營 had requested this combination @ other sushi bar or Japanese restaurant and no one can beat Sushi Gen on this!!

Drove 2 hours and 52 minutes from San Diego; parked 0.46 miles away; waited an additional 26 minutes outside to finally experience some sushi that everyone and their mothers say is the best that they have ever had. I am not doubting their experience, but since it was a borderline 4.4 to 4.5 star range, this place definitely warrants another visit and another review in the near future. Although this place provided some very good sushi, I could not rate it high enough to make the 5-star range (4.5-5.0). The sushi alone was definitely in the 5-star range, but combine that with ambiance, and experience, it came down to a high 4-star range...4.4 stars. During my 26 minute wait...I noticed a few posted rules that some may overlook and lots have broken. They're posted at the check-in stand. One was, no cell phone use. Oh well, they didn't really enforce it. Also, all parties must be present to be seated, and finally no outside food and drink. I came alone, so my 26 minute wait period was pretty fast compared to everyone else's, but I normally eat at the sushi bar anyway. Sorry, no reservations taken at the bar, you'll just have to wait it out. That's where you will get the best sushi experience....period. But, there will be times where sitting out at the bar area may be shocking to the keen observer. Lucky for me, I got the old sushi chef. I figured, this guy has to be a master chef, that he has been around for decades just doing what he did best....the art of sushi preparation. And although his sushi preparation was superb, his handling of the sushi meat was unacceptable. He would throw back the excess sushi meat back in the cooler regardless of where it originally came from...ie throw back the excess tuna on top of the halibut sushi and obviously causing possible cross-contamination. Yah yah....I know I'm just being paranoid, but that you probably won't get contamination, but think about it....why did Dr. Egon Spengler say "Don't cross the streams." �And on a side note, his Engrish wasn't the best. One of the sushi he recommended later, I just could not figure out what the heck he was saying...sounded like Giant Cramps. And I'm thinking, why would you recommend Giant Cramps too me. Didn't want to cause a scene, so I said yah yah, give me some Giant Cramps. Finally got home, and googled it, and he actually said Giant Clams. Whewww...case solved. Besides the sushi-mixing ordeal, he would throw back excess sushi and let it touch the window glass portion. Big deal again right??? Well, if you have ever stuck around until closing, you would see these guys use Windex to clean the windows...something to think about if you see them throw back the sushi and it just lingers on the glass for awhile. But again, the average person doesn't see this nor they care because it is so fast that they just overlook this or just too busy talking with your party. Anyhoo, on with the sushi. Again, sitting at the bar will allow you to see the master at his best, so you should order the best. Here is what I had on this particular Friday night. All nigiri pieces. Sopporo - 22 oz...enough said. Tuna - nice, dark red vibrant piece of meat. As good as it gets. Salmon - bright orange piece of meat, sooo fresh, sooo good. Yellow Tail - nice piece of slightly pink colored meat, very shiny too...glistens against the lighting. Chutoro - wow...amazing. I asked for Otoro, but they ran out, so they gave me the second best, Chutoro instead. One of the better Toro pieces I have eaten ever. It will literally melt in your mouth. Savor this piece slowly people. I wasn't sure how much this meat is, but I can tell you, it is somewhat expensive. But definitely a very very good piece of meat. Snapper - very well prepared, shiny creamed colored piece of meat. Spanish Mackerel - basically all the colors of the rainbow on this meat, with chopped green onions. Halibut - nicely cut, parallel along the striations of the meat with chopped green onions and soy. Kampachi - nice cut farmed yellow tail. Look real close to see the veins...coolness. Giant Clam - first time trying this, chewy, shiny piece of meat. It's a different taste. Tamago - nice, cold sweet omelette, perfect way to end this evening. Ten different meats tonight...20 pieces total!! Suhweeet!!!! Sushi-Gen is one of the better sushi I have been in. It also makes my cut to as close as Japanese as it gets. They serve the sushi in wooden plates, and to me, this enhances the flavor. You can taste the difference, so when they place it on your plate, just let it sit there for a minute or two to get the best flavor. I have a super high standard on sushi, and this place comes as good as it gets. Definitely worth the wait and definitely worth coming back. 燚efinitely worth another updated review in the near future.

I have to say that I have been to Sasabune and Sushi Zo. 營 was not expecting this to be better but the quality was on par. 營 think the difference between this place and the others is that not only is the sushi good but the other food, the Japanese tapas and food, are great. 燭hose were the ones that really reminded me of Japan. 燭he egg custard, the salmon skin salad, the miso soup with clams all reminded me of Japan. 營t was a great feeling. 營 actually didn't think the uni was great. 燬ushi Zo definitely has the best Uni I've had in the US. 燭his place can get pricey if you don't notice what you're ordering but it's totally worth it! 燙an't wait to go back.

Best sashimi I've ever had - nice cuts and very flavorful. I ordered the sashimi combo here and it came with miso soup, sashimi, rice, and tempura. The sashimi was excellent and the tempura was also delicious. As an appetizer, we ordered an sushi sampler plate that came with different types of sushi and some cucumber, yellowtail & green onion, and tuna rolls. Although the food here is quite pricey, it is definitely worth it! Definitely make reservations because it was very crowded for dinner, even on a weeknight.

Yes the lunch deal has got to be the best deal in town. Maybe even the state. And they are PACKED so everyone knows it. Get the sashimi, their shari isn't their strength. 燗nd the fact that they declined the latimes feature (which is supposedly one of the handful of times that a rest. declined) makes me adore them more. Btw, the dinner is a good deal too. This is a good relationship builder date. It's like the watered down urban version of the suspension bridge effect. Waiting and agonizing and chatting and then the thrill of shared victory at snagging good grub at an insanely good price. And if you're lucky the cake store next door will be open. Yummmmmm. Oh and don't be a douche and go w/ a big group. It slows down the turnover and the space isn't big enough either.

Ok.. So i came here after reading all the amazing reviews about it and heres what i thought.. Sushi was very fresh. Service was great too. We ordered the sashimi special or whatever it was called, and there was plenty for how much it cost. Also had a small order of the tempura. MY favorite thing here by far was the spicy tuna. I seriously cant have spicy tuna anywhere else..Sushi Gen hands down has everyone beat. Only negative experience was the wait. I know its a popular spot and I should have made reservations. We got there around 730 and was told it would be a 30-45 minute wait for 2 people. It ended up being an hour and 45 minutes. The restaurant is extremely small for how busy it is. The food was really good but i dont think ti was worth the hour and 45 minute wait. There are plenty of other sushi restaurants in the area. I probably wont come here again on a weekend because of the wait. However if i'm ever in the area mid week or something.. this will definitely be the place to go.

Been here twice now in the last week, and it is worth every penny! First time I was here and sat at the bar for some omakase, and the second time I had nigiri at the table. I have to say that going omakase is definitely the way to go at sushi gen. Customers have to remember that the whole point of a sushi bar is so that there is an interaction between the chef and the diner. Like a guest, the customer is treated to an enjoyable evening while the chef prepares the fish as he sees fit. Compared with my experience in Japan however, sushi-gen is still not the best. Some of the fish were lacking in flavor, and the order of the fish is problematic at times. The tamago was boring and stiff, and the yellowtail belly was slice thin. However, hats off to the unagi and the amaebi, which were quite good. The amaebi was firm and vibrant in flavor - sweet but not overwhelming, tender but chewable. I think the amaebi that I had a la carte was only $6, and it came with two soups with the heads. Amazing deal. Will definitely visit again to try the lunch specials, but I think i'll be tempted by the omakase again. Overall a good experience.

I LOVE THIS PLACE! It's right across from the office depot and parking is $2 w/ validation although the parking lot is really small. I love sashimi and this place knows how to prepare fresh, tasty sashimi! The best part about it? The $15 lunch platter. It comes with an assortment of sashimi (mostly tuna), miso soup, rice, pickled cucumbers, and this delicious boiled tofu thing. 燛xpect to be stuffed by the end of your meal! the best $15 you'll ever spend on lunch. I've also had the sashimi deluxe on a different occasion and it was so delicious. This comes with an assortment of all sorts of fish and luckily the day we went it had the fatty tuna - soo good! If I remember correctly it was big enough to split between two people and its either $35 or $45. The only con I can think of for this place is that sometimes there's a long wait - but it really depends on the day. Other times I've been seated as soon as I walked in. Also, if you're expecting good rolls, this is not your place! It's more of a traditional japanese restaurant so don't expect any of those crazy rolls you see at the more contemporary restaurants.

Great sushi place, probably one of the best moderately priced sushi houses in LA. I came here for my birthday dinner with a group of friends and once we got over the wait for a slow moving dinner group that wouldn't clear their table, dinner was on! We proceeded to start off with drinks that included a couple bottles of Sayuri unfiltered sweet sake and then ordered a round of various appetizers and sushi/sashimi combos. Among the appetizers my favorites included the monkfish liver w/ ponzu and salmon skin salad, although the whitefish w/ ponzu sauce was notable as well. There were at least 1 sushi set and 2 sashimi sets that basically went around to everyone at the table. As mentioned before, compared to more upscale sushi places like Sasabune, K-zo, Matsuhisa, there is less flair in the presentation and style, but then again, you don't have to pay for that extra premium either. Fish cuts were delicious and fresh while presented very straightfoward and traditional. 燗ll the enjoyment without the frills and frippery. Sushi-Gen is quite popular and even tho we had a reservation, because 1 or 2 in the party were running late, we still had to wait a while for our table. 營f you plan on going and not sit at the bar, definitely call ahead of time. 燗lthough not as small as my other Little Tokyo favorite, Hama Sushi, this place will fill up fast on a busy night.

Mediocre, boring, safe, over rated, middle of the road, overpriced, lackluster, and so average it hurts. These are some words I would use to describe Sushi Gen. Don't get me wrong, nothing was that bad, but nothing was "WOW" good. And since the bill was so high, I left feeling cheated. The atmosphere reminded me of Sushi Sasabune, trendy, factory like, and lacking a soul. To start, the ankimo was not very dense or creamy, and the portion size was the smallest of any sushi place I've been to; http://www.yelp.com/biz_�To make matters worse, they didn't carry half the sushi we requested. The chef would always reply to us, "Try some tuna or salmon!" NO! I want good fish! I won't go into detail of every piece I ate (see business pics for that) but not a single piece was great, just okay. I guess since Gen is downtown, people will continue to flock here, not knowing that they need to drive 20 miles south to get truly great sushi. Oh well, that leaves more for me.

So apparently, God lives in Little Tokyo. I know what you are thinking..."What the hell are you talking about Libby R.? 營f God does, in fact, exist, he must live somewhere more grand and more snazzy than a little, unpretentious sushi bar in Downtown LA." Well, you'd be wrong. Because last Tuesday, at about 5:30pm, when I rolled into Honda Plaza and parked at the lot for a measly $2.50 I met the big guy and his newest apostle - my sushi chef Masa. My pilgrimage was started with my girl Amanda L. 燗fter returning from her own enlightenment last week, she loudly proclaimed, "Libby, I found a new sushi place and, I'm telling you, it will change your life." And man, was she right. Amanda and I walked in without having to wait the normal 20 minutes to be seated at the bar with my homeboy Masa. 燱e asked about the chef's choice and how much it would set us back. 燤asa let us know it was up to us as we'd let him know when to stop. �My first bite was the salmon. 燬alty, meaty and fresh as the breeze from a top Mt. Sineai...and, good Lord, I saw the light. I can't say for sure how many pieces of sushi Amanda and I shared....after all religious experiences are hard to define. 燱hat I can tell you is that I walked away, soul touched and tummy full for $60 bucks (my half including tip). �Now I realize my testimony may not be enough to convert you. 燭hat you may be a nonbeliever in this intangible experience that is hard to describe.

What a let down. 402 reviews and 4.5 stars for this place? Way over hyped. �Came here last night and was surprised to see so many people standing outside waiting for their tables. You may think that's a good sign, but in my head, there was a loud "warning" siren blasting off. In my LA Sushi experiences, the "crowded" "popular" places never turned out to be decent. It's always the one that's small, hidden, not so crowded that offers great Sushi. And my initial thought was confirmed right away. Sushi rice Way too warm. The contrast between warm rice and cold fish was much greater than what could possibly be a harmonized fusion. It was especially bad with extra cold Uni on top. Also, the rice wasn't squeezed firmly enough, so it was quite a challenge to not make rice fall apart when I picked it up. Selections/Line-ups It was just like any other mediocre LA Sushi joints. Meaning, very "standard" and nothing special. Several of my requests were turned down with "oh we don't have that" and I was very sad. It wasn't like I asked for something so unique and so unusual. In fact, any of those would have been offered at several of the good Sushi joints in South Bay. The chef didn't even talk about what they had that's in season or what they had that's the freshest of the day. 燗ll he kept recommending was salmon, tuna, albacore, giant clam, halibut... you know, the "usual." Oh god, can you be more boring than that? For a moment they made me happy when they said they had sardines, but it instantly became a disappointment as their sardine was vinegared. And it wasn't the good vinegared version, but it was "the fish got old so I tossed it in vinegar for a while" version. No delicate nice flavoring what so ever. Garnish Garnish is one of the important contribution to the Sushi. You can't just put Wasabi, ginger, Momiji Oroshi (grated Daikon and red pepper), or green onion on top of the fish and be done with it. The combination as well as amount has to be right for it to be good. Their garnishing was nothing but sloppy and not only it didn't help their sushi tastes better, but in fact, it made it worse. For example, we had oysters on the shells. Each oyster was quite small, which was fine as the size and flavor differ depending on where it was produced. 燱hat was appalling to me was that they came with ton of Momiji Oroshi and chopped green onions on top. Oysters, especially smaller oysters, are known for their very creamy flavor and soft texture. Ton of Momiji Oroshi first killed off the flavor of nice mild creamy flavor, then the rough and hard stems of green onions just completely killed the beauty of the soft and smooth oyster texture. If the chef really cared about each ingredient's character and quality, he would have never chosen to put ton of Momiji Oroshi and chopped green onions. Chives would have gone much better as they are smaller and got less texture than green onions. Shame. At this point, I was pretty disappointed with what they had to offer, and the bill made it even worse. Long wait, ok service, boring selections, and poor cooking for the steep price.

I gotta hand it to them...they have awesome sushi. Fresh, party in your mouth sushi. Uni, halibut, octopus, toro, mirugai, yellowtail, kanpachi were all delicious. 5 stars for the sushi only. The salmon skin salad and fried chicken were pretty good. The tempura and oyster shooters were mediocre. The service was pretty slow. This place needs to work on giving a better estimated wait time. I actually called to make reservations and the employee told me he didn't have anything available until 9pm but to come in and just get on the waiting list because it wasn't going to be very busy. So naive little Caroline did. I get there and the host tells me it's going to be about 30 to 40 minutes. Not bad I thought...that is...until it really wasn't 30 to 40 minutes. It was an hour and a half~!! Argh. Hungry and cranky. And it was my birthday. :( No one apologized for the long wait nor did they thank us for waiting so long. I think the problem was that the employees were seating their "regular" customers before the actual people on the waiting list. Uh huh. The sushi was good but not an hour and thirty minutes wait good. Maybe the secret is to become a "regular." Not. Oh and remember...I HATE waiting. Hate it.

Hands down, my favorite Japanese restaurant in California-- but only for lunch. 燚inner there is pretty much the same thing as lunch (plus a couple extra sides), but twice as expensive. 燳eah, no. 燣unch is the way to go. I always tell my friends that the only things I miss about L.A. are Sushi Gen, tacos and really good Corean food. 燨kay, there are other things, like the warm weather, the red velvet cake at Doughboys and the mochi boutique in Little Tokyo, but Sushi Gen's one of the big ones. Here are a couple tips (besides taking advantage of the great lunch menu prices) for dining at Sushi Gen: 1. 燝o 20-30 minutes before they open for lunch and wait in line. 燨therwise, you'll be waiting 45 minutes (or more) to get a seat. 營've waited almost an hour there before. 營 admit, I was insane for sashimi that day. 2. 燩lease don't order the teriyaki. 燬ushi Gen is known for their raw stuff. 燗nd they really deliver. 營ncredibly fresh (they get frequent deliveries throughout the week) and well-cut (the sushi chefs are trained well). 3. 燙heck out either their Sashimi Lunch Special (not the deluxe, it's pricier for no reason) and their Chirashi Deluxe Lunch Special (the deluxe in this case does matter) Oh, for all you uni lovers, Sushi Gen will occasionally have their Uni Lunch Special. 燩eople tell me it's fantastic.

I wish the sushi chefs here were friendlier because the food here is so fresh and tasty. The salmon melts in your mouth and the sashimi is sliced thick just how I like it. But I'm telling you, these sushi chefs were a real buzz kill. They refused to smile and would bark at you if asked them what they would recommend. It was really uncomfortable. I'm used to chefs that say hello and give a shit about your dining experience. They actually want to show off their fish and drink beer with you. Now that's my kind of place. I suggest you sit a table where you can order a more variety of food and your experience won't be tainted by the grouches behind the bar. You can't dispute that the food is excellent here. It's just not cosy and welcoming. Hence, no 5 stars for you Sushi Gen. The way you treat your customers is equally important as the food you give them.

We finally came here after months of postponement due to my snowboarding season. Virginia, Shauna and me opted to seat at Sushi bar because that's how Omakase supposed to be. Just as Shauna's review, I was prepared to spend about $85 tops for this Omakase, but I guess we're heavy eaters, the fishes here were great, pretty fresh and generous portion. We were lucky that we only needed to wait for 20minutes before we got seated at the bar. Every order of sushi came in 2 pieces. Unlike the other omakase places that I had been, they usually came with just a piece each. Our order started with: - Seaweed with Radish foamy soup that almost didn't taste like seaweed at all, it's refreshing, it's like jelly dessert, a bit too sweet, but I liked it. (just found the name: Muzuku with Nagaimo) - Toro: this is where I said, "if we started with this, all these fishes coming up next, better be as good", because you can't go wrong with Toro unless it's not fresh. Theirs was pretty big portion and yet it still melted in your mouth, so delicious. - Yellowtail Belly: this fish was sliced thinly and still delicious, but couldn't beat Toro for sure. - Ama Ebi: this was alright, I'm not a fond of ama ebi and just like Shauna, when they offered to fry the heads, it actually tasted better than the sushi itself. - Albacore: this was pretty good too, I liked this a lot, the sauce was very different here. - Baby squid: to be honest, this was the dish that made me watched our sushi chef making it as it was so different, I've never seen it before. The sauce was a bit sour and it actually blend pretty well with the squid and sprinkled with a little sesame. They tasted pretty good. - Spanish Mackerel: this was Shauna's favorite, I liked the slices that they did to the fish, made it less oily and it's really fresh. - Giant clam: a bit chewy, yet I still liked it, different texture than the rest of the sushi we had eaten so far. - Unagi: I'm not usually a big fan of eel, but this unagi was delicious, the sauce wasn't as sweet as any other places, so I actually dig this sushi here. - Oyster: the only non-sushi or handroll that we got. Not really a big fan of it since the portion ws so small, I liked the oyster at Sasabune better. - Toro handroll: still good, but not as perfect as the Toro sushi we got on the first round. This was a good thing to end too, I wish I ordered Toro sushi just like Shauna to end it, then it would be perfection. The service was great up till the 3rd or 4th sushi, because after that the plates didn't get picked up as often as before and sometimes my iced green tea didn't get filled up as fast either, not that the restaurant wasn't any crowded earlier. The fact that the waiter spilled some water behind our seats and didn't say sorry was a downgrade too, but obviously I couldn't go lower than 4 stars. Our sushi chef, Masa, was so nice to us as well and listened to our every order, eventho sometimes a bit confusing, he would repeat to us the order to make sure he got it right. It's hard to satisfy me, let alone knowing that at least I'd be spending $75, the food better be great and it really was and our bill came up to $110 (tips and tax included) and since it's their 30th anniversary, each group was given a special cup to bring home as a gift. Would I come back? I certainly would, but not anytime soon, cause spending over $50 for dinner usually was too steep for me and this time I spent twice, but somehow I felt fulfilled and satisfied, so I just have to earn the money and then I'll be BACK!

Sushi Gen is kinda like the "office hottie" that everyone talks about: 燳ou hear a lot of things around the watercooler & only half of them are actually true but most of it is urban legend rooted in something someone said long ago... and kept alive by the same people that forward "email petitions" & "medical warning emails" around the office. A DOWNTOWN BUSINESS LUNCH HOTSPOT Sushi Gen, as it is today, is pretty good. 營t's blown up ridiculously since its inception but it's still a good restaurant. 營t has the added benefit of being easy to get to from downtown & having plentiful parking. 燬ushi Gen got absurdly popular after being repeatedly listed in the LA Times & the LA Weekly as being one of Los Angeles top sushi restaurants. �It's also listed as one of SushiMasters "Top 10 Restaurants in California" so LA locals know about it & the rest of the America has seen it listed on Zagat LA & we all know that Zagat is where restaurants go to become generically mass market so that pretty much means that anyone passing through town that can flip through a 3 1/2x8" book trounces through Gen's doors. BEST FOR BUSINESS LUNCHES? To its credit, Sushi Gen operates somewhat like a Tokyo kitchen - very efficiently & quickly. 燬ome believe their sushi to be the "best in Los Angeles" based on discussions I've had with folks there. 營 don't think it comes EVEN CLOSE to that but it's certainly better than joints like Beverly Hill's Nishimura or La Cienega's Koi at half the price. 燬ure, it's in the upper third tier of sushi restaurants for certain; � if you need a business meeting restaurant, this is probably a good choice being that: 1) It's got reasonably good sushi & authentic Japanese dishes (i.e. no bulgogi or kimchee here) 2) It's got a variety of dishes that'll please the Japanese foodie as well as the "I don't eat raw fish" types 3) They "put the hold" on the sushi nazi routine for noobs making it friendly for high maintenance types that usually bitch about 'not enjoying the experience' or 'rude service' 4) It's on the higher end of the price scale but you won't care since you'll be able to expense the meal as business WHAT'S GOOD? For starters, the wasabi is real fresh grated wasabi root, and miraculously they serve high quality Maeda-En tea, instead of stock Yamamotoyama. The good news is that because they churn out so much fish across EIGHT sushi chefs, they generally always serve fresh fish. 營n other words, there's very little chance of you being served something that's been in the refrigerator longer than a day or two. �And when you know that the fish is going to be fresh, it's best to side with the dishes that are hard to screw up when fresh. 燜or example, the Ikura/Salmon Roe is quite good. 燗dditionally, Yellowtail, Albacore, & Salmon are all generally always good, (since most of the crowd orders a ton of it) & again, consistent in bulk. 燱hat is served on Monday will be the way it is Friday with completely new, fresh fish. 燗sk for Toyo-san - the older chef in the middle. �WHAT'S BAD? Sushi Gen is akin to a conveyor belt production line which is good for speed of service but ultimately weak for quality. 燩reparation is often sloppy: 燭he rice is occasionally dry, the fish cut is very consistently mediocre unless you sit at the bar, knife strokes sometimes seems to be almost with the grain, I've had fish w/ a small bone in it, etc. 燗ll you really have to do is visit during lunch to discover how often the 'ball' gets dropped. Also - something to know is that while their fish may be very fresh, it's usually of arbitrary quality. 燝enerally the chefs themselves go to select the fish but I really have to wonder when it comes to Gen. 燗nd this is a point that seems to be lost on a lot of reviewers - FRESH fish does not equate to GOOD fish. 營 think they serve so much sushi that they virtually become indiscriminant about the fish they select to serve. 營t's probably because of all the "business lunch" traffic they get, who they figure can't tell the difference anyway. �Apparently very few Yelpers seem to be able to as well, judging by the reviews. 營 would not '5-Star' this place.) For example, one of their 'specialties' is Otoro & Chutoro... & most of the time it's laden with tsuji. �fibers) 營 shouldn't need to chew my sushi to this degree. 營 order this for customers I bring but it's always the weakest parts of any meal here. 燗lso Sushi Gen serves very poor Uni. 營t's usually firm, bright, & well textured... but ultimately bitter/tasteless instead of being sweet. CONCLUSION: I'll have lunch here & I'll take my customers because it's convenient & they serve a broad range of dishes. 燭he sushi's not bad & the atmosphere is electric. 燘ut when I'm on my own time or I'm aiming for quality, I go elsewhere. 燜or those looking for alternatives, Sushi Go 55 & Komasa downtown are more meticulous about what they serve. 燨r Hiko on the Westside. 3 1/2-stars.

Sushi-Gen served delicious, fresh sashimi. My friend and I shared the $35 Deluxe Combination, which included an assortment of chef choice sashimi. There was maguro, sake, tako, ebi, tamago, ika, and even, toro! Of course, my favorite fish was the toro. Everything was good, from the taste of the fish to the presentation thereof, and even the service. I always had a full cup of tea and water. Cheers to sashimi and sake! 5 stars it is.

There is almost no better place than Sushi Gen. Period. That was the only thing I had in mind when I was heading to LA.... Sushi Gen engraved in my mind like an obsession. 營 NEED. I WANT. I DESIRE. We were in the sushi bar chatting with the friendly Japanese chef, who managed to impress us by saying simple greetings in French, German, and Mandarin. 燬kip the menu, Omakase is the chef's choice, and you can't go wrong with it. 燱e were delighted by the super fresh hamachi belly, medium Toro, and other amazingly authentic sushi. 燭he green tea ice-cream wasn't great (taste artificial) but they gladly changed it with red bean ice-cream for us. �I then passed out with sushi joy and satisfaction. 燭hank you Sushi Gen.

One of the best sushi places I had the pleasure in trying out.. With 900+ reviews, I'll keep it short. Pros: - THe fish is like BUTTER -Incredible quality in freshness of all their fish (toro, salmon, red snapper, yellow tail) Probably one of the best sushi places I've had in Cali.. -Awesome experience if you sit at the sushi bar (very knowledgable sushi knives men) -The entree dinners are excellent,, They have a unique teriyaki sauce -Good service Tips: -Large parties you will have to wait.. maybe quite a long time -Small parties 2-4 you will have to wait. SO get here early. -Sushi bar has a minium limit or 4 orders Very very good sushi. TWO THUMBS UP!!

Did you ever have a restaurant that you didn't want to share so it wouldn't become more popular so as you could still selfishly get in. 燭his is one of mine and it's rating of 5 out 5 is spot on for a sushi bar. 燬o enjoy my recommendation and don't bother going (just kidding). The bad thing about Sushi-Gen is that is so good that you won't appreciate other sushi bars. 燗s a matter of fact I stopped going to other places because other sushi just didn't taste good and it's a waste of sushi dollars. 燳ou'll understand if you go to here a few times. I've eaten at Matsuhisa, Hama Sushi, Sushi Roku, Asakuma, R23, and all those little joints in Little Tokyo plus numerous others. 燬ushi-Gen is still the real deal for me and anyone I've taken there. 燭he sushi will spoil you for good so be careful. I like to start off with Hamachi (Yellow Tail). 燭hought I knew hamachi, but �their hamachi is like creamy yummy. 營t's not only super fresh, but hand picked (they have a fish buyer in Japan). �Then I usually go for Tai (Japanese Snapper). 營t's a very mild tender white fish that they top with some salt and maybe yuzu (citrus). 燳ou don't dip this into soy sauce, just stick it in your mouth and you'll say 'ahhh... yum'. �Next, I go for Aji (Japanese fresh mackerel) which has a dollop of ginger, green onion, and ponzu sauce. 營t's a little more strong in flavor but a lot less than you'd imagine (mackerel). 營 don't ever order this anymore at other restaurants as it's too strong for me. 燳ou should try it if you never had it. 燗fter this I need to chill and maybe order a sushi scallop. 燭hey shuck it to order and slice it real thing with tiny lemon wedges in between. 燯sually they drop a little salt so you don't mess up the flavor with soy sauce. 燱ow! 爄t's good. Go for the albacore as it's prepared similar to the Tai. 燭ime for some fresh water eel (unagi) as theirs is really good. 燭hey must cook their own. 燦ow it's time to order new stuff like oysters, natto, etc. or re-order sushi items I want again. Don't bother with the meal deal if you really want to savior the quality sushi at Sushi Gen. 燬it at the bar as you'll get the best cuts (always do that).

OMG! The best authentic sushi bar that I have been to in LA! The moment when you walked in to the restaurant, you feel like you are in Japan. Friendly host welcomes you with smile. We sat down at the bar because if you go to an authentic sushi bar, you MUST sit down at the bar or you will lose the point of being there. The sushi chefs there are so friendly, they will ask you for the next order when you finish your sushi. You can chat with them and they are so nice too! The sushi? I have zero complain to their sushi including rolls that my friend had ordered. 燦ext time I would love to taste more rolls since I already experienced that their sushi was absolutely delicious!! I would love to go there soon. I just loved it. Who would like to go with me? (LOL!)

Sushi Gen is probably the best sushi value-wise in all of LA. I used to buy seafood at International Marine which is where most sushi chefs buy their fish. So I know fresh sushi when I see and taste it. Sushi Gen may not have the highest quality raw fish, but the quality is consistently strong at the price point. The reason is that every Asian worker in the downtown area usually hits this place up once a week. Hence, the turnover is really high. Raw fish is expensive. Most sushi places cannot afford to stay in business if they threw away fish that didn't sell that day. This leads to a situation where most sushi restaurants serve you raw fish that is essentially a few days old. Yuck! If you know how to order, then you can easily eat well for $40 a person. I think the Tuna is always very fresh. Here is what I usually get: Tuna 2 pcs Albacore 2 pcs Hamachi (ask for the belly! It is the same price, but way better) 4 pcs Ama Ebi 2 pcs Fluke fin 2 pcs. (ask for Yuzu Kosho or frsh lemon juice with salt) Salmon Belly 2 pcs. Spicy Tuna roll (they season with an unconventional chili sauce. They don't drown their tartare with Mayo.) If you are still hungry after that, then you need to eat less! I always sit at the bar because you can build a rapport with the sushi chefs. If they like you, they will hook you up. There is always a line out the door so arrive early. Sushi Gen wins my award for Best Priced Sushi.

When I lived up north, I was bitching constantly about the freshness of the fish. 燦ot as far north as Seattle (I would've rocked out here, this area is yummers for sushi lusters), but San Francisco/Bay Area north. 燜or some reason that never fails to perplex me, sushi in S.F., save the one and only Ino which my foodie friend whom I trust says is legit/pretty good, just does not measure up to New York, Los Angeles, and forget about being whispered in the same sentence as Vancouver and Japan. 燳es, I went to beloved Koo twice (meh) and Kiss Seafood (it's fine, but this place isn't a sushi bar). Now I am in L.A., land of fresh sashimi aplenty. 燜or as long as I can remember I have come to Sushi-Gen and I always leave content and full of the freshest cuts of toro, hamachi, and m i r u g a i. 燗t this point, the staff, including the all-important sushi chefs, know me as a regular. 燭he Friday before my S.F. trip a week ago, I came here and it was yet again a delight. 營 got off work late and it was pouring rain. 燜or some curious reason, rain, instead of making me want traditional comfort foods (something spicy, something hearty), makes me covet fresh sushi. 燢ind of counterintuitive, I know. 燱e sat at the bar, naturally, and Masa-san treated us to a wonderful (but quite, quite basic) omakase meal. My favorites this evening: Red Snapper - Lord, have mercy, this is fantastic. 營 love. 營t is white fish with a hint of translucence and it comes garnished with a little yuzu and sea salt. 燳ou are instructed to not dip into soy sauce. 燡ust listen and insert into mouth. 營f you're like me, you'll just smile like an idiot. 燤ORE. Mirugai - Anyone who knows me knows how much I love these suckers. 燱hen Masa-san asked at the end if there was anything else we wanted, without hesitation, I peeped, "Mirugai?" 燞e picked out the best cuts and just spoiled me terrific. 燙hewy with that wonderful clean-tasting finish I adore, the two pieces made me want to serenade "Hero." Toro - Perfect, melt-in-your-mouth disappearance. Hamachi - Sushi-Gen's yellowtail is always incredible. 營t is just superbly smooth with this too tasty finish that just hints at creamy. Hirame - Beautifully done, this falls apart with the greatest ease in the mouth. 燣ightness of fish with warmth from the seared edges and just a touch of yuzu and sea salt. Salmon - I am not even the biggest fan of sake nigiri, but Sushi-Gen's is this slippery baby that does not have that oily taste I shun. 營t has a silky butteriness that isn't too rich. These are what I remember very well from that rainy Friday dinner. 燬o happy, I skipped into the night. 燞ow I love how fresh-tasting, clean fish matches that nip of crisp, brisk, and clean after a day of showers.

Sushi Gen - The Review by Toshiro D. Well well well. You are reading this because you want to know the truth about this wonderful little spot called Sushi Gen. Let's review stage by stage to be fair to the whole establishment, so that certain aspects which are good don't suffer under those that are not so good. 1. Food: Los Angelians are quite obviously starved for quality food in all sectors. Why is that? Hollywood and California by its very nature places form over function, exterior over interior, so things usually look pretty and once you've been married for two weeks, the truth emerges. Well, food, business partners, Hollywood agents, fancy used cars, all have this in common in La La Land. As Californians were some of the first risk takers to attempt to eat raw fish on rice, they also still believe that they can get decent sushi in their restaurants, or that they even know what decent sushi is. They can't. They don't. Sushi Gen is one of those few spots that pulls ever so slightly above the basic absolutely rubberific quality of most sushi joints, that everyone raves about it. They also rave because like that most disgusting hot dog joint pinks, lots of people like to line up for it. Call it the Studio 54 syndrome. Followers bring followers. And so lots of people run here. Moreover, as Korean culture has seemingly displaced Japanese in town, this place functions as an anomaly as many Koreans like to eat here and yet, there are a few Japanese chefs and servers around (probably because at one point this was a Japanese run restaurant). Also, the Chinese seem to like the place too. One thing I did notice and this is always a tell tale sign - there were no Japanese people around. Hmmmmm. Oh wait, sorry, there were some Japanese looking people. But they were clearly born here the way they garbled their "sumi-masen" in that showy "I speak Japanese- Valley girl" sort of way. Well, that said, the food is good. It is nice. It is better than ok. It is not worth though the likely 100 bucks it will cost per head to eat what would amount to a 17-25 dollar meal at the best sushi restaurant in Vancouver. Vancouver - where they catch the fish and walk it over to you, kill it and serve. Yes. Really. WTF??? Oh, but let's leave that to the price area. So bottom line, I like their food. But I don't love their food. The red snapper was tiny. The salmon was good and the uni (sea urchin) was the one thing that really stood out. But not for the price. Not at all. Verdict on food - if you have never had good raw fish on rice prepared by Japanese chefs, try this place after you have first tried Matsuhisa and in Little Tokyo, the more reasonably priced and better tasting Mako Sushi and Hama Sushi. 2. Sushi Chefs - They are polite, attentive, friendly, engaging and yes, actually Japanese. They seem to know their stuff. I was impressed but clearly, they have been dulled down and let down by the environment that they are in. You can clearly see the frustration on their faces when they suggest something in answer to a customer query and the response is "um like, do you have spicy tuna rolls". Yes. No Japanese culinary education going on here and that obviously sours the mood. Go down the street to KokeKokko and ask that question. The answer may be Sepukku. Anyway, I give them 5 stars on their chefs. 3. Servers - Rude, arrogant, obnoxious Yep. Several experiences. All the same. They are not Japanese. And the attitude reminds me of my experiences living in Hong Kong. When I asked about the cost of the bill which was incomprehensible, the waitress took so much glee in trying to humiliate me by loudly running through the price of each item while I, in a low voice, kept saying that it was fine, no prob, ok, stop, please, stop. Yah. What is this about? Well, it sort of works in a chinese or korean spot where you expect the abrupt, rude, funtime experience. But in a restaurant where you just spent 500 bucks for 2 people and want to kill yourself, no, not really acceptable at all. So, 0/5 for their staff. And this is based on multiple experiences. The hosts are better. But actually, if they don't watch and manage their staff, they suck too. And believe me California people, Asians know when they are being rude. It is not part of the culture. Especially not when you are paying. You get treated this way because you encourage it. It's the Rodeo Drive, spit on me, sort of mentality. The more spit, the better it is. Price - Hahahahahahahaha! Like lol times 1000. They have to be kidding. Honestly. Like 10-15 bucks for a piece of uni. Let's all go away, catch some sea urchin and choppy choppy. The prices are bloody insane and totally out of whack with reality. I like how no amounts are listed on the sushi menu. It's all a big "face" scam. Read Noble House and learn about "face" sometime. Ok, so that's the review. It's the truth. Go elsewhere. Go to Mako Sushi.

Good salmon, rolls, and terriyaki. Always seems crowded, even late at night near closing hour but the service is quick and the servers are friendly and attentive. Definitely will come back to try the sashimi !

Finally tried this place after the hype machine kicked it into high gear and I gotta say: Not so much. Perhaps it is my self-proclaimed sushi snob status, but the 5 star reviews are a bit questionable. As Jenny pointed out in her review when we walked in it smelled quite fishy. Usually that is my cue to turn it around and bail, but seeing as how the reviews were so high, we thought we'd stay and try it. The red snapper was good, although it was served with the skin on, which 爄s never a fave of mine :( The halibut was good The yellowtail was very good Spicy Tuna, I'm never really a fan of, but in spite of that, I thought it was okay. The ankimo was a true dissapointment. I order this everywhere I go as I feel it speaks volumes about the place, but this was nothing to write home about. Super fishy and bad texture. If you want THE best ankimo with the tastiest of ponzus, try Sushi Ike in Hollywood. They truly set the bar. The lighting in this place also took away from the ambience I felt. It felt like last call in a bar, too bright and not appetizing. The beer and sake, sure, hard to go wrong with this. Overall, I think it's more like a 3 and a half, but I'll be kind and rate 4. Not horrible, but nothing standout enough to crave.

Delicious sushi joint in Little Tokyo! I used to come here with my dad and line up by the door at 11 so that when they opened at 11:15, we'd have a seat and wouldn't have to wait in the long line that followed. I think the lines aren't AS crazy as before because of the recession, because the last time I came, there were a few empty tables when the doors opened, and that used to be unheard of! People had to share tables before. But that was a few months ago, so maybe it's back to what it was. Anyway, the fish here is super fresh and delicious. And they have a sashimi lunch combo for $15, which is totally a snag! And it's more than enough to fill you. Parking is $1.50, I think. Try it! :) Oh and afterwards, walk across the street and get mochi for dessert!

My God - how does this place have such high ratings??? Service is slow, the packaged napkin they give you at the beginning to wash your hands is grey... like it's been used 1 too many times, the food i wayyyy over-priced for what you get - why am I am paying $24 for chewy beef teriyaki? Why is my friend paying $24 for burnt salmon teriyaki? The ONLY thing I could say about this place is the beer is moderately priced and that the sushi does taste fresh, but not so fresh that it blows your socks off. People, I know there's a fine balance between 爌rice vs quality vs quantity but don't believe the hype - especially you manly men like me... avoid this place and check out tons of other places that meet that balance in an affordable tasty manner.

"A-OK". Coming here I was expecting spectacular sushi. Sashimi dinner combo: (Sashimi plate, tempura, miso soup, rice) -I was ordering the regular sashimi plate but the server sold me on ordering the combo. For $5 more I got tempura, rice and soup (wish I stayed without the combo, it was mroe than enough) -Sashimi plate was bountiful, but too much tuna and no salmon sashimi -I personally never liked squid sashimi maybe that's what made me iffy -Had a "grilled" piece of salmon on it but it was dry and very salty Sushi deluxe: -Was an ok amount -It had ikura (salmon roe sushi) which wasn't bad -Don't expect california rolls here, they'd rather keep it legit and top the box off with simple tuna rolls and cucumber rolls -bf ate most of this order but it seemed good :) Giant clam special: (Grilled giant clam pieces wedged between mushroom slices atop lemon slices in a filded foil tray) -Did not like this -Lacked the sweetness of mirugai -Taste combination was wrong -A waste of mirugai -Should have known they'd use the parts at the "body" of the clam that weren't used to make sushi/sashimi (the somewhat mushy part?) but it should have still been sweet Notes: -Good for nigiri and sashimi -Not your "special roll" kinda joint -Sushi menu does not have prices listed -May seem pricey but portions are adequate -Packed by the time we left at around 8:00pm on a MONDAY NIGHT! -Didn't like the tiny two seater tables, had to manuver our dishes Verdict: -Good portions for the price -Will be back in the future but not rushing

I joined Virginia D and Jenny B for omakase at Sushi-Gen last night. I've always wanted to check it out and I'm a fiend for sushi. From reviews I read, omakase seemed to be around $50-$60. I guess those people didn't eat as much as we did as we spent $110 each (this included tax and tip). Our sushi master, Masa, started us with a seaweed soup. Or maybe it was a salad. I first started eating it with chopsticks but it was slippery we had to slurp it to finish it. It was light and slightly tart with a pretty white foam on top. Our first fish was toro. Now, when you start with toro, can it get any better than this? No, which is why I asked for more toro as my final pieces. We also had: yellowtail belly- great, not as deliciously fatty as toro amaebi- the sweet shrimp were great and we had the heads fried. I actually almost liked the heads better. albacore- I've never been a huge fan of albacore but Sushi-Gen's changed my mind. It just melted. baby squid- I think all of us squealed and went on and on about how pretty they were. I hadn't had it as sushi before and I loved this. Spanish mackerel- This is my favorite of the mackerel family and this fish was so fresh and though "oily" like a good mackerel is, wasn't "old-tasting" like some places serve it. Giant clam- Masa said it was giant clam (mirugai) which I asked was the same as geoduck. Of course it was. I actually liked it better at Sushi-Gen than when I had it in Seattle and geoduck is from the Pacific Northwest! Unagi- Not over-broiled and sauce wasn't too sweet. I wonder if they made their own eel sauce? At this point, we were slowing down. I went for a full order of kampachi (amberjack) while Virginia and I split salmon. Both were good. We also got oysters, one each. For this, I've had better oysters. Or rather, how it was topped. I didn't even try it with the provided sauce. although not the best oyster, I didn't mind having it. Virginia wanted a crab handroll which I also split with her. I thought it was okay. I rather have more sushi. Jenny and Virginia split a toro handroll which looked amazing but I just wanted more toro! The only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is the service wasn't great. Our waitress actually spilled iced green tea behind me and splashed my ankles. She looked at me but didn't apologize. Then it took them a long time to even give us little plates. I was bringing down the plate where Masa was putting the nigiri until the little plates were brought out, about 3 things in. Eventually we were given sushi with its own special sauces on separate plates. These plates weren't cleared immediately either and they started piling up. My OCD was suffering. The busser was better than our waitress though. The kitchen took a while to get us our fried shrimp heads out. And for all the money we spent, I was surprised we weren't offered at least miso soup or a dessert on the house. This is a litany of complaints which seems a bit petty but the reality was, I had a really good time with the fish. The little things wouldn't have bothered me as much if it didn't keep happening. I would definitely come back again though! I'm still dreaming of that toro!

I came here last thursday, because my (native Japanese) date said they had the most authentic sushi in Los Angeles, with ingredients shipped from Japan. Being ethnic-Chinese and American-born-and-raised, I can't really identify authentic Japanese.. But, I can tell if it's good quality sushi/sashimi. and WOW! sushi-gen was FANTASTIC! We sat at the bar and sampled our way through various fish. I had toro for the first time.. and whoa, melty butter goodness from fish! I totally loved every single thing we ordered, except for this weird flat fish my date wanted because it's very rare and expensive in japan (it was kind of sinewy? I didn't like the texture, but it tasted fine). The hamachi (one of my favorites) was guh. Too bad I didn't quite make it through every thing I wanted to try (monkfish liver, ono, ikura, giant clam, scallops), but there's always next time! The prices were great too, considering all the (usually expensive) high-quality fish we ordered. We came in a little under $100, and while not a steal, it's reasonable and definitely worth what we ate. We also didn't have to wait at all to be seated. There was space at the bar, the minute we walked in. The rest of the restaurant was filled and there were people waiting outside for tables. The best sushi I've had in LA. Maybe the best in my life.

THIS IS MY FAVORITE SUSHI RESTAURANT! (Better than Sushi Go 55, Sushi Zo, Sushi Sasabune (in which Sasabune shouldn't even be included on my favorite sushi list.) I came here when I was an intern in college and had NO idea what to order and was embarrassed to order too much food or too expensive fish in front of my mentor. My friend then took me again for a birthday dinner and there was no way I was going to limit myself. A few tips: 1. Get there at 5pm so you don't have to wait in line. About 20 minutes in, there were people waiting outside the door. 2. Request the omakase. The chef prepares whatever sushi he feels like and you can ask to split it between you and your party so you can try different types of sashimi. 3. My favorite: EVERYTHING. I LOVED LOVED LOVED EVERYTHING. I hated all these other sashimi at other restaurants but I loved each one! My favorites were the ones where you didn't need to use soysauce at all! I ate about 8 courses = 16 pieces of fish that day. AGH. SO GOOD. I'm definitely going to try to be a regular here. We also got a free tea cup because they're celebrating their 30th anniversary. Or 50th? Don't remember...

How is this rated higher than K-Zo? Sorry, but 2.5 stars. After hearing so many people rave about Sushi Gen, I came in and sat at the bar (default for me!). It was nice seeing that most of the chefs and clientele are japanese and very friendly. My date and I ordered a-la-carte. For about 16 nigiri orders, our bill came out to about $180 w/ one tiny cold sake, which I thought was pretty steep!! I still feel that Hide is a much better price for fresher and bigger fish. �*hokkaido: our favorite. topped w/ sea salt. we got 2 orders �*aji: very disappointing. it was very stringy/chewy �*uni: decent, but not the freshest. and a little lukewarm for my taste �*ikura: i always eat ikura with uni. this was good and fresh �*saba: good, but i've had lots better �*mirugai: a little soft. i usually like my mirugai crisp �*albacore: very soft/mushy �*hamachi: also very soft/mushi �*toro: meh. it didn't have the marbled texture it usually does. it definitely melted in your mouth, but not in the succulent way �*kanpachi: very good! chef recommended �*tai: not so memorable �*amaebi: decent. came with fried shrimp heads �*salmon: bleh �*anago: i thought this would be raw, but it was seared. pretty tasty �*kani handroll: they didn't have blue crab, so we ordered kani. it was pretty bland. I was really full after this meal, but not in that super-excited, super-satisfied way that I feel after a meal at Echigo, Hide, Sushi Zo, or Mori. And I felt the prices were steep for what we got. Also, the rice was inconsistent! One piece would be tokyo-style (warm) and the other pieces cold. So strange! I probably won't be back.

This was my second time at Sushi Gen. 營 always think it's important to go 2x before rating a sushi joint. 燨ne of things I'm looking for is consistency. 燭he first time I thought it was way over-rated (2 stars). 燭he 2nd time I liked it (4 stars). 燗nd so... I'm giving it 3 stars. 營 would go 3.5, but Yelp doesn't allow those half stars. 燬o 3 it is. Both times I've been here the place has been packed. 燬o be sure to make a reservation before you go. �The pros: 1- Very friendly host and attentive sushi chefs (I sat at the sushi bar both times). 燛ven though they won't take sushi bar reservations, they will try to seat you at the bar if you request it nicely - and both times they did this for us. 營 was very pleased. 2- 燬ome sushi pieces were absolutely off the hook * Tai (snapper) and live Hotate (scallop) were scrumptious. * The Anago (sea water eel) was as good as it gets. * The Hamachi (yellowtail) and Unagi (fresh water Eel) were very good. * The saba (Mackerel) was nice. The cons: 1- Some of the pieces weren't as good as I hoped for although none were fishy whatsoever - just not as good as the rest: * The Chu-Toro (medium fatty tuna) was OK, but a little too fatty. * The Aji (spanish mackerel) was too firm. 2- They don't have an extensive sake menu, just a few average sake's. 3- $80 pp for dinner was a bit much. 燛specially since we only shared one large Sapporo and one small bottle of sake. All in all - I'd go back here. 燘ut it is far from me (I live in Culver City) so I'd need a reason to head downtown. 燘ut if you live in the area, it's def worth checking out, especially if you sit at the sushi bar.

Although I didn't want to revisit this place after my last review, my GF was in her "sushi" mood and since traffic to the westside looked horrible, I decided to give this place a go. Instead of trying omakase again, we decided to order every single nigiri item on the menu and a side of Ika/Natto. Although they were busy, the sushi came out promptly. 燤ost of the items tasted fresh, the presentation and creativity pales in comparison to Sasabune, Sushi Masu or K-Zo. 燘UT our entire meal for two not including the alcohol came out to $130 so in that aspect, they get an extra star On a side note, their natto is bland, fried chicken is good and they serve a mean yellowtail collar.

When I see that a place has 4.5 stars after 548 reviews, I often ask myself, why bother writing a review? What can I say that hasn't already been said by one of the 548 other people, who almost universally love it? Literally, hundreds of people have commented on how fresh the fish is. Scores of people recommend omakase, dozens of people have already covered the "I'm not from LA but Sushi-Gen is always on my list of places to go" angle. I can't deal with trying to figure out a unique angle, so let me just say this: Sushi Gen fucking rules. There, nobody's said that yet.

Sushi Gen is my favorite sushi place hands down. 營 just don't like the horribly long wait that you inevitably have to endure. 燭here is pretty much zero chance you would ever walk in and sit right down. 燛ven 5 minutes prior to closing there are usually still a couple of parties waiting to be seated. �I always get the Sashimi Deluxe (giant platter of assorted sashimi), 爐una cut rolls, albacore, scallops, yellowtail and plum cut roll. 燙onsistently fresh quality cuts of fish!! 爃ttp://www.yelp.com/biz_�The MUST TRY item I would recommend is the Yellowtail & Scallion handroll or cut roll. 營t's a roll of buttery goodness with perfect sushi rice and quality nori. 燳ou'll be hooked once you try it. �) 爃ttp://www.yelp.com/biz_�They've also got pretty good salads like salmon skin, seafood, or crab. 營f you're in the mood for a steaming bowl of rice in light broth, they offer 4 or 5 kinds of Ochazuke. 燗 complete dinner for 2 is usually around $130. 營t's worth every penny because the fish and the rice is unmatched anywhere else. �Make sure your whole party is there - this is one of those places that won't seat you without everyone present. 燩arking is $1.50 for lunch and $2.50 for dinner.

The best sushi in LA! If you're all about Rainbow rolls and Philadelphia rolls, take that kid stuff somewhere else. These Japanese chefs will serve you some real sushi and sashimi. You know how sometimes fish is all stringy and chewy? Not here. Premium stuff baby. And because it's so fresh, it's a great place to try new things. Did I mention the portions are huge? When I come with my mom and sister, we have the chef cut the sushi in half for them. If you wanna go, give me call! Tips: Located in the Honda Plaza, across the Office Depot in J-Town. Private parking is $2.50 validated. Come early or be prepared to wait outside. Sushi bar is faster, but you pay a little extra for the service.

I personally think this place is really great. 燭he sashimi here is pretty unbeatable in terms of freshness, taste, and quality. 燭hey've gotten rather expensive (sad to say) but I still like to come here for really good sashimi. If you're looking for rolls, Sushi Gen isn't really the place to come for rolls packed with a billion things, i.e. Americanized. 營t's all about pure, tasty sashimi with rice (i.e. chirashi deluxe, or sashimi deluxe, YUMMMY). My only complaint is the wait, but I suppose with any highly coveted restaurant in LA, the wait will always be impossibly long...

Sushi-Gen's fish factor is amazing. 營 love their yellowtail and they do have extremely fresh fish however, something is missing. In all my visits I've always left feeling sort of empty. Anyone can do fresh fish - if you have the money and the knowledge or even the right sources. 燘ut 爓here's the heart? The passion? Maybe it's the fact that there's always a line and the wait can be extremely painful. 燭hen once you're inside the noise level is pretty crazy and then the staff is rushing all over the floor. 營f you're dining at the sushi bar you get minimal attention from the chef because he's frantically filling orders for the tables. 燗t some point you start to feel like its all mechanical and they're just hastening to get a product on the plates for the hungry mouths. Overall, the service is poor and rushed. I suppose I'm not used to that and I'm not willing to endure the lines or the crowds for that price not when there are so many others that do it right.

One thing that I didn't do, but I really should have done was to sit at the counter. 燭his place is known to have a very long wait, so when we saw that a table was available, our hungry stomach went right for it... later regretted, but was too late... When you go to a sushi restaurant and you expect good quality sushi. 燬it at the counter. 燭rust me, it makes a huge difference when it comes to quality. Anyway, counter or no counter, this place could be a little overrated. 營t's a little pricey for the quality. 燭he way they cut the fish, texture and temperature of the sushi rice and the amount of vinegar in the rice was just not up to par. 燭he fish quality however was not so bad. I ordered the sushi platter and the bf ordered the sashimi platter and for appetizer we ordered ankimo... I don't know what it is in English since im so FOB lol...but it was pretty good.

The WINNER and undisputed Champion of the Sushi world in LA in "my price range or a little above it!" 營 have heard rumors of another as good or better in the nether reaches of the bastion known as BH! ~~ I visited here during my Interior Design class phase. 燨ne of our Instructors - John F. took his students out once a quarter, on HIS treat! 燞e was a pretty cool guy, Japanese national and pretty progressive, He forced us to use his first name in class! 燦o Mr's, No Sirs, No F-san... 營t was plain "John." 燘ut, I digress... This was early in my sushi/sashimi gestation, so I can't really account for much since this was years ago, and it was the ONLY fat cat in town. 營f you knew anyone that was a true Connoisseur of sushi/sashimi, they came here. 營f they were in LA from Japan and wanted sushi, they came here or to one other place... It's been some time since then, I have not made the trek back, yet... I want to come here after, now eating and enjoying sushi/sashimi in Japan, China, and locally. 營 want to "come home again." 營 want to see how the world revolves... 燱ill I get "MY satisfaction?" Yes, the wait is "EPIC." 燘ut, I believe that, that's part of mystique, the allure of the place! 燭he crowds that surround the entrance, the tiny parking lot... 營t's ALL, a part of the greater whole! 燭hat is, Sushi-Gen... The truth be told, I want this place to live up to it's name and time honored reputation... Time will tell... 營 am coming soon! 燱ait for me! Sushi-Gen! 營 am coming home again!

I just ventured to this little haven a few days ago on a friday night with some friends. 燗lthough we were uber hungry, we didn't mind the wait because it was well worth it. We started off with the cold tofu which tasted like well, cold tofu. As an entree, I ordered the chicken teriyaki with sashimi (sashimi or tempura, I opted for the former for balance). 燭he chicken was absolutely delectable...or maybe I was just really hungry by then, either way it was fantastic. Nice and juicy on the inside with a hint of crispiness on the bottom, which I really enjoyed because it added more flavor on top of the teriyaki sauce. The dish also came with a side of salad and pureed mashed potatoes, which I enjoyed immensely as well. I left with a happily full stomach and quite sober....can't vouch for my other compadres though. ;)

Let the masses of yelp reviews speak: this place is awesome. 營 usually frequent affordable sushi restaurants so it is an absolute pleasure to splurge (courtesy of my beloved) and eat sushi on the higher end. This is the sushi restaurant of my childhood memories: drunk and friendly sushi chefs, traditonal decor, and a lack of crazy fushion rolls. The fish here is buttery. 營 had the scallop, fatty tuna, and yellowtail belly and the pieces were quite suculent. It was smooth as a stripper's rump, but like a lap dance this sushi restaurant is a little pricey for my small salary. I should probably stop writing because I'm starting to crave their products. Oh well I suppose this restaurant is to cherish rather to than to visit often, got to reserve my desire for those special days. Anyways, enough of my lament. I say come ye come all with fat wallets. This is J-town's reigning sushi house, the biggest shogun in the neigborhood. 燞mmm, now if this place had samurai fighting ninjas? 燨r a yakuza bath house? Too much kudos to count.

5 stars...BUT!!!! A big but!! 燳ou see, eating at Gen is all about which chef you sit in front of. 營 totally understand how people can be underwhelmed here. 燭here are probably 6-7 sushi chefs working at dinner time, and most of them will give you an above average sushi experience. 營've tried most of them and my experience has ranged from "wtf...this is supposed to be top notch sushi???" to "not too bad." But there is one chef that served me sushi that was the best in the city. 燭he best. 燭wice. 燞is name is Kazu-san, and he is stationed at the far end of the bar, furthest from the entrance. 燳ou can tell he's special cuz he's the only one that's always got a bunch of japanese people sitting around him. 燞e is the real deal. 營f you hand yourself over to him and let him serve you what he deems best, you will be blown away. 燱ith him, you will get the best sushi in L.A. (that's near blasphemy to me since I've always felt that Kazu sushi in studio city was the best...but I'm tellin you...). If you don't think Gen is all that (and I don't blame you...the other chefs are meh), go there again. 燭ell the hostess "I want Kazu-san. 燳es, I'll wait." 燭hen, sit and tell Kazu-san "omakase." 燗nd I dare you to tell me that its not the best sushi you've had.

Whatever you do, get reservations!! 燗nd, just swallow the parking because it could take forever to find something. This is a delightful experience in sushi with friends. 燱e ordered both on and off the menu. 燭he ultimate sashimi platter is a great deal at $35, considering that it can serve up to four people. 燭he prices were decent, the people were friendly, the fish was fresh, and they had a reasonable corkage fee.

If you don't want to wait in line and enjoy marveling at the work of each sushi chef's knife, request to sit at the bar. Trust me, you'll love it here. The bf and I always sit at the bar so we were delighted when they seated us right away, given that the line was 10 names long. The minimum order is 4 per person which is great because I can definitely eat my fill of sushi. Long story short, the sushi here is orgasmically good. It literally melts in your mouth and you can definitely taste quality here. We ordered salmon, yellow tail, halibut (omg this is to die for), tomago (just a tad sweet for my taste), toro sashimi, tuna sashimi, octopus sashimi, squid sushi, miso soup, and a large sake. Everything was superb and I can't wait to get my sushi on again! Tip: Order the miso soup, it's only $1 which is a STEAL for miso soup in J-town.

Wow this place already has 600+ reviews, so I guess I won't be telling you anything new. I got a recommendation to check out Sushi Gen as an authentic sushi joint. 營 took my mom to eat here. 燬he grew up in Japan so I trust her opinion on how authentic/good a Japanese place is. We went on a Monday around 11:30 am and the wait was going to be 1 hour. 營 say, put your name down and walk down Alameda to the shopping mall. 燬ince you will probably always be waiting to go in, definitely park in their lot because they will validate parking so the parking will be minimal (much better than the meters). We later found out that we could have been seated earlier if we wanted the bar. 燱e ended up sitting at the bar where there's a 4 sushi pieces minimum and no lunch specials are served there as well (which seemed popular). I thought the sushi was good and fresh. 燤y mom thought it was amaaaazzzing. 營 absolutely fell in love with our sushi chef. 燗n old Japanese man with a ton of personality and knew what he was doing. The host was not so nice and the other servers seemed frazzled. Next time I go, I will definitely order the scallop sashimi. 營 saw someone order it, and they are litterally cutting it out of the shell in front of you- amazing!

Very tasty and fresh fish (4 stars, but...) A good place to go if you want to impress your date with how little you care about the cost of love. Perhaps this is just a poor grad student gripe, but I would like to know how much I am paying for my food before I get the bill. The dearth of prices on the menu makes this impossible. Nevertheless, there seemed to be many authentic Japanese dishes not available at the typical California sushi restaurant. I especially enjoyed the cucumber and pickled plum in addition to the scallop sashimi. We also had some nice salmon sashimi, although for the price there is definitely better. The service was also very good, except that the host insisted on seating my date while I was in the bathroom after being told it would be a fifteen minute wait. Just a little awkward when you're looking around the restaurant like a fool hoping she didn't change her mind.

i could come here at least ONCE a MONTH! 燗ctually, I did...for 6 months last year. 營t's hard to go elsewhere when living walking-distance from Sushi Gen. 營t's not bc the distance is so appealing, but the quality and service is impeccable. �All my orders listed here are Nigiri (fish on rice). 營'll start off by ordering the Red Snapper with the yuzu (citrus-sour) paste, Halibut, and Albacore. 燗ll 3 are decorated with either a ponzu or yuzu sauce. 燭hen, I will pander my palate with Yellowtail and Salmon (it is consistently THE bomb here!--so soft, moist, and melts in your mouth). �If you like a little crunchy taste, highly encourage the Halibut Fin which is seasoned with Yuzu paste. 燭oro is always good. 燘elieve it or not but their Tuna is REALLY good, nothing to hype about, right? �But trust me, this is the ONLY place where I can addictively order Yellowtail, Salmon, and Tuna. �The sushi is SO tasty here that I won't even mix my wasabi into the soy sauce. 燬eriously, I'll drizzle a little soy sauce into my dish for the nigiri-s waiting to be titillated in sodium. 營n addition, I love the fact that my chef knows I appreciate a generous slab of wasabi, and he decisively tucks it under the fish-on-top-of-rice.

FISH QUALITY Yellowtail fresh, Mackerels were not. 燬almon is farmed. Uni in most restaurants (including Gen) is rather sad. FISH SIZE Pieces were cut large so it's good. PRICE I thought price for lunch was extremely cheap. PRICE TO SIZE RATIO: Extremely good. Good place if you want large portions of fish. Not top tier for freshness, though, but I can recommend it cause my bill was so damn cheap.

My friend found Sushi-Gen on Yelp and wanted to give it a try, and wow, was it delish! When we got there, people were waiting outside and I thought "oh crap, it's going to be a long wait"... however, we got lucky and got a seat at the bar within 10 mins! 燱oo! 燬core. 燭urns out sitting at the bar was probably one of the best things we could've done. We ended up seated next to this really nice couple - Shanna and Ted - and they just happened to be regulars! 燬o they really helped us out, as we had no idea what to order. 燭hree things they recommended � were yummy (and I have no idea if I'm spelling these correctly): �Thai" (japanese snapper) - SOOOOO Goooooood. 燱hite fish on top of rice, but they put this sauce that's lemmony and gingery and oh-so-good. �Toro-chu" - It's like regular toro, which is fatty tuna, but just, well, fattier. 爃aha. 燬o good too! 燬eriously melts in your mouth. 燦o joke. �Salt Water Eel" - not your typical "fresh" water eel-- I didn't know there was a difference. :P 燬o good! 燙ooked differently than fresh water eel. 燨rder one piece with the regular sweet sauce and get the other one with that gingery lemmony sauce that you get on the "Thai" -- SOOO GOOOOD! Everything else we ordered was delicious as well, and definitely did not disappoint. 燜ood is not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for- everything is so fresh. 營 recommend sitting at the sushi bar to get the full experience. 燭he chefs were awesome and service was pretty quick for the most part. Next time I want to try the soft shell crab and oysters - they looked yummy yum too!

My favorite sushi place !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've been to so many sushi places in L.A. trying to find someplace decent, that's closer to home (Santa Monica). But, none compare to the freshness of Sushi Gen, and so... I make the trek (sometimes an hour in traffic!) to downtown L.A. At the sushi bar: There are no menus with pictures and they don't offer you a paper menu (but u can ask for one) they just assume everyone there is a regular I guess. It's best if you know your sushi and are ready to order with the chef, when you sit down. NO sushi rolls! Just nigiri and a couple hand-rolls. Avg cost: $40-70 for lunch. In the Main dining Room: There are menus, sushi pictures, and waitresses. Here you can order hot meals like chicken teriyaki, grilled salmon, tempura/sushi combo plates etc... lunch sashimi/tempura combo special $15 If you go there for lunch, they close at 2PM sharp. I hate when I forget that, and I drive up to their big CLOSED sign. Ughhh...heart-breaking. Some months back, I was waiting for a spot at the sushi bar, and a famous sumo wrestler came in. He got THE ROYAL treatment there and customers said nice things (I'm guessing) in Japanese, as he walked to his table. Total respect. If sushi gen is good enough for him, it's.... �)

What more can be said? Look at the score and the amount of reviews. Sushi Gen is a phenomenal sushi joint. The Sashimi lunch special is an amazing bang for your buck. A plate piled with sashimi, a big bowl of rice, miso soup, tofu, and cabbage. So so good. Also, I'd like to second the opinion that this is a place for sushi on the authentic side, so don't expect all sorts of crazy sushi and wacky rolls. It's a simple menu which makes it a delightful change from the rest of LA. Look at the reviews people, Sushi Gen is not to be denied.

Came here for the first time for with a co-worker just yesterday (she swears by this restaurant). We got to Sushi-Gen around 12 and there were, I kid you not, 20 people waiting for a table. The entire restaurant was already PACKED. While waiting, we asked the host if there's ever a time that it's not so crowded. Unfortunately, he shook his head and told us that even at 11:15, when the restaurant opens, there's already a long line outside. Boo. The service is great and the food comes out very very fast. My friend ordered a spicy tuna cut roll and I had the sushi and tempura lunch special. The sushi was incredible...as in melt-in-your mouth incredible. The tempura was a tad on the greasy side, but still delicious. I loveee sweet potato tempura, and Sushi-Gen's was divine! I was really surprised by the portions! 5 or 6 pieces of tempura, 6 pieces of sashimi, rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables, and some tofu all for $15. Not bad at all! I'd come back here for lunch more often if it weren't for the atrocious wait.

I've heard for years that Sushi Gen is easily one of the top Sushi joints in Los Angeles. 營've tried no less than 5 times to have lunch/dinner, but the wait was always intolerable so I always fell back on neighboring substitutes. I was finally able to try it out. 營 didn't have a whole lot of time, so I ordered the Chirashi so I could get a quick sampling of their fish. �Overall, it was quite good. 燛very piece of fish was fresh and was satisfactory. 營n retrospect, I guess a Chirashi isn't going to be the best sampling of fresh fish as it would be typically all the strange "leftover" cuts that aren't nice enough to put into an order of Sashimi or Sushi.

Sushi Gen is probably one of the most traditional Japanese sushi places I have been to in Little Tokyo/LA. They basically serve only what is fresh that day and do not mask the nigiri with to much unnecessary flavor. If you sit at the sushi bar they expect you to know what you are doing. Eating here reminds me of eating sushi in Japan. If you are not an experience sushi eater than don't sit at the bar... and if you do, please don't be that guy!

I would rate Sushi-Gen below Kiriko and Yoshida (regular sushi restaurants). Good, but it's not on my short list of great sushi restaurants. FYI: NO ROLLS except for the Spicy Tuna/Salmon roll! Maybe I would have found it a better value if I spent $35 on a dinner combo and sat at a table, but for me, a sushi dinner requires sitting at the bar and eating only from the specials menu or omakase. Pros: Fast service at the sushi bar (big staff), fresh (except for the salmon), cheap lunch specials (not cheap otherwise), friendly chefs. The chef made an effort to dress up my nigiri with onions, ponzu, sea salt, and etc. I appreciate that, especially since it wasn't an omakase dinner. Cons: Long wait, nonexistent wait staff, a little pricey for what it is.

Came here with a group of 4 people and had a reservation but still waited about 20 minutes to get seated at a table. I was expecting fantastic things from all the amazing reviews that was given here and was also fully expecting it to be quite pricey since it is supposed to be an authentic sushi place that serves raw fish only. The menu was quite authentic and I would also not bag on the waitresses either as they knew what we were into; however, the portions were surprisingly small and their cooked food menu was very limited to a few things not like many of these types of restaurants that had fried / cooked / grilled fish collars. I wasn't extremely impressed by the quality and taste of the fish and it was definitely pricey in the end. I just felt like for a sushi place of this caliber their selection was not impressive and what they had was fresh but not mind blowingly delicious. After getting out of the $2.50 parking with some usage of feminine features from my friend and I, I don't know that I'd come back again with so many smaller, less expensive and more homely feel sushi places in Little Tokyo.

Be prepared to wait, b/c there is always a line here; lunch or dinner, weekday or weekend. Parking can also be a pain. I suggest parking at the JVP parking structure across the street. One of my favorite restaurants in Little Tokyo. They have fresh quality fish. And it's consistent! Always fresh. They serve traditional Japanese food, which are all fresh, mostly healthy, and light. Pretty good value as well. If you sit at the sushi bar, you can only order sushi/sashimi, unless you are VIP (I've seen people order hot food!

Sushi Gen is undoubtedly the best sushi restaurant in J-Town. Not only because of the unbeatable sashimi lunch special, but mainly because of the extremely high quality of the fish itself. Since the customer volume is so high everyday, the inventory goes out quickly so new fish comes in daily. �Furthermore, the restaurant itself is very traditional, like something out of Japan. The owner is the head chef at the bar, having been passionately dedicated to the art of sushi making and customer satisfaction for nearly 20 years. Seriously, he has some of the most exotic and advanced sushi for the connoisseurs. The main attraction here is the sashimi. For $12.50 lunch, you get 4 appetizers, green tea, and a sashimi plate of over 20 pieces of fish. That's right. Sometimes even TORO comes in the sashimi, as the dish is a mix between raw fish, cooked fish, and seaweed. So it has a very varied and balanced taste. Find another restaurant that can beat it. Note: don't come here expecting Rainbow rolls, Caterpillar Rolls and all that garbage (which isn't even sushi). As mentioned, the fish is the main attraction here, so sashimi and nigiri sushi are what attracts the real sushi customers and all the Asian customer base. Highly recommended. The wait can be 45 minutes sometimes so come early.

The sashimi is always FRESH and the place is an actual authentic Japanese sushi restaurant. This place is the best in Little Tokyo if you are not into americanized sushi rolls. In fact, I don't think this place has rolls here. Anyways my advice is: Eat sashimi here! The menu is pretty short in variety compared to its neighbors, like Tenno Sushi, but the place is absolutely delicious and the focus is on their fish. This is a real sushi joint and you can tell from the menu and its selection. The only bad thing is that lots of people love this place so this places tends to have a line before it opens for lunch or during peak hours.

Well...believe me...I have turned many a non-believer into Sushi Gen lovers~ 燜or the price you actually get a decent amount of food (yes I clear my platter to the point of only leaving the garnish of lettuce...but I am always w/o fail full to the point of bursting...but it's a good kind of full, I guarantee you =D) For $15 you get miso soup, steamed tofu, sunomono, rice, and a 9"x6" platter of sashimi that usually includes the following: 3 slices of tuna 3 slices of yellowtail 3 slices of white fish 1 slice of squid 2 slices of a konyaku (at least that's what I think it is... 0.o) 1 piece of grilled salmon 1 mound of cubed tuna 1 mound of chopped tuna w/scallions (like spicy tuna w/o the spicy...although sometimes you get two mounds of cubed tuna) 1 mound of a marinated tuna that tastes similar to Chinese "fun yu" (anyone know the proper name?) 1 mound of spicy tuna (the best spicy tuna I've ever had. very little mayo, but a whole lotta flavaaa!) ...and lots of seaweed! (I like to put it in my miso soup to warm it up a little~ After tax & tip, the $15 meal comes out to about $20 -- Now that I know I can bypass the wait for my sashimi fix I'm probably going to get mercury poisoning and go broke at the same time...

I am really disappointed with this place for the sushi bar section. 燱ay overpriced, next time I am going to the sit down restaurant style instead of the bar. I will have to update this review at a later date, but I do not suggest the sushi bar. Go for table seating, since you cannot order from the reg menu at the sushi bar.

Sushi Gen (the "Gen" part is pronounced with a "hard g" as is "gun) is my very favorite sushi place in all of Southern California. When I want sushi, I could care less about sleek, trendy surroundings and techno-crap music, and I don't need a place with all kinds of pseudo-sushi inventions (DUI roll, Screaming Orgasm hand roll, etc.). I want fresh, authentic sushi prepared by guys with whom I have a serious language barrier. During the "go-go" business climate of the early 1990's, Sushi Gen was chock full of visiting Japanese businessmen just about every evening. Those guys knew a little something about real sushi, and this is the place they'd walk down to from the New Otani Hotel. And it's not like they didn't have a slew of other choices in Little Tokyo. Well, it's no longer the 1990's and the wave of visiting Japanese businessmen has subsided, but Sushi Gen remains a top-tier sushi restaurant where authenticity trumps meaningless westside flash and trash. The hamachi (yellowtail) is the best. Period. The stuff is so delicate and dissolves on the tongue. The uni (sea urchin) with quail egg is perfectly cold and moist--terrific stuff. The Spanish mackerel is also a standout. This is still the one sushi place I go to when I'm prepared to pay up for my addiction, and I never regret the experience. There are a handful of other places closer to my hometown that can quiet my sushi cravings, but Sushi Gen is always a monster slam dunk!

Not like this place doesn't have enough 5 stars reviews. I'll tried it twice before writing this review so I know it is a consistent experience. The fish both times were fresh and delicious. We only do sushi so we had tuna, salmon, yellowtail, yellow tail belly, blue fin tuna, and sometimes albacore. 燛verything was yummy. My favorite is the yellowtail belly. Please try it. I like the waitress with high pitch voice, for some reason that really added authenticity to my experience. She was very nice and quick about refilling drinks. I had no problem getting a seat at bar. Great experience. Will try to come back for more if I am in the area.

Came here for an early dinner on a week day, my friend said it was the first time he didnt have to wait so that was nice. My friend got the sashimi plate and I got the teriyaki salmon with the sashimi side. One word: FRESH! the fish tasted so fresh, pretty much melted in my mouth. The teriyaki salmon was also very good. I am definitely coming back again! my only gripe was they didnt give you any ginger with the fish -_-

My dad recommended this place to me when I wanted to get some sushi in Little Tokyo. I ended paying a lot of money. Over $80 for three people at the sushi bar, we all got hot tea, and a complimentary calendar at the end, but damn. It was worth it though. Our sushi chef was cool and hooked us up with his recommendations of the day. The Japanese cod with yuzu pepper sauce on top was so great. My girlfriend's cousin got the monk fish liver which was also quite good. The best thing though was the toro nigiri though. Man that was great. Some of the freshest sushi I've had, it was fabulous. My dad always said the test of a good sushi restaurant is actually the sweet egg. I've always thought it is the sushi rice, and the rice was perfect. Usually when a sushi restaurant has mastered the "small things" you can bet they got the fish down pat. It is always busy though, so I wouldn't bring a large group on the fly, cuz you will be waiting. Parties of 3 or less seemed to get seats much quicker.

Alrighty, I'm a fan! I didn't think that this place would have hit the spot for my craves for sushi, but alas, it did! My boyfriend and I were the first to walk in at 530 when it opened for dinner. We were kindly greeted by all of the sushi chefs, and were seated at a table near the sushi bar. The ambiance of the place was sort of trendy with the red wooden walls, japanese cartoon pictures, and wood floors. Service is exceptional. We were promptly asked what we wanted to order by a shy, Japanese speaking waitress who needed everything we ordered to be translated to her coworker. She said the cutest thing after we ordered our dishes, "No rice?" hehe My boyfriend and I ordered the SASHIMI DELUXE dinner! It was DELISH! My goodness! I couldn't believe how fresh and tasty each of the fish were! Everything that was on that huge plate was so good, and suprisingly filling! The presentation was very nice as well. We also ordered their spicy tuna roll (nothing special), and their salmon (always good!). As for drinks, my boyfriend had the hot green tea. It was pretty good. Oh, I just love my green tea and sushi! FYI: They charge $1 for extra ginger. It gets busy at 6pm! (There were no more seats available!) Our bill came to $64 for the both of us! Not too bad for what we ate! I would definitely venture out here to get some fresh sushi anytime!

Who wants cheap fresh sashimi? Hmmm.. that is a tough question.. ok you twisted my arm. I do! Dood, this place has the best lunch sashimi combos ever. Fresh large pieces of fish, delicious and delectable, melt in your mouth stuff. Located inside Honda Plaza, the special sashimi lunch is only offered during lunch hours. 燢eep in mind if you work in the downtown area or you are unemployed and in the area, come here early! This place is easily a 45 min wait for lunch! Annoying tidbits: *Screaming mini Japanese host that is crazy *Long long lines *No substitutions on anything... what you see is what you get But it is still 100% worth a try if you are a sushi lover! Avoid the potato salad.. it was extremely salty. Another fun fact- one of the sushi chefs from Sushi Gen just opened a new sushi joint that took the place of Sushi 333 @ Japanese Village Plaza. I will need to check it out soon!

Apparently Wed night is the slow night. Parked in pole position. YEAH! $2.50 parking fee, wtf?! But the guy in the car next to my door didn't seem to signal clearly if he was getting out of his car or staying put. Ayo, get off the pot! I stared at him and motioned for him to egress first which he did. Then the chap lingered. No surprise why -- he was waiting for his date to exit as well. "Thanks for letting me out first", he said. I slyly responded, "It's cool, but I'm gonna beat you inside!" You might be on a date, but on my birthday I wanna eat first sucker. You get one courtesy that's it! And apparently this is a sushi date spot, we got seated next to one of my brethren trying to explain to his non-Asian date all the kinds of seafood she was ingesting. He seemed a little anxious, chattering away rapidly and shaking his whole leg over the meal. She glibly laughed at all his little stories and was dressed to impress; dude relax - you got this like Kobe. $43 uni dinner w/ sashimi side (tax and tip y0) Love it.

OK, is Sushi Gen one of those over rated places? I've heard from people that Sushi gen is pretty expensive and I was not sure if this place was " Omakase worthy", so I decided to order Sashimi deluxe. The portion was American size and it was way too much. There are 6 pieces of Toro on my plate and I couldn't finish it. It's just too much. The fish selection on the deluxe plate was very interesintg,,,,, there was a tiny piece of grilled salmon, and I thought it was odd. It looked like left over from Makanai. I also ordered Ankimo sashimi, and it was not my favorite.(It was better than Otafuku,though) I will go there one more time and see if this place is at least 4 star worthy.

My, my, my. 燬ushi-Gen, you are quite possibly the best Sushi I've ever had! I needed a good place to take my visiting parents out on a workday lunch, and this was the right spot to satisfy our fresh fish urges. 燭hey've got a pretty simple menu featuring typical restaurant dishes (teriyaki, cutlet), sashimi, and sushi combos. 營f you're adventurous with your sushi, I recommend sitting up at the bar and ordering to your heart's content, but be aware of the four dish minimum before you sit down. 燭he restaurant only seats 72 people, so sitting at the bar would be your best chance to lessen the long wait (20 minutes even on a Monday for lunch). I got the sushi combo, which was perfect for $15 bucks. 營t was a sample of just about everything... five fish, egg, salmon roe, unagi, squid, sweet shrimp, and three each of cucumber and tuna. 燛ach piece of fish was extremely fresh and fatty. 營t filled me up with really good sushi for around a dollar a piece, what a great deal. 燬ashimi combo here goes for $30, so it's something to look forward to next time... maybe to split with a group of 4. Another thing I liked about this place was the chicken teriyaki my mom had. 燬he's not a big raw fish fan, so she stuck to a common dish I wouldn't have come to Sushi-Gen for, but it ended up being some of the best I've had. 燭he flavor of the teriyaki seems to be marinated into the chicken much longer instead of slathered on at the end, and the SKIN is kept on to provide some extra crispiness. 燚elicious! Definitely will be coming back if I can find a good time with friends to avoid their talked about lines.

Wait? What wait? I got seated in 5 minutes! Oh that's right, my friends waited for me while I was stuck in traffic. Thanks girls! I ate here with friends and fellow yelpers EJ C., Su L., and Long T. (from Houston) on a Friday night. Upon being seated, the waitress distributed hand towels which (as I explained to my friends) are used to clean your hands (obvious?) in case you wanted to eat sushi the proper way: with your hands (not so obvious). The exception of course is sashimi, so I kept my hands nice and grubby. You can read more about sushi dining ettiquete here http://www.dummies.com/W�in case you want to be a pretentious snob about it. Otherwise, keep rubbing those chopsticks and mix that wasabi with soy sauce like an uncivilized connoisseur. Kidding! Everything on the menu was a bit pricey, so I figured I'd get the sashimi deluxe dinner since sashimi is pricey anyway. It comes with a side of tempura and a bowl of rice, and of course, a random assortment of sashimi. While everything on the sashimi deluxe was excellent, I was severely disappointed to find that my favorite sushi, sake (salmon), was cooked! Arrrrrrrrrrrrg. Maybe I didn't read the menu properly, but that was so sad. Otherwise, I enjoyed generous servings of hamachi, toro, etc. If it wasn't for the fact that my salmon came cooked, I would have easily given this place a 5. I know, it's trivial, but not to a salmon sushi lover. Don't mess with my salmon!

I gave this place a shot because my friend was raving about "Sushi-Gen" over dinner one night. I went against my instincts of going to my usual sushi spot and wanted to see what the hype was all about. To be honest, I wasn't too thrilled. The place was packed. It was a Thursday night and we waited a little bit for our table of four. There were many parties of 2 that got seated before us which I think works out better because the place is small. When you come here, bring your wallet. This place isn't overly pricey but it won't be a cheap sushi fix. Order enough appetizers and sushi + alki and that tab will light up like a Xmas tree. The fourth person on our table didn't really eat and if he did, I know the bill would've came out to more than $125 easily. The fish was good but I've had better where it's been fresher. The cuts are decent though so you get a nice portion. When I left this place, I was ready to go grab a taco or something. I wasn't too full. The service was good. The environment is a little crampy but it's okay, there was some talent on the other tables to look at. I'm not saying I wouldn't come back, but I'm saying that by the words of others and all these 5 star posts, I was a bit let downed. And remember, it's okay to text and browse your cell phone here but there's no yapping on the cell phones allowed, read their signs.

They won't seat you until your entire party is here.

If the sashimi were any fresher here, they would have to start passing out "SHAMU" nametags to all the patrons of this restaurant. It's more expensive that most of the Japanese restaurants I've been to, but you will be surprised by the amount of FRESH sushi and food you will get here.

Bottom line about this place, in my opinion, is that while I didn't have ANY problems with the way my sushi tasted, this place isn't OMG THE MOST AMAZING SUSHI PLACE EVA!!!! My BF and I came here after we tried to go to Wurstk點he and were hit with (literally) a 50-60 person line going down the block. It was already late-ish and we wanted to eat. So, Yelp suggested this spot. We opted for a table (after waiting for about 20 minutes, which didn't bother me since it was a Saturday) since we weren't all that hungry and apparently the sushi bar has a 4 order minimum per person. In my opinion, that's too much food for one person but whatever. We split 4 爏ashimi (yellowtail, albacore, tuna and salmon) and 1 spicy tuna roll (and a side of white rice) and were beyond full. I was semi freaking out because the couple at the table next to us had a bill for $350 (!!!!!) but our total (with a large beer) only came out to $40. Just to spell it out for you, we ordered 5 pieces for the both of us....thats slightly more than half the bar minimum, so at the bar we would have been paying about 70-80 for too much food. Not to say this place isn't good, it definitely is! But I've gotten sashimi this fresh at Haru Sushi Cafe in West Hollywood, for far less money. I guess this place deserves 4 stars for being the "freshest" sushi spot in downtown, since the little tokyo food scene isn't that great?

In short: Long wait for Excellent sushi and service... Plan to go early so that you can avoid AS long of a wait and to get parking. �Reasonable prices for the quality of fish. Look out for specials too. 燣ast time i went a while back, they had a Uni sashimi special for only $18. 燭hat is a steal!!!

This is the freshest sushi you can find in los angeles. I have gone here for their excellent lunch special and for dinner. Both times I got the sashimi combination. At lunch for 15 dollars you get different cuts of meat along with a small tofu appetizer, salad, and miso soup. At dinner I got the Sashimi Dinner for 26 dollars and it came with tempura, miso soup, salad, and another seaweed salad. On the side I also ordered some spicy tuna rolls to share and 2 pieces of unagi sushi. Everything was so fresh and the fish would just melt in my mouth. Although at dinner time this place is a little pricier than most, you are getting bang for your buck. It is so worth it. If you are gonna eat sushi might as well eat it as fresh as possible! The spicy tuna rolls were so good, I am really glad that I ordered that on the side.

had lunch here the other day and the quality of sushi was superb. 爄 was actually in the mood for some indian food but since we were in the area, decided to check out sushi gen. the line was long and the wait was horrendous. 爐he restaurant was cramped and we were seated at the very center of the table section. 爂osh, i felt like sardines in a packed can. 爏canned around and all i saw was orders of sashimi. �i ordered the famous lunch time sashimi plate and she had the teriyaki beef with sashimi. 爓e were both provided with some miso soup, tofu and a small portion of dressed cabbage. �overall, the meal was good but i was in the mood for indian so i didnt enjoy it as much as i wouldve had i been craving for sushi. 爐he sashimi was melt in you mouth good, but i just felt like some complex spices. gonna get here early the next time im really in the mood for sushi.

Just got back from Japan in Sept 2011, since we were toured around by locals while there, its been hard contemplating thinking of having sushi again stateside. Saw the reviews and decided to give this place a try, glad we did. We got there at 11am under the impression that they open at that time, was greeted by a long line and an opening time of 11:15am. Sat at the sushi bar and gave the sushi chef carte blanche, our only request was the toro and sweet shrimp with the fried head, everything he served us was magic, from the makarel to the snapper to the urchin. The sushi here rivals that in Japan, a little smaller in portion but not in flavor and sheer delishiousness. Highly recommended.

Dinning was once an artisan experience. �My Yelper friend, Nick H. had written a review which got me thinking of our recent visit. Actually I started coming to Sushi-Gen way way back before its expansion, let's say twenty years ago maybe? I remember, even though the restaurant was packed all the time, nevertheless, it was cozy, friendly; we enjoyed sitting at sushi bar chatting with the chef and got some goodies on the house all the time. On the contrary, on my most recent visit for lunch, the restaurant was packed still, but the server was so mechanical, all the good old 爐radition of fine service was gone. We're so rushed through the entire time. �So do I want to come back? �Yes, I still miss the Chef's Deluxe Sashimi Combination! - and...at such time I shall be prepared for �Zen" in me. :)

OMG what yummy goodness! it's time to do the happy food dance! if you've seen me happy w/ my food then you know what i'm talking about. the head bopping cuz the food is just soooo goood and satisfying! the only thing that's bad is the pricing for the sushi. there is NONE listed!! so you blindly mark off which fresh fish you want and pay the bill when it come.. kinda scary.. well for me at least, but just be prepared to pay a lot and just enjoy the food :) the toro (fatty tuna) wow! i have nothing to compare it with since i've never had it. but wow it was good. it just melts in your mouth! no chewing necessary. grandma this ones for you. haha. i just put it in and rub it against the roof of my mouth and it just melts away. Soft shell crab appetizer: yummy as well. you can even see the eggs in the crab! very fresh. Shrimp tempura: was ehh.. a little to greasy for me and i like grease! Beware they do run out of selection towards the end of the night so come early. we did wait for about 30-40 mins but i think it was well worth the wait for my 1st time there. our bill for 3 girls, was 90 including tax and tip, so it wasn't too bad at all. but then again we didn't order too much.

High quality sashimi - extremely reasonable prices. I did the sashimi and tempura dinner ($23) and I will return - nothing short of the freshest sashimi I've had in a long time. Maguro, spicy tuna, HAMACHI, tako, negi maguro - a feast for the eyes and a delight for the palate. Served up with soup, pickled veggies and rice - not to forget the Tempura - battered lightly and cooked up crisp and perfect for that melt in your mouth satisfaction.Plum wine ($4) sweet and an excellent pairing with the wasabi and did I mention this place was PACKED! 燚inner, Monday?

I'm actually quite torn on how many stars to give this place. �On one hand, the sashimi was pretty fresh. 營 got the sashimi deluxe, and it was pretty deluxy. 營t was huge, so by the end of the meal, I was pretty sure I didn't want to see any sashimi in a long long time. �The plate consisted of sake (salmon), hokkigai (surf clam, the half reddish half whitish tongue looking one), toro (fatty tuna), tuna, whitefish, yellowtail, squid, octopus, tamago, shrimp, spicy tuna etc. 燗nyway, I was kind of disappointed that there was only 2 pieces of sake(salmon) because that just happens to be my favorite. 燗lso, the hokkigai was a little bit fishy, and the yellow tail was a little dry. Also, I am not a fan of octopus or squid, so that was just wasted space. 燗nd, what is up with LA and spicy tuna? 燭hat is hardly what I think of as deluxe sashimi. 燘ut apparently, it's a staple of LA "sushi" dining and what people think of as exquisite and fantastic. 燙ome on guys... bring on the amaebi, uni, oysters... I think it was good to get the deluxe to taste a little bit of everything, so that IF i ever come back, i'd know to order a la carte. 燗nd only get what I want to eat. 燨k this is really starting to sound like 3 stars, but the tuna was pretty exquisite.

Get the Sushi Deluxe. $15 and it comes with everything you want--fat slices of every kind of sashimi. It's worth every penny. Even the biggest sashimi eater will be satisfied. I ate to my absolute fullest (I love sashimi) and still, I had half leftover. Don't waste your money getting stuff like California rolls or other platters. A table next to us kept on ordering tons of stuff, but none of it amounted to the diversity in the deluxe. �One star off for charging for green tea and ginger. We're already dishing out quite a lot!! Oh, and come either right when it opens or around 2. If not, expect to wait over an hour. I warned ya!!

I hated this place. No Las Vegas roll or Mexican roll??? How disappointing... Really though, like ODB, you better like it raw. No deep frying or stuffed "ethnic" rolls... just straight up, delicious raw fish. The sushi snob I was with ordered just about every fish on the menu (possibly, twice), and every single one was delicious. The fish was so fresh, it tasted like it just came out of the ocean (or Echo Park lake). Just don't asked me what I ate, because my response is going to be "fish." Definitely a hidden gem in a mini-mall. Great service, attentive sushi chefs, and ocean deliciousness. If you're not down with rawness and need your sushi deep fried with witty names, read my review below for Niko Niko.

There's only so much I can say about this joint. Many have wrote about it, and I truly backed it up. No lie. At first, I thought it could be a overhyped place and with all the reccomendation I've gotten, I finally gave it a shot. Came on a lunch time, party of 2 still had us waiting for at least half an hour. However, The wait was totally worthed it. Let me break it down. Had the Beef Teriyaki with Sashimi Combination along, with Toro, Uni, Salmon, Japanese Mackarrell and Monk Liver. The beef teriyaki was cooked to perfection which really caught me off guard, it was tender, juicy and its medium rare was just how I expected. Of course, the sashimi were fresh. The sushi were just so fresh and excellent. I really thought it was one of the best sushi I ever had. The bill came out to 60 even with tips and taxes included. Sometimes, being overhyped can be bad, I was wrong this time. The prize was totally worthed it, and for its wait, I'll do it again.

An unassuming (but fanastic) find in the quaint Japanese shopping malls of downtown L.A. ! They had some cuts of fish that you would not necessarily find in run-of-the-mill sushi places such as yellowtail belly, sea urchin, and monkfish liver. The Chirashi dinner special had great value for the price! You get to try all of their main cuts of fish (minus salmon, but I think they were out that night). Yellowtail, snapper, tuna, belly, squid, octopus, plus tamago and eel. Recommended for those who want to try a variety of sushi without the pressure of doing a la carte. Kudos to my Aviator connoisseur who was brave to venture out of his California rolls by gettting the Sushi Dinner special instead. It had the same cuts of fish as Chirashi, but sushi-style. He explored what fish he liked (and did not like). He also made reservations and discovered the place (double down bonus points). We also ordered the sweet shrimp (large portions, hint of natural sweetness) and monkfish liver appetizer (tasty). They serve up the fried shrimp head too, a gesture by the chef to indicate the shrimp was indeed, fresh. Make note of the 4 order minimum per person if you sit at the sushi bar. Parking is limited on the mall lot, but Jtown Plaza across the street has a competitive flat rate. Bonus points for not having the pomp and circumstance of WeHo or Hollywood. A step above the dizzying array of sushi places in L.A. Save to the list of places to go when downtown.

I live near the fisherman's market (tsukiji) in Tokyo, Japan but when I came here, I would say they had the best quality fish here in LA. I rarely give 5 stars!!! The food is pretty traditional japanese but the prices are very reasonable. This is the one place everyone must try at least once in their life, I mean, they always have good reviews, amazing food, reasonable prices, people lined up outside every day, great staff, great vibe, so what are you waiting for?????????? I always recommend the Sashimi Deluxe, a dish full of different sashimi with miso soup and white rice for only $21!!! Definitely a must-try.

I've been coming here ever since I was little. That would strike anyone that knows me as a little odd, since coming here when I was little implies that my dad took me here, and my dad doesn't take me out to eat anywhere other than Seafood Town in Torrance. So that definitely says something. My dad drives 40 minutes out of his way to get his sashimi at this finnnnneeee establishment. We always arrive about 20-30 minutes before the restaurant opens for lunch and we are never the only ones waiting for them to open. �My dad usually orders the sashimi plate, and depending on what I feel like I'll either get a teriyaki beef and sashimi combo or just teriyaki or just sashimi, but regardless of what I order, I never finish. The fish is freshly cut and the price is exceptional. Service is generally good, not necessarily warm, but they're as quick as they can manage with as many people as there are.

This place is the standard with which I measure every other Sushi place by. The best thing about this place is the essential ingredient for every sushi restaurant on this Earth. Fresh. Good Fish. You can tell these people did their homework, someone probably got up in the middle of the night to go buy the best fish at the wharf or SOMETHING, 'cause the fish is always top notch and beautifully cut and arranged. I'm not a terribly experinced sushi eater, so I sit at the table and order their lavishly loaded deluxe sashimi combo ($30 dinner, $25 lunch, worth every penny.) They also have a list of very nice sake (I don't know my sake very well yet, but I'd humbly recommend the Kurosawa.) Of course, if you know what you're doing, sit at the sushi bar and enjoy the incredible work of the chefs. This place never dissapoints.

Where else can you get three slices of toro AND generous servings of assorted sashimi (with rice, shrimp tempura, miso soup to boot) for $23 at dinnertime in LA?! My mouth is salivating at the mere thought of Sushi-Gen's sashimi deluxe dinner. 燙hunks of ruby red tuna nestle against fresh albacore; glistening slices of sweetly-glazed squid lay against little nuggets of yet more toro; a piece of chewy octopus, shredded crabmeat, and a mound of savory spicy tuna salad add textural contrast. All this sashimi goodness is pillowed upon beds of undressed seaweed with luscious tamago on the side. 燭he only disappointing portion lies on the NE corner of the plate - a dry and flavorless hunk of broiled salmon - but this can easily be overlooked in light of the platter's true value. Accompaniments include your standard rice and miso soup and cucumber salad. 燭he tempura deserves a mention for the shrimp is lightly battered and fried, giving a crisp bite to the succulent meat that is surprisingly non-greasy. It's lovely to walk to Sushi-Gen (from my place it's about 2 miles one-way, a perfect distance to whet the appetite) and to contentedly stroll back through the cool night air after yet another satisfying meal.

Delicious. I've been to a lot of upper-scale sushi restaurants, and Gen can fight with the best of them. The day I visited everything was high-quality and authentic Japanese.

I highly recommend this restaurant. Delicious oysters, sushi, sashimi, and green tea. Very authentic.

We showed up pretty early for lunch since we were told that people start lining up at 10:30. Doors open at 11:15. So we got lost and showed up at around 10:45ish. We were the second people there. 11 rolls around and people come flooding through the gates. We stood in line and when the doors open, some group really has the audacity to just walk in right in front of everyone. Gr! So basically there was plenty of room for all the people in line but I would suggest getting here early because a wait forms immediately. They are pretty prepared and speedy because right away they ask for drinks, bring out the plates of sashimi and leave it chilling on a counter in preparation of all of those who they know are going to order it. So we ordered the sashimi (pretty typical) and the combination sashimi with teriyaki beef. Both are such a great deal. Large portions and great quality. The sashimi is fresh and the beef is pretty typical teriyaki beef. It was good, not drenched in sauce and not too fatty. For the price this place is good, but I can't say it's the best sashimi I've had. They charge for hot tea also, just an fyi. Overall good experience.

I used to love this joint but now I'm disappointed. I sat at the bar and still, the fish was disappointing. No essence of freshness left at all. Worst part was I ordered live sweet shrimp and they tried to pass dead ones to me. I called them on it because I know my live fresh shrimp in a heartbeat. At first they denied it. Then they fessed up. And I guess in their remorse, they actually sent an order of a more recently dead sweet shrimp to me. It was a nice gesture, but dead sweet shrimp is still dead so don't lie to me thinking I don't know my sushi and don't pass on crap and charge high prices for it. I asked them why said it was live sweet shrimp when it was obviously mushy and dead in my mouth and they said that it WAS alive in the morning, but they peeled it all in the morning to save time. these people do not care about their sushi at all anymore. sad to say. At these prices, they really should.

There are two kinds of sushi places: places where I would consider ordering omakase, and places where I would never consider doing such a thing in a million years. I'd estimate that 90% of the sushi places around L.A. fit in the latter category. One rule of thumb: if they have "philly rolls" on the menu, don't order omakase. I'm not so snobby that I avoid places where I'll order some rolls, I just think the two types of places should be rated differently. Sushi-Gen is an Omakase spot. This has an important implication for customers (and reviewers): If you go to Sushi-Gen and order spicy tuna rolls or the typical round-eye "sushi deluxe", you're not making the most of the place. Not only do you miss what they have to offer, 爕ou usually overpay for what you get. It's like going to be best wine bar in town and paying $12 for a beer instead of $15 for a great unusal wine you wouldn't have known to order yourself! With that backdrop, I think the first criteria for Omakase is that the ingredients should be absolutely stellar and fresh. No problems here: Sushi-Gen's fish is very high quality and fresh, as others have pointed out. Additionally, the rice is a bit warm - when combined with the cool, fresh fish it creates a very nice sensation on the pallatte. The second is an interesting mix of selections. If I'm giving the chef carte-blanche to choose my meal for me there should be some surprises. Indeed, there were a few dishes I'd never seen, and some I'd never heard of! One example was a spicy scallop sushi, which is to be eaten WITHOUT soy sauce. It had a lemony flavor to it with a subtle mix of spices. Finally, I we live in a showbiz town and I like some drama in my Omakase. Surprise me. Make it a conversation! My friend I had lunch with told me while we ate that he liked chopped up tuna. The chef overheard this and made a special toro roll that mixed chopped up tuna with some little fruit pieces - it was phenomenal!!! There was a flow to the meal and the sequence of dishes was as exciting as it was fufilling. Bonus points: we said we wanted to spend around $50 each, and the tab was $51 (pre-tax). So, that's why I give this place 5 stars. I think the price is reasonable for what you get when you make the most of what Sushi-Gen has to offer. It is unfortunate that people order a salmon roll, give this place 3 stars, and say it's overpriced. Fortunately that leaves more seats at the bar. I will be back...

The sashimi here is really really fresh! I'm really picky about sashimi and won't touch anything that tastes "fishy" but I had no problem with anything here. I've had both the lunch special and dinner at the bar . The lunch special is an awesome deal and you just can't go wrong with the variety of fish you get for $15. Dinner at the bar gets a little pricey but it's sooo worth it for quality sushi.

So many reviews, so many 5-star ratings. What can I possibly contribute to the overwhelming majority of those who LOVE Sushi-Gen? Nothing mind-numbingly brilliant or interesting but I just want this extra star to make up for any other review that could show a lower rating! GASP! Because seriously, if I read one more review about how you were disappointed this place doesn't have the bento box you want or the fried this or that, I will take a picture of your review (or profile), save it as a JPEG, then dump it in my trash. That'll be satisfactory, yes. Thursday, December 3rd, I had the honor of taking a guy I'm dating (who, later that night, asked me to go steady ;)) to dinner at Sushi Gen for his 29th birthday. I had made reservations at a steak house (JAR) two weeks prior to his birthnight but he wanted to get sushi (he hadn't had Sushi Gen in nearly a year!) so hey, whatever the birthday boy wants, right? Luckily for us, because it was 9:00p.m. on a Thursday night, we didn't have to wait AT all. We were immediately seated at the bar, which means ... faster food! We ordered our drinks and two bowls of clam miso soup. Mmm! We ordered the following (and I rated them out of 5 stars): ***** Salmon (3 orders of 2) **** 燳ellowtail (2 orders of 2) **** 燯nagi (2 orders of 2) ***** Albacore (2 orders of 2) Spanish Mackerel (1 order of 2) - he ordered this so I can't rate it. *** �燬picy Tuna Handroll (1 roll) ***** (x 100)Toro (2 orders of 2) I only took a picture of the albacore and toro (as shown in the gallery) because I forgot. I was too busy enjoying the food! I loved ALL of the fish; they were SO buttery in texture. Melt in your mouth like buttah baby. I would say the TORO and SALMON were my favorite. But I'm biased because I generally love salmon. ;) The total bill came out to be $93.00 for the two of us. I don't know the pricing for each individual fish. I left a total of $112.00 before leaving. Parking was $2.50. Along with the attendant, there were 4 of his friends loitering so I'm sure if you're with a lot of women, he'll let you go without paying. (Not that this measly amount will make up for your dinner bill!) �) I give it 5 stars. I would definitely go back!

When it comes to Sushi Gen, I know what it feels like to be a bird circling its prey. 燜or the past 6 years or so, I'd always try to make it a point to visit Sushi Gen, but for whatever reason I just wouldn't be able to go. 燬o when a business meeting warranted visiting downtown LA, I made a straight beeline to Sushi Gen for my long awaited sushi dinner. The lot parking is almost always full, but there is plenty of street parking around the corner if you don't mind walking a bit. 燣uckily, we were able to snag a table for two at the sushi bar at 7:30pm in a mere 3 minutes. 燗ll the stars must have been aligned because I think everyone else had waited at least 15 minutes. 燭he action behind the sushi bar is happening. 營 counted at least 6 sushi chefs and a handful of other guys working the back of the sushi bar. I make it a habit of ordering omakase only at the better sushi establishments so I had no qualms putting our dining adventure in the trustworthy hands of our sushi chef. 燨verall, very impressed with the fresh quality of the fish. 燢anpachi, mirugai, toro, and ebi were particularly delicious. 燭he shrimp head miso soup was robust and flavorful as well. 營MO the portions were actually quite generous and the sushi to rice ratio was just right. 燱e could have stopped at the end of the omakase, but the kanpachi and toro were just too good that we placed another order. This may not be the best sushi joint in LA, but Sushi Gen definitely ranks in the top 20. 燗nd in this town, that's still saying quite a lot.

Gosh, my review before was short. 營t's okay, I can make it up now. 燭hey close between lunch and dinner, so don't come here in the middle of the day. Upon entering the small parking lot, you will need to grab a ticket from the machine. 燚on't forget to validate it before you leave, so your parking fee will only be $2.50. 燭here's metered parking on the street as well, but sometimes it's tough to find a good spot. We got here around 5:15 on a Monday night. 燭hey open at 5:30 for dinner, and already there were 7 parties before us waiting. 燱e were still sat right away though. 燣ooking around the room, most people order the sashimi or sushi set dinners, since they are great deals. 燬ince I'm cutting back on eating raw fish, yes I know it sucks, I ordered a few cooked appetizer dishes. For sure one of the great things about their menu is that it does cater to everyone. 燭hey have the more "americanized" items like beef or chicken teriyaki bento to the izakaya style tapas to fresh sashimi and sushi. I ordered the Salmon skin salad, Ankimo (monkfish liver), Ume-Shio cut roll and Grilled Yellowtail collar. 燤y dinner-mates all ordered the sashimi dinner. 燱e also ordered Uni sashimi for the table to share. Salmon skin salad was just okay. 燦othing to rave about. 燗ctually I barely had an salmon skin. 燗nkimo was delicious and fresh! 燘y the way, ankimo is not a raw dish. 營t's steamed, but served cold. 燯me-shiso cut roll was not the best I've had. 營t was more salty than sour. 營kko actually makes the best ume-shiso cut roll. 燭he yellowtail collar was grilled perfectly and just super tasty! 燭he portion was also rather large too! 營 couldn't even finish it, had to share. 燭he uni was super duper fresh! 燱hen ordering sashimi, they give you the whole box plus a side of chopped fatty tuna. 營t's all accompanied with sliced cucumbers and crispy seaweed. 營t's $30, but so worth it. The sashimi dinner was a ridiculously large portion! 燗ll for only $26! 燳ou get two small starts of pickled cucumber and a sunomono. 燭hen you get a big bowl of rice and a plate of mixed tempura. 燜inally a full plate of fresh assorted sashimi. 燤y dinner mates were very satisfied and full. �The servers were also very nice and filled our hot teas regularly. 燨h, they have lots of ice creams and mochi ice creams for dessert as well as exotic fresh fruits such as cherimoya. 燚efinitely a great place to go for fresh and delicious Japanese for a good price!

Just go. 燫ight now. 燚iscover why Sushi-Gen is such a LA staple now for sushi. 燗fter reading this of course! :D 爃ahah Last Saturday the gang took me out for a late birthday dinner at Sushi-Gen in Little Tokyo. It really is a hotspot and a staple in LA. 燩eople have high expectations when they go to Little Tokyo for Japanese food and many disappoint but never Sushi-Gen. 燱henever I pass by this place there's always a line out the door, sushi bar filled with patrons, dining room filled with people from all sorts of life: businessman, families, college students... Because of the crowd, you can say that their sushi and sashimi will always be fresh. LA's very picking with sushi since we have such a wide selection and when a restaurant has been gathering crowds like Sushi-Gen for as long as they have, you know they are doing something right. I had the sashimi dinner set and that night it came with 燼kami, toro, maguro, hamachi, ika, tako, whitefish, spicy tuna, crab, and konjac. 燜resh fresh fresh fresh fresh! 燛specially the spicy tuna.. O M G. 燗dding salmon roe totally adds a whole nother dimension to texture. 燚elicious. 燦ot a big fan of whitefish and wish it had salmon on there instead, but that's just a minor detail :P The dinner set also came with tempura. 燩erfectly fried shrimp, potato, zucchini, and eggplant. 營 almost considered ordering another a la carte haha. If you love fish collar, definitely try the yellowtail collar. 營t's a little bit annoying to eat, but really, nothing's more perfect than that! I shall save up and try their omakase next time since I've been hearing a lot about it. 燗lso if dinner price is too much, try it out during lunch!

Be prepared for a wait into the world of sushi awesomeness. Food: The sushi here is probably the freshest I've had in a long time. The sashimi is what I go for and the consistency and taste just can not be beat. It may be pricy to some people, but that's what you pay for if you want some high quality stuff. Just try it out and you'll see. Service: They try really hard here. I appreciate it. It's crowded and stuff all the time and they really try. Once inside and seated, they will try to get your order ASAP. I appreciate their efforts a lot in such a stressful environment. Environment/Location: Location is a tough call because you have to pay for parking unless validated. It's also in a VERY small plaza so be careful about time if you are thinking you will park fast. Wait times are so long here, too, so again you don't want to come here for a quick lunch if that's what you are planning. Inside is pretty crammed and small, and tables don't accomodate more than 4 people, so don't come here with a large group. Overall: 4/5 I'm a fan of this place for their excellent sushi, but not a fan of their parking and tiny seating area.

***From May 2008*** I am with the majority of people here that give the food a 5 star. 燜resh and tasty sashimi made to order. So here's my gripe: A friend and I decide to go for lunch, looking for some sushi. 營 remember hearing that Sushi Gen is top notch, a rave for foodies, etc. etc. 燗nd that we needed to get there early for lunch as there would be a crowd. 燬o at 11:15 we go, with a mindset that we would beat the lunch crowd. Wrong. The line was already out the door. 燞ost says "40 minutes" for a table for two. Bummer. 營 guess we could go to that other sush- "But the sushi bar is open. 燱ant to sit there?" he says. Hmm. 燤y friend and I have a quick debate, then agree to sit at the bar. "There is a 4 item blah-blah-blah for each of you. Appetizers, sushi and sashimi only." (under his breath.) Wait what did he say? Too late. 燱e were seated. 燬ushi chef starts naming things at warp speed, we nod at random, he makes 2-piece items, yells something else out in Japanese, we look confused, smile in confusion, he whips up something else, then we ask for check. $64 and change. �Let this be a lesson to all you novice sushi bar patrons. Get to Sushi Gen early for a table, wait it out, or find somewhere else to eat. Unless you feel like throwing down hundos for lunch. 營 will go back again to try their $15 sashimi plate though. 燭hat sounds tasty and a lot less fleecing. ****************************** ������燯PDATE: ****************************** On the second go round, I jumped out to beat the crowds at 10:45 am. 燭here was a line starting at this point. 燗fter waiting in my spot for 10 minutes, the line tripled in length. Geez... The guy ahead of me said, "This is nothing. 燱ait til 11:15 when the place opens. 燭here were people here last week for lunch that came from Van Nuys and Brea. 燨n a Tuesday!" Once the doors swung open, we funneled through like the herd of cattle that we were. 營 ordered the sashimi lunch special. �15. 燱hat could I possibly get for $15 that is worth such a wait? 燗nd then the food came. �Holy. Underwear. Side dishes galore, including miso, sweet cucumber salad, pickled cabbage, and tofu. 燭he sashimi was plentiful to the max. Four types of tuna, hamachi, salmon, crab, and a bowl of rice. The sashimi was so fresh, perfect texture, perfect taste. Quality and quantity abound; no frills, no rockin' rolls, just authenticity. $15 goes damn far in this place. 燝et there VERY early, and you will be in for a treat.

Not sure why i am writing this review - I guess it does make me # 430, which is always nice. Felt like an impromptu Monday night sushi extravaganza 燼nd found this place last minute on Yelp. It was exactly what I was looking for. Authentic little place, great quality, and what I felt were descent prices. Everyone keeps acting like this place is SUPER expensive. I did not see it that way. We (3 college guys) ate a fishing boat's worth of fish, and drank enough sake and Asahi to complete my little fishing boat/sailor analogy. in total the bill was $170. An expensive meal I guess but in the sushi world we defintiely got what we paid for. Also, amazing waitress. She was a tricky one though. When she would come up - instead of asking if we would like anything else - she would ask "More beer? More sake? 燤ore sushi?" Who in their right mind says no to any of those...

Great sushi joint. 燬mall place and there usually is a wait, but it goes pretty fast. 營f you don't want to wait, the sushi bar usually has seats open but a minimum of 4 orders and no lunch specials can be ordered. �The kampachi(sp?) fish head with appetizer sashimi lunch special ($15). 燭he fish has lots of fatty meat goodness that melts in your mouth. �Service is good and fast. 燭he only bad thing is that you have to pay $1.50 for parking even after validation.

I've been 10+ times so I can't give it 2 stars (which, for me, means I wouldn't go back as opposed to 3 stars which means I wouldn't object)... but I won't go back. The lunch menu is a good deal. 燳ou get a LOT of food for $15. 燭he dinner - best bang for the buck on the menu is sashimi deluxe with an order of sushi rice on the side. I haven't had cooked food here, and if I go back, that is what I will get. 燭he hamachi collar looks pretty awesome, and it's hard to mess up such an oily fish anyway.

This place was fantastic. We sat at the bar and ordered, albacore, unagi, toro, japanese snapper, and uni. IT was all mouth-wateringly delcious. It can get a bit pricey, especially when you don't know how much everything is when you're ordering it. However, despite our crazy bill it was still well worth it. Our chef was nice enough to let us sample the herring roe on kelp that we pointed at in curiosity. I can never go back to those random hole in the wall sushi places again without comparing it to sushi gen. �I'll come back on my next payday.

There are only a handful of sushi restaurants in LA where the chef still goes to the fish market early each morning to pick out each piece of glorious fish. 燬ushi Gen is one of them. The staff here is incredibly friendly and the service is excellent. They do take reservations which is very helpful on a Friday night. Great place to grab sushi before heading to staples center. Things to try: The Japanese snapper with lemon and the toro (the best and fattiest in LA!) Sushi-Gen is the real deal. 營n fact I really shouldn't be telling you about it, you're going to ruin my spot!

It's tough to know what to rate Sushi Gen. 燭he place is a bit of a contradiction of terms. 燨n one hand they do fresh sushi extremely beautifully. 燳ou can taste the freshness of the fish. 燭hey serve it at the right temperature. 燳ou can taste that they properly make their sushi rice--the whole bit. 燭hey also have a nice sake selection. 燭he prices are above average, but not by a ton. 燭hen again, they are only *steps* away from the cold storage section of the city, where ALL of the freshest fish goes, so there's really no excuse for there to be ANYWHERE in Little Tokyo that doesn't have the freshest fish that money can buy. However, the service last night left a LOT to be desired. 燨ur server was curt, not particularly attentive, and even seemed judgmental of my order. 營 mean, I was at a real sushi place. 燚on't look at me all funny 'cause I wanted a California roll and asked to make sure it had real crab in it. 營 thought it'd be fun to order one in a REAL sushi place. 燝eez! 營f you're gonna judge me for it, don't put it on your menu! �This wasn't the best fish I've had in LA. 燭hat was definitely Sushi Zo, but then I've not had omakase here. 營f nothing else, you'll know that you're going to get fresh, Japanese sushi and sashimi here. 燜rills, service, smiles? 燳ou won't. 燘ut I suppose you don't always get those in Japan, either, so...enjoy.

If you're going to stand outside and wait for sushi, you may as well get the best sushi... and you may as well get it for the sort of prices that make you feel like going to confession. To that end, I'll usually default to Komasa or Hama (in a pinch) every time. This is, of course, simply personal preference. The quality of Sushi Gen is undisputed -- they serve very good sushi here. It's just often very hard to get in, there's long waits, and it's arguably a bit off the beaten path. Unfortunately, their prices are just a bit higher than most of the comparable competition in the area, and I think that factors in quite a bit when I have to decide where to get my sushi on. All that said, if you don't mind the wait and you feel like loosening your purse strings a bit, you can't go wrong at Sushi Gen.

I don't remember the sushi here as it was over-shadowed by my first experience with Sea Cucumber. UPDATE: I've now been back and sat at the crowded sushi-bar. After a mix-up with the sushi chef, about whether the ladies i was with wanted rolls or nigiri sushi we got them what they wanted, which were rolls. me moved on to some nigiri once they felt more emboldened, I ate some yellow-tail, some kanpachi, unagi, anago, all which was really good. Our Sushi-Chef was hilarious, when asked about a fish he would enact the part of the fish, flapping his arms for halibut fin, etc. Pretty amusing, and all after he scolded us for wanting maki at the sushi bar. But now I get it. Line or not, I think the sushi here is good, and in a pinch if you don;t know where else to go this place will do just fine.

Attn Sushi Lovers!! If you want the best sushi experience just pls pls pls order Omakase. 燭hey don't have a set omakase menu price but if you let the chef know i'm pretty sure he'll be happy to work with your budget. 燭rust me it's worth the $$ :) 營 always ask for omakase and order a bottle of sake which comes to around $120 ish, but keep in mind I do eat ALOT. 燬ushi Gen is the place for real traditional sushi not for fusion rolls, but if you do want rolls thats full of flavor try the Negi Toro Takuan(scallion toro radish) Roll. 營 prefer hand roll to cut roll because of their nori (seaweed). 燘uy your chef a beer so he can enjoy it after work. 燯se the restroom before you're seated. 燚on't walk out in the middle of your meal to smoke your nasty cigarettes. 燚on't complain if they squeeze you in for a seat just be grateful dammit. 燩our little soy sauce at a time.... It bothers me when I see people filling their little dish up. 燳ou can always pour more right? Now go enjoy your meal like you've been eating sushi your whole life. 燭rust me that this will be the only sushi joint you'll be visiting from now on. 營f you don't like this place.... then just go back to katsuya..

After my most recent visit I realized that LA has too many quality sushi joints for Sushi-Gen to stand out. 燞eck even the Little Tokyo area has several quality sushi joints. 營 definitely feel you can get equal or better quality elsewhere including Mako, Hama, Komasa, or Hirozen for either larger portions with comparable prices or similar portions for cheaper prices. �Ordered the uni, aji, albacore, toro, japanese snapper, kanpachi, ama ebi, hamachi, and salmon all for myself and was just barely satisfied. 燤y biggest disappointment was the hit and miss of the taste and quality of the nigiri and their small portions. 燚isliked the albacore and aji. 燭he fish was bland and not fresh and the garnish overpowered the fish anyways. 燭he aji was the smallest cut of fish I have ever eaten in a sushi joint. 燢anpachi, hamachi, salmon and ama ebi were ok. 燭he uni, toro and japanese snapper were very good and enough to provide an A-Ok dining experience. 燭he total came out to $86 with tip and tax for one. �I highly recommend going to Mako Sushi in Little Tokyo over Sushi-Gen for the larger portions, cheaper prices, better taste and service. 燝o to Hama or Komasa for cheaper but quality alternatives with the same bustling vibe as Sushi-Gen. 營 would still visit Sushi-Gen but only if I'm treating or showing guests or friends.

Absolutely delicious and absolutely fresh! My best friend and I went in here completely clueless but the chef was very funny, and helpful. We pretty much tried every type of fish. We had the salmon, red snapper, yellow tail, tuna, octopus, and shrimp. All amazing, but since we were so clueless we didn't know how to really order because everyone around us was getting these amazing dishes. Most definitely a place for real sushi! And a place to put a dent in your pocket, but I don't mind since it was well worth it! Oh, and the chefs are a bit creepy. They like to stare...

Where to begin where to begin.... First of all be warned that without a reservation it's impossible to eat here. (but we got lucky and got a sushi bar) The place is packed and buzzin with activity but it's so small!!! =( I felt so cramped and claustiphobicky sitting next to someone that I dont know and paranoid ill elbow him in the face while I eat... ): This isn't your usual sushi joint where they give you a piece of paper and you order off of there... No you have to flag down the sushi chef and do a mass order of sushi/sashimi to keep you going while you order more while stuffing your face. Think of the wait at a sushi bar like this... *the bar at a club* (I swear it's like when you go clubbing - you gotta flag down the bartender and wait and wait for them to come around to you ahah) Why -1 stars? -1 star for the cramped sushi bar (i wasn't in my comfort zone. the person next to me was in my comfort bubble ahah) Why +4 stars? +1 star for the friendly staff +1 star for the fresh sushi +1 star for the service +1 star for the atmosphere (: But all in all the sushi was delicious and very fresh. Our sushi chef was awesome~. And~ came out with a full stomach and very satisfied (:

800+ reviews so doubt i can add anything new or insightful, but i will try... 燼nd keep it short and sweet! - no frills, traditional japanese sushi - priced very reasonably - expect to wait to be seated, even if its just 15 min - the menu is not extensive beyond sushi... 爏ome broiled fish collars (salmon, yellowtail) and a few teriyaki dishes are about it besides dead fish - the sushi menu itself is not extensive either... 爊o frills stuff, but they will make some things for you if its traditional sushi, i.e., negihama maki (yellowtail cut rolls) aren't on the menu but they obliged my request. as others have said, some of the freshest fish you will ever have. 爐he sashimi lunch, and even the sashimi deluxe, are true bargains... 爕ou can easily pay 2x for the quanity and quality you get. 爕ou may not get the variety of fish other places offer, but (1) you wont get the quality of Sushi Gen and (2) if you do get the quality, it will be double the price. 爐he other specials are great as well, i.e., think salmon collar, 7 pieces of sashimi, miso soup, rice, & tsukemono for $15... along with Komasa down the street, one of the top sushi restaurants in all of Los Angeles...

If you want melt in your mouth delicious mouth watering sushi take your mouth and appetite directly to Sushi-Gen! You will never be disappointed. The line outside doesn't lie. This is authentic Japanese cuisine at its finest! If you want excellent sushi - this is where you must eat. This is on the top of my list! There are no frills here - it's located in a small mini-mall in Little Tokyo. I happen to go the chiropractor a few doors down, so I'm fortunate enough to be in the area quite often to frequent this amazing sushi bar. The toro, yellow tail, tuna, salmon, scallops, tako and even the clam miso soup is incredible! Your head turns from side to side to check out what the next person or table is enjoying. If you love sushi - you will more than love it here.

I've been going to Sushi Gen since I was like...10. 營t hasn't changed and it really shouldn't since it's just about perfect. 燤y family knows the head chef and he always sends over a huge complimentary plate of sashimi to my grandma, though she probably has no idea who he is anymore. 燱e used to go every week...I'm not quite sure why we stopped. 營 think it's because it was hard to maneuver her wheelchair behind the sushi bar to the restroom. �The spicy tuna is sooooo good and all the fish is so fresh and delicious. 燛ven the cooked stuff is good, especially the yellowtail collar, I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it. 燭hey even have yamakake and they'll put maguro in it and everything! 燱e usually don't wait in line, but I've seen people outside and they don't seem to mind the wait. 營've heard the lunch specials are good, but I've never been because of my ridiculously short lunch break. 燭ry this place out. 營 swear you'll think you've died and gone to Tokyo.

My first experience here was a bad one because I sat at the bar with my mom, got a bone in my albacore, my sweet shrimp tasted nauseatingly metalic, and the bill ended up costing +$70 between the both of us for maybe 3 or 4 orders each. My second visit wasn't much better-- my date decided to phone her exboyfriend while we were looking over the menu to ask him, "what was that thing that we used to always get?" Well, at least 'that thing' that they used to always get was filling, tasty, and affordable. Their sashimi plate saves them from less than three stars.

Sushi Gen is definitely the best. Fresh, not fishy, just right. The staff are rushed because they are always busy, but still manage to be friendly. Plus the sushi chefs all cheer you on your way out -it's sweet.

Decent sushi, but mostly filled with out-of-towners and power lunchers who somehow have in their mind that this is 'the' sushi place in little tokyo. 燦ot true. 燭he wait is way too long, both in waiting to get seated and for the food to get prepared. 燚ecent food -- but not the best. 燗ll native little tokyo'ers know, 燾ross the street instead and find the frosted white glass restaurant called Hamakawa right on the corner of 2nd and Central. 燨pen only after 5pm and closed on Tuesdays, but offers a much tastier, prompter, cheaper and more genuine sushi eating experience. 營've been going to both Sushi Gen and Hamakawa for years and can say that while both are good, Hamakawa is the best.

One of the best sushi places I've been to! My best friend took me here for my bday and we ate about 100 dollars worth of food. We ordered the sushi deluxe (good, but still room in our stomach for more, and the cucumber roll almost killed us with the shocking amout of wasabi in it) and the giant clams (soooo gooooooooooodddd), and then we were still hungry so we ordered the sashimi delux ($30). Next time we go there, we will just order the sashimi delux. It was huge, filling, and the fish was so buttery. My friend tried to make me eat the snail-like thing and I tried it for the first time in my life. Not bad... I liked that they gave a lot of tuna cuz...that's mostly what I eat (yes, i'm a sushi neophyte). we ordered the plum wine, which was HEAVENLY. the Tuna with shredded yam was weird. I was thinking that the yam was going to be cooked but it was sticky and raw... not used to that. We also got the yellowtail collar, which melted in your mouth. I want to try the salmon collar next time. Mmmm. so good..

That's what you need to do.. if you don't make reservation you need to get there in LINE (yes line) before it opens, at least 30 mins before because the line is soooo long.. When there is a line you know the food is that good!!! Food is a little pricey but it's worth is once in awhile!! The only Cons to this place is how you have to wait in line and make reservation at lunch time.. but just do it.. all worth it!!!

Why oh why do I live in the valley where all the alleged "legitimate" sushi bars are all but Japanese owned and operated? Why can't there be more establishments like Sushi-Gen around here? I suppose I'm going to have to move as a solution to that problem... Sushi-Gen IS the place to go to for sashimi in Los Angeles without having to pay out your ass. For $15 during the designated lunch period, you can stuff your face with a platter of clean and fresh cuts of yellowtail, albacore, 爋ctopus, and salmon with an order of their "sashimi lunch" --- all while sheeplessly contributing to the global decimation of wild-caught fish populations. A zesty miso soup and a hefty individual serving of rice is served with the fish. I eat a good amount of sashimi (surprised I'm not dead from mercury poisoning) so I'm confident to say I know fresh seafood when I eat it. They don't have any of that Americanized-fusion "Las Vegas high-roller tempura cowboy roll" or "Caterpillar rainbow dandelion cut roll" crap. REAL, JAPANESE PREPARED FOOD. REALLY FRESH SUSHI. That's all there is to it. Highly recommended if you're down in that part of DTLA (Japantown). Here's a little heads up though...it's not a "well kept secret" in L.A. Too many people know about this place and for good reason...which results in the restaurant being packed for every hour they are open (especially lunch), so you may have 爐o wait awhile to be seated. A very solid 4.5 stars. Parking in that lot with validation from the restaurant costs $1.50.

This is the best sashimi I've had, it blew Katsuya (the original not the cheesy knockoffs) away which was my previous favorite but it's not even close. The sashimi is so fresh and so high quality it just melts in your mouth. It's certainly not cheap and it's always busy but well worth the cost. We always end up about $50 a person which isn't cheap but is not bad for the quality. Food - A+ Ambience -A Service - A- Value - B+

I ordered the sashimi dinner (like the regular sashimi, but for a few $ more, you get soup, rice, sunomono AND tempura. Tasty and well worth it.) Also ordered the grilled marinated black cod. Mmmmm.

So I've heard that this place is crazy popular and the best for real, authentic Japanese sushi, so of course I couldn't resist trying it! I came on a Monday night around 5:30 pm and the place was already filling up. By the time I left, there were people waiting outside the door for a seat. Take from that what you will. And yes, the restaurant is located in a parking lot that charges $2.50. Make sure you get your ticket validated at the restaurant so you don't have to pay even more. - Sashimi deluxe ($35): this comes with a variety of sashimi and other side dishes: salmon, yellowtail, octopus, tuna, fatty tuna, shrimp, and then a spicy tuna, cooked salmon, crab meat, and seaweed. It is a lot of food and very filling! The salmon and yellowtail were my favorite. It is SO buttery and just melts in your mouth. Delishhhhhh!!! Other items-- crab meat, spicy tuna, cooked salmon-- were just mediocre. It comes based on the Chef's choice. - Tempura (Large: $14): Shrimp, sweet potato, zucchini, carrot. The tempura was perfect-- it is so light and crispy and crunchy. It is definitely one of the best tempura platters I've ever had. - Assortment: we also tried the uni (good, but not fab), the yellowtail belly, and the salmon skin roll. I didn't find the roll that great because it was bits of salmon skin. I prefer pieces of salmon skin (I know I'm picky, but I swear it matters!) Overall, I think Sushi-Gen captures the feeling of authentic Japanese dining that is rare nowadays. For example, I think my parents would love this place. I, however, prefer eating Japanese food with a twist (anyone check out Ikko, my favorite?) Bottom line: come here if you love traditional Japanese sushi.

PHENOMENAL. Fresh and delicious sashimi! Everything was perfect, except for the long wait. 40 minutes to seat a party of 3 when I went in (tuesday night around 6pm). Wait 20 minutes longer and we could've gotten a table, but our stomachs were getting too impatient. At the bar seats, combination plates are not allowed to be ordered, so we just got hella sashimi, and oh my gosh it was glorious. Even the stuff we were skeptical about, such as the mackerel because they tend to taste/smell fishy, were extremely fresh with no strong aftertaste. Our chef recommended the Spanish mackerel, and it was hands down the best mackerel I've had. I've always been a fan of yellowtail, but the yellowtail belly here melted straight down my esophagus. Probably the best yellowtail I've had as well! Everything else I ordered was just as amazing. The fatty tuna was super soft; uni was so delectable; halibut was one of my favs. There was a lot more I ordered but it's all the same story. Next time I would make a reservation or wait a little bit longer for a table seat so that I can order the combo plate. I believe ordering the sashimi one by one is way pricier than the plates. Our check came out to be ~$200. Eeks... No regrets nonetheless! Please, come here for sashimi! It is a must-try!!! PS $3 for parking in their parking lot 3 hrs max.

Possibly a divine sushi experience. 燬ort of felt as though I was sent to sushi-heaven and back. 燱ow. While visiting my friend in L.A.

Tobiko Sushi - Almost sweet, delicious! Toro Sushi - the first time I ever tried it and HOLY COW, I am a believer. Uni Sushi - I ordered 3 orders of this, one after the other because I couldn't stop. Unagi Sushi - THEY BROIL IT AT THE SUSHI BAR!!! It's super warm, sweet, and delicious. Maguro Sashimi - big, beefy cuts of wonderfully fresh tuna Hamachi belly Sushi - OMG. 營 didn't even think something so glorious existed.

It was 12pm on a Tuesday when I ventured to this joint, and luckily I only had to wait 20 minutes to be seated for two. 燱e parked in the plaza's parking lot as it only cost $2 for two hours with validation. 燬o here's what we tried... Lunch beef teriyaki and sashimi combination: 燭his is what my lunch partner got. 燭he beef teriyaki was all right. 燭he sauce was too salty, but that seems to be a universal issue with teriyaki sauce, and not this beef teriyaki itself. 燭he sashimi came in this small bowl. 營f you want to order this, do not expect a generous portion of sashimi as that is not what you'll get. 營 posted a photo if you'd like to see for yourself, but it's hiding amongst the sea of photos other yelpers posted.

Albacore nigiri sushi ($5): 燤y favorite part of the meal as albacore is my favorite cut of fish! 燛xtremely fresh, and the cuts were fairly generous.

Went here with a friend a few weeks ago, both of us were here for the first time, thought the wait would be pretty long since it was Satruday night, and there were a lot of people waiting. The host said about 20 to 30 minute wait so we went next door to get a drink first, it ended up being less than 15 minutes and we sat down at the sushi bar. As soon as we sat down the chief gave us each a bowl of appetizer, I'm still not sure what it was, but it was good. We ordered a bottle of sake, and decided to go with omakase. Everything was really fresh and delicious, there was nothing I didn't like, my favorites were the amaebi (sweet shrimp) and scallops, and toro. Sake was also really good :) 燭he only small complaint I have is that they sat many people at the sushi bar so it was a little tight on space, but as long as the food is good, I don't mind it much. The bill came out to be pretty high but was worth it, just not all the time. If not for the price and the drive (from Irvine), I would definitely be coming here a lot more.

Reputedly the best & freshest sushi place in LA (I hear alot of unsubstantiated rumors from all sorts of sources), & I must agree. The fish is SUPER fresh. The quality of ALL the dishes from the complimentary appetizer (there's more than the usual) to the combo plates is fantastic. And the price for what you get is a little unbelieveable. My only problem each & every time we go (& I have alot of patience) is THE WAIT, usually an hour to an hour & a half no matter what time we arrive...though we've only gone for lunch each time. Once we arrived about 30 minutes early just to wait in line for the doors to open, & only waited 5 minutes to be seated. (4.5 stars)

The best part about Sushi-Gen is the quality of their fish. 燛verything we ate was fresh and delicious! 燱e started with a bottle of cold sake that we had the waitress pick out. 營t was smooth and crisp and reasonable ($18). 燱e ordered a spicy tuna roll, a yellowtail roll, a california roll, a couple orders of salmon nigiri, and a couple orders of albacore nigiri. 燛ach piece of fish was better than the next. 燭he rolls were just the right size and the pieces were perfect too. Our bill wasn't outrageous and we left full and very happy. 營f I'm ever in Little Tokyo again, I'll definitely come back to Sushi-Gen!

PIcked this place by chance about 6 months ago. I will never forget it, probably because it was the first time I'd had omikaze. Took my friend there for his first sushi experience and my first, albeit unknown, omikaze/a la carte... It started with some beers and a few nigiri selections that I am fond of, then I began to notice the 爈ittle old chef serving us the fish (at the bar, and apparently lucky to be seated there). I felt like striking up some conversation with him even though I don't speak Japanese and he barely spoke engrish'. Feeling a bit adventurous that night I decided to ask the chef for random pieces from the fridge in front of us. He would name the fish for me and I would ask him to hook it up, and he did. BLEW MY MIND. He would serve a piece at a time, if I liked it, he would hand me another. And on and on till I was at about 200 hundred bucks or so. The sticker shock was somewhat of a buzz kill but well worth the experience. I felt a kinship with that man. I hope to eat there again one day. Oh, btw, I travel constantly, eating sushi whenever I can afford it, and this was some of the freshest sushi I've tasted anywhere...other than the last time I had mackerel served up from the top of an igloo chest' on the back of boat.

Sashimi Lunch and Sashimi Dinner. Fresh/Delicious, great compliments. At lunch, Sashimi order comes with miso soup and rice. For dinner, Sashimi w/Tempura comes with miso soup/rice/some kind of cold noodles (very small as an appetizer). Lunch ends around 1PM. Inside Honda Plaza (need to pay parking, can be subsidize/validated depending on how long you park. Waits can take as long as an hour. I don't recommend groups because there are not many tables.

Excellent sushi, reasonable price. �Highlights: 爑ni, saba, albacore We ordered the chef's special, which had a roll that looked and tasted like cooked salmon and carrot, which sounds like something you'd get at Cheesecake Factory (not in a proper Japanese Sushi restaurant). 燭hat almost knocked it down to three stars. The uni and mackeral were phenomenal though.

We were still hungry... The sushi was fresh, and good, but nothing spectacular, the portions and rolls were tiny, and we were left starving after everyone at the table shelled out $20 a piece. 爓e had to go to yogurtland afterwards to fill ourselves. The wait was long, and the service was a tad slow. If you're a trust fund baby, it's a great place to get sushi. 營f you're not, go for lower quality, but at least it's filling sushi, elsewhere in little tokyo.

This is my favorite sushi place in Los Angeles and has yet to fail me. Quick words of advice if you're thinking about coming here for the first time. 1. Don't bring your non-Sushi loving friends here or else you will waste a lot of money! There are plenty of cheap alternatives in Little Tokyo that will satisfy your friends who only eat "California Rolls" 2. Don't get a table, sit at the bar. You will 爓aste your experience if you sit at a table instead of the bar. The sushi chefs there are awesome and authentic, whereas you have no idea who is making your rolls in the back-of-the-house. 3. You have to order the Toro (Fatty Tuna). Best damn thing on the menu. 4. Come Early! This place gets packed around prime time on the weekend! 5. No Reservations! 6. Don't forget to get your parking validated! What makes this place stand out from the other sushi places in Little Tokyo (other than the price) is that each cut of fish is perfect. You really have to appreciate fine sushi in order to savor the most of your meal here. Temperature of the food is perfect as well. The only negative side is that you're looking to pay ~$75 a person if you're ordering food and alcohol (still not the most expensive sushi place I've been to, but that's pretty pricey). I will honestly say that you get your monies worth if you're an avid sushi lover.

*Highlight: lunch special sashimi plate!! Their lunch special is ridiculous-- you can get a HUGE plate of assorted sashimi plus soup, rice, and tofu for $15. The sashimi is so fresh and amazing. It's gotten to the point that whenever I go to other Japanese restaurants, I sit there missing Sushi-Gen. ;) It's not so horribly crowded at 11-11:30ish on weekdays.

Oh how I miss being walking distance from Kanoyama. This is the one place most people recommended to me for affordable and fresh sushi in LA. Too bad downtown's so far, but it was worth it. The sushi dinner combo is reasonably priced, and its a decent amount of food. They give you standard cuts plus a few others. 燦ow that I know its good, I'll have to come back, sit at the sushi bar, and try the special stuff to really judge...

They open at 11am on Mondays, and my friend and I got there about 20 minutes earlier. We decided to take a walk around the area, and we came back around 11:15-11:30am. The place was almost packed! I was really surprised. I was filled with anticipation. "This place must be good!" I thought, and it was. It really was. My friend and I ordered the tempura and sashimi lunch special, the unaju and sashimi lunch special, and a sushi combination. Yes, three lunch portions for two people! And a large bottle of Asahi beer. We were quite ambitious! The lunch specials came with miso soup, a tofu dish, salad, and some pickles. Everything was delicious! Like everyone said, the sashimi was fresh! I was in food heaven. Our total came out to be around $60. A pretty good deal, considering how fresh and delicious everything was.

I've been going to Sushi Gen as long as I can remember. 燭oyo-san practically watched me grow up. 燬o naturally, I'm a bit biased when I say this is a great place for traditional sushi. �Actually, I've been to many other sushi restaurants and I think this is the BEST one in LA. 營've had better fish in only other two places, Ritz-Carlton (Kapalua, Maui) and Tsukiji Fish Market (Tokyo, Japan). �The overall price-to-quality package is GREAT! 燭he fish is fresh, the price is reasonable and the services is friendly. 燭his is also the first place I ever had toro and uni, my two favorites. 燭ry the other usual suspects...salmon, unagi, soft shell crab, fresh shrimp, albacore tune, etc. If you have a choice, sit at the bar. 燗rrive earlier because the line can be intimidating after 7:30pm don't think about it...just do it...go there...

This place has the best sushi I've ever eaten. I actually couldn't talk while I was savoring the pieces in between bites. Sit at the sushi bar for faster service from the chefs (but only recommended for 1-3 people!). Had 2 orders of toro (very very good), tuna, salmon and red snapper sashimi - and everything is just mouth-watering delicious. We had all that, and a beer for $60pp - definitely very good deal!! There is always a wait, but sushi bar waits are between 20-30 min only. The only negative about this place - it makes other sushi places taste blaaaah

Sorry folks, this place does not deserve anything over par... If one were to use one word to describe Sushi Gen's food, I think the word "standard" would be quite appropriate. 燭here really isn't anything wrong with their food. 燜ish are pretty fresh, and everything is done right, but to all honesty their sushi feels like they came out of a factory rather than prepared by sushi chefs creating them with their hearts. You know those sushi for dummies menu with pictures for different types of sushi that has both Japanese and English names? 燭hat's exactly like what Sushi Gen serves you, nothing less but nothing more either.

I had dinner here Wednesday for the first time, I had read many reviews here before. The Sashimi Deluxe platter was $35 and worth every penny. 燭here was an excellent assortment of raw fish and plenty of it. 燩lus there was ample garnish and even some smoked salmon too. 燚id I mention raw crab, octopus, king clam, tuna, shrimp and a bunch of other stuff I don't remember. The Sashimi + Tempura platter was $26 and also VERY good. 燭he Sashimi was everything on the deluxe except for the shrimp, just a slightly smaller portion. 燩lus the tempura aspect came with 2 shrimp and 3 or 4 large vegetables. The staff was very nice and pleasant and I did not have to wait for a table. Everything was very nice. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes Sashimi. 營f you're looking for "exotic" kabuki-esque rolls you probably are not in the right frame of mind for this place. 營f you're a carb watcher, this place is an excellent place too.

My long time favorite! It was here that I began my love affair with sushi and sashimi. Their sashimi lunch special is an unbeatable value. It comes with the most delicious soft tofu side that is only served during lunch with the sashimi special. Their dinner sashimi deluxe is great as well. 5 stars for their sashimi lunch and dinner sets:) The value ends there, however, as the sushi bar is pricey. The set sushi dinner is weak, with only an inferior selection. Make reservations or expect to wait even on weekdays.

Maybe the best sushi restaurant I know of in LA these days. 燤y parents used to make lunch visits often, especially when decent Japanese food was scarce back in the days. 燨n the occassion when I wasn't in school, would I be able to go with them. My usual is the broiled yellow tail collar. 燤y mom recommended it to me and I've been hooked ever since. 燭he sashimi and sushi is also some of the best quality, especially good if you're all about the raw fish and not so into the fancy fusion cut rolls.

The only reason why I'm giving Sushi Gen a four star, instead of a five star, is because they charge $1.50 for hot tea and they don't even tell you and it's not even listed on the menu. It's not a big deal if I had wanted it but to act as if it is complimentary, which is standard in most Japanese restaurants, was not nice. Case in point; the waiters/waitresses ask if you want water or tea. Obviously, you're going to think the tea is free because water is free. Other than that, the sashimi is amazing and great , great quality for the price. I would definitely recommend the sashimi lunch.

Waited about an hour for this during dinner time. 燭he whole I'm thinking, "Why is this place so popular?", "Is it worth the wait?", "Yelp loves this place". So what did I think? We tried the sashimi platter, sushi platter, all kinds salads. 燭he dressing on the salads was tangy and delicious. 燭he sashimi was fresh, the sushi was prepared excellent. 燭he moisture of the sushi rice was perfect. 燭hey did use a bit too much wasabi in some of the sushi pieces though. 燭he tempura was very... tempura-ly. 燨f course we ordered too much and didn't finish, we always do that. 營 haven't had sushi since, being forced to stuff down sashimi pieces isn't amusing. 燬ervice was great of course. It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but it's pretty darn good. 燩ricey though because our bill raised the roof. 營'd come back here if there was no wait.

Some coworkers asked if I wanted to come along for lunch. Sure! It was friday and even though I don't really eat meat with the exception of salmon, I figured I could find something to eat at Sushi-Gen. The parking lot was paid parking and incredibly small. We found a space and then joined the rest of our, party waiting outside. I think we waited for about 30 minutes before being seated. Many of my coworkers came along for the sashimi plate, so they were happy. Unfortunatly pretty much the only vegetarian option on the menu was a veggie roll. It was the same price as the sashimi plate, at $15, but I ordered it anyway. It had to be good, right? Everyone got their soups and eventually our meals showed up. Well, everyone except for the veggie rolls. We saw our waitress and asked her about the rolls and she kinda ran off. Finally, once the rest of the people had consumed about half of their meals, our veggie rolls showed up. Although the rolls were fine, they weren't special and I could have made the same item at home for probably a dollar. For me, this place was way overpriced and not worth the wait. I am glad I went along to spend time with people and not for the food.

My better half took me here as a surprise for my birthday. 燱e were both really excited since we had heard great things. 燗ll was going well, we ordered some cold sake, told the server that we would like omakase, sat back and waited for the feast that was to come. I went slack-jawed when the first thing I saw on the platter was a spicy tuna roll!?!?! 燭his was followed my sake/salmon and unagi. If McDonald's opened up an omakase joint (don't laugh, they own a patent on McSushi) I would expect this, but Sushi Gen? 營 cut my losses and didn't say anything, nothing makes a bad night worse than being the douche who castigates the server for the management's problem. I called a week later to ask WTF and the management blew me off, they politely blew me off, but I was blown off nonetheless. 燘ottom line: while the sushi is first grade, order omakase at your own risk, you will probably be disappointed.

Went here for my brothers birthday party. The sushi is good and so is the service. The only drawback is that the oysters could be better. Some people might like it creamy, but to me it tasted a little chalky. The warm sake came out hot to the touch. The sushi was fresh and good. Everything tasted good. The mochi ice cream appeared to come from a box that you can buy at trader joes or any asian suppermarket. All in all, it was a fun time there.

I just went to Sushi-Gen after a long absence. I had been going to Oomasa for a couple months and totally forgot how mind blowing Sushi-Gen is. We arrived at 5:20ish on a Wednesday (before they opened) and we weren't the first ones there. Once again, we formed a line like we were waiting to get on a ride at an amusement park... the most delicious sushi ride of our lives. We sat at the sushi bar and were greeted by our sushi chef and his mentor, whom I assume is the owner. With attention and care, our sushi chef took our order, and, in addition to the owner, asked us how each order tasted. "No soy sauce! No soy sauce!" he teased when we ate our salmon. I held up my soy sauce dish to show him that was my intention. Sushi-Gen at the sushi bar is a completely different experience than Sushi-Gen at the tables. At the bar, you can watch the incredible talent prepare your food for you, and you can interact with them. At the tables you get great food without the ambiance or attention (or fun!). So Oomasa is still really good... The fish is fresh and it is SO reasonably priced. But imagine good sushi, and then try to imagine EXTREMELY GOOD sushi... I'm talking 11 notches of goodness above good... That would be Sushi-Gen. Tuna, white tuna (butter fish), salmon, halibut, mackerel, eel, tamago, salmon skin hand rolls, scallop hand rolls, spicy tuna hand rolls... You name it, it'll blow your mind.

The company was awesome: as was the decor, still, the food left a lot to be desired. The atmosphere was a little ruined by the hovering employees and the lighting: still (or maybe because) our service from the hovering employees was prompt and they were nice enough to help me out with some extra chopsticks. Food: I was only vaguely pleased. Others seemed to enjoy it, but I found the fish to be just OK (except the fatty tuna, which I've never seen done wrong). The fishy odor was REALLY upsetting to me: I've been to enough fish markets that I don't need it to assault me in a restaurant as well. Ultimately, worth a trip if you're in the area: but not worth going out of your way.

I had an interview in Little Tokyo, and I thought I'd look up a yummy place nearby for lunch. I came all the way from San Diego, and Sushi Gen did not disappoint!! The line was so long and we barely made the cut since they close at 2pm. We were 3 minutes past closing but I begged the host to add us on and he conceded. It was a good start already... We were seated and a little rushed by the waitress, but understandable and nothing to complain about since they squeezed us in before closing. We got the Ankimo (monkfish liver) appetizer, the Sushi Deluxe and the Sashimi Deluxe. The Ankimo dish was amazing!! Great presentation, just the right amount of ingredients and garnish. YUM. The Sushi Deluxe was nothing to rave over. The Sashimi Deluxe, on the other hand, WAS AMAZING! It's presentation, quality, variation, and value were great for $30 that was well worth it. The sushi bar chefs were so funny and nice too, they kept entertaining us! They put prawn heads on their fingers and did a puppet show, and when they presented us with our Sashimi Deluxe, they all gathered and ooohed and aahhed: "Sashimi Deluxe....oooooooOOOOOhhh" They were friendly too when I kept asking what this was and what that was :) My bf and I were stuff and completely satisfied. They recommended a good sake as well. Would love to go back!

Make sure to sit at the sushi bar even though there might be a long wait and no wait for the tables. The wait is worth it!!!

Pros: fresh, large portion, cheap Cons: wait time if you come at prime time I love coming here for lunch. The best time to come is around 11:20-11:30 otherwise, be ready to wait for a table. Everytime I come, I order the sashimi lunch special. In my opinion, they give you a lot for your bucks. I never eat the rice but yet I still can't even finish my sashimi. The sashimi special comes with miso soup, rice, and appetizer (normally, braised tofu), then for the sashimi you get about 10 different items including grilled salmon, eels, tuna, squid, spicy tuna and others that I don't remember. Writing this review makes me what to go there tomorrow for lunch. *drools*

I went here for lunch because of all the reviews. 燭he regular sushi -tuna, salmon, yellowtail--was decent, but it didn't come close to what I had expected. 燱e tried the ankimo, one of my tests for a Japanese restaurant, and was very disappointed. 營t didn't taste fresh. 燤aybe they had a bad day. 燱e waited over 30 minutes. 營 don't think we'll come back unless the wait shortens. p.s. Came back here a few weeks later and waited 45 minutes because we were told we ordered the wrong dishes. 燱e got the sashimi platter and it was large and a good value. 燭his time, the fish was better and our experience was a little more aligned with the hype, but we still didn't think it was worth the wait. 燭here are comparable sushi without the wait

First time I came here was last year on a wednesday afternoon at like, 12:30. it was PACKED... but that's a good sign. It took about 20 min to get my party of 5 seated which wasn't that bad. The service there is fast but polite. We ordered, they got our food to our table quickly and made sure our water/teas were refilled AND they never rushed us. THIS is how all sushi/japanese restaurants should be like. I ordered the lunch special. Can i say that it was the Best. Lunch. I. Ever. Had. ? Yes I can. For all of those poor souls who have not eaten here yet, let me just say that this place is hyped up... but it actually meets that hype. Such few places do... The fish is so fresh and it just melts in your mouth. Everything is so good there! Even the rice. The rice is so chewy and so fragrant and so delicious! All the times I've come back to eat here, I've had NO complaints. And as of the price... 15 dollar sashimi special ftw I will be coming back again... and again.... and again......

My friend took me here. We arrived at 11:05am and there was already a line. I believe it was opened at 11:15 and we promptly were ushered in. Somewhere behind us the line was cut off and the people were told to wait a while since the restaurant was at capacity. We both ordered the sashimi plate and I soon realized that almost everybody was ordering the same thing. It came not even 5 minutes after we ordered. Boy, the chefs must have anticipated the sashimi plate order rush and armed themselves before opening the doors to us. What makes this place so famous for its sashimi plate? Well, it could be the very fresh pieces of fish, it could be the generous thick slices, it could be the colorful variety or it could be the sweetly smoked tuna, which I totally love. I should bring my husband here. He'd thank me so much. LOL

Hadn't been there in more than a decade but met a friend for lunch. 燬till a busy place with a waiting line out the door. 燭he sashimi set isn't as generous as it was but the price hasn't gone up as quickly as the market price of fish, so it is explainable. 燛verything was still top quality and fresh. 燭he service is still good but I it seemed there were fewer waiting staff. 燗s a result, the waitress forgot our rice. �I still believe Sushi-Gen offers the best sushi as it has the widest variety of seafood and it is fresh. 營t can do this because it is always busy and does't have to risk as much in terms of spoilage. 燭he only place in LA which was better was Sushi-Co but that cost $250 per person back in the mid 1980's and has since moved to NY. �I'd like to find a place locally that offers live fish kept in tanks which i experienced in my travel to Japan.

Okay. The word 'Sushi Gen' makes me salivate......so I don't think I need to type any further to describe this fine establishment. Introduced to this Little Tokyo sushi joint by a good friend who works and dines in Downtown LA, I am happy to call this my favorite place to eat sushi. Definately do try the Yellowtail and Red Snapper (sashimi, of course). The soft shell crab is to die for and the albacore sushi, as always, is fantastic. Arguably the best stuff in LA. Always crowded in the evenings - so arrive earlier than expected as wait times are long. But nonetheless, definately worth it. If you like sushi - this is a must.

As a long time sushi-gen patron, I can tell you the rants about the wait is no joke! Get there early or die!! .... from hunger A few tips (aside from early arrival): If you're planning to sit at the sushi bar, and you've got the patience, ask to be served by the head sushi chef! He's really nice, and you'll get the best cuts because the sushi sensei gets first pick on the fish. If not, don't fret. They'll never have bad fish with their rate of turnover. Can't make it early? Be prepared for some rejection. Hamachi Kama (Yellowtail Collar) and some other items may be sold out for the night. The best bang for your buck is the dinner special, but that's usually some kind of teriyaki or fried fish. Personally, I'm not a teriyaki kind of girl but if that your thing, go for it! For more adventurous eaters, I'd recommend the following: - Ankimo (Monkfish Liver): very fresh! yum yum. - Mozuku Tororo (Yam with Seaweed): Light, great texture, try this!! I don't see this dish too often. It may not be shown on the menu, but your server will know - Hamachi Kama (Yellowtail Collar): If the HK is sold out, a good substitution is the Yellowtail Head. Both sold out? sucks for you :P jk. I'm sure their other fish dishes are excellent, but they wont beat the Hamachi. - Uni (Sea Urchin): Very sweet - Fatty Yellowtail: !! you must try this. mmm so good. I'd def pick this over their toro. The last 2 times I had their toro, it was pretty disappointing. Stringy toro rubs me the wrong way. Haven't had these in a while, but worth a try - Giant Clam - Sweet Shrimp

WARNING: If you "like sushi" (CA-Philly-Tiger-Crunch rolls with the cream cheese goops) please don't eat here, and please stop claiming that you enjoy sushi. Not that I don't enjoy those above rolls, but Sushi-Gen is the real McCoy. 燭he fish cuts are always fresh and of high quality. Their Maguro (fatty tuna) and Amaebi (sweet shrimp) are SO incredibly rich, it's, dare I say, orgasmic. Of course, for the authentic sushi experience, I'd sit at the bar. The sushi chefs are the best, so entertaining and welcoming, and the older veteran chefs always recognize a regular. I always come here with my dad every once in a while (we eat about $90 worth of sushi...serious business, not your daily fast food). We always find ourselves starting convos with the people around us and it's great. One thing I absolutely love about Sushi-Gen is that at the bar, they give you the fish. They don't fatten it up with way too much rice to fill you up. Any other average sushi restaurant will do that and make you full so you can't enjoy the amount of fish you probably could. Even if you don't sit at the bar, you can order the most amazing sashimi combinations--my jaw drops at the whenever I see the colorful plate of raw goodness ready to be served elsewhere in the restaurant. Just go. Order whatever you want. So, so good.

This is my favorite sushi place in LA. Although I'm sure it's not the best, but since it's close to my house, has great sushi, friendly sushi chefs, and reasonable price, I would give it 5 stars anytime. If you are feeling adventurous and don't have any food restriction, definitely sit at the sushi bar and ask for the omakase (chef's choice). Depending on how much you eat, but normally it would cost you about $50 - $60 per person. I did it a couple of times and was always provided with the greatest and the freshest ingredients. One time the chef brought out a special type of ika (it's seasonal and smaller than the regular ika) and it was so delicious I asked for a second, but then he said he ran out since he gave me the last one. One suggestion, don't even bother sitting at the table unless you have a large party. I always get better quality sushi when I sit at the sushi bar.

This very well could be the best sushi in California. I've never had any that's better. I live nearby and I walk by this place often and usually see people waiting outside. For some reason, I've been lucky and have been able to walk right up and get seated. 營f I've had to wait, it was a short wait. Their lunch specials are very reasonable (it's actually a steal for the quality of fish that they give you). 營 recommend the chirashi sushi for lunch.

A week day around 12pm, already a crap load of people outside waiting. Had to wait 45 min for a table (but it was al worth it). You could also sit at the bar but they do not offer lunch specials at the bar. Sashimi lunch is usually what I go for. It has tuna, toro, yellow tail, octopus, grilled salmon, spicy tuna and some misc. Generous portion and delicious if you asked me, and at $15 it is well priced. They have an outdoor parking lot ($3) or you can opt for street parking ($4 for 2 hours). The hype is very real.

Aside from the long waits (even if you go before it opens), Sushi Gen doesn't disappoint during lunch time. 營 have tried the Chirashi and Sashimi sets. 燜or $15, thats relatively inexpensive for Japanese food. 燗nd they give you sooo much food. 燡ust look at the photos! �I try to eat here whenever I'm in the downtown area on a weekday, which is not very often. 燭he fish is fresh and everything else is delightful. If you are around Little Tokyo and have two hours for lunch, its well worth it. 營f you have less time for lunch, you'll need to show up at 11 (Sushi-Gen opens at 11:15), or you'll probably need to wait half an hour since people line up early. �Also, parking is $1.50 with validation for two hours. �I haven't been here for dinner yet, but I expect the plates to be relatively more expensive with the same portions.

Only been here for their lunch menu. My mom took me to this place after hearing a raving review from a client of hers. Supposedly, her client does sushi import business and she said Sushi Gen imports quality fish. When I hear restaurants using quality food, I get over-hyped before even trying their dish and sometimes, come out disappointed, which was not the case for Sushi Gen. Their Sashimi Combo platter was amazing! It was not the typical Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail dish like other Japanese restaurants. This place was an authentic sit down quality restaurant with real Japanese dish. They served slices of quality tuna slices, thick and fresh, along with other flavorful dish that I have never tried before. It's hard to explain what they were but it was really good. The dish also came along with miso, rice, and something like a seaweed salad. The ambiance felt like you were in an actual Japanese restaurant. Portraits of Sumo wrestlers and Japanese employees. It had a good vibe. The line can get lengthy at times and they do not take reservations, but if you have the time, I believe it is all worth it. Overall, this place gets my vote as the best Sushi restaurant for lunch.

Go at all costs. 燛specially if you love sushi, but don't want to spend over 150$/pp. 營f you really want to do it right... sit under the head sushi chefs and order the omakase... it is mind blowingly delicious. 燭heir cuts drape over the rice and you can ask them to make all their cuts on the belly, the area which, of course, is the most tasty :) Toro (always orgasmic) Halibut Fin (my new favorite cut of sushi) Giant Clam Hamachi Belly Kanpachi Uni (some of the best i've had) Aji Sweet shrimp (they'll deep fry the heads for you, this is my favorite part) Saba Fresh Water eel Quality and freshness is the creed here along with expert cutting... you really will not regret it and for good sushi it won't destroy your pocketbook. 燝o on a Tuesday if you can... since most of the Japanese chefs in the LA area go to the fish market on Monday... but I will go here any day of the week. 燫emember to eat your ginger between orders!

Everyone needs to be there or else they won't seat you. Don't worry - you don't have to wait long. Their door opens at 11:15. 燗nd shh... this is a secret - but they do take reservations for lunch.

I remember loving Kabuto in San Francisco a whole lot (they have grilled unagi sushi and very, very innovative choices like fresh pear w/ mustard/curry on top of hamachi sushi... you can order 1 pieces instead of the standard 2, also, so you can try a lot of stuff)... but tonight, Sushi Gen is at the top of my list.

I planned a little surprise birthday dinner here for my boyfriend with six other friends, and it was probably the best decision I've ever made as far as dinner/birthday/sushi decisions go. Why I chose Sushi-Gen: my boyfriend is the biggest sushi nut I have ever encountered. I wanted to take him to enjoy some authentic, delicious, fancier-than-normal sushi, and Yelp showed me that Sushi-Gen was the only way to go. 650+ reviews, a 4.5 rating, photos showing delicious sashimi and a recommendation from a friend saying that Sushi-Gen has "the freshest fish she has ever tasted" got me hook, line and sinker. I was incredibly eager to try this place out. The week leading up to the dinner, I kept stalking Yelp photos of the sashimi dinner plate, waiting in anticipation! Why I recommend Sushi-Gen for its service: our reservation was for 8PM on a busy Saturday night, and we were all running late (I had to stall a lot since my friends were late too!), but all eight of us were seated right away and the restaurant was very accommodating of our party. Our server was FANTASTIC and so very cute and smiley and polite and came to check on us periodically despite the busyness. They also gave my boyfriend a delicious green tea ice cream dessert for his birthday. Also, I had to call and change my reservation plans four times and probably caused a lot of trouble... but everything still went so smoothly! Thank you, Sushi-Gen host... I forgot your name :( Why I recommend Sushi-Gen for its food: the fish literally melted in my mouth. It was so fresh, so tasty, so soft, so melty, so delicious and heavenly... I ordered the Chirashi Deluxe, most others ordered the Sushi Deluxe, and my boyfriend ordered the amazing Sashimi Dinner. My order was basically the Sashimi Dinner but with all the rice lumped together and all the amazing fish placed on top. I highly recommend the Sashimi Dinner, though. Just look at the photos and you will be similarly enticed. Oh! And they had good Kirin beer and sake. The food is a tad pricey, yes, but it is DEFINITELY worth it, because the portions are large and the fish is so, so, so satisfying. I can't wait to go back.

In my opinion little Tokyo has the best sushi restaurants in la! Sushi Gen falls in that category of such said! First of all they're clam Miso soup is dangerously good!! full of clams and a heavy bonito flavor, i love it! Came her with a friend and ordered the sashimi deluxe platter, it was a display of beauty so many different sea creatures on one plate! My friend and I just stared and marveled at it for a while, I had no idea of what a few items were on our plate, Those were the things I ate first, lll figure it out and edit my review. All the fish were fresh and pretty tender with the exception of one cut, i enjoyed the seared salmon a lot I thought it was a nice contrast to all the raw items, the salmon sashimi was butter soft and that square fish thing was delicious. I also thought the octopus was real good, most of the time its always chewy in the sushi joints, sushi gens was nice & tender, I felt the same way about the clam as well.

The fish is very fresh here and everyone from the sushi chefs to the water boys are friendly and always seem so darn happy to see you. The price is medium range and this is where you come if you're a true sushi/sashimi lover. 營t is definitely not a real roll place...which is perfect for me, but some people who like those fancy rolls with artsy names & caterpillar heads sticking out of one end, this is not the place for you. 燤ost you'll get as a roll is the standard Tekka/Kappa maki, spicy tuna roll, california roll and salmon skin roll. �I "heard" that there was this awesome lunch special where you get miso soup, salad and a preset assortment of sushi/sashimi for a great price. 燬o I went one day at lunch time. 燭here was a line of 20 people waiting for the doors to open in front of me. 燨nce we got in, I was the ONLY person sitting at the bar. 燩retty much everyone came for this lunch special. 燘y the time I left an hour later, maybe five people were sitting at the bar but there was a line of people still waiting to be seated at a table for the lunch special. The only thing I wish they did have was reservations, but this place is 1st come, 1st served only.

One of those places that's so damn special you don't want to review it, but the secret was out long ago. Sushi Gen is one of LA's best sushi spots. It's right next to Kagaya (another fave) in Honda Plaza, it's fairly small, and it's pretty perfect. I prefer Sushi Gen to the 818 sushi temples (Nozawa, Katsu-ya, Kazu) because there's no attitude and the fish is...a little weirder. In Little Tokyo you will get a more exotic range of choices & that we love. Masa, the head sushi chef, is a master and a very nice guy. Please try to leave us room at the bar!!

My first time here and the wait is out the door, but thanks to Lorena I didn't have to wait more than a minute. So they have this lunch special for $15 which I have posted a pic with. I think it is a great price and is filling. The fish was definitely fresh. I guess next up would be checking out this place during dinner time one of these days. This place was packed and looking very Japanese inside with the typical decor. It was well lit and the servers were eager to get your orders out for you. And which parking lot can beat $1.50 for lunch. Though when i got there the parking lot was ful.

Oh man. Oh man oh man oh man. I don't think words could adequately express the quality of the sushi here. The fish is so fresh and tender, it literally melts in your mouth. I don't know if it's placebo effect or whatever, but even the sushi rice tastes incredible. I could just eat the sushi rice (chirashi, anyone?) and I'd be content. Many of their cuts are incredibly delicious, but of special note is the Japanese snapper. They treat it with a tiny pile of yuzu peppers and a dash of lemon. Absolutely incredible. I frankly have no clue how badly the snapper raped my wallet (no prices are listed on their sushi list and I didn't want to sound like a stingy bastard so I never asked...but ignorance is bliss), but I don't care if I have to shell out a hundred bucks for just one morsel of that stuff. Their albacore tuna is also pretty amazing. They give it a liberal treatment of ponzu and dress it up with some green onions, all of which makes for a very delectable party in your mouth. The waiters/waitresses/front-desk-dude weren't that great though. Very impersonal. Hostile, almost. We were largely ignored by them...but I guess it didn't matter in the end, since we were sitting at the bar anyway. Speaking of which, the sushi chefs were very amiable. They didn't rush us at all. They worked efficiently, but a huge amount of attention went into every order as well. All in all, after blindly ordering sushi left and right, the damage came out to be $92 + tax + tip for two. We had roughly the same number of orders (7 each), but I had more expensive orders on my side. Worth the price? Undoubtedly.

I've now been to Sushi Gen at least ten times. 燗lthough it's not amazing, it is certainly one of the most consistent and reasonable sushi bars in LA. 燗nd that, in my opinion, makes it unique. There are too many sushi bars to count now. 燘ut I can say, Sushi Gen is one place where you'll always find a good variety of fish, good/very good quality of fish, and reasonable prices. 燭his last time, I had tai with lemon juice and salt (very good belly cut) , kanpachi (tail end cut - not my fave), tako, iwashi, aji, marinated sanma (not my fave - I really like this fresh while it's in season during the fall, but I was glad to see they had it), akami (bluefin) and two types of toro - one slice each of Canadian chu-toro and Boston o-toro. 燭he Boston o-toro was unbelievable. 燗lthough a little sinewy because it was real o-toro from the center of the belly, the meat had the this unbelievable firm, yet fatty and rich texture that I haven't had in a long time. �This is why you go to Sushi Gen. 燗lthough they sometimes have Yellowfin Tuna, they almost always have Bigeye or Bluefin. 燗nd the tuna is high quality. 燱hile you can go to many other places to get the same farm raised fishes (i.e. east coast fluke aka hirame, salmon, hamachi), Sushi Gen has the real stuff. P.S. - All of this for about $40, including soup to end.

My bf took me here yesterday for dinner to celebrate. With reservations, we waited about 5 minutes tops. He ordered the sashimi deluxe (came with tempura) and I got the chirashi. When our orders came, I realized why we don't come here that often (besides the fact it's pricier than other places); there's no salmon pieces. Well, there's a piece of cooked salmon on his deluxe, but that doesn't count. As for my chirashi, I remembered it to have more pieces of fish. However, overall, the service was great and the quality was close to excellent (my toro was lacking a bit of flavor and my minced tuna was a bit fishy). Would I come again? Yes, but not anytime soon.

My brother is a wholesaler for fresh seafood so i get to eat everything from king crab, hamachi, uni to sweet shrimp. yes, i wanted to brag. :) My brother took me to Sushi Gen, and the reason why i never go with the mother is because she hates waiting. My brother is a big critique on seafood, and he says this place is very fresh. It is very fresh, and i think that's the most important part of sushi or sashimi.

No frills, just awesome food. I wouldn't even call this place pricey -- the last time I was there, I ate my fill of sashimi and was out for about $25-$30, which seems pretty reasonable for a top-notch sushi spot. I mean, even crappy sushi will set you back a minimum of $20/person. Don't waste your time with rolls -- just go straight for the sashimi. It's all killer, so just order what you like. Atmosphere is terrible, so I wouldn't recommend it as a date place unless you are out with a major foodie.

On the recommendations of everyone, the BF and I came to eat some of Nemo's buddies. 燛verything raw on the sashimi plate was some variation of tuna. 燭hey had some good stuff, and the amount of food you get will fill you up. 燞owever, the toro I was given was horrible - didn't-even-finish-it-bad! 燘F ordered the sashimi again (he first had a pricey box of rice and fresh eel). 燭he second time around, the toro was much better - you could see a HUGE color/quality difference, which makes me wonder why his toro was ten times better than mine. Lunch special for a full plate of sashimi is $15. 營t's an EXCELLENT deal considering the abundance and freshness of the fish. 燘ut then you factor in tax/tip and parking ($1.50 validated), and your LUNCH comes out to much more than what I would consider to be a "value meal." 營f it was mind-blowingly good (Toros in Alhambra anyone?), I would be back and maybe splurge for dinner. 燘ut as it was not, I'll stick to Fish-o-Filet Fridays for my Omega-3s.

Lunch time on a wednesday and there was about a 15 minute wait. No problem. Once we were seated I noticed how the inside looked so much bigger than it appears outside. As soon as I opened the menu, one of the waitresses came to ask if we were ready to order. She was on it! I had the chirashi and my friend had spicy tuna and eel. Her spicy tuna was really good and it had tiny pieces of chile in there to spice it up. Now that i think of it, i should have ordered one of the lunch specials with something and sashimi. Next time. The service was really friendly and fast. The parking in the lot is about �2 or so with validation but parking is very scarce in the little plaza. True rating would be about a 3.5 but I will round up in anticipation of next time ordering something else and maybe it being better!

What I found beautiful about this visit was witnessing their attention to detail and tradition. 燘eing the 2nd to last customer placed onto the waiting list at 1:50 pm for a 2pm closing, by the time we were finishing our meal around 3:30pm, we watched the cleanup of the front kitchen. 燛very knife is sharpened by one chef, washed by a second, and slowly hand dried, inspected and polished by a third. 燛very step was performed with the utmost care. 燭he entire front kitchen is scrubbed head to toe as if it were the end of the day, but they are merely just closing from lunch. 燱hat was already seemingly spotless was made more spotless. 燬eeing the adherence to tradition, procedure, and greatest of care makes me respect this institution. 營 now understand why they have been around for ages and with great success. Now onto the food. It's been a few years since I've been to Sushi Gen for lunch. 燗fter a 2-3 hiatus, I've found that the legendary high quality sashimi used in the lunch items are gone. 燙osts have increased and green tea is a charged item now. The fish is no longer the choiciest cuts, not longer sinew free, and no longer the freshest, but make no mistake the fish they serve is acceptable. 燱hat hasn't changed is their attention to detail and quality of all their other non-fish items. 爐heir rice is still immaculately perfect and every part of your chirashi still has the same attention as before.

In about a two-week stretch, I've tried two of the most highly rated sushi joints in the Little Tokyo area and I've had very different and yet eerily similar experiences at both. 燯nlike Restaurant Komasa, we were promptly seated here (table for 2). Several nigiri were simply top-notch and we actually ended up ordering more to finish our meal. These were: �- Ami Ebi (Sweet Shrimp, bodies nigiri-style with the heads deep fried, mm-mm good) - The Yellowtail, Konpachi, Unagi, and Scallop Nigiri were all very tasty. Much of the other nigiri was just okay, nothing earth-shattering (like the Salmon, Tuna). The 燨yster (wrapped with seaweed, blech) was one item I actually had to force down and would not recommend. 燭here was also another roll that we got that was just not very pleasant. 營 also don't think that I would order the Spicy Tuna Roll or Uni again here. The impression I have right now is that Sushi-Gen has more variability (taste-wise) in their food (more highs and more lows as well). 燭he stuff that's good is really good, but there is just stuff that I didn't care for. 燯nfortunately, I don't think I'd drive out for either of them.

The sushi is so delicious! It is one of the places I always come back to even though it's about 30 miles away from my house. So whenever the opportunity arises when I am in LA, I'm sooo there. *Of all the times I've been to Sushi-Gen, I rather sit at the bar than the booths simply because the sushi comes out immediately for you. BUT feel free to go to the booth if you want to order a meal AND/OR sushi (it'll just take a slightly longer time before the sushi comes out). *The sushi chefs are really helpful, especially if you ask them for assistance on what they would recommend. (Note: Do not ask for what is the freshest fish of the day is because you are indirectly saying that some of their fishes reek. Now we know that happens a lot...but let the chef feel more respected and he will be glad to help you.) *An advice from me would be to make sure either you have a reservation OR come early before they open because-- TRUST ME-- the line can get loooooong. It won't be too long before the entire restaurant fills up with hungry people. Happy eating! :D

I love this place! For real sushi/sashimi lovers only! Do not come here for a romantic setting or elegant interior. This is a place to get great, fresh sushi at an authentic Japanese restaurant. First, make a reservation. The wait is usually long. Parking can also be a headache if the small parking lot is full and street parking is nowhere to be found. As a back up, I would just park in the Japanese Village Plaza parking structure and walk. Environment: Bright lights. Good service. Simple menu. Definitely not a romantic or intimate setting. The small dining room is always packed and noisy. They have a sushi bar available, but I have never sat there. Food: Their sushi and sashimi is amazing. Their sushi dinner is pretty large and has a great variety of fresh and tasty sushi. The hamachi (yellowtail) sashimi is so fresh and soft, it practically melts in your mouth. They also have yellowtail belly which is the fattier version and was just as amazing (I believe a bit more expensive). Their sake (salmon) sashimi is so sweet and tasty that nothing compares to it. All other sushi after Sushi Gen will be such a disappointment. Warning - kinda pricey! Remember, you're paying for quality! If you want a cheap sushi dinner where quality is not a concern, I'd recommend Kabuki.

What's the hype all about?

The good: the sushi and sashimi is pretty decent. 燭he prices are fair. The bad: fugly decor, horrible ambiance in the general area (tiny shopping center with tiny parking spots) and a parking attendant that hates life, hates his family and hates you! Go to Fisherman's Village just north of here (much larger center). 燭here are several sushi places in this center that are far better than Sushi Gen and you're less likely to get mugged/stabbed/spit on in the sketchy parking lot of the beloved (??)

I have been to this place twice now. The first time I was seriously not impressed but I came back recently and wow was I wrong. This place has catapulted to the top of my list for sushi places in the Los Angeles area. I was instructed to get there early because it gets filled up fast. I showed up and parked in the plaza parking lot. It costs money but its not bad at $2.50. Don't forget to get your ticket validated or else you will have to pay more. When I walked in, I noticed that it was indeed a small place, so I'm glad I got there early. Luckily, we were sat immediately. I don't know much about sushi, so upon the recommendation of a friend, I decided to get the sashimi dinner. I was a bit worried about the portion size because I was hella hungry, but boy was I wrong. It was a ton of food. The meal starts off with both soup and salad. Then comes the actual sashimi which is a good portion and extremely fresh. But thats not it! It also comes with five pieces of tempura, which are perfectly fried. I eat alot and there was no way I could finish the meal. The price is noticeably more than other sushi places, but you are paying for better quality and bigger portions.Trust me and just go. Cost: $116 for 4 sashimi dinners

I love sushi and try to check out most sushi restaurants. 燗fter a string of bad sushi eats, I always need to go back to the roots and check out Sushi Gen. A true Los Angeles staple in Japanese food, it is owned by Master Sushi Chef Toyashima. 燭he frail, old Japanes sushi chef barely takes a day off and always treats his customers with the utmost respect. 燞is work ethic trickles down to the other sushi chefs, waiters, and even the hosts. 燭he fish is ALWAYS fresh and the toro is to die for. 營 know the fish wholesaler he gets his fish from and when I heard of his dedication, it was like hearing that Jessica Alba can cook as well. He is the first one at the fish market EVERY MORNING to get the best pick of the day's catch. 燞e hand picks his stock guaranteeing the highest quality of fish. The owner of American Fish has clients coming in from Japan and takes them exclusively to Sushi Gen to showcase the quality of fish on the west coast. 燬ushi chefs worldwide recognize Sushi Chef Toyashima as a master at his craft and an icon in the art of raw cuisine. Well worth the price, although its almost always crowded.

Freshest fish this side of the water! Oh man, I think this is the best sushi I've ever had. I sat @ the bar, which has a four order per person minimum and does not have the full dinner menu available, but who needs it when you have sushi this good. The presentation is somewhat pedestrian, but the friendly sushi chef's are very personable and entertaining. It's a bit pricey, but not the priciest out there. I spent about $100 per person, and that was with only two alcoholic drinks per person. The Japanese Red Snapper was something I will always remember! There are a few parking spaces in the plaza, otherwise, park down the street at the Little Tokyo Plaza parking (about $4).

It's just one of those places that I can't find up here in the bay area, much to my disappointment of my stomach. �Ok, so my friends and I have this system. We all sit at the bar (always!)and try to order so that we each have one piece per order, so that we can try more different kinds of fish, got it? But that's neither here nor there. Anyhow, this is what we ordered: - salmon: get this w/the seaweed on top and sesame seeds. trust me, it's damn good. - japanese snapper: with lemon and salt only. don't dip in soy. yum. - kanpachi: this tasted like a mix of yellowtail and halibut - very tasty. - sea urchin: so buttery. so good. spanish mackerel, scallop, yellowtail, fatty tuna, sweet shrimp (get the fried heads), unagi. All of it was good. Never noticed a fishy smell to the place but I probably fixated on what fish I wanted to order first ... One thing I don't really understand here is ... sometimes you'll be given this free appetizer before you start ordering and sometimes you don't. What test do I need to pass to get this every time and not some of the time?? It's mountain yam sliced julienne atop some seaweed mixed in a light soy/vinegar broth. It has the consistency of snot but aside from that, it's quite tasty. I would have given 5 stars but I took one away since the prices seem to have increased since the last time I was there. And the wait can literally kill you if you're really hungry.

All I gotta say is the sashimi is like butter baby! Sushi-Gen is located in the Honda Plaza on 2nd street in Little Tokyo. 營've only visited this place during lunch because they have great lunch combos! 營 usually get the chicken teriyaki and sashimi combo, but have tried their salmon teriyaki too. 燚epending on what combo you get you could end up spending ($15-$20), but it's a good price for the amount of food they give you. 燭hey give you miso soup, pickled cabbage, and tofu to start. 燭he teriyaki/cooked items are a decently sized portion, but they are pretty average in flavor - tastes good, but it is nothing to rave about. 燭he sashimi includes 9 pieces of three different kinds of fish - tuna, yellow-tail, and snapper. 燭he fish they use here is great...very fresh and very tasty. 燣ike I said before - it's like butter baby! You don't have to come here during lunch, but I have a feeling it can get pretty pricey during dinner. 營've eaten at the sushi bar and it does cost more than ordering a lunch combo. 燡ust a tip if you decide to sit at the bar - you have to order a minimum of 4 sushi items and you can't order the lunch combos. 營 爉ust say that I did enjoy the spicy tuna cut roll! 營'm telling you the fish is awesome here! This place gets pretty crowded during the lunch hour. 燩eople wait in line starting at 11am, to get in to the restaurant that opens at 11:15/11:30. 營f you come later, expect to wait 20-30minutes (but I've waited longer before). 燜or the quality and price it is definitely worth the wait! 燩lus Yogurtland is just across the street. �see my review on Yogurtland)

Ordering straight off the menu can be the kiss of death at a sushi place, but in all honesty why? 營 don't have to tell the chef at a French restaurant what kinds of meat I like. 燙ertainly sushi is best when you've created a rapport with the chef making it, but Sushi Gen has shown me the glowering hole that is table service at all too many sushi places. It's not that any of the fish was bad, it's just that other than my wife telling me her toro was fantastic, this place was no better than any of a hundred of other sushi dinners I've had around LA. 燜ish was fresh but boring. 燤y sashimi dinner was half tuna pieces of varying sizes in three separate areas on my plate--not including the spicy tuna. The price wasn't as high as I'd expected, but I won't be going back anytime soon. 營f the other four or five places in the area don't hold up I'll just skip sushi in Little Tokyo all together. Again, not bad, just not special.

Garbage, this place is so overrated and overcrowded, fish is not fresh, likely frozen and chefs pump out orders. Sat at bar, witnessed plate after plate of lunch special get rolled out assembly line style, pieces from their actually looked fresher than the ones served at the bar. As a tip it is a safe bet to order either the lunch special (available only for patrons seated at a table) or the fish that is served in the lunch special (tuna). Here is what I had: Tai (red snapper)- tasteless and watery likely frozen no bite Ika (squid)- frozen pre cut variety taste was fine Anago (sea eel) - well cooked overly sauced Shima Aji (spanish mackeral) - poorly marinated, sloppy skin removal, tasted like mush Kanpachi (amberjack) - better tasting than other pieces, still missed that snap usually found in the fish Hotate (fresh scallop) - It was from a live scallop, so you'd think it would be good, instead of sushi was served sashimi style as this is the way it is done here with presentation on shell, so cheesy, anyway super thin slices and use of lemon between each could not mask the poor quality and fishiness that should not present Chefs are butchers as I witness an order for albacore passed on to an assistant who proceeded to destroy the fish in creating the order. Gristly pieces were apparent from my vantage point and the assistant also decided it would be wise to cut the fish five different ways when the original manner did not work. NOT GOOD... Service was also meh, likely based on the crowds, but tea should be refilled (especially when servers frequent the area and notice the empty glass rather than bumping into when taking orders to table). Cooked dishes looked fair, yellowtail collar was a nice portion that looked properly cooked, i.e. not overcooked. Sushi here is for those happy to pay half price for mediocre fish rather than spending more for a true experience and proper taste. It also suits the crowd who prefers to drown their fish in soy sauce laced with gobs of wasabi paste, creating more of a chinese spicy mustard dip (commonly seen in at least a third or the patrons here), whose sauce ends up masking the inferior fish served here.

We were really hungry and in a rush because baby was sleeping. We decided to go for the bar instead of wait and I'm so glad we did. Fish served at the tables is excellent, but I think that they reserve some of the extra special cuts for the bar. When you are willing to shell out a little more, do it. For example: Got the Scallop sushi at the bar. Seasoned just right with lemon and sea salt, it was so much better than the same order I received at a table. Also, get the Toro. OMG. I had a flashback of Tsukiji. Tip: I have a better experience with the chefs in the middle area. I do not mean to disparage any of the other chefs but the older guy and the lean handsome chefs in the middle were so good to us. The perfect combination of friendly and hard core.

Jermaine Dupri once said, "Fresh, like a million bucks (throw on the Bally shoes and the fly green socks)." That's what Sushi Gen gives you - fresh sashimi and fresh service. I came here on a weeknight and did not experience a wait (which was surprising given the experience of other people). We were seated almost immediately, and the wait staff was extremely welcoming, friendly, and timely. Our drinks were almost always topped off. Everything on the menu appeared appetizing, and I settled for the sashimi combination, to get a sufficient sampling of goodies. It was melt-in-your-mouth legitimate. I would warn that parking in the area is slightly limited. While Sushi Gen is located in a plaza with a parking lot, if it is full, street parking is often difficult to get.

Great if you can get a seat at the counter. 燬ometimes there is a wait, but it is much more fun than sitting at a table unless there is a secret conversation you want to have, the sushi chefs may harass you and your guest which is the best part as everyone becomes a family and drinks together!! Their fish is superb and I would trust it over any other restaurant. �I love Kazu-san and Toyo-san as they're always so friendly and if you are unsure of what you'd like they will make you something 爕ou will love. 燭he atmosphere is a party all the time! 營t is pricey but it is so worth it!

Favorite sushi place. I've been coming here for as long as i can remember. My grandpa was absolutely in love with this place and really only comes here for sashimi. Closest he's found to the real thing having spent most of his youth in japanese occupied taiwan and having traveled to japan several times. My best memories from childhood are the journeys we had to take to travel from the valley to this place to get here at lunch opening. First ones in line all the time!! I still come here but since my grandpa's passing not as often as we use to. The place basically your typical sushi place. They have a couple tatami rooms for the more "authentic feel" its the ones with the hole for your legs...those make me giggle. I've always gotten the Sashimi plate. I don't know what its called my grandma usually order in japanese, but its the freshest fish I've gotten. Really good quality and a good portion. Comes with miso soup, rice, and pickled cucumbers. Never ventured farther than that. Never needed to. It's always busy. Especially at lunch hour on any weekday (hence, the lining up). The people are very nice but they are always so busy. 燫eally nice, made us happy :) I would love this place even if the food sucked. But it doesn't. so go! and enjoy! you'll make the gramps happy :)

Ok, this is by far the best sushi/sashimi restaurants that I have ever tried. Enough said!!! So now the review: Food is amazing, you cant go wrong in this place. Every plate is full of flavor. It is pricy compared to other japanese restaurants around (but worth every penny!!). It can get crowded and sometimes you have to wait 30-60 mins for a table (but worth every second!!). Staff is super friendly and cordial. They have private parking or you can park on the street (if you are lucky to find a spot). This place is great and if you like japanese cuisine, you should definitely try this place...promise you are not going to be disappointed.

I have been hearing about this place for quite some time now. 營 was really excited to finally get a seat at the sushi bar with my girlfriend. 燱e were seated right away at the bar and noticed the massive staff they have on hand. 爐he restaurant was a good temperature with nice decor including large fresh flowers on the sushi bar and warm tones throughout the restaurant. 燿id i mention the staff was huge? 爐here were no less than 8 sushi chefs and about 4 other "helpers" behind the bar. �update: i am writing this later on in the evening the very evening we ate at sushi gen. 爉y girlfriend and i have now been suffering hours of pain in our stomach and we have no doubt it was from the fish at the restaurant. 爓e eat sushi at least twice a week and sometimes three times 燼 week, so our bodies are very used to raw fish. 爄 have never had pain like this from sushi. 爏o i really don't think i can return. 爄 don't really blame the restaurant for this and the food did taste good but some thing got us. 爐hat is all i am saying for now . . . �the food: the fish was very clean and served up instantly by a very courteous chef who was extremely pleasant to share our time with. 爓e enjoyed Japanese red snapper, salmon, yellow tail, albacore, blue fin and a few hand rolls. �i believe 7 orders of sushi and a hand roll with 2 green teas came out to $42 w/o tip. 爊ot bad for good fish. 燽ack to the fish . . . i felt the cuts were a little thick for my taste. 燼lmost a sashimi sized cut on the sushi. 爐his could very well be a plus for many but for me it took away from the texture a bit. 爐he sushi was served a slightly chilled temperature which i appreciate (not cold!!) and the ginger and wasabi portions very large from the start. �overall i felt this place was very good and the atmosphere was extremely pleasant with a very authentic feel. 爐he staff were amazing and we were in and out with a great meal in 30 minutes due the speed of the chefs and the restaurant was packed. 燞owever, it is not the best I have had which is what I was expecting from the reviews here on Yelp. 燞owever, it could have just been the fish for the day. 營 will go back.

I've been coming here for years with the family since this is my parents' favorite sushi place. Coming here is always a feast for us. Their prices are on the higher end of the scale but definitely worth it. I highly recommend just getting the sashimi combo for lunch or dinner. The fish is so fresh and the quality is pretty good that the fish just melt in your mouth. Their Unagi Bowl is good also if you like eel. However, as much as I love this place, I have to subtract one star due to the high price and some inconveniences with this place. Like mentioned in the other reviews, parking is painful and the wait is long. So painful that everytime I come here I ask myself why I endure this suffering and still come back. Make sure come here early when they open so you can line up and get in early to avoid the rush, or you have to be strategic and come here after the first round of crowd has finished eating and get in as part of the second round. They are really strict with their business hours, and they will turn you away and not put you on the waiting list if you arrive after their lunch time.

Not satisfied, I felt ripped off. Maybe I am in the minority here. 燘ut has anybody else had the Deluxe Chirashi for $15 before? I ordered the Deluxe Chirashi since I wanted to get a sampler, and everything in the bowl was cheap - cheap - cheap. The main fish was a couple of slices of cooked octopus and maybe 4 better peices - a couple of pieces of tuna and a couple of pieces of whitefishbut the rest was filler - a few chunks of seasoned radish, powdered pink sugar, tamago shavings, and not much else. When I had asked the waitress what was in the Chirashi, she would not tell me just saying several fresh picks of the fish of the day. 燬he was too busy to come back around after a table cleaner delivered the Chirashi bowl to me. So essentially for $15 + tax and tip, you are getting about 4 small better peices of fish for $3 each and another $3 for a couple of peices of octopus. Next time I guy, I will have to try sushi directly from the sushi menu and pay their high price - but at least I will know what I am getting. I would opt to go to Hide Sushi in West Los Angeles on Sawtelle which in my opinion is equal in quality and better priced.

If you like #1 stuff like me, you come to sushi gen. The quality of their sushi is one the highest in town, and their price is very fair for the quality of you get. Im more a quality over quantity type of person. Their portions are actually pretty good. The only better sushi place in LA is urasawa and be ready to spend anywhere from 300-500 dollars if you choose to dine there. The other alternative is sushi gen where you can order a plate and be satisfied for about 30 dollars. I tend to seat at the sushi bar, because the wait is shorter and i dont really order their plates anymore. Been coming here almost 5 years now. The past year i was visiting sushi gen almost every friday. Their spicy tuna is so delicious, it never gets old.

This has been a long time coming, really. 營n actuality, it's a travesty I didn't review this restaurant first. 燭his, to me, is the penultimate experience in sushi in the greater los angeles area. 營 don't mean just in little Tokyo, I mean in the entire LA county. 燱hile I can't claim to have tried every top flight sushi restaurant (urasawa is gonna be for a special occasion in the future), I have been eating sushi for 15+ years, up and down California, and without a doubt, sushi gen is my go to spot. 燱hen someone asks me what I feel like eating at any given time, its sushi gen. 營 have brought all of my friends that visit me to this wonderful establishment, and they all tell me I have excellent taste in food. 營 wish I could take the credit, but to not like sushi gen must mean your taste buds must be allergic to excellence. You have the option of either eating at the bar (omakase style only, minimum of 4 orders per person) or at the tables. 燱hen I come here, usually in small parties (between 2-5 people), I go for the table. 燤y go to meal? 燭he sashimi dinner with a side of tempura ($26). 營 think 95% of the time I have dined at the table, I get that. �All the dinner plates start with miso soup, tsunemono, and pickled vegetables (usually a cucumber and cabbage concoction). 燣ets start with the miso soup. 營 feel like you can judge a good sushi restaurant by the attention to detail in the miso soup, having the correct ratio of dashi to miso paste, as well as having the tofu be unbroken. 燬ushi gen hits all three of these aspects wonderfully; this is how I know this is the precursor to a wonderful meal. 燭he tsunemono is deliciously sweet and tart at the same time, serving to counterbalance the saltiness of the pickled vegetables and miso soup. 燭he salty pickled vegetables are the weakest part of the trio, but it's refreshing when eaten in conjunction with the other two items. After that comes the main course: a plate full of sashimi, a bowl of perfectly cooked hot sushi rice, and a side of shrimp and vegetable tempura. 燭he tempura itself is delicious; not too heavy, crispy, crunchy, and piping hot. 營t's the perfect side to a cold plate of heavenly sashimi. 燭he usual suspects in an order of the sashimi dinner? � slices of tuna (sometimes fattier, sometimes leaner), 3 slices of hamachi, their house special spicy tuna (I guarantee you its like no other spicy tuna you've ever had), chunks of yellowtail, chunks of regular tuna, tamago, either tako or ikura (octopus or squid), some sweet preserved fish (this is indistinguishable to me), and a cooked piece of salmon (kind of the odd man out), all served with a generous helping of seaweed. 燭he specifics are up to the sushi chefs, but it usually comes out like that in some fashion. 燗ll of the fish is of the highest quality, although I wish they served salmon sashimi instead of the cooked salmon (they don't make substitutions). 燗 comparable plate would cost 3-4 times as much at any other establishment west of downtown (sasabune and hide sushi come to mind, but I'll be honest, those restaurants pale in comparison), and the portions are so generous it borders on the obscene. 燜or my money, the sashimi dinner combo is the best meal in town, and I will challenge you to a duel if you dare dispute this. I've also had the pleasure of trying their various appetizers, from the ankimo to their fried chicken, and the quality of the food is definitely there. 燘ut honestly, if you are going to go to a sushi restaurant in the heart of Little Tokyo, you should be eating the raw goods and eschew the cooked. I've only eaten the omakase once before, but I must say, it was absolutely delightful. 燱hile I am sure there are better authorities than I to the world of omakase, the flavour pairings and the order of the fish prepared by the chef were simply superb. 燜rom what I recall, we started with the prototypical orders of fish, including toro, hamachi, and mackerel. 營t pains me to say it, but the quality of the fish served with the omakase is just out of this world, just a cut above what is offered to the main restaurant. 燩un intended. 燱e proceeded with other more adventurous fare: albacore with thinly sliced green onions, mirugai with a touch of yuzu pepper for added kick, and scallops so sweet it threatens to overwhelm. 燗 nice touch is that the chef intersperses the orders in a way where some of the nigiri you eat with soy sauce, and some you don't; he will tell you beforehand what the proper way of eating the order is. 燭he amaebi is also exceptionally sweet, with the fried head serving as a textural counterpoint to the sweet shrimp. 燭he only downside to the omakase? 營t can easily run you 50+ per person before sake, which ups the joint a dollar sign. 營t's a bit more decadent than the table meal, but either way, you can't go wrong with Sushi Gen.

If anything, Sushi-Gen's reputation precedes itself. Located in Honda Plaza, away from the more heavily-trafficked Japanese Village Plaza at the center of Little Tokyo, true Japanese food lovers have no problem finding this place- especially during lunch. My first experience with Sushi-Gen was during their famed lunch hour that starts at 11 am, where they have discounted prices on some of their meals. As a college student, I usually WAKE UP at 11 am, so getting up that "early" was a small sacrifice in order to land some really tasty sushi. BEWARE! Although there were only about 20 people ahead of me in line when I got there around 10:40 am, the moment they opened the doors there was a near bum-rush of senior citizens and Taiwanese aunties pushing their way through. Calm down y'all- there's plenty seats for everyone! Like everyone says, Sushi-Gen's fish is fresh and the portions are perfect. The interior is basically traditional Japanese minimalist, with no frills, and the same can be said of the servers- curt but polite, they would prefer you order and finish your meal without not dilly-dallying away too long... There's probably another line forming up while you're having those last sips of green tea. All in all, a nice place for lunch and dinner (if you're willing to pay full-price), not just because of the quality sushi, but also because you're able to get away from all those scatter-brained yuppies that seem to fill Little Tokyo on a daily basis these days...

I soooo did not like this place. 燜orget about the line. 燭hat was not a factor. �OKok, my head is down (ashamed), I got the Deluxe Combo or something. 燘ut I went with a couple of hakujins in town and THEY ordered. 營 so knew they wouldn't go for the uni or anything, but STILL. 燭una was soso, and the monkfish (?) was even worse. 營 swear - go to your nearest Bristol Farms, or even a Nijiya, and get better fish.

Ate here last night. Sat at the Sushi Bar. The sushi was super fresh and it was soooo yummy. Hardly any soy sauce was needed. I love the use of fresh wasabi on the pike mackerel and the red snapper. It was sooo yummy.This is what we ordered. Me Salmon Sushi, Toro Tuna, Uni Sushi, Yellowtail Sushi, Sweet Shrimp Sushi, Red Snapper, Pike Mackerel, and oysters Boyfriend Salmon Sushi, Yellowtail Sushi, Red Snapper, Pike Mackerel, Two orders of Toro Tuna, Three orders of Yellow Tail Belly Sushi We sucked down two large Sapporos. Total sushi price was $128.00 plus $26 for the Sapporo. Everything was super fresh. The meal was great. It was expensive but we left happy. I took one star off for the wait to get a table and the parking.

Maybe "fresh" is a subjective term used here. 燘ut my notion of the word is seafood that emanates the deep ocean. 燙lean, blissful, roll your eyes back into your head type bites -- only attained by fish caught recently and post-rigamortis for ideal flavor. 燞ere, not so much. 燭he price was decent but I've had the same quality from all-you-can-eat sushi joints in college towns.

This is my sister's favorite sushi place and I was in desperate need of a sushi fix, so she took me here. We ordered tons of different sushi and also got the sashimi dinner as well. 燭he sushi was awesome. I would have given them 5 stars, but my salmon sashimi appetizer was a disappointment. 燗s soon as they put the plate on the table, my face fell. 燭he salmon did not look good - not in the I'm gonna get sick if I eat that or the I'd send it back way. 燭he color was just not as bright as I expected it to be and it tasted kinda bland. 燦ot what I was expecting and it kinda made me rethink coming to this place since salmon is such a common sushi fish. The saving grace was the yellowtail belly. 營t was melt in your mouth awesome. 燭he regular yellowtail, ika and scallop were also yummy. 燤aybe the salmon was a fluke that night (no pun intended), but the rest of our dinner was still fabulous. I left full and happy, so I guess it worked out.

Sushi Gen is probably my favorite sushi restaurant in terms of price vs. value. �Considering the amount of business they generate, I'm surprised that they haven't expanded or relocated in the decade plus that I've been going. 營ts amazing how people wait before 11am to be able to get a table. 營 think their best value is their chirashi and sashimi lunch specials. 燭he deluxe shashimi is huge and I couldn't finish it the last time I went.

My boyfriend mentioned this place to me a few times and finally took me there. It was his first time going there too. It was a week night and the place was crowded. They sat us immediately at the sushi bar as we had requested. We got "Omakase style" and we were truly satisfied with everything the sushi chef served us. We love uni and I have to really give this place 5 stars for the delicious uni that they have. All of sushi there is amazing. We left there oh so satisfied. If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. That is how good it is. From the service to the food. Yum yummy yum.

This place is one of the best sushi restaurants in LA. The fish is seriously fresh! You have to try it here - it is hard to find great fresh sushi in LA. The fish literally melts in your mouth, like it's supposed to... get the combo. If you're here, I think you 爉ight as well splurge a little and get a good combo set and enjoy the fish. And a beer. Mmmm.... There will always be a wait, oh well. But it's worth it! Parking is validated in the lot, might be a little hard to find. Maybe you could park across the street in the Office Depot lot and try to not get caught.

Probably my most favorite sushi place in Little Tokyo when I feel like spending a moderate amount. Decor is nice but the service and food has it beat. Make sure you get reservations. The combination dinners will be more than satisfying but ordering your sushi/sashimi a la carte will be so much better. Sitting at the bar with the head Sushi chef will get you the best stuff around but sitting at a table can be nice too, especially if you want a more intimate setting with a small group. The service is fantastic. After reading some of the other reviews, looks like I need to come here for lunch sometime. This place is perfect if you want good traditional sushi.

Sushi Gen is one of those places you might consider not telling others about, because you want to keep it for yourself, but it seems as though the word is out! 營 knew I was in for a treat when I saw the line waiting outside the door on a Monday evening before they opened for dinner! Very excellent and straightforward sushi and sashimi, meticulously prepared and fresh as can be. 燭he tuna sashimi, a staple in most sushi joints, is a cut above here - full-bodied and rich. 燘ut all of the fish is excellent - the miso-sweetened blackened cod somehow stays flakey without being dry. Service is good, and prices are very reasonable when compared to newer, more gimmicky sushi restaurants across town - but it's not cheap.

I have only been here once so I still have a lot more to taste, but based on my Sushi Deluxe platter, I can tell that Sushi-Gen has incredibly fresh fish without all of the fuss and frill of those fusion sushi places. I spontaneously felt like sashimi one day and heard of this restaurant from a friend who lives in Downtown. 燬he makes all of her dates and boy-toys take her here for the sashimi. 燬o I figure that if she likes it enough to eat here with her multiple men, then I think I should try it out. So I called about 30 minutes before we would arrive there to make a reservation because I heard that there can be a wait, via Yelp. 燛ven with my reservation we had to wait. 燬o basically, come prepared to wait a little even if you called in advance because this place is busy! I am not usually a fan of sashimi but Sushi-Gen made me a believer. 營 was really tempted to order something cooked, aka Teriyaki salmon but I had to try out their sushi and sashimi. 營 ordered the Sushi Deluxe and the bf got the Chirashi. 燭hey were almost identical but his came with the extra octopus which I don't like so much. 燤y fave was the Toro because it melted like butter in my mouth. 燗lso, the Sushi Deluxe came with wasabi in EVERY piece. 營 should have mentioned no wasabi to the waitress but I wasn't thinking. 燱e also ordered the Yellowtail Collar, which takes 15 minutes to prepare. 營 think if we hadn't ordered this we would both still be hungry after each eating our sushi. 營 guess I needed that little bit of cooked food to settle all of the raw. After I almost finished all of the sushi on my platter, I found my tuna sashimi left, which I had saved, and said loudly "OH YEAAAAA," in the Kool Aid guy kind of voice as he runs through walls. 燭he waitress laughed at me as she filled our water cups. 營 guess I was too excited to find that little bit of fish left. I was a slightly sad that they didn't give any salmon sashimi in either the Chirashi or the Sushi Deluxe, because I like salmon sashimi even more than tuna! 燬adness. 營 would have gladly traded in a squid or white fish for one salmon. 營 also thought that my water cup smelled a little of fish. 燤aybe too much fish in one restaurant can be a bad thing. I must come back to try their lunch. 營t sounds like a steal, dinner costs mucho dolares.

What more can i say that the others haven't? 燳ep, nothing. 營 couldn't decide on 3 or 4 stars. 燭he draw is the food, and yes, it was amazingly fresh, top quality fish. The internal debate comes from my overall dining experience was pleasant and just fine, but with nothing to really set it apart. 營f you dimmed the lights a little, upgraded the seating and decor, it would probably be a no brainer for me. 燦evertheless, i went with 4 stars. Some of the reviews called it pricey, but for 3 of us, we ordered a HUGE plate of sashimi for $35. 燨f course add on some wine, beer and sake and you pay a little more, but I feel you get a great deal for your money. 營 don't know what was on our tray, but i enjoyed 90% of the selections. �We scrambled for a last minute reservation on a week night, but when walking in, the place was not as crowded as expected. 燗s we left around 9, the dining room was practically empty.

The meal started off well.. We had 7pm reservations and right when we showed up at 6:59pm there was an open table for us. Looking around its notable how immaculate the restaurant is (this scores major points with me when eating sushi). For drinks: 5 Stars Super large sake and an Asahi To start: � Stars Tempura dinner, Miso soup, clam Miso soup, and 6 of the most delectable oysters I have ever had. Sushi: 5 Stars 4 - Salmon, 2 - Hamachi, 2 - Ama-Ebi, 4 - Kampachi, 2 - Uni Cut Roles: 3 Stars California Role (not sure why we got this), Spicy Tuna Role (Much better at Hama...;) Sashimi: 5 Stars Thin sliced Halibut, two orders of Toro and two orders of Giant Clam. The four of us devoured the generous perfectly cut fresh morsels of sushi and sashimi. As most others I am going to have to say Sushi-Gem is great and a must try. The only draw back is the price. Be prepared to spend a pretty penny, this place does not come cheap.

This place deserves a lot of the hype it gets, and the long long lines of waiting diners will agree with me. If you want to eat here, you'd better start lining up before it opens, or prepare yourself for a substantial wait, and no, they don't take reservations. But it's okay, the sashimi is well worth the wait (and if you come here, you should always get the sashimi; the other stuff, you might as well get elsewhere). This place has the best raw fish I've had, and the baked salmon and eel, things I normally would pass on (I like my fish fried or not cooked at all), was super moist and delicious. Service was efficient and no nonsense, which makes sense for a place that gets as crowded and busy as Sushi-Gen. I was impressed when the first platter of sashimi was served within ten minutes of opening. We didn't wait long at all between getting our orders in, our drinks, the soup and salads, and the main dishes. I only wished it were located closer to where I live ;)

This place is GOOD. Most sushi places you have to order their daily fish specials to get it fresh. 燳ou can try the rest of the menu and freshness is a toss up. AND esp. when you order the sashimi combo, it's mostly likely not going to be all that fresh. 燬o sad. 燭his place, all the sashimi is oh so wonderful all the time! 燤y friend and I shared the sashimi plate and a yellowtail collar. �Sashimi plate - more than enough for two people. 營 would say 25-30 pieces, oh my. All of it was awesome. �Yellowtail collar - crispy skin, juicy and tender meat--some of the best I've had. Although we only ordered 2 things we both had food babies at the end of the night. No rice, no edamame, no miso, just straight fish. We had made it a mission to finish everything. 燗nd I got to say, it was quite the battle. Parking - you pay to park in the lot. 燜orgot how much or if there's street parking. 燘ut since it is in Little Tokyo, I'd opt to say street parking is pretty hard to find. Wait - went on a weekday for dinner. 營t was rather later in the evening so the wait was only 15-20 minutes. 燘ut I heard this place gets packed!

After reading all the reviews my expectations were set very high... and when we do this we typically get disappointed because it doesn't usually live up to all the good reviews.....And in this case it was absolutely NOT that way at all! Since it was our first time we ordered the sashimi deluxe. 燭he sashimi tasted like butter! 燱e also got the oysters which was very fresh but i think i prefer my oysters with lemon and tabasco. Other things include halibut, masago, giant clam and sweet potato tempura. 燭he only thing that was a little strange to me was the sweet shrimp, I don't think it tastes bad at all but it has a very strange texture....Takes some getting use to. 燗lso you have a choice to get the head from the shrimp deep fried or in a miso soup. 燱e got it fried and that was good. 燘ut anything fried is usually pretty tasty =X At the end of it all, my stomach was happy. 燱hen the bill came around I thought it would have been a lot more damage than it turned out..

This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Little Tokyo. Sushi is my favorite food and I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants. If you're one of those pseudo-sushi lovers who can only eat California rolls and Dragon rolls, this is not the place for you. And one more thing, those rolls with sauce and imitation crab inside are not "Japanese." I went with 3 of my girlfriends and I ordered the dinner SASHIMI DELUXE. I don't remember the exact name of it, but it comes with sashimi, tempura, etc. for 30-something dollars. It's quite a bit of food. And it's good food. The fish is fresh. You should definitely try this place. The wait is long, so get yourself a cup of Yogurtland or something while you wait.

It was my first time at Sushi-Gen, and honestly, I was not expecting good sushi, given the run-down look the place had from the outside. And again, I was taught the lesson: "Don't judge a book by it's cover" cause the sushi was pretty darn good! :D I ordered the chiraishi (~$27: bowl of rice topped with various sashimi pieces) and loved it! It's definitely one of the better ones that I've tried at various restaurants in Little Tokyo. The sushi was really fresh. I was really impressed. :) It's definitely one of the pricier sushi restaurants, but i think the quality is totally worth it. :) I'm only giving 4 stars, cause this place lacks a little bit of something to make me want to come back (other than the food). maybe service? charm?

My first reaction to seeing over 400+ reviews was "wow, this place must be stellar". But in looking again I acknowledged the fact that this place is in LA, which means everyone and their grandmother's weekday bingo friends have made a review. Sometimes when seeing such a large reviewing populous I feel the credibility is diluted if only because is seems people in SoCal will yelp about just about everything (and some without ever having tried it). Fortunately this place proved to uphold and even surpass the hype. It really is quite good. Simple d閏or, attentive service, and knock out raw ingredients. I usually judge my sushi experiences by how many "holy shit that's good!" moments I have. I counted two of those here, and that's really saying something. These moments generally come about 10 times a year for me so I'm for sure not just throwing those around.

(average) - sweet shrimp (I didn't try this one but it's probably average by the looks). - Uni (didn't eat this either) sushi wise..I got: - avacado eel cut roll - spicy tuna cut roll (their cut rolls are EXTREMELY small, I forgot how much they were each..but I guess they were ok...) app: -small tempura FYI, a "small" tempura- it was $9, the large is $12. �I just saw EVERYONE ordering it so I thought it might be soo deliciousss...) 營 thought I was in Hollywood or something for the price, and the tempura better be OFF THE HOOK with that price, right? Uh, no. �The shrimp is soggy. 營 HATE SOGGY SHRIMP and I HATE EXPENSIVE SOGGY SHRIMP. 燭he last time I checked, our economy isn't doing too well. 燱hy are you doing this sushi gen? Why? 燳ou have money to buy fresh flowers for the place (btw it's really pretty...) but dude, please serve some fresh shrimp! Or is it just me? �Fine, so I do have expectations, but it's called having standards. 營've eaten over maybe 1000 places and I have to open a Yelp account to share my thoughts. 營'm so disappointed. 營 will never return, unless you prove to me that you will improve. 營f you do, let me know.

Another spot in Little Tokyo which is filled with Japanese people so you know it's legit. 燭hat's the mark of a good Asian restaurant.. well authenticity wise at least. �The wait is kind of long here.. we were a little late for our reservation and we had to wait another 15 minutes. �The sashimi deluxe special is really worthwhile on the menu. 燜resh.. varied.. large spread... great deal! 燭he mistake we made was that we thought the sushi deluxe special would be as good.. it's not. 燬aw the salmon teriyaki.. quite large piece of salmon.. so you wouldn't be going wrong with that either.

I've been coming here since ages ago but I'm happy to review it now. 營t's a good establishment. 燗uthenticity and freshness are great combo for a sushi joint; Sushi-Gen embodies these two elements which makes it easy for me to come back to. �With a lunch outing with my aunt, at 11:30 we waited about 20 minutes to get seated. 燬eriously at lunchtime, 20 minutes is practically like no wait. 燭here's always a wait here, so if your in a hurry this might not be the right choice. 營 ordered the Salmon Lunch Special which comes with grilled salmon, sashimi, miso soup, mini tofu, rice and mini salad. 營 say for under $20 this is a good deal. The grilled salmon took 20 minutes to cook (which the waiter told us while ordering). 燨nce it came out, it was amazing! the flakes of salmon came off the bones and really it melts in your mouth. 燭he fish was fresh and well cooked. 燭he sashimi was amazing! I had 8 pieces from tuna, halibut and salmon. 燫eally a melt in your mouth experience. 燭he service was good, the waitresses were constantly refilling my water and my iced green tea. For lunch, I think it's really worth it if your willing to wait. 營t's a good price for great fish! 營 can't wait till I go back again!

Oh my goodness, how come I barely discovered the best place for sashimi in LA? Their quality of raw fish is outstanding!

I've been here twice and haven't been dissapointed yet. I went this last weekend, around 9 on a saturday. The line seemed daunting and the host told us it was a 45minute wait.

The sushi here is spectacular. 燭he presentation is eye-catching, the flavor is top notch, and the freshness is hard to match anywhere. Some favorites of ours during our visit, if you're willing to spend a little, is the Toro and Otoro (if they happen to have any). 燭hese items are rather pricey when ordered as sashimi, but they are very much worth it. �Looking around, the dining room felt somewhat cramped, with just enough space between you and other customers to not feel entirely intrusive to each other's conversations. 燭he wait staff was good, though my water was left empty for much of the night. Overall 4 Stars. 營f not for the water and somewhat tighter quarters, it would have most definitely won the 5.

I've been a fan of Sushi-Gen for some time now. It was actually one of the first sushi places I was introduced to when I moved to LA. There are a number of directions you can go here. Their combinations are quite good, and I think their chicken teriyaki is some of the best. It comes with a serving of miso soup, sunomono, rice, and either sashimi or tempura. A pretty full meal for about $20. However, you can also go with their sushi or sashimi combinations. These come with soup, sunomono, tempura, and a selection of various sashimi/sushi, of the same quality as you would get a la carte. Personally, when I want to treat myself, I'll just order off the a la carte sushi menu and just pick out exactly what I want. The sushi is as good as any that you'll get in Little Tokyo, and I think it's pretty much as high of quality as you'll get for the price. I do enjoy sitting a the sushi bar, but similar to other sushi joints, you can only order sushi there - small drawback. If you know you're just gonna get sushi, go for the sushi bar (the wait is usually shorter there too). If you want to try out the combinations, you'll have to wait for a table (which can be quite long at times). Parking in the Honda plaza is $2.50 if validated. Street parking is ample with a decent walk.

Adding this to my list of good dinner places in parts of LA that I don't frequent. Ended up downtown early for a concert - decided to head to Little Tokyo for some grub. Since it was already after 9 pm, only a 4 minute wait for a table. Got the yellowtail belly, the freshwater eel, the scallop sushi � plus some crab sunomono, some veggie tempura and cucumber rolls. Everything was very good - the scallop sushi was just divine. That slighty sweet and fresh taste that great scallop sushi has. YUM! The cucumber rolls were the most authentic cucumber rolls I've had in North America - with that great wasabi kick. Not many places put wasabi in their cucumber rolls. We came in with no expections (despite the raves Sushi-Gen gets) and got a great dinner. The price was okay - about �60 with tax and tip - not supercheap sushi, but the quality was good. Not OMG, eyes-rolling-back-in-my-head Azami good - but good. Definitely worth another trip!

GOOD food. 燘ad service!! 營 mean, terrible! First me and my friend get to the sushi bar and our sushi chef asks us what we wanted--we didn't even have a menu yet! 燭hen when we asked for one he looked pretty irritated. Then, I love this...no prices on the sushi menu! 營'd really like to know what the heck I'm paying before I order. So I started off with yellow tail, which was GREAT. 燤y best friend however wasn't very happy with her spicy tuna and opted at this point to have something from the dinner menu. 燨f course, you can't have stuff from the kitchen at the bar so we asked if we could sit at a table--reasonable request to make in opinion. �Of course, not to them! 燭hey wouldn't sit us to a table because "we're not allowed to go from bar to table". 燛ven after asking if we could pay for the bar check and pay for a table check they still said no way (and very rude-ly). So at this point my best friend is PISSED. 營'm frustrated and wanted to leave so we asked for the check. 燨ur sushi-nazi chef then tells us that we had to order a four order minimum to be at the bar and starts working on other people's orders. 燭hen he cues us to order something at this point I'm now furious--how can any establishment force a patron to order a four order minimum? 燭he chef actually wouldn't give us our check until I finally said I'm not ordering anything else and we wanted to leave. 燗t which the chef tells us dictates the rules of the bar and chirps for the host to get us our check. �Me and my friend were anticipating to order more than yellow tail and a spicy tuna but NO WAY would we give our patronage in exchange for rude service. �Yes, the food is traditional and good (at least for me, the spicy tuna was fine) but I would not recommend anybody to go there from the bad service we got at Sushi-gen. 燬imply RUDE.

came here on valentines day bc due to my perpetual tardiness we missed our reservation at the original restaurant my date had schemed. for whatever reason i dont usually go to japanese restaurants. this place has crazy good reviews and its no wonder, the sashimi is like buttttAH, im actually getting a little drooly as i type. the ambiance is cute, authentic japanese, warmly lit, quiet, accessible (not too trendy, too tightly packed, loud, dark, hipster) its perfect for dinner with the significant others parents (which is what was happening at the table next to us), the family (i would totally take my raw fish loving family here--and even my grandfather, who gets agoraphobic and hates waiting to be seated, hates clatter clutter, but love loves himself a good chirashi bowl--this place would even meet his high and picky standards), or a date. bc its such a chill ambiance it feels like a neighborhood spot you could pop in weekly, but i dont actually think thats financially sustainable--so sad. they have their own parking lot--2-4$ to park, but you need cash. there's also a cute japanese bar two stores down w/flatscreens and i'd imagine lots of scotch. we thought it was a strip bar or burlesque joint or something, but i think its just a normal bar...its a great place to chill while waiting for your table at sushi gen--we were so hungry we shared a hot dog at wurstkuche beforehand (which is just down the street); the perfect appetizer..hehe

For lunch, the sushi box has a larger and more varied selection than your standard sushi-special fare, and will only set you back a mere $12. 燭he staff is friendly, attentive, and just boistrous enough to remind me of the loud, bustling sushi bars that are standard in Japan. 燦ot to mention the fish, which is so tasty and smooth it's almost like butter (the yellowtail was especially delightful). 燭his place is my number one choice for nigiri and sashimi, which is quite the feat considering the numerous other options to be found in the neighboorhood.

When you walk into a sushi restaurant and there is no price on the menu, you know you are in a �place that takes their fish seriously. �I've eaten at a lot of sushi restaurants and while I don't consider myself a sushi elitist or an expert, I do know what good sushi taste like and I can safely say that Sushi-Gen has the best sushi that I've have ever eaten. 燙oming from me that is a pretty damn good testament to the quality of the fish. 營 ordered all nigiri pieces and actually felt bad for ordering the spicy tuna roll in addition because I felt that I completely disrespected the sushi chef and the restaurant for ordering a "non-traditional" menu item. �Here is what I had and each piece was phenomenal with absolutely no fishy taste to it whatsoever. 1) Toro 2) Halibut 3) Japanese Mackerel 4) Yellowfin Belly 5) Spicy Tuna 6) Baby Yellowfin 7) Ahi I loved each piece that I had and can't really say which was my favorite because they all had different qualities. 燘ut what I do know is that biting into those pieces was just as good as great sex, in fact it may have been better.

Sushi quality is prime. Fatty tuna, albacore, all good. I went here with another person and we got the seafood salad and deluxe sashimi plate. So much sashimi for ~$35 bucks. The seafood salad was very standard and nothing special really stood out there. The sashimi was so good that I recommend it to anyone that is a sashimi lover. 3 stars because it was $75 after tip for deluxe sashimi and seafood salad (no alcohol). That's pretty steep for the whole experience. This review might be affected by my date. Was not a stimulating conversation so might have a little bias on this review. Pros: you're going to get quality sushi cons: price

Sushi Gen is my favorite sushi restaurant. 營 compare all sushi to Sushi Gen. 燣ocated in little Tokyo, in Honda Plaza, Sushi Gen is no longer a hidden gem. 燛veryone seems to know it. 營 would not recommend going unless you had a reservation. �The food is fresh and top notch. 燭he toro, 爕ellowtail, and halibut are of excellent cuts. 燬ince the place is always packed, the fish must always be fresh. 燗lmost anything you would want at a typical sushi restaurant - Sushi Gen would have. �With regard to Sushi restaurants, I strongly suggest that you find a place that you like. 營t may not have to be Sushi Gen. 燨nce you have found a place that you like and enjoy. 燝et to know the staff, the chefs, etc. 燨nce you develop that relationship with them, they will begin to treat you well. 燭hey will often suggest things that you may not have had. 燞eck, even buy them a beer or two.

I'm giving Sushi-Gen a 3.5 I found out about this place through yelp. A friend and I eat lunch often in downtown LA, and we've been wanting to try this place. The reason why we did not try this place sooner was because some reviewers complained of the wait. Today, we ended up going anyway for lunch. When we got there at 12:45PM, the waitress had seats for three in both the bar and table area. The server was friendly and service was quick. I ordered the sushi deluxe combination. My friend ordered the salmon terikyaki. Overall, the fish was fresh and the food was good, but not as spectacular as I thought it would be. Perhaps, we ordered the wrong dishes. Or maybe our expectations were too high because of all the hype on yelp. I might go back and try something different. Good sushi, but for $21, I didn't expect anything less.

Finally stopped by this icon for their lunch specials. Phenomenal! First of all, parking was perfectly fine. It gets a little tight for sure. My friend ordered the $15 sashimi combo - amazing! I ordered the sashimi/chicken teriyaki combo - $14 and amazing in terms of taste and amount. One less star because I hate, yes HATE, restaurants that don't give little sides like banchan or ginger for free with your meal. Sushi Gen charged $1 for ginger. Oh come on! Ginger is so cheap... With the economy the way it is, lunch specials like these allow for a great meal without hurting the wallet too much!

Excellent sushi. The lunch special is a great deal (full sashimi plate for $15) but as others have mentioned, if you don't time it right you can end up waiting a LONG time. I've also come here for dinner and would come here every week if I could afford it. Dinner is significantly more expensive than lunch. I highly recommend the uni as it is the best I've ever had. Other good ones: - toro (melts in your moth!) - unagi - sweet shrimp (with the heads fried) - hamachi belly - blue fin tuna Minus one star because there is a weird fish smell when you walk in. I don't know what it is, but usually it stops bothering me after a few minutes.

Male Host = Stinking attitude. Female Host = Better attitude. Wait staff = Excellent service. Sashimi Deluxe = Yum yum til I puke. 燦ot very particular about the slimy squid with a starchy texture. Oysters = Not worth the $25+ for five. Overall, Sushi Gen and Komasa are comparable. 燞owever, Sushi Gen has a greater selection of sashimi (Deluxe). �Sushi Gen gets 4 out of 5 stars thanks to the male host's stinking attitude about seating requirements on a Saturday night at 8:30 p.m. when it wasn't even packed. 燗pparently it's their policy to have the entire party present before being seated. 燱e had a party of 4 and although half of us were there, we were ready to order for the entire party as the other 2 were sitting in the car, waiting in line on 2nd street to bypass the slow security guard as we entered into the parking lot. �Bottom line, it's a bad policy to have the entire party present, especially if it wasn't busy. �It hinders the quick turnaround of tables, which results in more revenue. 燗fter ordering, it takes a while for the sushi chefs to prepare and serve anyway. 燘oo!

I don't understand what the hype is about this place! We decided to do a nice family dinner and came here on a Saturday evening. Before the place even opened, there were already 10+ people lined up at the door. When they finally opened their doors, there was a mini rush into the place, to my amusement. Anyway, we were promptly seated and within 5-10 minutes, the place was packed and more people were waiting outside. I don't remember specifically what we ordered since my mom did the ordering, but we tried most of the things on their menu. The tempura was good--just the right amount of batter so it wasn't too thick, it wasn't soggy, and the crisps were delicate and not oily. Sashimi was fresh fresh fresh but, sadly, not served in generous portions. The place was good but not OMGlet'slineupbeforeitopens amazing. I was not reeling or raving about the place when I left.

So this is a review for my most recent visit during lunch and for the sashimi platter. Only get the sashimi platter if you're hard core about sashimi. 營 like sashimi but I prefer to sit at the bar and have nigiri with sushi chef's dressings on it. 燭his was sashimi overload for me. 燭he fish is fresh, yummy and it is a very large portion for $15 but it was just too much for me.

Would have been 5 stars if they still had what I wanted. The things I did get was great though: tuna, yellowtail, salmon, toro. Missed out on the abalone and yellowtail belly I also tried the california and spicy tuna roll for fun. Don't waste money/time on those and just stick to the real sushi. Komasa has way better cali and spicy rolls. Had reservations at 830 was seated a lil bit earlier which was nice.

Are you guys kidding me?????? This place blows for the money. Ive had it all in LA. and im talking about quality places from the hole in the walls to the $$$$ places and what 爉y experience today was just terrible. After all the hype I decided to check it out since people try to tell me that its better than my usual favorite spot Sushi Iki. I ordered: Yellowtail Sashimi (joke) Albacore Sushi (3/5) 2 Red Snapper Sushi(5/5) the only tasty thing on the menu Halibut 燬ushi (3/5) Salmon Sushi (0/5) ive never had a sushi taste this fishy ever at a sushi spot. the salmon did not go in right at all. in fact i think im getting sick from it. Spanish Makeral Sushi (3/5) Makeral Bones (1/5) sad part is they dont even know how to deep fry this correctly All this came out to about $110 with two unfiltered nigori cheap saki bottles. Usually I go for the Otokayama but felt like getting unfiltered today. Now lets say all the fish was amazing for this price and their tiny ass portion sizes I would say it was more like a $60 meal. Id rather cork over the extra money and go to Matsuhisa or Urasawa.

With this many reviews of this place, I'll just chime in and say that Sushi-Gen is one of the very very best places in the LA area for sushi, which is saying a lot given our Asian communities around here. The sashimi I had here is quite possibly the best I've ever had. It's also quite expensive, but you get what you paid for. They do have pretty good lunches which are less expensive than dinners. A very classy place for very good treats without fail.

Pros: Sashimi nigiris were great fish was very fresh. Just melted in my mouth rolls were good as well Cons: Took one star off because it is expensive if you order a la carte at the bar. I thought the prices were supposed to be reasonable but it reflected a moderate/pricey sushi restaurant when seated at the bar. I will try their lunch specials or combos next time and sit at the table since other yelper say that is less expensive.

Sashimi combo is a deal! Fresh toro, tuna, poke, etc... for $!5. Comes with rice, miso, tofu, and small salad. Don't expect the best service. You will feel kinda rushed. Wait was about 45 min.

OMG. Okay this is by far the best sushi I ever ate in the city of Los Angeles. Like the 30 minute wait on a crowded Saturday night was well worth it. I ordered the beef terikaryi dinner with the 7piece sashimi. The sashimi was very delicious and high quality. To be honest, I really hate the texture of tuna from my past experience, but this tuna blew my mind away.! it was very tasty and as I placed it on my tongue, it just melts away! My friend got the sashimi dinner, it was randomly selected by the chef and there was no substitution period..Every piece of fish on the plate were delicious, there were no left-overs! This is definitely my spot to grub for sushi when I visit LA again. You won't be disappointed. Although, I didn't understand why there were no cellphones allow. I couldn't take a snapshot of that yummy-ness. T__T

I can't remember an American sushi bar that served fresher fish. 燭he pristine taste of the fish here is really in an universe by itself. 營t tastes like it just came out of the ocean or off the fishing boat. 燭his is also one of the most expensive presentations of sushi ever, $65 for lunch, so this is not for the meek at heart. 燘ut I have to say this is an unique experience, and trust the sushi masters with the omakase. 燭he fatty toro, the Spanish mackerel, the Japanese snapper and the Santa Barbara shrimp set the standard to judge all other sushi bars.

3.5 stars - here's why: The sushi is delicious. There's no doubt about that. I had heard a lot of great things about Sushi Gen, so I had very high expectations and honestly my expectations were all met. I had my usual - yellowtail, salmon and a spicy tuna roll. Everything was great but the bill was over $30. At Hama or Komasa the bill would be around $20 for the same meal. I'd rather save $10 on a dinner that just as tasty.

I'm a huge fan of sushi and we ended up at Sushi-Gen after many family friends who recommended this restaurant. 燗fter passing by this restaurant mayn times on the way to Curry House, I had this image in my head that it was a grudgy, hole-in-the-wall Japanese restaurant. 燣ittle did I know, it was a remodeled location with fantastic servicce. �My boyfriend and I came here for our Valentine's Day dinner and it was packed! 燱e had a choice of the bar or a table. 營f we chose to sit at the bar, we had to order 4 dishes minimum and we weren't allowed to order a dinner combination. 燬ince we didn't like to held back from conditions, we decided to wait for a table. 燱e walked around J-town and visited the local Japanese market and bought some goodies.

I'm so glad I finally made it here after all the hype I've heard. I had the sashimi platter along with some uni and scallop sushi and i was happy. I went on a weeknight, called 2 hours before for 燼 reservation, and was seated like a VIP within 5 minutes of arrival. The sashimi was fresh and plentiful, just as you yelpers promised. Sadly, however, I think I've lost my taste for uni. Who knows if it was the quality or what, but the fishy flavor just didn't agree with me this time.

If you're talking quality sushi - fresh, fresh, fresh, Sushi-Gen is the place to go. 燘ut we're not talking fancy Americanized rolls here, we're talking authentic Japanese, the real deal Holyfield, that will knock out your craving for true sushi. 燤y dad and I always hit up Sushi-Gen when I'm in town.. the menu isn't rocket science, and you know what you're getting. Food: I like the salmon-skin salad they serve, and did I mention all of their sushi/sashimi is super-fresh? �Atmosphere: Face it, you're just here for the sushi - not the ambiance. 營f you want fancy-shmancy decor and paintings and seats, this is not what you'll find here. 燭his is just a place you go for sushi. Price/Portions: Eh... yeah, you are going to spend a good amount of money on sushi, no matter where you go. 燬ome people might think their portions are small, but this is the standard serving size for sushi - you wouldn't want to be bloated off of sushi would you? 燪uality over quantity, I say! 燘ut yes, this isn't a cheap lunch or dinner, expect to pay a little more. The Bad: OK so I already raved about the fresh servings of sushi - 爐he bad part is, it's not a secret. 燛veryone and their mom must know about Sushi-Gen because every single day I've gone whether it's a random Wednesday or a Saturday, it's always been jam-packed! 營f you want to get lunch, the line starts forming like a good hour in advance. 燭he wait is just crazy, crazy, crazy. 營f you don't want to wait, you can travel across the street to a few nearby sushi joints that are probably not as fresh, but at least you won't go hungry and get tired standing in line. The Good: I love Little Tokyo and so many of the restaurants are great finds. 營'm lucky enough to be spoiled by all the good Japanese places in Torrance, too, but if you're looking for an impressive, conservative, Japanese restaurant for a business lunch or with your closest friends, Sushi-Gen is a nice place to enjoy some sushi and sake. �If you wanna do take-out, try their salmon teriyaki, it's also pretty tasty.

The sashimi was really excellent quality, but nothing to write home about. 營 am a part of the old school sushi eaters where I usually rate a sushi restaurant based on their quality of simple fish rather than how creative their rolls are. 燬ushi-Gen should take advantage of this fact. 營 mean.. the sashimi was good but I've had better (like at recently rated Kirala in Berkeley). 燱e started with a nice agedashi tofu that I quite enjoyed. 燗fter that it did not go above and beyond. 燭he best pieces were the albacore and the uni. 燬almon, tuna, halibut and surf clam I've had better (but it's still very good). �Ambiance and service was standard for any nice sushi restaurant. 營 can't speak to the prices because I didn't really look at the check but I think I paid about $20 for myself.

I came here last night and had an amazing dinner with my best friend :) We met up in Little Tokyo because it was the middle to where we both were at. Having no idea where to eat, we decided to yelp something closeby. There are ton's of sushi restaurants around this neighborhood so it's hard to pick one. Sushi-Gen came up as a familiar name and they had good reviews. It was obvious it was a good place when we walked over, the place was packed on a Wednesday night. We had to wait about 25 minutes to be seated. We started off with a few drinks, Sake & Soju. I'd never had Soju before and was tempted to order it and try it. I was very suprised at what it was, I was always under the impression that it was sweet, and more of a mixed drink. In my mind, I'd always thought it was a Korean Sangria or something lol. Boy was I wrong. It was pure alcohol on the rocks. Granted I drank it :P It grew on me. Reminded me of a vodka tonic with the wedge of lemon that was inside of it. We ordered a few things for dinner, Miso Soup of course :) I had the regular Tofu one, my friend had the Mushroom one (she said that one was a bit slimy with the mushroom). I was happy with my Miso, it was average. We ordered the Fried Eggplant and it was incredible. I'm a huge fan of eggplant and the flavors with the sauce where so delectable. We had an eel avocado roll & a spicy tuna roll, they were both very good. The fish was very fresh and the size of each cut roll where perfect. Bite size, not falling apart. Lastly but not least, we shared the Black Cod which was seared, unlike any fish I have ever tasted. It remind me of scallops. They made sure it was cooked with plenty of butter and each bite melted in my mouth. It's a small place and I'm not sure if they take reservations, but it was well worth the wait.

This place is a good find. 燭he place is small but not too tight... 燨ne item worth remembering is the grilled black cod. 營t was fresh and simply melts in your mouth and explodes with flavor. �It has so much flavor balanced by what seemed to be yuzu fruit rind... The sushi and sashimi is fresh and delightful. 燭he shrimp & vegetable tempura is okay and didn't really stand out. So as of today, 6/29/10, Sushi-Gen just made it to my top 5 Japanese spots 1. Urasawa 2. Matsuhisa 3. Yu n Mi 4. Sushi-Gen 5. Sake House

It's a 4 star restaurant but it loses a star due to the wait and the front host who would not let us sit because 1 member of our group had not arrived. �we were a party of 6). 燨ur friend that was coming told us to go ahead and order. 燭his was a sloppy handling of handling the guests. It's a decent sushi place, but i felt that the sushi pieces look incredibly small compared to other sushi places i've been to: kabuki, taihei, tenno, and the one that's upstairs in the korean market (forgetting what the name of that business was) My friend had hyped this to be the best place to get sushi. 營 personally didn't feel that the small establishment and roll appearance was "epic" as what my friend had described. Meh. 燭here is always a wait, and the venue is NOT good for bringing groups of people 6+.

This place is good. 營f I lived closer it would definitely be a place I would frequent. 燯pon the recommendation of fellow Yelpers, I got the sashimi plate. 營t is a huge portion with generous cuts of fish at a very reasonable price. 燭he sushi combination is not as impressive and I would recommend ordering your sushi a la carte instead of getting the combo. 燭he staff here is very friendly, nice, and courteous. 燭he only part of my experience I did not enjoy so much is the amount of green onions they blended with their cuts of toro and tuna on the sashimi plate. 燤y friend is a sushi chef and she told me to be wary of restaurants who pair their sashimi/sushi with lemon or the like because it is their way of masking the scent/flavor of older cuts of fish.

The absolute best sashimi meal I've ever had. Given, I came with a friend who wanted to take me out for "real" sashimi, after I had told her I love sashimi. As a result, we literally went all out on the ordering, with sashimi deluxe, toro sashimi, uni sashimi, and an individual order of beef teriyaki with sashimi each, which was slightly overkill. I've never had to actually hold myself back from consuming rice while eating sashimi, because it definitely doesn't come cheap, but this was one of those rare moments in my life until I become a sparkling entrepreneur (as opposed to a budding one). Uni I believe speaks for itself. Always been one of my favorite sashimi dishes, and always will be. Toro on the other hand, was a whole different experience. This may have been my first time trying it, but damn it does not look like your typical fish. It actually resembles more like quality raw kobe beef, glistening with fat, unlike the typically transparent form of tuna. If tuna was chicken of the sea, then toro was definitely the prime quality bacon of the sea. I could've cried with my first bite, soaking in the buttery taste while I bit into it ever so slowly, letting the fish dissolve itself in my mouth. drool. Yellowtail hamachi (also one of my favorites) was very delicious as well, in the best quality you can probably get this side of the pacific. I think I've consumed enough fish for a month. And then perhaps another trip back here. ;)

I went for dinner around 6pm and had to wait about an hour for a table for two. I had the Sushi Combo Deluxe, and it was very tasty. Everything tasted fresh. My friend had the Sashimi Deluxe and she very much enjoyed it as well. The presentation was nice. The only downfall was the lack of hospitality of the hosts and the so-so service of our waitress. I wouldn't go here all the time for sushi since it is quite expensive, but I am glad I got to try it out.

Sushi Gen is where you go when you want to dress up the sushi bar experience! The ambiance is nice, but the wait is a bitch! The restaurant is pricey for a high quality sushi bar, but the food is of the highest quality. Shockingly, the variety of seafood is limited. With that said, there are better deals around town. Oomasa in Little Tokyo has more personality, even though the ambiance isn't as sexy!

This place would get a 4.5 for being more expensive than it should be and for slightly lacking service...However, Jason (the receptionist guy...He's there EVERYDAY!) remembers us by name evertime, is very kind/patient and tries hard to get us in ASAP. 1/2 star for JASON. However, the other 4.5 stars goes to the freshest (with the exception of urasawa) fish in LA. Have tried almost all the sushi joints in Little Tokyo. This is the ONLY sushi restaurant I frequent. By "frequent" I mean atleast once a week, and up to 3 times a week. No thank you: "Hama", "GOGO" "Komasa" the list goes on and on... Here's the quick list of what to get: LUNCH: SO worth it $15 for the sashimi: You get agedashi tofu, tsukemono (japanese pickles), rice, miso shiru and a combination of their freshest fish. Once in a while you'll get some very generous pieces of toro! they charge close to the price of the meal (for toro) if you order it at the sushi bar! Ask for sushi rice instead of reg. rice to complete your experience. Sometimes it's free, sometimes its a $1. Dunno. Dun ask. Dinner: Sashimi Deluxe (although it doesn't come with everything that comes with the sashimi lunch, not even rice) Worth it! Comes with Toro everytime! It's decently sized: can share with a friend! Uni dinner is also pretty amazing if you don't mind the price tag+all that UNI!!! Sushi Bar: They are experts @ Japanase Snapper and Scallop. They use YUZU PEPPER, sea salt and lemon. 燨thers who do it don't compare. Dunno why, dun care. Don't forget especially for these: Fish side down or sideways on the tongue, then chew! yum!

RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL! Update 1/25 - Chef finally offered apology but nothing free. My response - apology not accepted, unless he allows me to shove a sea urchin up his butthole and he has to walk around and serve other customers like a Geisha. ---------------------------------- If you want to be mistreated and you have fetish for being mistreated and being embarrassed and yelled at, come here. Sushi is okay, not the best. The manager is an asshole. The only time I would return to this restaurant is to shove a big piece of FUGU up his butt and take it out to make him eat it from the floor. The manager is disrespectful and arrogant. All these other reviewers must have been paid to write reviews. This place is horrible, I've never been mistreated this bad in my whole restaurant escapades. Our bill was $200 and they complained about us taking too long to eat because we had an extra person. FYI - an extra person will speed up the food consumption process not slow it down. The manager approached us and started to yell. Count him lucky because a big piece of friend fish was about to be shove down his sorry Japanese samurai throat. Do you friends a favor, don't go there. There are many places like Toshi sushi and Oomasa and Hama sushi that taste better and they respect you better. I will never return to this crappy place. The good reviews are probably just paid by the restaurant. Looking forward to see this place close down. They serve you crappy quality if they don't like you. But they reserve the good pieces for their Japanese customers. The chef and restaurant manager should apologize to their customers. Meanwhile, more bad reviews to come on google and rotten tomatoes and twitter. Follow along please. By the way, anyone interested in shoving a big piece of FIST NIGIRI SUSHI with broken pieces of teeth down the sushi Gen's manager's throat?

Hip, Hip, HOORAY -- I VOMITED REPEATEDLY IN THEIR RESTAURANT AFTER EATING THEIR SASHIMI DELUXE PLATTER 燗ND THEY STILL HAD THE F-ING NERVE TO CHARGE ME FOR IT!!! As a preface, I have been eating sushi my entire life (30+ years) ever since I was a young child. 燩ossibly no more than three times in my entire life, including this one incident, have I been sick as a result of eating raw fish. 燞owever, this time, without question, it was due to some of their fish NOT being FRESH and some LOW quality CUTS. �Tonight, I ordered the sashimi deluxe as I had done numerous times before, although, this time I got some slightly less than fresh fish, but the chopped tuna was pretty fishy and immediately made my 爏tomach turn, so i stopped eating pronto. 燗dditionally, all the premium cuts (toro, hamachi, etc...) had this string thick white stuff running all through it and that stuff is completely inedible -- it's like slimy floss. 燬o I very politely asked my waitress to remove the plate and take it off the bill. 燬he refused and said I would need to speak with the manager. 燗s I waited and waited, with this nasty platter in my face I began to feel more and more ill. 營 walked over to the manager and told him I was not feeling well because of the fish and wanted my bill and asked him to remove the sashimi deluxe platter. 燞e had the nerve to say I would NEED to pay for what I had eaten -- I corrected him and said what had made me SICK to my stomach. �The bill came and he attempted to charge me $21 instead of the normal $35 when I hadn't even touched the premium cuts on my platter, and I was literally turning green faced because of the BAD FISH. 燩lus they had made me wait at least 15 minute during this horrible ordeal and I could no longer hold it anymore and I rushed to their restroom to vomit. 燯pon coming out of the restroom, I informed the manager I threw-up and that he should take the sashimi deluxe off the bill, so I could pay it and leave -- again, he refused. 營 sat back down at our table and did not feel comfortable paying for this platter nor was I about to just walk out, but again the urge came to vomit, so I rushed yet again to the restroom to relieve the brewing discomfort in my stomach. �At that point, I had had enough and told the manager that if DID NOT immediately remove the sashimi deluxe from my bill and if I needed to throw up again before he could make it happen it would be happening 爄n the center of the restaurant, so he could see it firsthand. 營 guess he finally realized I really wasn't feeling well and about to lose it, so he conceded and stated he'd take it off the bill -- I find it absolutely ridiculous that I had to take it this far. 燬till they had the nerve to make me wait at minimum another five more minutes 燼nd in that time I again needed to rush off to the restroom and VOMIT. After leaving sushi-gen I vomited in their parking lot about five more times over the course of the next twenty minutes. 燨nly fish came up and after I believe I got most, if not all, of it out of my stomach did I start to feel better. �I TOOK PHOTOS of the whole incident, though, I am somewhat indecisive as to whether I should post them on yelp.... F sushi-gen -- this used to be one of my top sushi joints in LA, but that all changed after tonight!

Absolutely awesome sushi! 燱e put our taste buds in the hands of the sushi chef and tried unusual (for us) sushi like sardine, mackerel, octopus and snapper--all were wonderful, the sardine most redolent of the sea and tasting so fresh like it had just been caught that morning (probably had--this is the freshest fish I have ever eaten). Sushi Gen is constantly bustling and although we had a reservation, we chose to sit at the sushi bar--only complaint (and a minor one given the extraordinary quality) was that we were squeezed in between the wall and beginning of the sushi bar window and couldn't easily point to what we wanted. 營t's in a small strip mall in downtown LA--easy (and cheap) to park early on a weekday evening. 燦ot cheap, but worth every penny given the quality of the fish.

What happened Sushi Gen? You used to be my favorite place!

But when I went back two days ago and ordered sashimi dinner again, all i got was 3 slices of yellow tail, 3 slices of white fish meat (don't know what it was), 2 slices of squid and a bunch of tunas cut in different ways. Me and my co-worker looked at each other and felt cheated because it wasn't how it used to be. 燚isappointing!! ��After all your fame and popularity, it seams that you're cheapening the quality it used to have. �I won't be ordering a sashimi dinner just to have bunch of tuna to fill up my stomach. �Next time, I would rather go for sushi instead.

Now everyone, this is Japanese as good as it gets (without having to fly to Japan). I am sure you will notice once you will have to be in line at 11am before the restaurant opens. I had never seen such a long line in my life. So be prepared! Pros: The best fish I have ever had, sweet, soft, fresh. Price is good for what you get ($15 for a ton of sashimi for lunch). Cons: Must wait for ever to get a table, so if you are hungry don't go there unless you buy a snack on the way. Every time a friend from out of town visits we go there. I really love that place

Ask me what L.A's main food staple is! 營s it hotdogs? 營s there L.A. pizza? 燤aybe there's a Hollywood Carne Asada burritto out there somewhere, but if you ask me, it's California Rolls! It's the only food item that even incorporates a locale into its name, as opposed to the ubiquitous LA street taco? 營n n Out is just one chain. 燬o I digress... Well I was in the middle of a good review until my co-worker came in and asked me for stuff, so I've gotta keep this short and say, the sashimi, tuna and salmon pieces were great. 營 love to order handrolls, and their's did not let me down.

In our desperate search for a sushi fix coupled with a spendthrift attitude, my friend and I trekked all the way to West Hollywood in hopes to try our virgin tongues at Wa Sushi only to find in our disbelief--it is closed on Mondays. And lunch hours are non-existent. So the idea came to mind: Hey, we've never had omakase at Sushi-Gen! So with the plan in mind, we set off into our journey for spectacular sushi in J-town. Dealt with the usual crowd that looms outside of their doors, we waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated at the sushi bar located far into the restaurant near the restroom (I was tipped off by a third party sushi chef that it is the better seat, I cross my fingers). Let me just start off by saying that I appreciate sushi creations by quality and use of variety of modifications to deliver a punch that would resound with a CHO-OISHIIiiii (Very tasty). That may sound like more of a fusion taste, but whatever it is, I was expecting to see some exotic mixtures of fish and unfamiliar tastes. With that said, we were greeted with an appetizing bowl of muzuku with nagaimo, had no idea what it was but it was a welcome change. It was quite slimy but I didn't mind, though I can tell there would be some that would not be able to appreciate it. Then came the barrage of sushi that I'm more familiar with--kanpachi, tuna, uni, aji, hirame, giant clam, etc. All VERY fresh and good, but it was lacking in one department... and that is taste. Not to mention the cuts were a little shy compared to what I am used to, but that is besides the point. The snapper topped with the green sauce (wish I knew what it was, lol) was delicious and is totally what I'm looking for in sushi. Sushi that deserves to be eaten without the aid of wasabi and soy sauce. Sushi that makes you see colors the first time it pairs with your tongue and shifts colors in the mating duration. Honorable mention would have to go to the monkfish liver sushi, first time having it and despite the fact I don't like liver anything, it was surprisingly good! Good job! Got a serving of anago and in my previous experience, anago has always been on the dryer/bland side so I was a bit scared. To my surprise, I liked it! Not bad :) Otherwise, I craved a little more flavor. I craved a little more sauce on each bit (or any sauce for that matter). I tasted quality, which was quite apparent when Sushi-Gen is full house everyday, inventory definitely does not have a chance to become "un-quality." I should of ordered the oyster shooter with the quail egg and a mixture of other unobserved ingredients, big regret. Otherwise, good dining experience! Omakase for 2 came out to be $189 pre-tip, which sorted out to be a little over a bill a head. Would I come back for omakase or regular dine in? Hmm... probably not. Sorry Sushi-Gen, but my heart is still partial to Toros in Alhambra.

FRESH FRESH FRESH! Gen Sushi has the freshest fish in LA. They specialize in serving nigiri and sashimi, NO rolls. Three of us came here on a Saturday night and the wait was about 45 mins, which was definitely well worth it. We sat at the bar and just began naming off types of fishes we wanted - fatty tuna, hamachi, mackerel, uni and the list goes on. Every type of fish was very fresh and tasty. We also ordered the yellowtail head which came with a lot of meat and cooked very well. For 3 people (with beer and sake) the total was about $250. I consider this pretty cheap for the quality of food we received. Will come back for sure!!

Well, It is good, The food quality and service are both nice, very popular. But nothing special for me. Mediocre~ You can park in the small plaza, and mention that you are going to 燬ushi Gen, they will ask the price for sushi gen for your parking. And get validated in Sushi Gen. I had their Chirashi, Sushi deluxe. They are OK, but the cooked fish is excellent! Forgot which one though, based on the grilled fish, I give them Four Stars. Don't expect too much, I think they are slightly over rated here.

I've been here two times now, first for Lunch and most recently for Dinner. After both of my bouts with Sushi Gen, I've made a few conclusions. 1) Hands down BEST SUSHI LUNCH SASHIMI SPECIAL. It's an incredible amount of food and quality for a low, low price of $15. A cornucopia of flavors and freshness! It's wonderful. 2) Expect to wait for seating unless you come extra early for lunch or dinner. Each time we waited around 20 minutes. If the wait is especially long, take a walk around the corner to the Little Tokyo Marketplace! Sooooo much cool stuff in there from the supermarket to the gift shops and one of the rare Video Game Arcades I know of. 3) Park in the Sushi Gen parking lot, sounds like a no-duh but it was only $2.50 for dinner. No need to validate or refill a meter. For dinner we wanted an encore of the Sashimi Lunch goodness we had here the first time. We both ordered Sashimi Lunch Dinner for $26. This dinner includes the usual Miso Soup, Sunomono, and a pickled cold noodle dish. It also comes with a tempura dish with your typical tempura shrimp and assorted veggies. However, to our surprise the Sashimi plate is exactly the same as the lunch except with Tamago! Not that it was a bad thing as that plate is off the hook! So essentially the difference between our first and second experience was $11, which only accounts for a tempura dish, a small pickled noodle dish, and a piece of Tamago on the sashimi plate. Only more reason to come here just for the lunch special ahhhhhh yumminess. I probably won't order that meal again even though it was tasty and filling. Also second time around, I didn't notice it but they charge for hot tea ($1.50). Lame. Still, I love Sushi Gen and I will be back in the future but probably just for lunch.

My friend and I lucked out-we came around 1:30 and we sat at the bar right away. This place has been on my bucket list for a while, so I was one happy camper. And when I left, I was an even happier camper. So fresh, so delicious, and the chefs were very friendly. I had yellowtail sashimi, salmon, japanese mackeral, sweet shrimp sushi and ankimo. Oh, and soft shell crab appetizer. I appreciated that the shrimp heads had the tough neck shells (?) removed-much easier to savor! Just mouth-wateringly goodness that I felt fortunate to have experienced. Be sure to get the french macarons at nearby Frances Bakery. Got there by Metrolink and Red Line-fun day for me.

I was there for lunch 2 times last week because the food was really good and the price was very reasonable. I was there on Monday at around 1130 and waited 20-25 minutes for a table for 2 and then again on Wednesday after 12 and waited for 10-15 minutes for a table for 2. There is usually a waiting list and the wait is usually over 30 minutes, according to my sister. However, both times when I went, it was alright. (guess I was lucky) I love sashimi so both times I ordered its sashimi lunch, which has a big plate of sashimi, grilled salmon, spicy and non spicy tuna, and other stuff. Soup, tofu, sunomono, and rice also come with almost every combo. And the best parts were the food was soooooooooooo damn fresh, tasty, and high in quality, and for all of this you only pay 15 dollars. If you are a fan of uni, try its uni and sashimi combo. It comes with a smaller order of sashimi and a box of uni (check out my photos).

why do people go here? i really don't get why so many people wait to eat here. the sushi isn't that good and the host is a total jerk. we had a reservation for 7pm and half the group got there on time while the other half was parking. the full group got to the restaurant at 7:03pm but the table was given away and the people i was with have been long time customers. in all my years of eating out, i've never come across a restaurant without at least a 10 minute grace period. what if our friends' watches were slow? even 3 star michelins don't do this and this restaurant is far from even getting 1 star. this restaurant is an example of poor service and food quality due to the ridiculous demand. stop giving these people your business. go eat sushi in the westside...hiko, sasabune, zo, kiriko or in studio city. anywhere but here. stop following people here like dumb sheep. i hope more people figure it out and stop going. maybe some humility (and a change with the one host) will turn this restaurant around. i'm convinced people only go here because they live in dtla or near jtown and don't know where else to go in the area. that is the only reasonable explanation. either that or people don't know what good sushi and service is like.

Super fresh, super awesome. This is my favorite sushi place of all time. Can't touch the Spanish mackerel here, and the sashimi is *always* delicious and fresh and melt-in-your-mouth goodness. During prime time, it will be a bit of a wait, but if you come for an early dinner, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the speed with which you are seated. Some street parking, and there's also a garage right across the street.

I never wrote reviews based on my experience with reservation or service, because I always felt food should come first in a restaurant review; but my latest experience with Sushi Gen reservation prompted this review. Even though I understand it is an immensely popular restaurant(and I've eaten there numerous times), it is after all a restaurant, a service industry catering to customers. I made a dinner reservation for 4 earlier in the day but 2 could not make it; so I called a few hours prior to change my reservation to 2 people. The response was that I would have to lose my table and start a new reservation for 2, for either an hour before or 2 hours after the original reserved time because the time slot for table for 2 was completely booked, and I could not have my original table. They will absolutely not accommodate us! Well, I will not go back even if it is the only sushi restaurant in LA!

Sushi-gen has been opened since the 80's I believe (correct me if I'm wrong). 燭hey have been keeping their strict guidelines for many years. 燭hat is something cultural. 燭hat also speaks for it's freshness and taste as well. 燦ot sure about recently at night, because I only go during LUNCH time when they have the fresh stuff...

It wasn't very pleasure visit. I can write a book about how much I don't like this restaurant, but I won't. I'll try to keep it as short as possible. Sashimi was fresh. That's for sure. But I'm not giving five stars just for the freshness. That's how sashimi is supposed to be. Service was mediocre and it was too crowded. I don't know. May be I was there on a wrong date at a wrong time. Over 200 people rated this place with an average of 4 1/2 stars and I'm only giving this place three stars. May be I'll try this place again IF someone takes me for a treat. 燨therwise, I probably won't go again.

The best sashimi I've had in the states so far. It's authentic and fresh. All the thanks goes to my wonderful Fourth Year Japanese teacher, who told me about this place. I hate the large crowd and long wait (to get a table and to get your food), but it's worth the trip, JUST for the quality and deliciousness of the fish here. The salmon sashimi is my favorite-- it's not on the menu, but they offer it on the paper you write your order on. It *used to be* $15 for 6 or 7 generous pieces of fresh, succulent salmon, but now it's $21. I swear by the salmon belly at Sushi Ota (in Pacific Beach), but this salmon (even if it's not the belly part, I assume) is also orgasm-worthy. Eating this sashimi makes the world stop and time go slow. I wish I could come here once a week. My only gripe is that none of the entries on the menu serve raw salmon sashimi (or sushi, I believe) at all. Even the regular and the deluxe sashimi entries DO NOT have any raw salmon! The deluxe has a portion of salted cooked salmon, which isn't nearly as good. Thus, my only question is, WHYYY??! It's the yummiest fish they have there, and it doesn't get featured! Oh, the agony. I usually order the sashimi deluxe and the salmon sashimi, and it's more than enough food for two. The tuna sashimi is also excellent. The first time I visited, I ordered the sashimi + tempura combo plate. My tempura came out relatively fast, and my sashimi took forever to get. Once I got the sashimi, I was shocked at the quantity of food (even for the combo dinner entry), and could not finish it. :( As we all know, leftover raw fish is not recommended for eating. Cons: again, the long wait. The parking lot isn't too great or big, and you have to pay to park there. Also, the place is pretty tiny, and I've heard it used to be even smaller, back in the day. Also, the servers are running around like crazy in between all the tiny spaces separating the seating areas, trying to get everyone's orders. It is noisy there, even with the no-cell-phone rule, so it's not so much a quiet and romantic place. BUT, it is the perfect place for the freshest, most delicious, and most authentic sashimi at a reasonable price.

My friend and I were there last night. Parking was $2.5 with validation at the Honda Plaza just across Office Depot. There was a fairly long line. I heard it wasn't because it's Saturday evening-- this place is busy during the day as well. I can't tell whether the food was good or super good. I know it wasn't bad anyway. We ordered the sashimi deluxe for $21. Hot tea was $1.5 per person. Our server was friendly and quite efficient but the guy at the front desk was not very attentive and slightly intimidating. Had it not been with my friend, I might have walked away. I do have a tendency to walk away when I think people are rude.

I was treated to a meal here by one of the biggest diamond dealers in LA. The details are fuzzy - all I can remember is sheer pleasure. It didn't hurt that the man spared no expense in what he ordered. I'd recommend Komasa over this place, honestly. The food is *basically* as good and at about a third of the price. (Or so I'd estimate - I never saw the bill, though I heard rumors.) I'd pay the extra for the uni at Sushi-Gen, though.

I finally experienced Sushi Gen after hearing about it for over a year. 燨n an early Wednesday afternoon (5:30p), I was able to walk in and sit down at the bar. 營 ordered most of what I normally do, but did ask the chef for a recommendation or two. 燞ere's the breakdown: Uni - pretty good quality, but I have had better at Wa Sushi and Sachi. Yellowtail - delicious, fresh, very good and highly recommend Red Snapper - fresh, delicious with the sauce they put on Spicy Tuna Handroll - not a big fan of the tuna in this one, the only item I would steer away from Spanish Mackeral - so glad I asked for a recommendation, they prepare it with enough flavor that you don't need soy sauce. 燬ooooo Good.

This place is one of the best sushi places I've ever been to. The best way to go is the omakase route. The sushi chef picks out the best of the day and serves you till you are finished. Of course you can ask for your favorites but they keep the fish coming. They have the freshest fish I have had in a LA. The other reviews here say all that needs to be said but I encourage you to try this place. Might be a little bit pricey for some, but the quality more then makes up for it. Seating at the sushi bad a must. Another note, make sure you get the nigiri and/or sashimi. You can do without the rolls.

This is a very well-known sushiya among the Japanese in Los Angeles area. So you can't go wrong with this place if you are looking for any authentic traditional sushi experience. I had deluxe sushi combination and chirashi deluxe. They were pretty good. Most of the sushi neta melted in my mouth and the temperature of the sheri was just about the same as body temperature, which is the perfect condition. 爄t made the rice feel so comfortable in mouth and it also made freshness of the sushi neta stand out. I haven't tried the Omakase yet so there's not much more I can say. But from my 5 visits here, I can say that Sushi Gen is a really good place for authentic sushi experience, where sushi neta melts in your mouth and the rice tastes perfect.

Fried shrimp head, miso soup~ Overall, the experience was excellent~!! even tho we waited more than an hour when we had reservation already, but the quality of the foods make it totally worth it~ 2 people spent around $140~!! very fair price~ cant wait to come back~!!

Fresh fish, imported japanese sushi chefs, and a long line before the place opens.... this place is probably worth every penny if you are into sashimi. You definitely want to sit at the sushi bar if you are there strictly for the sashimi. I still can't get over the fact that there was a line before the restaurant opened, that just tells you how great it is that people are willing to stand out in the cold to grab a seat by the sushi bar. What more do I need to say!

Went here about 3 months ago to visit my former professor. 燗te at this place and all i can say is that if you are a sushi lover....This place is the REAL DEAL...Japanese food is always going to be priced a bit high but it's probably the insurance that they have to purchase.... 燭his place has fresh as you can get sushi. 燩resentation is clean and visually pleasing.

I really don't need to be writing another review about how this is some real amazing sushi. But I will say that, as of now, I can barely remember any place that has better sushi! ( I have been to Hokkaido and stuff too, unfortunately probably not to all the right places). So, I'll proceed with my list of favorites and possibly some tips? Upon reading lots of reviews here, it seems like most people take advantage of the sashimi deluxe and eat at tables and stuff. People, you don't get to appreciate the true awesomeness of Sushi-Gen by sitting at the tables! I mean, the deluxe is great for price + quality and all, but people can't expect to be blown away by that. I truly believe that the best way to have the Sushi-Gen experience is by sitting at the bar! Now, my favorite chef of all is Chef Masa, but that could be because he seems to know exactly what type of sushi I'm into, and he's much more adventurous with me. Another good option is Kazu, who also seems to be a veteran. The sushi bar is no doubt much pricer (possibly double the price of the sashimi deluxe and stuff), however the quality of the food is just completely better. Boyfriend and I used to sit at the tables, until one day we braved the bar. Needless to say, there was no going back. Shelling out that extra 80 dollar difference to sit at the bar was worth it for us. Personally, their staples of awesomeness are definitely the Toro and Uni. But, because I tend to like things that other people don't order as often, I'm going to have to vouch for their lemon-salted halibut fin (seared) and the Ankimo with ponzu. Also, try coming during the 爋pening hours, or at least before 7pm. Unless you want to wait 30-45 minutes, don't come between the hours of 7-8:30pm. No kidding. After 8:30 pm works too, but you do run the risk of them running out (gasp!) of the best sushi (They've run out of hamachi belly and uni and toro on me once....I was sad). The chefs are real friendly-- the bar is like a family atmosphere, so don't be afraid to chat them up!

I only tried their sashimi and sushi and I have to say their sushi is very fresh and delicious. Their sashimi deluxe is the number one dish, as I was recommended by my friend, and I was totally in love with it. ALL of the sashimi, even ones that I would not have ordered by myself, tasted terrific. Not only is their most popular dish, the sashimi deluxe, a wonderful experience, but also, their other sushi were great too. So all in all, there is no question about the quality of their food. However, my only complaint is that, because the restaurant is so popular and so many people go there, I feel that their service is not good enough, which is not a huge problem since many popular restaurants are like that. I highly recommend this restaurant, but please prepare to wait in line unless you arrive before the restaurant opens.

We were told the wait was 45 minutes, but ended up waiting for an hour and 20 minutes. The big question is, was it worth the wait? What we ordered: As appetizer, monk fish liver ($6) and salt grilled hamachi (yellowtail) head ($15). Two of us shared a sashimi deluxe ($35), two bottles of large Sapporo ($7 each), no rice ($3), no miso ($3 for a very small bowl), no sake. The waitress was pleasant and efficient. With 20% tip, the bill was $90. Not exorbitant for a nice Japanese dinner for two, but neither would it qualify as cheap eat. What we got: the monk fish liver was rich and flavorful. But then, there is no chef magic in this dish. The liver pretty much comes from the distributor as is, the chef just cuts off a piece and serves it with ponzu, chopped scallion and tobiko. No points added. The hamachi head: I am used to having more rock salt rubbed on and a little more burnt. They probably choose to use less salt to let the real taste of the fish come through. No points deducted. Lastly, the sashimi deluxe for two came with most of the varieties served in very small pieces (thumbnail size), which means the restaurant was likely using side cuts and corners that are close to the tendons, i.e, not prime cut. Also, piling small pieces together makes the portion look bigger. Not a nice trick. Points off. On the positive side, the dish had good variety. Two slices of octopus were the basic thaw-and-serve, no surprise there. The three very tiny slices of squid was fine, enough to tickle the palate. A sizable lump of spicy tuna was tasty, but still, like the squid and the octopus, it's cheap stuff. A pile of salmon skin shaving had already lost its crunch, and had to rely on its oiliness and burnt flavor to carry the day. There was one lone cooked shrimp, a slice of tamago (Japanese sweet egg), a small pile of tiny red snapper pieces, and two piles of tiny tuna pieces. Next, there were four small slices of flounder/sea bass/amadai, and two normal size slices of salmon. So far, everything was good, though nothing spectacular. But wait, right in the center of the dish was four good size slices of hamachi, firm and fresh. Impressive. And... whoa, what's that behind the hamachi? Five slices, I say again, five good size slices of toro (tuna belly). You hear it right, we got toro, and lots of it. The slices were classic melt-in-your-mouth tender with great oily taste. For the toro and the hamachi alone, lots of points added. Four or five star, you think? Not so fast. Restaurants are about not just the food, but also the ambiance, the convenience and the service. The service was ok. Sushi-Gen is small, always very crowded, crammed and has very little d閏or or atmosphere. The wait was unbearably long, yet they did not have any waiting area inside (there were four chairs next to the door and that's it). They would not take your phone number to call you when you are up, so you must stay and wait for over an hour, or come back periodically to check in. The two guys at the host stand were surly. Many people stood inside to wait, and one by one they were told to get out of the way. We came back from outside after the 45 minutes wait, and had to stay inside because they were about to lock up the door. The whole lot of us were physically leaning against the back of the chairs of some sushi bar diners. Worst of all, they are draconian toward diners. At the host stand there are notices, one after another, that said: no smoking (fine, that's good); no laptop use (ditto), no cell phone (I don't like people talking on the phone while dining, but disallowing it? That's going too far); if you sit at the sushi bar you must order everything a-al-carte, with four orders minimum per person; all diners must be present or you won't get seated (we witnessed two parties turned away for that reason); and written in two different notices: we reserve the right to refuse service to anybody (please sir, I want some more sushi); the list goes on. Remember Harry Potter Order of the Pheonix, when evil Professor Umbridge made one new rule after another, and you see Filch nailing the new orders all over the wall? Now you get the idea. Bottom line: Do you like eating really late? We got there at 8:20PM; we started eating at almost 10PM and that was not by choice (they locked the door at 9:30). This place is all about the food and the food only. If you want good sashimi and don't care about time or comfort, this may be your place. But for the same money or perhaps a little more, there are lots of good choices around town, where you won't have to wait for over an hour, endure the attitudes of surly staff, sit over the shoulder of other diners, and beg them to do you a favor and take your money. You are the customer. Don't torture yourself. Four stars for the quality and value of the food. One star for everything else. Two stars overall... and I am being nice because, after all, I did get toro.

WOW WOW WOW!!!! Did I mention WOW? This place was amazing!!! I drove over an hour to get here based on the stellar reviews to treat my mom to a special birthday lunch, and although I was apprehensive on taking my mom on her special day to a place I had never tried myself before, all I have to say is WOW! Not only did Sushi-gen not disappoint, but it exceeding my expectations! I love sushi, and this is by far one of, if not the best experiences I've had. The place is an un-pretentious casual friendly restaurant with EXCELLENT sushi. My mom and I sat at the bar where you can only order sushi, but after the drive, that was all that I wanted to have anyways. The fish was all amazingly fresh and the staff was very friendly and very quick to serve you. The fish was so fresh and so buttery and full of it's natural oils that it was like trying real sushi for the first time, and not the frozen re-thawed out ones we have probably all experienced. 燱e were also very lucky, because we didn't arrive until around 12:30pm on a Thursday and expected to have to wait for 40 minutes or so, but we waited only about 10 minutes! I definitely recommend sitting at the sushi bar if you are planning on having sushi only. The sushi chefs are great and you really create a rapport with them, the service is fast, and you can order whenever you want without having to wait for the waiter/tress. I have only been here once due to distance but it's SOOO worth it if you're close by, and even if you're not like me, if you're heading up that way, stop by the sushi will make your mouth water!

Best sushi I've had in L.A. and in California so far, fish and rice combination has a flavor that closely matches what's in Japan. Prices are too high and the sake list is laughable. It gets really crowded on weekends so get there early or be ready to wait a while! I would not go with a big group of friends. Two people will wait 15 minutes tops, four people more like 30 to 45 minutes. Bottom line...go there to reminisce about Japan's sushi~ drink at home!

I have to give this place 5 stars! They serve the best sashimi ever with such reasonable (unusually cheap?!) price. Since I had been here, I've always compare other sushi places with Sushi Gen. I tried even more expensive places but man~ Sushi Gen is still unbeatable! Lunch special is really really special with the variety, quantity, quality, and the price of the meal. I always get sashimi special. Their fish is so tender, soft, and fresh. I don't know which part of fish they use. The fish tasted like it could melt in your mouth! I thought about taking out one star because they only serve salmon salad instead of sliced salmon 爏ashimi, but I couldn't because the fish is just too good to be true for less than $15! The wait for lunch is awfully long (Mon to Fri only). I still think it's worth it! I loved it so much I even came for dinner. Dinner gets more expensive and not much more food, but I think the price is still decent with its quality. After all, I cannot always afford to wait in line for lunch. :P I hate that I'm moving out of LA. How can I find such a good sushi place with this kind of price in the Bay Area?! :(

5 star for the quality of the sashimi (prices taken into consideration) The uni dinner is heavenly, though a bit pricey. good bargain for uni-lover. For a refreshing and deliiicious lunch, opt for the sashimi lunch (which is way cheaper than its sashimi dinner - $16), which includes steamed tofu appetizer, miso soup, rice, as well as the sashimi plate (that is pretty accomodating, i have to say). Now, the downside? the waiting time can be a drag! especially if you have a party bigger than 4. I usually like to pop out either at 1pm for lunch (which is near closing time 2pm) or 8.30/9pm for dinner - which is perfect time and you dont have to squeeze with other people! Overall, sushi gen is still my fav place to go when i have that raw fish craving! de-lii-ciouuss!

Japanese people have told me about Sushi Gen, so I had reasonably high expectations going in. They did not fail me. If you are looking for hip, young, trendy, famous, Hollywood, and all that jazz and pay for a premium, go somewhere else. If you want yummy raw fish, do try Sushi Gen. It was not cheap as the bill came out to about $80 per person, but then again we ate a LOT. If you want to park in the plaza's lot, pay $2.50 upfront for 3 hours (with validated ticket). They'll start charging you if you're there for too long. -- Service - 4 stars The wait was unbearable, but I won't hold that against the restaurant. The hostess was very friendly and assured us that we get our seats at the sushi bar. And even though we sat in the very corner right next to the kitchen, our hot teas were refilled in a timely manner, and dishes brought/taken away quickly. -- Ambiance - 3 stars The place was surprisingly small and cozy. None of that snooty modern decor- there was a lot of wood inside. It was a little crowded but not too noisy, and the sushi bar was fun. Sit at the sushi bar if possible, you'll get to know the chefs and they will apparently hook you up. I saw several regulars getting something special. It's a fun, cozy and friendly place without the 'modern' decor that, sadly, is sometimes evidence of the owners trying too hard to make the place classier and charge you extra for mediocre sushi. I really didn't care for the ambiance, I just wanted some good sashimi, and they did not disappoint. -- Food - 5 stars The fish was fresh and delicious. Once I saw the fish, I didn't bother with the rolls; I need to have as much sushi and sashimi as possible when there is good fish available. I think we had toro, tuna, uni, yellowtail, sweet shrimp, salmon, albacore, fluke fin, eel handroll, and a few other things.. They were all DELICIOUS. I was beyond stuffed by the time we were done with our meal, but was very happy. For any sushi lovers out there, Sushi Gen offers fresh raw fish- what more could you ask for?

So my girlfriend had been raving about Sushi Gen for a long time, especially since we always passed it when we went to Aloha Cafe next door (also a really good place in the same strip mall), and when my mom came to town we finally took the dive. I felt like I was back in Tokyo at one of the local haunts I went to when visiting, and the fish was so good. You may be turned off by the price and a small menu that you find online, but that's shouldn't stop you. First off, most of the dinners come with a ton of food (salad, soup, rice etc etc.), so much so that my mom was full on the sides/apps before her main dish appeared. They also offer a lot of appetizers and their meals a al carte, which can be great for the foodie looking to try everything. Though if you are a fish lover, I suggest that at least one of you get the sushi or sashimi combo, its guaranteed to be a crowd pleaser.

Best sushi. Period. Seating at the bar is highly recommended. Toro was amazing. Girlfriend asked for seconds, and she usually doesn't! Also ordered oyster shooters, uni, kampachi, amaebi, monkfish liver, albacore and a few others that I can't quite remember, but they were all very fresh and well cut. Rice was perfectly made as usual. Our chef was also very friendly. Staff is overall nice, though they seem to be running around a lot more than other places. Can't blame them, the place is always packed. Had to run to car to grab girlfriend's passport for an ID check because of the oyster shooters. "No id, no shooters for you" Well, I guess that's a compliment. For the quality and variety, price was not excessive. HIghly recommended if you are a sushi fan.

I ordered a dinner set, Uni. I had a couple of Uni Sushi in Japan, so I was interested to get that in SUSHI-GEN. The Food The UNI set was really creamy because they gave me a whole plate sized. I would not recommend UNI. My party ordered different dinner sets, SOUL FISH and they were good. The sushi was not a disappointment. SALMON & TUNA SASHIMI was juicy. The Service I always find Japanese people very respectful towards their customers. Atmosphere I felt like I was actually in Japan. I gave 3 stars due to my mistake of ordering a very creamy food and later I got a little sick.

I got served a boatload of ATTITUDE with my sushi. I went here with my family in August. 燭he quality of their sushi was at best okay especially given the price. 燪uality is comparable to Genki Sushi but with prices to match some of the better sushi bars in Tokyo. 燭heir steamed scallops were a bit smelly and fishy in taste - I didn't think they were very fresh. 燬erviced was rushed. As we sat waiting for our last dish yellowtail collar to be served, the manager rudely came over to ask if we wanted to pack up the leftovers on the table. 燱e told him we were still waiting for a dish. 燭here were 6 of us, and up to that point we had been at the restaurant no more than 1 1/2 hours. 燞e just wanted us to leave so he can turnover the table. 營t turned out the waitress forgot to jot down our yellowtail collar order: we were wondering why it was taking so long to cook the yellowtail; the mgr was agitated that we were holding up the table. 燘ottomline, it was a misunderstanding. 燦ot being experienced enough to handle the situation, the mgr became abrasive and even more rude to us when a simple apology would have diffused the tension. I'll gladly pay good money for good food and good service....but not for BAD ATTITUDE. 燦o one deserves this kind of treatment from any serviced-based establishment. 燬ushi-Gen: no, thank you and never again.

I guess am not as much of a sushi snob as I originally thought because I have no idea why people are obsessed with this place. Food: So yes, the fish is quite fresh. $200 to feed four people fresh? I'm not yet sold. We ordered a seemingly endless array of sashimi, nigiri sushi, and a few rolls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_�. I say seemingly endless because it certainly wasn't. I was starving at the end of this dinner because we were trying to keep the cost down. My favorites were the ikura (salmon eggs), pickled gourd rolls, sweet shrimp, and the red snapper. If you've never had pickled gourd before, you really haven't lived. It's tangy, crispy, and best of all neon yellow. The sweet shrimp is severed and served in two pieces. First the head is deep fried, feelers and all. Next, the body is served raw as nigiri sushi (on rice). I loved the head. The body was a thumbs up as well, but probably less so. I wasn't blown away by the texture or taste of anything on this plate unlike my experience at Sushi Go 55. Perhaps because of the long wait I just ate way too fast. Service: Expect an hour wait or more for dinner and equally crazy hours for lunch. According to friends who are loyal customers, it's possible for your wait to exceed the operating hours of the restaurant. Have a backup plan ready and definitely do not go here when you are starving. You might die. Atmosphere: Pretty low key inside. It looks like a sushi restaurant with dimmed lights and big comfy booths. I wouldn't call it spacious so be wary if you are bringing very large parties. Synopsis: I've heard it's better for lunch. Although the price is significantly cheaper you essentially get the same meal. After almost starving while waiting for food, starving while eating food, and facing an exorbitant bill, I think I'm done with high end sushi.

From Utah to Los Angeles, what an unwelcome vibe. We had a friend visit us from Utah so we figured we'd take him to what others rave as one of the best sushi places in Downtown LA...I guess they are too good, since we arrived at 5:16pm and they were preparing to open at 5:30pm. 營 asked if we could please wait in their lobby, since it was cold and raining outside. �NO you cannot wait inside". 燬o we step outside and try to bear it out, but my friend has to pee so he goes in to ask if he may use the bathroom: "NO" 燦ot even a sorry, or this is our policy, etc. 燱e would have been fine waiting outside if they had at least allowed him to use the bathroom. 燭he rude cold Japanese man working there Monday Jan. 23 has no compassion, appreciation, or consideration for another human being. 燛specially in a tough economy, with 3 customers, you'd think they care about new business, especially walking into an empty place nearly ready for customers. I'll be sure never to even bother trying to try the Snobby Sushi-Gen since they don't care of the older generation of more considerate people from out of state. �I hope the owner reads this and address his staff, I would fire that rude man on the spot after reading such a review.

This was hands down one of the best sushi experiences I have ever had. The food was extremely fresh and delicious, there wasn't a thing we ordered (and we ordered a lot) that we didn't like. Everything was fresh and delicious. Service was excellent...can't wait to go back.

One of the best sushi places I've been. It is neatly tucked at a small plaza in Little Tokyo in downtown LA. I was there for a night and thought I'd check the highest rated sushi joint in LA. Not disappointed. I tried to make a reservation, but on a Tuesday night they were too busy to take reservations at 7pm. So I went over there and for a seat of one, I waited about 20 minutes. Well worth it consider the food that I had. A very packed restaurant, but the waiters were attentive for such a busy hour. I ordered mockfish liver for appetizer, and for nigiri I had otoro, ama ebi, uni, salmon, and unagi. The mockfish liver was, perhaps only to my personal taste, not very delectable. The smell was a bit too strong for me, but that might just be me. I tried toro for the first time, and to my surprise it was not as amazing as I had heard/hoped. Perhaps all the hype and talk had gotten my expectations to skyrocket too much. The ama ebi, however, was simply amazing. The ama ebi, which is also called sweet shrimp, was very fresh and chewy, not to mention flavorful. It was so good that I just had to order twice. The restaurant also made the shrimp heads into fried delicacies, which were incredibly succulent with a drizzle of lemon juice. The uni was also one of the best that I've tasted, with the sweetness still lingering in your mouth long after you had savored the sushi. Unagi was great, melt in your mouth status, but the salmon was alright for me, above average but not on par with the ama ebi and uni. Aside from the sushi, I also had the deluxe sashimi platter, which was a huge plate full of fresh sashimi for only $35. Well worth it in my opinion. My bill comes up to be $71 for the nigiri plates, $6 for the mockfish appetizer, and $35 for the deluxe sushi platter. I had an amazing experience at the place, and I would definitely visit it again for the uni, sashimi, and most importantly, the ama ebi.

I sat at the sushi bar and had the chef choose everything. I had some nice toro, yellowtail, sea urchin (not my favorite but I hear it's the freshest here) and a variety of other sashimi. Everything tasted very fresh and the bill was about $55 for 5 different items. Pretty steep but the line out the door suggests I was right to come here. I'll be back but will try some other non-sashimi items. Long wait all the time so be prepared to stand outside for awhile. It's in the run-down Honda Center strip mall so don't expect anything nice in terms of vibe though the inside is just fine.

My go to spot when it comes to sushi. 燛verything is fresh and reminds me of when I was in Japan. 燭he quality is unequal as well as the sushi chefs talent in creating these masterpieces. 營t gets crowded though but worth the wait. 燭his was the first place I went with a friend and tried Ankimo (Monk fish liver) which is surprising good but I am not into anymore. 燭he halibut, red snapper, halibut fin, salmon, spicy tuna handroll are very good. 燭he yellowtail and the albacore are excellent. �You can tell a sushi place is good when you order tuna (maguro) and it melts in your mouth and has no skin (which makes it chewy and not very good)

At first, considering the price, the food is decent(lunch set is around $20 ~ $30 w. tips and tax). Sushi Gen is one of the honest Sushi restaurants in terms of the price in Los Angeles.

Take it from someone Japanese, Sushi Gen is great. It's not the place if you want those trendy LA sushi rolls, but a great place for authentic Japanese food, and great, super fresh fish. I recommend the sashimi dinner. It has a little of everything and it's a great price. The only reason it's not 5 star is that the wait can be pretty horrendous. Notwithstanding, I'll wait for great sushi. I don't think there's a better place for low key, fresh sushi.

Wonderful quality food at the sushi bar. Tried a host of different meals. Went around 1230pm but unfortunately 4 item minimum per person which can easily cost up to $50. The wait for tables was a little extreme, 20-30 minutes for two people. I've been to a sushi bar or two before and can appreciate the style. It's expensive but pleasant to sit quietly and just enjoy the chef's food. Although the options are limited the sushi menu is quite diverse. I tried Albacore to Fatty Tuna and everything in between, all of which was superb. In particular those two items were extremely soft. The wasabi on the white rice adds a little kick to each roll. I tried the octopus as well for the novelty which was a little too chewy. A small bottle of Asahi coats the meal great, probably a good idea to get a drink of some sort. All in all very enjoyable if not extremely pricey. I'm not sure how it is at night but during the day a nice, slightly relaxing place to get full on great sushi.

I really like this place, I think it's right there among the best in LA.

I remember going to this restaurant even as a little kid with my parents. And even now, when we're out in Little Tokyo or when we crave good sashimi, we eat here. The sashimi is really fresh and we almost ALWAYS order the famous $15 lunch/sashimi special. The spicy tuna that's included with the special is superb. The quantity for the special (about 3 slices of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and other sashimi) really makes the deal worth it since the quality of the fish is really fish. Every time we come here though, we have to wait at least 45 minutes - so just be warned!

Lunch at the sushi bar was just ok. The fish is very fresh however, service sucked and for the prices charged, 爐hey really skimp on the ingredients placed in their rolls. We also had a trainee who was very nice but the preparation was not good, tataki dish had chunks of fish cut too big and was way oversauced and the ankimo was overcooked! Yuck! Service: At $80 I do not want to have indigestion from placing 5 people next to you in a space for 4 and a waitress who practically throws the hand wipes at you, seems irritated that you are there and you can't even get a water refill. This is a place to get a cheap and fresh meal as long as you stick to the prefab specials. For the sushi bar pricing, I will go somewhere more service oriented. Dinner at the sushi bar is a similar experience. You still feel rushed as if they make their money on turnover. But at those prices I want to savor the food.

With all the other omakase joints closed on a Monday, we gave Sushi Gen a shot. The wait was actually somewhat lengthy. The fish quality is definitely fresh, but the taste is mediocre. For mediocre tasting omakase, it was definitely over priced. There is, without a doubt, quality in the freshness of their selection. The problem is that the selection isn't anything out of the ordinary. We were given muzuku with nagaimo as an appertizer. It was then followed by a selection of tuna, kampachi, uni, aji, hirame, giant clam, amaebi, monk fish liver, anago, etc. I'm used to having more creative and adventurous sushi. Thus far, I prefer Toros in Alhambra. The cuts are not as generous as Toros nor was it as tasteful. At Toros, you know you'll never have the need to use any soy sauce and the wasabi is the real deal. I also did not like that Sushi Gen did not provide an itemized bill. Sushi Gen is a great place if you prefer the more common selection of sushi and traditional taste.

Ahem. I'm very white and enjoy my sentiments of sushi-elitism just as much as my other fellow white-ians on this site do, and I can safely say that my recent trek to Sushi Gen - after, of course, having been coming here all my life before any of you/since the dawn of time/I MADE & INVENTED SUSHI - was one of utmost astounding wonderment. I called the owner up (which is me by the way) and demanded he know of my impending presence. His exact words: �yes". I hopped in my G5 as fast as I could - I live in Tokyo, Japan, [in the heart of Pyongyang] mind you - instructed my pilot to set a course for Downtown, Los Angeles and off we were into the sunset to this most sought-after of Sushi joints. I landed the G5 in the enormous parking structure considerately provided for all and showed the valet my security credentials. Jose (the valet) and I shared a laugh as we caught up on old times - on account of our not seeing each other for such a temporal allotment of nothingness. My 5 girlfriends and I- the 5 of them completely OK and already complacent with the fact I bone all of them simultaneously - walk up to Sushi Gen's entrance, shoving everyone away to their deaths in our path. We all authoritatively take our seats and foresightedly demand our meal be free on the grounds of it being too delicious for any normal, serf human to fathom. My 5 GF's and I then commenced having sex on the sushi bar while the owner regaled us with stories from the old country �about how samurai used secret progressions to attain the meaning of life). I then acceded into God-status and took many, many lives that day. Oh yeah... the sushi was good.

On the upside, I did a much better job of eating in front of my date here than I had on our first sushi date (at Mosun). 燤y hands worked better, and I could take bites larger than a cucumber sliver at a time. 燬o that rocked. 營t's always nice to feel that simple things, like eating, are not over one's head. I loved Sushi Gen's authentic dishes- I hadn't had yama kake (mountain yam) in a dish in L.A. before, and I love it in all its slimy glory- it comes in their seaweed salad, which was a great little dish (little being the operative word). 燭here was a good variety of fish, an array of which I had not yet encountered outside of S.F. If there is an upside, that must mean there was a downside too, otherwise this would be a 4 or 5 star review. 燬o: what the hell is up with the lack of prices on the menu?? 燭his isn't a $300 fine dining meal where I am throwing caution to the wind and don't want to know what everything costs; this is a jeans-and-a-t-shirt Monday night "Let's grab a bite to eat" meal and not a single fish had any pricing next to it, for any size. 燘ased on how little the salad items we got cost, the fish must have been outrageous; like $30-40 for two small orders of sashimi (scallop and salmon, not anything pricey). 燱e both just sort of stared at one another, and the bill, confusedly, and each put down a credit card. 營'm a small eater, and I wasn't even full, yet I spent far more than normal at a sushi restaurant of this caliber. In retrospect, I wish I would have just flipped the damn bill over and looked at what each sashimi order was priced at, b/c the not knowing is still driving me mad. 燭here's a lot to be said for fledgling relationships: you're giddy, eating is hard, and you're so overwhelmed by the amazingness of the girl sitting across from you that you figure, hey, maybe it's normal for a small order of sashimi to cost three times as much as one would anticipate based on the price of the non-fish menu items.

you remember what i said about my conversation policy with restaurant staff? 爐he "yes, no, thank you, please" part...well, sushi gen is the place where you don't need to say anything other than those 4 words to their staff (not because the waitress didn't speak english!!!). 爋ur waitress was very attentive and quick, yet never overly intrusive and rushing. my bf and i ordered a sushi deluxe combo with salmon skin salad and mozuku, a large tempura combo, and spicy tuna rolls. 爓e never had mozuku (wet seaweed with white foam on top) before but we devoured it. 爄 enjoyed the salad more than my bf which he thought was too fishy (i reminded him that it is made with salmon skin). 爐he tempura dish had 4 large shrimps, a set of eggplants, zucchini, sweet potato, and some other veggies, coated with light, crisp batter. 爐he spicy tuna rolls were really tiny (no prices were listed for a la carte items), but very delicious. 燼s for the sushi, i had better. 爃owever, the rice had the perfect vinegar and sweet flavor to it...one of the best sushi rice i ever had!!! more than anything, our waitress really made our dining experience pleasant. 爄 wish she can give a restaurant service 101 lecture to all aspiring waiters and waitresses. �p.s. - there's about 30 to 60 min wait on weekend nights, but use the time to walk around little tokyo. 爄t will work up your appetite and you can buy some dessert for later.

Parking is a hassle and Gen should really consider taking reservations for the sushi bar. 燭he bar seats are the best in the house, so naturally they get mobbed, and the waiting area leaves plenty to be desired. 燭hat said, there's a reason for the madness at the bar - Sushi Gen does a delicious omakase. I met a college friend driving in from Orange County and by the time he showed up and we got seated, I was impatient to eat. 燬ervice is incidental to the Gen sushi bar, but I'm okay with that. 燨ur waitress was quick and impersonal, but efficient and polite. 燱e asked for omakase, gave her our preferences, and she relayed them over to our chef. We asked for a combination of sushi and sashimi, with a concentration on fish, as per the preferences of my pickier friend. 燭he chef was communicative all the way through, and though it was omakase, we were very much in control. First came a cold appetizer of mozuku seaweed and yam, a refreshing vinegary bowl to start us off. 燦ext was a sashimi assortment of kanpachi (amberjack), chuutoro (medium fatty tuna), and sake (salmon), all sea-fresh and toothsome. 燗nkimo (monkfish liver) in ponzu sauce with diced scallions was not my favorite, but this was my first brush with ankimo, so I have nothing to compare it to. 燗lso, I had eaten six scoops of ice cream earlier in the day, making me a bit sensitive to the richness. 燭he albacore tataki salad that followed was much more palatable, with nice slabs of fish served simply with greens in a light dressing. 燗fter this, it was all sushi: tai (red snapper), amaebi (sweet shrimp, fried head and all), hirame (fluke), aji (horse mackerel), saba (mackerel), iwashi (sardine), and unagi (freshwater eel). 燛very piece was good, with the tai, the amaebi, and the saba standing out past the others. I'd been wanting to try Gen for a long time and I'm glad that I finally did. 燗t the end of the day, it wasn't the best sushi I've ever had, but it was definitely quality, and I'd be happy to go back.

you know that axe commercial where, all of a sudden, a girl starts dancing in front of a man while chanting, "Bow-chica-bow-wow"? well that's what went on in my head when i saw my lunch special sashimi plate. AND!!!!!! I would've started dancing and chanting that porno music too if it weren't for the 2384203498 people that were there. if you look at the pictures, the sashimi lunch special is pretty much the same thing as the dinner sashimi special except without the tempura. Holy crap!! All of that for 13 bucks!?? Bow-chica-bow-wow~! haha. The fish was very fresh. The cuts were very big and there was a huge variety of fish that was served on that plate. Along with the lunch special: miso soup, rice, tofu, seaweed something, and neverending green tea. Their green tea is good, but tastes a little powder-y which i don't like too much. What a ggggggrrrrreeeeeaaaaat(Tony the tiger....sorry that was lame) place to eat lunch. I'm going to try and eat here for lunch every week. b p.s. when the old man host isn't there, a beautiful hostess replaces him. Beautiful. Bow-chica-bow-wow~!

can i just say ohmyeffinggee!!! my first time here was a couple years ago for a second (mercy) date. 爋ur first date was pretty disastrous and i decided to give him a second chance... i AM nice after all! �p well... actually, it was because he did bribe me by offering to take me to his secret sushi spot... hehe. 爏hhhhh... don't tell him i told you that! but let's just say, the zero turned into a hero after that experience. 爀verything was so melt-in-your-mouth-mmm-mmm-gooooood that each time i tried some new and exotic fish (that he was ordering in japanese i might add), he was becoming more and more attractive with each bite. 爐he sushi was so orgasmic i almost jumped the guy right at the sushi bar... he actually morphed from insecure and blubbering into suave and debonair... this place does wonders for the average romantically-challenged guy! don't bother sitting at a table... go right to the bar and just tell them to give you whatever specials they have. 燿on't bother ordering the usual fanfare you can get anywhere else (i.e. tuna, salmon, etc.)... ORDER THE SPECIALS! 爄 do recommend the yellowtail toro, however. 爄t is so buttery-melt-in-your-mouth smooth... it's like a choir of angels singing in your mouth! 燼nd don't bother ordering anything from their menu. 爕ou haven't had mothereffin sushi until you've eaten sushi at sushi-gen. 爄'm serious! as for the hero, we dated for about half a year and parted ways after realizing we didn't have much in common except love for food but i am definitely grateful to him for introducing me to this gem. in any case, my love affair with sushi lives on...

You can totally judge a dude by his food. Any guy who eats omakase will get a PLUS +++++++++ in my book. That said, I certainly don't want my guy to be a frequent patron at Sushi Gen. Screw me over once. OK. Maybe it was a fluke. Screw me over twice? Sayonara, Sushi Gen! I don't mind a mediocre sushi place because hey, not every meal can be orgasmically memorable. BUT OH THE WAIT! I HATE waiting for mediocre food. Been here once for dinner, got the widely acclaimed sashimi platter as well as many pricey a la carte sushi. Not impressed. The sushi I had was made with no heart. Just fish. Everything was massively produced in the kitchen (yes I said kitchen, I highly doubt most of their sushi even comes from the sushi bar). Been here another time for the every so popular lunch special. $15 for a plate of sushi. Again, not 爄mpressed at all. I can name at least 3 other places in Little Tokyo with better fish and the same reasonable prices. Everything was fresh... I'll give them that. But a memorable meal? NO WAY. I compare Sushi Gen to Costco. Great value. Decent quality. But something is missing. And that something is HEART.

Whenever I go out to eat sushi, Sushi Gen is the first place that comes to mind. 營 am so lucky to have found this place in the midst of all of the sushi restaurants that have overwhelmed modern society. 燱hile sushi and sashimi were considered taboo only 5-10 years ago, it now seems that around every corner there is some sort of sushi restaurant. Sushi Gen has, by far, the best quality fish I've ever found at a Japanese restaurant in the U.S. 燤oreover, it ranks amongst the top 5 Japanese restaurants I have ever eaten at, including those in Japan. 燗lthough I have only eaten at Sushi Gen two times, I can comfortably say that their food is authentic. 燭he second time I visited I brought a group of 8 friends, including a couple that was not comfortable with consuming raw fish. 燞owever, to my delight, they were willing to try the bluefin toro (you'd have to be crazy not to) and found it to be enjoyable. 燭o get a true sense of what Japanese cuisine is all about, Sushi Gen is a good place to start. 燭heir service, food preparation, and decor is highly reflective of modern Japanese dining. 營 highly recommend trying the Deluxe Sashimi Dinner or if you're even more adventurous, try sitting at the sushi bar and having the chef choose several nigiri-style sushi selections, it's the best way to ensure you're getting a variety of fish that are fresh and tasty. 燣ook to spend around $30-50 per person, including drinks if ordering from the menu, $50-100 if at the sushi bar.

The sushi was of excellent quality but the bill leaves you with a feeling of gross violation. The first warning should have been the sushi menu with no prices listed on it. 燱e were at ease throughout the meal due to the jovial nature of the sushi chef. 燭he second warning should have been when we asked for the bill and we saw the chef scribble the word "food $98" with no itemized listing of our order. 燦ow mind you we had only ordered 10 orders of sushi totalling 20 pieces of fish. 燦o 100 year old vintage, rare fish but your run of the mill sea fare. 燤aybe the beer we drank had kept our instincts at bay but as we walked out we could not help but feel as if I was visited by my cell mate bubba for a night of spooning. 燞ow on earth do 20 pieces of sushi (not sashimi) equate to $98 of "food"? 燦eedless to say I was awestruck by the price for a good four hours afterwards. 燱hat had provoked this price? 營 warn all diners to ask for pricing before you order.

super fresh, super high quality sashimi, reasonably priced. the best deal is the sashimi for lunch!! i've been eatin' here since 1982!! there is ALWAYS a long line for lunch. so, be there by 11am or just before they close. if you get there just before they close, *cross your fingers* that they'll let you in. sometimes, their waiting list is so long that they'll stop takin' names earlier than 2pm or whatever time it is that they stop serving lunch. dinner is awesome, with the small tofu & beef broth appetizer that comes complimentary with each person's entree order. I LOVE THIS PLACE. warning: the host is a real ass but you can't blame him. he's always swamped with names and parties and people constantly asking him if they are next. GIVE HIM A BREAK!! but be sure to listen for your name and make sure your ENTIRE party is present. or else you don't get seated!!

This restaurant is pricy and over-rated. Three of us went on Sunday night around 6:30 PM and we didn't sit down untill 7:30 PM The Uni (sea urchin) sushi is the smallest portion of uni that I have ever seen. 1 piece uni for each sushi. Hamachi was very greasy to the point that you want to throw up. NOT GOOD! The Hamachi toro was the signature sushi of the restaurant however it's just WAY over priced. The california roll is $15, I know where I can order the best california roll in L.A. for $3.50... It's just a mystery to me that why this restaurant is so busy. I was very disappointed with their service too. It was way too many tables and way too little waiters/waitresses. We waited about 15 minutes to get our food. The only satifsfying dish was the "Tuna with grated potatoes", but it should be the japanese yam instead of the potatoes that you have in mind. It's very authentic japanese food and I was impressed of the taste of the dish. I honestly wouldn't go back again.... BTW... our tab was over $200 for three people. We order ed two big bottles of Sapora and the rest were the food. It's just way too expensive~~~~

I have been to Sushi Gen three times in the past 3 month, the first time I went I ordered the famous $15 sashimi lunch special. I went in after 1pm and got seated very fast at the sushi bar.( usually when you sit at the sushi bar during busy hours you have to order sushi/sashimi only, no lunch specials) I sat my kazu san, who is the best sushi chef at Sushi Gen. The sashimi lunch special was very good, and it was a lot of food and definitely very good price for $15. It's a must try, and you either get there super early or should just show up after 1:30p after the busy lunch crowd. The 2nd time I went there, I so happened to be sitting at my old spot by Kazu San and the family sat right beside me has been going there for around 20 years and the dad goes there regularly like twice a month ever since sushi gen opened in the 80's. So I over heard him talking about his sushi and he knows Kazu san, him and his family had ordered Omakase, which is basically to leave it to the chef to select what's good, and kazu san served them toro, uni, spanish mackerel etc... SO I had ordered toro, uni already and after I started talking to the family, I decided to get the Omakase too. I ended up eating a little much, and Paid over $70 for my lunch. I work a lot and I eat out almost everyday, since I'm such a foodie I pay for good food without a blink. It was an experience. I'm not going to say Sushi Gen has the best sushi in LA, but you get what you paid for. They do have very very fresh fish, because Toyo San, the other older sushi Chef personally knows the supplier so he makes sure he gets the best fish. Just the past monday, I brought my college best friend who is visiting from out of town. We went Omakase style, the toro is so gooood it melts in your mouth! along with other good sushi, and an order of hot house sake, it was $170 for the both of us before tips. We also happened to see/discovered Elijah Wood( frodo from Lord of The Rings) eating at the across from us on the other side of the sushi bar. Looked like he also enjoyed it with his lady friends. I even got a picture taken with him after he finished. Basically Sushi Gen is so popular for a reason. Don't hesitate, try it and you won't regret.

"Cheap, cheap!", sings the little birdyQ. and quietly whispers, "...at least at lunch!" *flap flap* Ordered the sashimi combo for $15. Fresh and good variety of fishies (salmon, tuna, snapper, beef..yes) on my plate. Comes with a little salad and miso Hubby ordered the sushi deluxe � good fish, good rice (a big plus in my book). Comes with miso. About $ 15 -$17. Wait is pretty long, we got here just a 爁ew minutes past opening time and there was already a line. We waited 20 minutes, which was fine since we simply meandered over to H.I.S. Travel to check out upcoming deals. When noon hits, the wait turns into an hour. eep.

Waited to eat at this restaurant for 30 minutes, which isn't THAT bad. After reading all the great reviews, I was ready to be blown away but everything was very standard. We thought the toro was going to be fresh but it had the stringy/tough white part that just had to be removed before eating the fish. The albacore was tough and not impressive. The Uni only came in a whole box, which was too much for my party of three to handle so we just skipped out on it. This place had fresh fish but nothing made it stand out and i don't think it was worth the wait.

We visited Sushi Gen because of the great reviews on yelp. We went during a weekday around 6pm(they just opened) and it was already crowded. Me and my husband did the omakase at the sushi bar. We also ordered 2 glasses of house red wine. The bill came out to be about $180, not including gratuity yet. Wow, I normally don't do omekase, didn't really know how expensive it can be But I must tell you, the sushi was great, nothing that we would normally order. It was so fresh and succulent.

i dont know what else i can say about this place other than just thumbs up A+++!! lots of people on saturday night, of course. this place was recommended to me by several coworkers and i finally tried it w/ my bf. the wait was out the door. for just 2 people we had to wait 30 mins, and it was only 6pm! we sat at the bar, and for some reason they told us there were no menus for sitting at the bar. and then we were confused bc the next couple sat right next to us got to order from the menu..? but regardless, the chef we had was awesome. he realized that it was our first time there at the restaurant, so he suggest to make us whatever he feels. and he did a great job! everything was so fresh and so good!! simple as that! the restaurant was packed, and the chefs also had to make other people's food, but he was still very focused on us sitting at the bar. we must've had about 15-20 orders of sashimi altogether in a span of 1:30 hrs. and when the bill came, it totaled up to about $150. as i was about to sign, the chef called over the server to fix the bill. apparently he noticed that there was a mistake, and the bill was too high. which we wouldn't have noticed because we didnt count the orders we had. we were very pleased with the food and service. definitely will go back again for the best sashimi in town!

reservations are a must unless you want to wait for a long, long time in the cramped entryway or outside the restaurant. i actually overheard the group next to me debating whether to stay or leave. i think they eventually stayed. luckily we had a res and were seated almost immediately. the sushi was good, but i wasn't really blown away. given all the rave reviews for this place, i must be really picky about my sushi or something. at 8:30 on a saturday night, they were sold out of a lot of things i wanted to try, including live scallop and spanish mackerel. my favorites were the yellowtail belly and albacore. we tried to order uni but our server must have misunderstood us because we got some kind of clam instead, which was actually pretty good. parking is $2.50 with validation in the outdoor parking lot.

Delicious, super fresh, and reasonably priced. 燙ome early to this place since reservations don't necessarily guarantee you a spot. 燤y parents were visiting for the weekend and we were craving some gooooood sashimi. 燭hey prefer the real deal Japanese sashimi as opposed to the celebrity infested trendy Japanese fusion stuff so Sushi Gen sounded perfect (no offense). The ankimo was so fresh! Not a hint of fishyness to it at all. 燭empura that came with our beef teriyaki steak was lightly battered and delicious. The popular sashimi deluxe was AWESOME! I'm drooling just thinking about the melt in your mouth hamachi. It was so big, the three of us couldn't even finish it. The only disappointment was how small the uni nigiri was. I'm not a big uni fan but my mom and is she said it was very good quality but just kind of small. 燙an't wait to come back and eat at the sushi bar.

Does "market price" freak you out? Don't be, that's how Sushi-Gen does. Actually, that's how top sushi restaurants do back in their home country. Want good stuffs? Prepare your guts and wallet, and come to Sushi-Gen. I've been to JP for many times and always love to try any sushi retaurant that has a line outside their door. Sushi Gen has the same atmosphere and smell, like Tokyo and Tsukiji central market. I went there with my best friend on Thanksgiving weekend. We arrived at 12:10 pm and there was already a long line for it. We sighed up on waiting list (host was very friendly) and waited for 45 mins. And then, it was the sushi feast. I don't really care about "no price on sushi menu". To be honest, living in Austin, Texas is a disaster for Sushi lover like me. When I'm in LA or SF, I'd love to pay pretty money for EXCELLENT sushi. Here I was. We sat at bar and greeted by a young sushi chef who worked next to the oldest chef. I'm sure he needs to watch his back all the time hence quality is undoubtedly good. First round, we had ika, taco, ikura, and hamachi. Ika and taco were prepared and preserved carefully. I could taste the fresh and subtle seafood protein sweetness without anything extra to ruin it. They were also very easy to chew and swallow (not like those crappy and gummy ones). And then comes hamachi. The color and texture of this baby was gorgeous, so was it tasted in my mouth. Other than that, our sushi chef did a great job of making nigiri. Fish and rice melted in my mouth as they touched my tongue, with perfect portion of FRESH wasabi, YUM. You ask me about ikura? All I could remember is they pop in my mouth and I know only top quality ikura can bring you that. Since ikura is one of my favorite, 5 points extra for ya, Sushi Gen. Unagi, tamago, sardin, saba and benito are also very very good. If you like vinegary 爁lavor, definitely try saba and sardin. The reight- to-point sourness from rice vinegar dresses with grated ginger would bring you to heaven directly. The most important stuff that afternoon, of course, was amaebi. Listed on VIP price line, I was quite hesitated if I should get them. After 3 seconds struggling, my appetite told me "you fool, try it while you can". So I did. It. was. de-li-cious. I repeat, DELICIOUS. Amaebi means sweet shirmp and once they touched my tongue, it was literally melted. The smoothness and sweetness were even better than hamachi. For those like shirmp head, Sushi Gen would deep-fried them for you. As for the taste, do you really need me to explain? We order about 12 sets of nigiri, almost tried everything they had that day. Nothing I could really be picky about since it reminds me so much of those great nights in Tokyo. I'm sure I will be back.

I love Sushi Gen! I've only had one dish the four times I've gone there (sashimi dinner for $23-$24), and it's great. The dish comes with cucumber salad, miso soup, and tempura (shrimp and veggie), too, which I think definitely helps justify the price. The sashimi dinner itself is really yummy. Every time I've gone, the sashimi selection kinda changes, excluding the usual 3-4 sets of different tuna cuts (I'm not complaining, I love tuna!). It's always so packed, though, the wait is a little tough. I hear going there for lunch on a weekday is best, but I haven't had the opportunity to.

Whenever I go out to eat sushi, Sushi Gen is the first place that comes to mind. 營 am so lucky to have found this place in the midst of all of the sushi restaurants that have overwhelmed modern society. 燱hile sushi and sashimi were considered taboo only 5-10 years ago, it now seems that around every corner there is some sort of sushi restaurant. Sushi Gen has, by far, the best quality fish I've ever found at a Japanese restaurant in the U.S. 燤oreover, it ranks amongst the top 5 Japanese restaurants I have ever eaten at, including those in Japan. 燗lthough I have only eaten at Sushi Gen two times, I can comfortably say that their food is authentic. 燭he second time I visited I brought a group of 8 friends, including a couple that was not comfortable with consuming raw fish. 燞owever, to my delight, they were willing to try the bluefin toro (you'd have to be crazy not to) and found it to be enjoyable. 燭o get a true sense of what Japanese cuisine is all about, Sushi Gen is a good place to start. 燭heir service, food preparation, and decor is highly reflective of modern Japanese dining. 營 highly recommend trying the Deluxe Sashimi Dinner or if you're even more adventurous, try sitting at the sushi bar and having the chef choose several nigiri-style sushi selections, it's the best way to ensure you're getting a variety of fish that are fresh and tasty. 燣ook to spend around $30-50 per person, including drinks if ordering from the menu, $50-100 if at the sushi bar.

Maybe the best tuna I've ever had. Amazing. Sashimi plate is enough for two people and it costs $35. Thrown in an appetizer, another roll, a beer, and some sake ... you're looking at about $40 a person for some of the best sushi you can get.

Sushi Gen is the only place I can order a sushi combination and have it full of GOOD SHIT. Normally, ordering a platter at a sushi restaurant (as opposed to a la carte) implies that you are lazy, have no imagination, and not enough taste to specify exactly what kind of fish you want. As punishment you'd get the dregs of the kitchen - the unwanted, filler pieces - the egg, the plasticky octopus, way too much tuna. But the combos at Sushi Gen are legendary for being abundant, fresh, full of interesting pieces (I'm embarrassed to list what you get because some of it I don't even recognize!). And you get a LOT of it. And it's way cheap for what you get. $15 for 20 pieces of quality sashimi on the lunch menu (it's listed simply as "Sashimi"), including rice, miso soup and tofu is jaw dropping. At dinner, the $26 Sushi Deluxe meal is mindboggling. I mean, it comes with a million things including uni. I'm baffled by the variety and consistent freshness of their fish and can't help imagining that they've struck deals with mob fishmongers or something. But whatever, don't question, just trust. Whenever I have friends who move to another city, say New York, where you can get decent sushi but will pay through the nose for it and end up with just a tiny thing on plate, they always lament the lack of a Sushi Gen. And then I feel an embarassment of riches. Service is nothing special. They're fine, but have such a long line of waiting customers that they just want to keep it moving and it's not really about having a magnificent experience. Doesn't matter, just keep the fish coming. P.s. it's pronounced Gen with a hard 'g,' not "jen" as I had been mispronouncing.

Last time I went we waited 30 mins at 1:45pm for a table, but it was worth it. As long as you get your name on the list by 2pm, they'll seat you. No lunch menu at the bar. 燜or lunch for two people, I would recommend getting two $15 sashimi plates over the $30 sashimi because the former comes with rice and soup and seems to be about half the amount of sashimi. My other fave here is the chirashi bowl. Some of the best sushi in LA without the exorbitant prices of other places.

Still the best sushi bar in Little Tokyo and the wait wasn't half bad on a Friday night (table not bar). 燭he toro and uni still rival those i've recently had at more expensive sushi houses. 燝ood thing too because those are my faves. 燞ad the trifecta of yellowtail, yellowtail belly, and kanpachi (baby yellowtail). 燭he belly tastes like toro. 燢ohada (gizzard shad) was mmmm 爂ood.. 燭ried the appetizer version of the ankimo which comes with a slightly spicy ponzu sauce. 燦ot bad, but found the sauce overwelmed the fish a bit too much. 營 like that fishy taste. 營t's sushi afterall. �A personal fave of mine is the kazunoko which is herring roe. 營t's salty and crunchy and goes well with beer. 燨nly downside is the high cholesteral.

My friend, and fellow sushi lover, asked his fishmonger buddy which restaurant he would go to for the freshest fish. The answer: Sushi Gen. That was all I needed to know. Instead of heavily researching I just showed up with my friends. I expected some fancy restaurant and was caught off guard by it's location in a rundown looking strip mall. Step inside and and it's a different world. Everything about the restaurant declares: I am authentic Japanese. The food is a sashimi purist's haven. I came on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was bustling with patrons. You can tell they have a high demand and thus turn around for fish. The restaurant focuses on the flavor and textures of fresh, unadorned fish. No fancy toppings, sauces and preparations here. One of my friends and I split the sashimi dinner and ordered a few nigiri alongside. The sashimi dinner is an excellent value ($21) and comes with a lot of fish: lots of tuna, 3pcs yellowtail, 3pcs halibut, several small pieces of octopus, squid, spicy tuna, a small piece of cooked salmon, steamed egg custard, seaweed. The octopus was not chewy at all and I was also pretty satisfied with the tender halibut. I was a little disappointed with the quality of hamachi. It's one of my favorite pieces of sashimi and it just wasn't as soft as I've had before. There was an overwhelming amount of tuna on this platter and it was all blue fin. I wish they would have replaced even a third of this with another type of fish, even if it were different types of tuna. Nigiri: Albacore tuna- luxuriously soft and melted away beautifully. Wonderful flavor. One of my favorites overall, and definitely for the evening. Spanish mackerel- very mild and soft. topped with a few thinly sliced scallions. Japanese mackerel- first time having this particular fish and it tastes more like mackerel than the Spanish mackerel. I think I like it better but it's fishier and not for sushi virgins. Yellowtail- again, very good but not quite the quality I was expecting. One of my friends got her usual Chirashi bowl that was overflowing with various cuts of fish/octopus/squid. Portions are very generous. And the rice below was really good! It had a hint of sweetness and the texture was spot on. I kept stealing some from her bowl. One of our less adventurous sushi eaters did quite well, but needed to supplement all the rawness with a cooked dish: fried chicken. It was like giant baseball sized popcorn chicken you find at Boba places. Only it doesn't come with the spicy powder seasoning, and you get four large pieces instead of a handful of smaller ones. It's dark meat and really juicy. Lastly: service. Wow, everyone here was SO gracious. The server, the busboy, the waitress... oh the poor waitress. We had so many questions about the menu. What's on the sashimi dinner? How's it different from the sashimi delux? We even dragged her over to ask what the table next to us was having because it looked that fabulous (it was the sashimi dinner). She had to come back three times because we couldn't decided what to get, but every time she came back with an easy smile and endless patience! They didn't mind us sitting and catching up for a half hour after we finished eating. And as we walked out, they thanked us kindly for stopping by. A few details: Parking is $2 with validation inside the restaurant. They don't seat you until your entire party has arrived.

Great place for sushi or sashimi right on the edge of Japantown. Expect a line if you come on the weekend. Put your name on the list and go for a walk. You'll wait half as long as their estimate (never fails, you'd think they'd get better at this). While the teriyaki and tempura are decent, stick with the sushi/sashimi. Service is a little slow. I usually get a table because the bar is a bit shy on elbow room. They have a parking lot (it's in Honda Plaza) that sometimes is free and sometimes is not so I usually park on the street. I've always found free parking within a block. Personally, I think their sashimi is the freshest (and best) in all of Japantown.

i'm a little bit shocked at myself. i can't believe i haven't reviewed sushi gen. i thought i did. this is the probably the single restaurant i've been to the most in all of los angeles. perhaps a hundred times by now. when i worked at barwick studios i probably ate here three times a week to skip the traffic back to westwood and i probably had mercury poisoning as well. the GEN is like an old reliable friend. some sushi joints are sexier or fancier, more rarified, or more sushi nazi, but nothing can beat the value and consistency of sushi gen. the sashimi dinner, although its price has creeped upwards over the years is probably the best deal in town. i just got back to LA this past friday, after an epic two months of insane travel in spain, morocco, new york, hong kong, macau and thailand, and i had to get my fix. my favorite chef, hiro is no longer there, but you know... its too legit to quit. i'm now in baton rouge on a movie for two months (til august/september). if anyone knows any fools out here give me a shout, cuz i dont know anyone! and i need to explore some southern cooking! looking forward to fried foods and getting called chink! aw yeah!

I admire japanese culture because they can focus on just one thing and one thing only in the hopes of simplifying it and taking efforts in perfecting its form. Sushi in it's most basic form should be just that. I am starting to cringe when I see the words "Catepillar", "Volcano", and "Dynamite" when restaurants are trying to describe sushi. I am starting to dislike all this sauced up nonsense that has become popular mainly to bring sushi to the masses. Cooking should be a celebration of the ingredient not a smoke and mirrors operation to hide what you are eating. I came here and order sushi, sashimi, and a beer. I enjoyed the fish, not the avocado, or sauce, or sprinkled crunch crap.

For a celebration the bosses left it up to me to choose a spot for lunch on them. Of course my counter part is up in age and SUPER picky! She only eats Mexican food! Because of this, 營've let her choose the place we eat to celebrate for the last 4 years! 燜inally, I had ENOUGH of tacos and burritos and I suggested something I wanted to do. So, I took a chance on Sushi-gen . I mean geez, my first choice in 4 years best be good and I best not disappoint! 燬o I called ahead of time to make sure they served chicken teriyaki for Julie, they did (I know, I know...chicken?!?!). 燭hey also informed me there are NO reservations available. 燬o we hopped the metro, walked a couple of blocks and found this delectable little place. It was a Friday, probably about 12:15 pm...LUNCH RUSH!! 燭here were several parties waiting to be seated, I asked the host how long the wait for 4 would be, he informed me 15 minutes. I said okay but was seriously doubting we'd get seated that fast. 燱ell, color me happy, it really was only a 15 minute wait!! 燭he restaurant was packed but the host and other staff was friendly (but not too friendly) and informative despite a slight language barrier. 燱hen we were seated they gave us just the perfect amount of time to sit, get comfortable, wash our hands and make up our minds on drinks before taking our order. We admired the artwork and decor of the establishment and as soon as we knew it, another waiter was back with our drinks and ready for our food order. Very quick and impressive with it being during the lunch rush and all. �As everyone seems to agree, sashimi was off the hook! And thanks to everyones informative reviews, I even tried uni for the first time! Everyone was extremely satisfied with their meal, even picky Julie!! And also I forgot to mention my boss is vegetarian but he managed to find a veggie alternative and also liked the place. I had no regrets choosing sushi-gen and I have a feeling it will be my new craving : ) If you like sushi, sashimi...try this place! Fresh, tasty, perfect temperature, presentation is great, staff is nice and not disgruntled. GO...GO NOW!

this was one of my fave places to eat when i was a young intern in downtown l.a. 燼fter about six long years away, i finally went back recently. �i used to order the sashimi plate, which was a great deal at $11. in this reunion of sorts, i debated if i should do the chirashi (because other reviews noted that the sashimi platter was tuna heavy and i've since tried to avoid eating a lot of that) but the sashimi plate lunch special included other goodies so i went for that. 燼nd, heck, for old time's sake, ya? �it's happened several times when i revisit a place that i liked a lot before, that it wasn't as great as i remembered. 爄 was really crossing my fingers that this wasn't going to be another one of those times. 爉uch to my relief and surprise, it was even better than i expected!! remember when i mentioned that since it was a lunch special, it included other goodies? 爓ell, watch out for those because those could get pretty filling...i mean you can't help eat them, they're so good. the first thing we got was a small appetizer of pickled cabbage(?). then came nori, then meaty flavored tofu pieces, miso soup, and THEN a payload of sashimi! 爋kay actually not everything was raw. 爐he salmon was cooked (to my disappointment--it's one of my raw faves!) plainly while other unidentifiable fish were cooked in a sort of marinade...i don't know how to describe it, you just gotta try! 爐here was a lot of fish that's for sure. 燼nd all this for only $12.50! for a sushi lover, i'm embarrassed to admit i wasn't sure what all the fish were--i stick to my favorites; leave me alone. 燽ut if it was tuna heavy, it was mainly the white fish variety and all of it was like BUHDAH!! 爐he ahi, the yellowtail....HOLY MELTIN MOLY! 爓hat a special treat and surprise coming here again was. 爄f you're gonna try sushi gen (at least for the first time or on a budget), this is the way to go. p.s. to me, there was no overwhelming "fishy smell" but i grew up in a house that cooked a lot of fish and other "funky" stuff. 爄 think i know what other reviewers meant but i felt it was barely noticable (i was looking for the scent!). 燽tw, the bathrooms are quite clean! 爋h, and we got there before it opened on a monday and there was already line!! 爕ou may need to time going there in 1 hour increments from opening to avoid waiting too long.

Unfortunately Sushi Gen is too far for me to come to on a regular basis but my yelp list wouldn't be complete unless I said something about this Little Tokyo mainstay. 燭he sushi here is superb and alwasy fresh so let's just get that out of the way. 燳ou can read the other reviews about how awesome the toro, yellowtail belly, uni, etc is...and it's all true by the way, but what's the secret not too many ppl know about is the sashimi deluxe dinner. 燜or something like $35, you get a mountain of every type of sashimi you can imagine including uni and toro! 燡ust order two sides of rice and you and friend are set. 燭ry it sometime when you don't get a seat at the bar.

In order for a business to be successful you have to do one thing better than anyone on a consistent basis and have a real vision for what your customers want that thing to be. There is a market for Gen. Sushi Gen is traditional Japanese to the very core, nothing more, nothing less. 燭he sushi is a good, fresh, quality grade but nothing really got my attention. No vibe. I've been to at least a hundred Japanese restaurants in my life. Ninety of them were exactly like this one. 營t's the other 10 that I remember fondly. This is not one of them. Parking is $2.50

Sushi Gen is an authentic sushi-ya for the counter sitting fishy. They are always spot on. Make sure to ask what is fresh today before ordering away. Gen will tell you the truth which is good because the truth always comes out in the flavor and texture of the fish. They seem to always have amazing yellowtail belly, and the Uni here has never let me down. They have quail egg in abundance, so put it on your Ikura & Natto handroll, delish! The rice is also suprisingly high grade, this place hits it right on the nose.

With so many great reviews, they certainly don't need mine! This is the probably the best sushi I have had. Completely fresh and amazing. The sushi combo dinner is a great variety of sushi and an incredibly large portion (great to share). I've never liked spicy tuna until I had it here! It always seemed like a mushy mess of left over scraps, but theirs is super fresh tasting with great texture and discernible fresh flavors. The Spanish mackerel with green onions and seaweed was also a winner. Their seaweed is not at all too salty, fishy, tough, or slimy. Perfect springy texture and mild flavor. The cold tofu appetizer is one of my favorites and theirs was the best! The wait wasn't TOO bad (40 min for a Friday night). If you have a drink next door at Bar C, they'll come get you when your table is ready!

Top quality sushi at great prices. Haven't tried the dinner, but the $15 sashimi lunch is a great bargain. Full plate of sashimi with soup, sides, and rice. Just be prepared for the 40 minute wait. They take lunch reservations, but only about 4 days in advance. Plan well or prepare to wait.

Sushi-gen is the best sushi in Los Angeles. Whether sitting at the sushi bar or eating at the tables, I enjoy every visit to this Little Tokyo landmark from the pre-packaged hand-towels to the last bite of fresh fish and crunchy tempura. My friends tend to object to the prices and have on occasion texted me--from brand new iPhones of course-- to decline a visit and tell me about how far in the red a dinner at Sushi-gen will put them. But never fear, ordering the sashimi dinner is a good investment considering the quantity and quality. Never had a bad experience, tried most of everything there is to try. An easy five stars.

So somehow I ended up in Little Tokyo one Saturday afternoon. By 1:30 I was hungry and Sushi Gen was right there so I stepped inside. There were not that many customers so I just sat myself at the bar. The staff was attentive. The sushi chef was fantastic. The fish was heavenly. I could not get enough. I tried uni, ebi, hamachi, toro, unagi, and a few others plus a sashimi combination. They were ALL great. No wonder I was so full afterward.

I don't understand why this place gets so many great reviews and why the line is so long. I ate at Sushi-Gen tonight, and got there at 5pm, and the place was already at half capacity. I heard so many good things, how it's fresh, and reasonably priced. LIES! The fish was not fresh. It didn't have the nice cold feeling you get when you eat sushi/sashimi. The sushi didn't have the nice bite, where you're biting into something, rather the sushi was short, and thin. I took a bite, and I went straight to my tooth, there was no give. The pieces were small and the place was completely overpriced. What everyone calls fresh and "authentic" just shows me that Los Angeles does not have great sushi. I've eaten at a lot of places, and while I may not yelp them all, I've eaten and experienced a lot. Hong Kong had amazing sushi and for half the price. San Francisco's Tekka is 100 times better. The sushi is three times the size and much more reasonably priced. A yellowtail (hamachi) is three times the size, and is only $4.50 for ONE PIECE. The uni is definitely fresher, and instead of giving you one piece, Tekka gives you THREE PIECES, and it's only for $5! The toro is definitely toro at Tekka and it doesn't have fibrous fish tendon hanging. The scallop is HUGE and has a bite at Tekka. Sushi Gen has NOTHING on Tekka. It's completely overrated. Travel around and have sushi and let me know. Compare the quality of the fish, the size and the price. Anyone can pay an exorbitant amount for good sushi, but it's all about a balance, and Sushi Gen doesn't have it. I don't understand the line, oh WHY! Bad palates!

It is what it is, and it isn't what it isn't, it is a place to get great simple very high quality sushi, it isn't a fancy dimly lit restaurant. 營 think many people go here expecting it to be something exciting and amazingly unique, but that's not where sushi gen shines. 燬ushi Gen has the highest turn over of fish in LA for a sushi restaurant, that means they can offer great prices on very high quality fish. 營f you like simple sushi at a reasonable price them Gen = Good.

For the sashimi lover, Sushi Gen has good quality fish for not that much dough. 營 got the sashimi dinner ($21) which was just a platter of sashimi--no tempura/miso soup/etc. 營t came with tuna, yellowtail, cooked salmon, spicy tuna, sweet egg, a piece of mirugai, and a bunch of other stuff i can't remember. You can get the full sashimi dinner for $26. 營 also got the unagi sushi, which was small but delicious. 燭he eel was not as bony as I've had at other places, but the unagi at sakura is still my favorite, even though it is so massive that it falls apart after one bite!

after my two favorite sushi spots turned me down for take-out on a busy weeknight, I wandered over to Sushi Gen. the host was more than happy to accommodate me, even though they were busy as well. our sushi was great, my only complaint was that it was about 50% more expensive than Komasa, my all time favorite, the food was comparable, though, so I was happy. :)

do not come here for dinner. you will overpay and undereat. had the sashimi dinner which was just deplorable. dilapidated. disappointing, who puts leftovers on a $35 plate?? if you come for lunch you get 3 options for sashimi, and the prices are better and they do not give you little slivers of fish. literally, like little pieces of beef for fajitas, and smaller! the sushi dinner plate was also unsatisfactory. im very sad. still. so you your sadness for something else thank you wont come back for dinner, maybe lunch.

Another great sushi spot!!!! I went there on a Tuesday night and didn't have to wait for a table although we didn't have a reservation. We actually sat at the bar and just ordered what we wanted. We got a bunch of usual stuff like Toro, Uni, hamachi, and unagi. Every piece was just speechless. I have no idea how many times I said "so good" that night. I think the bill came up to something like $250 with a couple bottles of sake. It was worth it, and I am definitely coming back :)

this place deserves me making a yelp account and actually contributing to my fellow yelpers. went to Sushi-Gen for the first time with my boyfriend, who is a foodie connoisseur. We were seated right away at the sushi bar - you can not order from the dinner menu when you sit at the bar - sushi chef only. This is better because as soon as he places the meat on the rice, he leans over the glass freezer case, and places the sushi on your plate. we ordered a few sushi items on our own, but eventually let our chef give us his favorites.... Fatty tuna is probably the best we've both had. Spanish and Japanese Mackerel were both great, i like the Spanish better. The Snapper was delicious! Halibut, Albacore, Fresh Water Eel (is served warm, not too sweet, perfectly tenderized) and a few other sushi items. we also got the Spicy tuna roll, which is also very good. The Avocado Eel roll was delicious as well. Overall a very nice experience. Sushi chef was friendly and funny!! A MUST GO!!!

I had to make my first review something worthwhile... �I had been trying to keep Sushi Gen on the underground, but there's no doubt that the word has been out for some time now... hence the increasing amount of wait time for seating... Although I just went last night and luckily was seated at the end of the bar within a mesmerizing 10 minutes. I guess people were waiting for a table, which was going to take about an hour. I think the bar is the best, yet dangerous place to sit, due to the amount of food you will want to order after each delectable piece of fish. I've taken a few friends here and the place has become their new fave sushi joint as well. The yellowtail sushi is chunky and oh so good. I have not had it elsewhere the way it is put together here. It's not mush like at other places that slab it onto a roll; it is popping out of the soypaper... you'll want to order more. Last night I overheard the patrons seated next to us ask the chef what we were having and that they would like the same just because it looked good. The tuna-I've never seen such a red pretty fish. The albacore sashimi dissolves in your mouth. The toro is like butter. The uni is not too fishy or too sweet. Just a perfect ending to a sushi meal... I've been with people who have also ordered the teriyaki; you can tear the chicken just by poking the fork into it. I don't stir away from the sushi though. It's not fancy, just plain fresh perfect cuts of fish! I love sushi and have tried several places throughout the LA county and there is no doubt this is the freshest authentic sushi I have had.

J-town L.A. is nostalgic in many ways... When I was going to a school nearby downtown LA, my dad and I regularly met up in J-town and explored all the sushi places. 燨ver the years, it became a routine that we'd check whether the (long) wait at Komasa was tolerable, move on to Sushi-Gen, and then Hama Sushi, in that order. 燛ven after I moved out of LA, somehow I'd find myself in J-town during the holidays... Last night, I retraced the steps and found myself @ Sushi-Gen again, after Komasa closed early because the chef went home sick. �Sushi-Gen was exactly how I remember it to be - fine quality sashimi and sushi (albeit over-priced), with a live buzz in the air, esp. if you sit at 爐he sushi bar (with a minimum of 4 orders per person) where you can see real kitchen action. �The Asian sushi chefs in the front line, and the Mexican sushi sous-chefs in the back. 燭his is just an awesome melting-pot scene, typical of LA, that you've got to appreciate. �As I did many times before, I secretly wished that one of the Mexican sous-chefs would be promoted to front-line... 燽ut it hasn't happened yet... not when I was there anyhow. 燗nd as I did before, I secretly contemplated an employment class action lawsuit, on behalf of all Mexican sushi chefs who have ever worked at Sushi-Gen... 營f my dad was there, he would've heard a whole earful of how the situation was "F@#&%-up", while I'd have to endure one of his lectures on the fine art of sushi by only Japanese chefs. �Our politics disagreed, but we agreed that Sushi-Gen served fine sushi. 燗nd last night, even without my dad, Sushi-Gen's sushi was just fine. ��$2.50 for parking. 燫eservation highly recommended.

Been here two times. Once I sat at the bar, once at a table. Both time I basically just ate the nigiri they brought us. It was incredibly fresh and when I was at the table there was a little more hand holding on what sauces we should dip which piece in, ect, (which I appreciated). The bar has a minimum you have to order. Love this place. Both times one of the best meals I've ever had.

Hands down, the best sushi I've had (excluding Masa - I don't consider Masa a "sushi joint" though...) the rice is perfect, the fish is fresher than any other I've had.

This place is always bustling, but the service is attentive nonetheless. Find parking in the lot isn't too bad if you plan well in advance. The sashimi plate was quite satisfying-- I highly recommend the tuna here. Acceptable prices overall, and the furnishings were comfortable even if the decor was a bit cheesy. No real complaints from me, though I hear they changed up their hours after the business boom. That's a pity, since their lunch special certainly hit the spot. I definitely ended up eyeballing my friends' bento boxes.

Close to 600 reviews and 4.5 stars? I held Sushi-Gen to very high expectations given the stellar yelp reviews. I'm glad to report it lived up to the hype. Came here for dinner on a week night, and as others have said, 爀xpect to wait for a table as the restaurant is by no standards large. We took the sushi bar, which I actually prefer anyhow. To make a long story short, it was some of the most fresh sushi I have ever had in my life. All of the following were excellent: hamachi, spanish mackerel, maguro, toro, uni. Sweet shrimp was very good as well - you can choose to have the head fried or served with miso. I went with the latter and it was delicious. We also ordered monk fish liver, which was so rich and creamy. Overall I had a great dining experience here. Yes, crowded as heck, but some of the best sushi I've ever had. 5 star!

So you are at the MOCA, trying to decide just WHAT the artist was trying to say with that smear of paint, when you realize that you are starving, and naturally, craving sushi. Being near Little Tokyo, you'll have a very hard decision to make with all the great choices in sushi restaurants (or noodles!). 燘ut you have definitely chosen correctly if you end up at Sushi-Gen. From the line out the door at 1:30pm, we knew we were in the right place. This is clearly an LA favorite. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes, but after 5, the funny host asked if we would mind sharing a table - of course not! We were just happy to start our midday meal! In any case, our new table friends were very friendly. Our server was also very helpful and friendly, and the food came out rather quickly considering how busy they were. The lunch menu is very simple and in my opinion does not do justice to the variety of fish and dishes available. Getting past my initial confusion, I ordered the salmon collar lunch special which comes with a nice portion of sashimi, miso soup, rice, and a small amuse bouche for the table. My friend ordered the veggie roll, and we also had a tempura appetizer. Wow! I loved everything. The tempura was crispy soft and delicious! We had shrimp, zucchini, eggplant and potato, all perfectly done. The miso soup was just right, and just what I needed. I found the sashimi very fresh and melt-in-my-mouth delicious - their fish is perfectly cut into thick slices and feels nice and cool on the tongue. The salmon collar was amazing - a huge serving, perfectly flaky and moist. It was served with squid, crab, and sweetly fried anchovies - the mix of which was excellent with the bowl of rice. I wish I lived in LA and could get this lunch special everyday! I thought the prices were high, especially for the veggie roll and the tempura, but the lunch specials are priced well for what you get. If I am every in LA again, craving sushi, I will know where to go. I envision myself in the future, sitting at the sushi bar and ordering way too much - and loving every bite!

I research sushi restaurants whenever I am in another town (which is often) so I have had a lot of fresh fish. 營 am very picky and I told the sushi chef that I am a difficult one to please and to bring on the omakase. 燤ost of the fish matches some of the freshest I have had. 燱asabi is not real, but you can ask for the real stuff (it should just come with omakase). 燣eft very impressed and much poorer ($135 for two with tax/tip).

I've been in love with eating sushi/sashimi since I discovered it almost a decade ago. I have to have a raw fish fix at least once a week (typically 2-3 times a week). Sushi Gen is hands down, no questions about it, 100% THE BEST that I have had since the beginning of my quest to find the best sashimi. As prior reviews have mentioned the Lunch Specials are awesome because of the price. They have the same items (same quality/quantity) on the Dinner menu but at almost two times the price. My two favorite items on this menu is the Sashimi Special ($15) and the Chirashi Bowl ($15). The Sashimi Special is a generous assortment of tuna plus cooked salmon, some cured fish, a little bit of octopus and a couple of other things. Typically if I'm in the mood for a bigger variety of fish (salmon, unagi, tamago etc) then I get the Chirashi Bowl. Either ways the fish is so fresh that it begins to melt a little bit as soon as your chopsticks touch it. Then, you put it in your mouth and it disappears without any real chewing involved leaving you with the wonderful essence of the fish. The portion size is very generous and I typically have a difficult time finishing the entire meal. The meal also comes with a cucumber salad that is not sweet or sour (as I would typically expect from Japanese cucumber salad), a wonderful warm tofu that had been cooked in a meat broth, miso soup and rice. My boyfriend is not as crazy about sashimi as I am so he typically orders the cooked items on the menu. All the items that I have tried off of his plate has also been very tasty - Salmon Teriyaki, Chicken Teriyaki and Tempura Lunch Specials (so far) have all been delightful. They come with rice, salad and a yummy creamy Japanese style potato salad. I have not tried the Sushi Bar portion of the restaurant yet because they do not allow you to order from the regular menu . There is also a minimum order. Also, one last awesome thing about this place - they do TO-GO orders at lunch. If you cannot make it to the restaurant by 10:50am-ish to wait in line for their 11:15am lunch opening I would recommend ordering to-go or going a little later otherwise you will have to wait around until the first wave of people finish eating (30-45 mins).

A very good place to pick up some good ol' authentic Japanese place. If you are looking for your typical sushi roll, this is not the place for you. 燭he sashimi is so fresh and you'll have to ask someone how to order the great appitizers and sides. Don't expect to leave here full though.

Sushi-Gen offers the usual nigiri sushi and roll choices that are reasonably priced. 燘y reasonable pricing, I mean that you'll probably be spending anywhere from $10-$25 per person at lunch and $25-$50 per person during dinner hours. 燦ote the price differential between lunch and dinner for your own budgeting needs! One important thing to note! 營f you eat at the sushi bar, you cannot order from the lunch or dinner menu. 燳ou must order sushi and rolls. 燞owever, if you eat at the tables or booths, you can order both sushi/ rolls and menu items. The Sushi-Gen atmosphere differs between lunch rush hour and dinner time. Their lunch hour is packed! 燭hey open at 11:15 AM sharp. 燩eople wait as early as 10:45 AM to get in! 營t has a cafeteria atmosphere. 營t's so loud where people hustle and bustle in and out. 燭he staff wants to get you in, serve you food and get you out! 營t's not a place and time to sit, eat and relax. Dinner time is very chill. 燳ou're not rushed to finish off your food. 燭hey serve you tempura as appetizers with your dinner which they don't do at lunch hour! As for quality, it's "fresh" and by the quotes, it's still edible in terms of safety standards. 營 wish it were fresh as in "just delivered." The owner of this restaurant worked as a sushi chef in a very high end sushi restaurant in Japan during the late 1960's. Last thing, parking is easy, convenient and inexpensive.

Dood, Sushi Gen has some bomb bay sushi! I would say better then Yoshida. Reading the reviews of this restaurant just makes me feel just a little bit more special. Why you may ask? Cause I didn't have to wait. Muhuhaha... Evil, I know... but it was great. My experence of this place was amazing. If your wondering how? I got people. Yes people... lol Who are my people? My "big boss" (he hates it when I call him that) lol We desided to come here before our Club Event. I've read the reviews before and was scared that we might have to wait long. When we got there and I asked the host how long was the wait? 30mins... I was sad unitl the manager came by. My boss went to high school with him. Which I didn't know and he didn't know he worked there. 10mins later we had our seats at the bar. Now that is service. I felt bad for the two old couples that were in front of us. =T sorry... I don't think they wanted to say something because they most likely thought we were gangsters. We just came from a funeral and we were in all black suits. We're big guys too... lol but I really felt bad. (Trust I'm not part of the Tri-ad or yacuza how ever you spell it. I'm a nice gentle person. ^_^V see...) The sushi made me feel so much better though. I'm cold when it comes to my tummys happiness though. lol I recommend just eatting the sushi, FORGET THE ROLLS! If your going for the gold, stick with the sushi, trust! The sushi Chefs are GREAT! My first time and forsure not my last.

Definitely one of the better sushi spots in LA. 營 only wish I could afford to eat here as often. 營 agree with the other yelpers that the fish is super fresh. 燳ou don't get that after taste that you get with not-so-fresh fish. 燭hey slice the sashimi pretty thick too so you get what you pay for. 燳ou can easily find yourself placing order after delicious order at the sushi bar and getting a $200 check at the end. �There are plenty of other sushi restaurants in Little Tokyo, and cheaper at that, but you won't get the same quality. 燗t least with Sushi Gen you're not wondering where the fish came from.

I'll keep this short, because a place with over 800 reviews really doesn't need my two cents. Went here for a late lunch last Friday. We knew we were in the right place given the crowd of people all waiting outside for their names to be called. We dined at the sushi bar. I chuckled to myself when the ma顃re d' told us that we could only order sushi at the sushi bar and that each person would have to eat a whopping 4 pieces. Don't worry buddy, that won't be a problem! The sardine sushi was excellent, and perhaps our favorite. The yellowtail, toro, sea urchin, oyster, snapper, and scallops were all fresh and delicious - everything was really good.

If you don't already know about their $12.50 sashimi lunch, you are totally missing out. It is definitely an eye-popper. It's just so much fish!!! Only draw back is that you always have to wait (sometime up to an hour!) and the selection of fish is very tuna-heavy. If you want more variation, go for Chirashi Lunch for the same price. Or their sushi (same, 12.50) is excellent to. But the real secret is the daily specials that they write down on the Post-It notes and stick on the menu. I had Hamachi Head the other day. The whole fucking head of a yellowtale on a huge plate staring at me. Not for the faint of heart. Yummy stuff, though!

Alright, first of all this is definitely NOT a moderately priced restaurant. I will say their food was extremely good and my friend and i both agree, but we only got to try a LITTLE bit. If you're on a budget you'll probably want to go somewhere else, like what we did after we ate a sample of their food. The restaurant is authentic itself and owned by Japanese. I think when I have more money I'll come back, but as for my experience now it was not as pleasant as I would have wanted. The waitresses were also a tad pushy, trying to get us to order right away so they could seat other people I suppose. It's hard though with a friend who CAN'T decide haha.

why does everyone like this place??? it's overrated and plain. They don't have any exotic fish from Japan.

The overwhelming number of 5 star ratings here perplexes me. 燘y the end of our meal my friend and I were actually laughing at how atrocious the entire experience was, from atmosphere to food to service. 燬ushi-Gen is located in a beat-up little strip mall where parking is limited on a busy night. 營 had to wait 15 minutes to park, which actually got my hopes up because I figured I'd stumbled upon some cool little unexpected hole-in-the-wall that would be the next downtown sushi sensation. 燭he crowd spilled out the front door and down the sidewalk so I was thrilled I had a reservation. 燚idn't matter. 燬till had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. 燭he atmosphere, or lack thereof, was fitting for a strip mall joint. 燦o music, no style, bright lights, dime-store decor. 燬ervice was nonexistent. 燨ur server didn't speak English (fine - I get it - but just sayin' - you need to know your Japanese if you eat here). 燬he took our order and we never saw her again until I lunged at her as she passed by and asked her for our check. �The sushi rolls were tiny, tasteless portions of GOD AWFULNESS with a thimble of soy sauce. 燭he edamame was cold and undercooked, served with a side of salt that slid off the beans onto the plate. 燭he shrimp and veggie tempura was a giant mass of deep fried grease; I had to dig around to find the tiny item inside, like a prize. 燭he broiled lobster and mushrooms tasted like they'd been under a heating lamp at McDonalds for the past hour. And the kicker? 營t's expensive! 營 seriously don't get it. 燭he sushi at Ralph's is a thousand times better, as is the atmosphere and service. �My friend and I wondered - is this authentic Japanese? 燗re we missing something? 營f so, I'll take American-Japanese any day over the real deal.

What better place to satisfy my nigiri craving than Sushi Gen, located in Little Tokyo and serving some of the freshest fish in LA. 燭o experience our food the way it was meant to be enjoyed, my boyfriend and I decided to sit at the sushi bar, something I rarely do. 營t was my first time actually ordering sushi at the bar. 營 usually just order simple hand rolls or a spicy tuna roll. 燤y sushi tastes have expanded since then, thank goodness. I had been reading about sushi and talking to some friends who consider themselves as sushi snobs, and I decided to try something other than salmon and tuna. 營 took the advice of fellow Yelpers as well asked our sushi chef for his recommendations. 燦ote that you can always order ONE sushi (two pieces) and share with someone else if you want to have room to try many different types of sushi. 燱e didn't realize this until halfway through our dinner. 燱e tried lots of things that we both have never had, making our dining experience 10x more memorable. 燛very single item we got was delicious, but a few definitely blew my mind! My boyfriend and I got: *Kampachi (high-end yellowtail): the texture of this fish is more solid and has more substance to it. 燭he flavor is buttery, rich and smooth. 燚efinitely better than the regular Hamachi *Toro (fatty tuna): this was the first and last sushi we ordered at the bar. 爓e started off with this since the chef recommended it, and it was so good, we wanted to end our meal with it again! 營t is so creamy, fatty and flavorful. 營t nearly melts in your mouth *Amaebi (sweet shrimp): I've been craving sweet shrimp for a while, and my bf has never tried it before so I ordered it for us. 營 got the heads deep fried, and they served them with a wedge of lemon, which added a nice touch. 燤y bf claimed that the shrimp heads were the best he's ever had. 燭he sweet shrimp itself was so fresh! 營t wasn't mushy at all. 營nstead, it was almost crunchy and crisp when biting into the shrimp. 營 love the slight hint of sweetness. �*Ikura (salmon roe): I've never really liked this, but I gave it a try. 營 ended up giving it to my bf since he really likes it. 燭oo fishy for me. 燞owever, I must admit it's the least fishy of the Ikura I've had in the past. *Spanish Mackerel: I loved the way our chef prepared this sushi. 燞e drizzled it with ponzu, topped it with some fresh grated ginger and daikon. 營 usually dislike mackerel because of it's overall fishy flavor, but this was absolutely amazing. 燭he fish was so fresh that it had little odor to it, and the sauce was so good with it. 燦ote that the sushi chef will tell you when to eat your sushi with soy sauce and when not to. �*Hamachi (yellowtail): It was very fresh here and delicious. 燬ince I have Hamachi often, I didn't consider this mind-blowing or a new experience. 燞owever, it is definitely very good here *Red Snapper: Our chef put a bit of salt and finely diced Jalapeno on top of our fish. 營've never had red snapper sushi before so I didn't know what to expect. 燭he fish was good, but I didn't like the Jalapeno with it. 營'm usually a huge fan of Jalapeno with rolls, but not so much with nigiri. �Our total came out to be $95 pre-tax/tip. 燱e were pleasantly full after dinner. 營'm pretty lucky to have a bf who loves making me happy and eager to experience new things together. �) 燭hanks darling for satisfying my sushi cravings and treating me to the best sushi I've ever had!

Honestly, I don't LOVE sashimi and I definitely don't understand much- and I was expecting rolls but here.. it's a whole new level of sushi. Don't wimp out and get teriyaki here. Just get the fish- chirashi bowls and a big plate of sashimi all run for about $15 each. Comes with soup and pickled cabbage. Doesn't get any better than that.

Sushi-Gen is one of the better sushi bars in LA. 燭he prices arent over-priced, and the fish is always fresh. 燨rdering from the sushi menu gets pretty pricey, I think you can easily spend $40-50 at the bar. 燘ut, if you order from the regular menu, the prices are reasonable. 爄ve been here multiple times and the fish is always of the highest quality! ��The tempura here is excellent, its nice and crispy, and they give moderate portions. 營 think this place serves better tempura than most japanese places i've eaten at. 營 really like the sashimi dinner, its comes with a huge plate of sashimi, tempura, rice, soup, and all the fix-ins. 燭he price is about $26, and it will definitely fill you up! 營f your more adventurours, id suggest the sashimi deluxe. 燭he price is a tad high at $35, and it doesnt come with rice, soup, or anything...but they give you an excellent assortment of fish! 燩retty much everything you desire except the Uni and sweet shrimp. 燭hey include, chu-toro, yellowtail, squid, spicy tuna, toro tartare, snapper, salmon belly, octopus..etc..It was by far the best assortment of fish I have had, and they give generous portions of fish. 營 definitely love the variety in their sashimi, almost ever table orders it! ���The one thing I really dont care in the sashimi dinner is the piece of cooked salmon they include..I really dont get why you would put a piece of cooked fish on a raw-fish platter? 燭he grilled salmon always seems a little overcooked and dry, I think they should include raw salmon instead of the cooked version. �BTW you dont get salmon sashimi in the regular sashimi dinner, only the deluxe. 燭he salmon is very fresh and tasty! 燭Hey definitely serve high quality salmon, maybe thats why its not included in the regular sashimi dinner. �I also did not like the sushi dinner, the variety is limited and I personally feel like the sashimi is a better bargain! �you only get about 8 pieces of sushi, along with a small tuna roll, and its about $21..for the same price you can get the sashimi dinner and it will satisfy your craving more! ��Overall the prices here are reasonable, ordering off the menu averages $30 per person, ordering off the sushi menu can get expensive, but it is well worth it! 燭he fish here is always fresh and delicious! 燭he wait here is always long, so I suggest coming here before 6pm! 營t really starts to get packed around 6pm, so come here early! 燭he parking situation is always horrible, you either find street parking (which you have to pay for) or you have to pay lot parking ( $2.50). 燭hey use to offer free parking inside the lot with validation, but i guess times are rough, and they are trying to take advantage of everything! �燭he street parking is even more expensive than parking inside, they charge $2.00/hr, so i'd suggest trying to find parking inside the lot, but during busy hours this can be hard.

The sushi/fish itself was one of the best I've had, very delicately sliced and fresh tasting BUT .... you pay a hefty premium for this delicacy! Don't plan on feasting here unless you come with wads of cash, because you WILL leave here poorer :) But, at least you leave with a happy stomach :)

maybe it was the fact that i walked in with a chip on my shoulder, but sushi-gen didn't exceed my expectations AT ALL. 爕es, the fish was fresh, but it really doesn't offer anything beyond that. �first of all, the host is an ass. 爃e acts as though he holds the ticket to the hottest seat in town. 爃e refused to seat two of us, even after we told him that we'd be ordering drinks and appetizers before the other two people in our party got there. 爃e didn't tell us that's their policy, that he's sorry, etc... he just said, "nope." "no." "i can't seat you." 燯GH. second, i don't usually do rolls at a sushi restaurant, but one of my friends got the spicy tuna roll. 爄 thought it was really not good. 爄 think that they use the worst/least fresh bits of tuna to make it, and just mask it with that awful spiciness. 爉aybe, though, i can't blame this on the restaurant. 爄 really never enjoyed spicy tuna rolls. and third, no green tea tempura ice cream!!! hahaha... i guess another thing that i can't hold against the restaurant, but i was craving it so badly, and thought that they would definitely have it. �since i go the criticism out of the way, onto the positives. 爕es, the fish was fresh. 爋ne of my friends ordered the sashimi platter, which is actually a REALLY good deal. 爕ou get a plate full of decent sashimi pieces, and a side of mixed tempura all for $21. 爉y friend and i opted for the sushi a la carte. 爓e ordered the following: uni, spanish mackeral, yellowtail belly, yellowtail, spicy tuna roll. �the uni was really very, very good. 爐he flavors were all there, but i don't think that it was the BEST uni i had. 爄n fact, i've had better at Taiko. 爉y favorite was the yellowtail belly, which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. 爉y friend told me that the spanish mackeral was to DIE FOR, but i thought it wasn't that good. 爄 guess she got my hopes up, and although it was pretty yummy, i thought that the yellowtail belly blew it out of the water. �all in all, i guess sushi-gen is pretty good. 爄 get why some people would rank it as one of their favorite sushi spots in town. 爄 personally don't think that i'd re-visit the place (unless i was near the area), but i would recommend to others. p.s. i'm not sure if the rainy weather contributed to this, but the place was not packed AT ALL on the thursday night that we went. 爓e got seated immediately WITHOUT reservations.

i have to agree with some of the previous reviews. �i tried a few things that should be good at such a highly rated sushi spot and they were at best average. 爐he "fresh" sardine was hardly fresh at all, the giant clam was average at best, and the ankimo and toro were okay...nothing to rave about. 爀ven the hamachi, maguro and sake were just above average. �i'm not sure if it's cuz i've been spoiled by places in the bay area but this place isn't in the same league. �note: : my friends and i waited for over an hour to be seated and we the last to leave so i'm assuming we may have not gotten the freshest stuff...they had run out of sashimi by the time we were seated....i'll bring them up to 3 stars from 2 assuming if we got there earlier some of the fish we ate would have been better...but i have doubts.

Sushi gen is officially my favorite sushi place.

Look for the Blue awning in the Honda Plaza, parking 3hrs is $2.50 w/ validation, but street parking is possible. 2 people will generally seat quickly, but partys may have to wait. Food Quality is excellent, prices are harsh but sustainable. Great taste and texture. If something tastes bland, it's meant to be dipped in something. The dinner combos are suggested since they come with Miso soup, Rice and the side of Tempura or Sushi. ~$20-$26 for most dishes Also FYI, the sushi paper menu prices go $13, $10, $8, $7, $6, $5, $4 from top to bottom seperated by the bold boxes since those prices aren't listed. The menu is for people "in the know" so don't expect a description of anything like the sushi deluxe (equivalent to around 15 pieces/piles of fish). Or that the dinner combos come with 5 peices of Tempura or ~7 pieces of sashimi. Or you can order the Sole dinner and request that they use red snapper Fillet so that there are no bones to pick out. Some of the food can seem bland, but they flavor the sauces so that everything is delicious. The spicy tuna was pretty spicy though. Might be 5 star worthy, but it's my first review..., gotta save 'em up.

Been coming to this place for years. 17 years, really. My family has been going to this restaurant since the Sashimi Dinner (this is our dish of choice) was $12 or 13, since the tomago on the Sashimi Dinner plate was two big fat slices (it's now a half slice), and since the Mexican(?) busboy was working there (well, he's still there!). 燗side from the obvious increase in prices over the years, the restaurant is still great and still offers a relatively good value for the quality of food. The tempura is still as crispy as ever, the miso hot and savory, the green tea strong... I could go on.....

We barely sat down for a minute when the waiter came and expected us to order right away. Then right after we ordered, the check was placed on our table..When I told the host that I dont understand why the check was placed on my table when I havent even received my food...All he said was sorry and walked away. 營 rather go to Komasa where the sushi is as fresh and it comes with all the pickled ginger and ponzu sauce you want.

EDIT: Came back to try this restaurant again with some friends, and WOW the food is great. The fish are all very fresh and delicious! You have to try their Toro (Fatty Bluefin Tuna Belly) and Yellowtail Belly - these items are pricey, but they are top-notch. Their Seaweed appetizer (Mazawaka Seaweed? I'm not sure) is very good too and a great way to start off your meal. This is now one of my favorite sushi joints in all of Los Angeles. I would advise potential customers to avoid sitting at the tables though and choose only to sit at the bar - the difference in the quality of your sashimi and sushi orders is quite noticeable! I didn't give this place a full 5-stars because every once in a while, I unluckily get seated in front of a stingy chef, and both the quality and quantity (size) of my sushi orders suffers. However, if you haven't been here before and are a sushi-lover, you must try this place for yourself!

This place is usually the standard that I measure other sushi places in LA in terms of quality of cuts. 營f money is not an issue and you want to enjoy quality sushi, go to the sushi bar and ask the sushi chef to make you whatever...omakase is the term. 營f you are there with someone, just ask to split the order (which is usually 2 pieces) that way you are able to enjoy a wider variety of sushi and then later on you can reorder your favorites. 營n my opinion this keeps the experience fun and fresh and allows you to get to know your sushi chef better as well. 營f money is an issue an ABSOLUTE must try dish is their sashimi plate which last to my knowledge isn't even on the menu but EVERYONE there knows about it. 燨rder it! 燝reat cuts of all sorts of fish and traditionally made. �No mayonaissey concoctions...again traditional and back to basics which they do very well) 燬ashimi plate runs at lunch time at around $11 to $13 and is very filling. 營 do believe the dinner version is a bit more closer to $20. 燚ue to their known quality you will find people waiting in line for lunch at around 10am to get in. 燭he crazy thing is they open for lunch at 11am. Usually the sushi bar is less crowded for lunch since everyone is there for the sashimi plate. �Great value for what you get at lunch but note dinner menu is considerably higher. 燚inner for 2 at the sushi bar can easily carry you over $50 and probably closer to $80 to $100 if you really enjoy sushi...so definitely a place to spluge. �This place has been one of the few Japanese owned with Japanese sushi chefs since the sushi restaurant industry in Los Angeles have been taken over by Koreans...not that is an issue for me. 燜ew people feel that those places lower quality for quantity and price which works for me as well. 燫ecently I have heard rumors that sushi gen have been bought out by a Korean owner, but I haven't seen if that has affected their quality or call to traditional japanese cuisine. 燗gain I'm not knocking on other sushi places that are owned by non Japanese owners, but if you are looking for a specific traditional experience, that may be a footnote for some. 燜or me, if the quality is still there its all good.

Yes the sushi is fantastic, so fresh it melts in your mouth, but my visit was marred by the total meanie of a sushi chef, Tatsu! The guy would NOT let me eat in peace! Now I've eaten sushi at many fine establishments here in the States, China and Japan, and NEVER have I been so harassed by the guy at the bar! One instance that really irked was his loud admonishment not to put my sushi down. I'm petite, and cannot put an entire spider roll in my mouth lest I choke and DIE.

i really cant enjoy sushi anywhere else. i usually go during lunch (as i work near it) but only on special occasions for it takes forever to be sat. at LEAST an estimated time of 30 minutes. i usually get the chirashi lunch special (assorted sashimi and other japanesey savories over a bed of cool sushi rice) and finish it to the very last grain of rice. the chirashi as opposed to the sashimi combo, comes with sweet egg, glazed unagi, and shrimp but less sashimi. also, the sashimi combo comes with regular steamed rice though im sure that could be substituted with a small price. and their green tea (hot or iced) really does complement your meal perfectly. con but worth weathering- the long wait and rushed service. but if ur willing to go big and opt out of lunch/dinner sets and order ala carte, sit at the bar and experience the genuine sushi experience

8.10.07 update :: sat at the bar at lunchtime. the special isn't available at the bar at lunch and there's a four piece order minimum per person, but none of this matters, as the 爐he fish was truly supurb! fresh, delicous, and the sushi chef were weird and wonderful. --------------------------------------------------�--------------------------- i guess i'm a sucker for the hype machine and as a result was slightly disappointed. it wasn't like i expected a sushi miracle but after trying to get in here twice, (one time the line of people was spilling out into the parking lot, most of them japanese - a good sign, i think) and hearing rave after rave, i thought i was going to experience the coveted S.O...or sushi orgasm. i loved the variety and more traditional-ness of the place. no deep fried creamcheese rolls here...just straight fish and a variety of things i had never heard of: jack mackerel and gizzard shad come to mind (both really good and fresh). they have 3 different types of yellowtail (please, i could eat yellowtail everyday). fresh and different, but not mind blowing. we sat at a table because there were so many of us, but i hear the bar is the place to be, (they don't take reservations for the bar ). so next time i'm going to go with less people, put my name in and head over to a local watering hole to wait out the 6, 478 people ahead of me.

This is one of my favorite sushi places of all time. I'm pretty picky about sushi, especially sashimi, but this place always has a great selection of fresh fish. I firmly believe that japanese style sushi/sashimi should be done in a traditional Japanese way, with none of the silly crunchy roll crap--and this place stays true to its roots. I always get the sashimi platter, and I usually go for lunch, since it's a little cheaper. I love the variety of sashimi and the small side foods that comes out. Everything tastes delicate and never fishy. To top off great traditional sushi is the REAL green tea they serve (now they charge for it...boooo). Even though it's pricey, I can never say no to really great real japanese sashimi!

never had the chance to visit this place for the lunch special, as they are not open on saturday for lunch. 燘ut I did have a great time for dinner, deluxe sashimi is very fresh, presentation was great, you should definitely give it a try, I deducted 1 star for not having one close to where I live (sorry but distance needs to be taken into consideration for me )

I've been to Sushi Gen numerous times but haven't had a chance to yelp it. We came back here the past weekend for some delicious sashimi. The wait time was about 45 minutes before we got seated. This time I brought my parents, so we ordered a pretty good amount of food. My mother is not a big fan of sashimi, so I got the beef teriyaki dinner with tempura it was was very tender and not over drenched with the teriyaki sauce. The rest of us shared the sashimi deluxe, yellow tail tatake, rolls, and other small dishes. It was a very satisfying meal between the 4 of us. If you are looking for fresh sashimi that will melt in your mouth, you ought to give this place a try.

This place has the worst attitude in Los Angeles. 燛very single time I go there, the host makes me feel like I wronged his mother or something. 燨n top of that the wait is absolutely atrocious. 燭hey don't care to change their attitude since they feel like they are doing you a favor for letting you to eat and spend your money there. 燚espite their great food and extremely fresh sushi, I have finally decided to give up on this place since I would rather not put up with their attitude, as there are plenty of equal quality alternatives that can provide service with a smile and not have an eternal wait.

Damn I love this place. The atmosphere is too bright, the service is nothing spectacular, and they close too early. But the sushi is melt-in-the-mouth, like-buttah delicious. I can always tell a good sushi place by how tender the salmon is and SG has the best, most tender salmon ever. I'm happy to sit at the bar and let the sushi chefs deliver piece after piece of fantastic fish. This place has simply the best sushi I've eaten in LA.

Okay, I couldn't help but to visit a few yelp spots while I was in LA. My aunt from Korea was visiting and I suggested we try some sushi instead of Korean food. *(For those of you that are up on your Asian history, she was around during the Japanese occupation of Korea and was forced to learn Japanese. Long story short, she is fluent in both Japanese and Korean and was able to speak to my friend who is Japanese and the Sushi chefs also.) I couldn't even speak to her because I am a horrible part Korean hybrid American... English only, knowledge of only names of Korean food. Pathetic, I know... *Well, we chose to eat at the sushi bar instead of waiting for an hour for a table. The sashimi was excellent, high quality for sure. The staff had very strong Japanese accents and it was clear that we both had a hard time understanding each other. However, my aunt was able to order some dishes for us and it was very good. *Drawbacks include, $140 check for 4 people including tip, long wait if you want to be seated, you have to pay for parking! Oh well, that is the story of a nice restaurant in downtown.

I went there a couple days ago with a few friends for dinner and I'm glad we got there early because by the time we left, the line was out the door. 營 heard a lot of good things about this place, but I have to say that it was kind of forgettable. 燭he sushi was fresh and good, but the portions were very tiny for what you pay for. 營 guess I'm kind of spoiled with the places that give larger rolls and more sushi for the same price as this place. 燭he service was ok - we had to wait awhile before we got our food and the people sitting next to us, who arrived after we did, got all their food before we did. 營 hate when that happens at restaurants because it always makes me feel like they forgot about you. 燨verall, this place was good, but not great.

I'm pretty sad that they raised the price for the lunch special (used to be $12.95). . .but it is still a GREAT deal despite the price hike. When I didn't have work, or while I still went to UCLA, I would go home on a Thursday night and have my daddy take me to Sushi Gen for lunch on Fridays. 燱e'd wake up early, leave the house around 10:30AM and get there before 11AM. 燭he place doesn't officially open until 11:15AM (sometimes 11:30AM), but already, there would be a line 20 deep. 燬o no matter what, you'll be waiting a minimum of 30 min. 爁or this place. The wait is absolutely atrocious if you arrive after the place opens. 營f you do have to wait, go shop across the street at American Apparel or go to the bakery next door to buy some sweets to kill time. 燘ut let me tell you, the wait is worth it. They give you a couple of small dishes to whet your appetite before the show: 爉iso soup, this sweet and sour seaweed thing, warm marinated tofu, and pickled cabbage. 燭hen the main event: 爐he sashimi lunch special. 燭hey give you SO MUCH FRESH sashimi. 營 can't even name all the fishes on the plate. . .I only recognize tuna, yellowtail and maybe mackerel. 燗ll the other ones are mystery fishes to me. 燘ut delicate, thick slices of mystery fishes. . .as soft as tofu. The only sad thing is that they don't give you any salmon sashimi (they usually give a piece of cooked salmon) :[ 燘ut that is okay. 營t's still worth it. 營 don't even have to pair it with the rice to be full (by the last piece of fish, I'm kinda uncomfortably full, but being a glutton and being a cheap Chinese, am horrified at the thought of wasting such good, fresh fish, I shove it down my gullet anyways). However, 營 have realized that the boys still needed the rice to get full. Parking is somewhat annoying, especially when it gets full. 燬ushi Gen does validate, I think the price for parking comes out to be like 60 cents or some weird number like that. 燬o worth it!!!

This is basically what I had expected out of California sushi, but I was by no means disappointed. 燣ong waiting probably has this place as the hot spot of Little Tokyo. 營 just should have stuck with the standard "Sashimi Deluxe" like my friends. 營t contained the best cuts of your standard fish, with a few fun items. 燭he real gem of the platter was the Toro, which was true to the authentic cut. 燜or $35, this huge portion of sashimi is a steal, and my friend said its even cheaper for lunch. 營 thought I'd venture out and go for the Omakase, which was about $38 that night. 營 was happy with everything I had received, but nothing was that great, except the hamachi. 燭hough I received some exotic cuts, I was a tad disappointed that I had only received about 10 pieces of fish that didn't have me ecstatic. 燨verall, this is one of the great sushi joints around.

My roommate and I had just missed lunch hours, and had to wait 3 more hours before Sushi Gen would open up again---but it was worth the wait! One of the best Crunch rolls I've ever had---the sauce was infused into the rice/eel---delicioso.

the bf and i had been planning this day for months. instead of returning to work the day after my (short) xmas break, we ventured out to sushi gen to get their awesome lunch specials. we headed out early and arrived by 1130 to avoid the lunch rush. once inside, i ordered the tempura lunch special and he had the sashimi platter. they offer some really good warm tofu (with a speck of meat if you're lucky!) and a little dish of tsukemono. man oh man do they give you a lot of fish! i was slightly disappointed that there was no raw salmon in sight, but the yellowtail more than made up for it. the fish was incredibly fresh, and their tempura is that perfect point between crispy and crunchy. the veggie slabs are huge! i stole the little squids from the bf's plate, and also got to try some of his spicy tuna. honestly, even the rice is good here! no wonder it gets super crowded. lunch definitely seems like the best deal.

The sushi and fish are AMAZING. Don't come here expecting the huge, Americanized, rice-stuffed, cooked rolls. I came with Christina O. who is friends with the owner and has been familiar with the restaurant for years. We had the tofu broth to start and enjoyed lightly battered tempera, unagi, yellowtail, and salmon skin. It gets ridiculously crowded during peak hours (dinner) and the wait can be fairly long but the freshness and quality of the food is definitely worth it.

We sat at the sushi bar, SURPRISINGLY, we were seated immediately for dinner. We must have timed that right. The bar is large, seats many , unlike most of the tiny Little Tokyo bars. There were 爊o visible sushi specials, or the little beer sponsored sushi menus to clutter the counter. Immediately, we were brought our OSHIBORI, which often restaurants take forever to do. Because we were at the bar, we didn't order entrees, 爓hich would be rude to do anyway. I think the host said it's a 4 order minimum per person and no menu items. Sushi bars should be that way, so that's not offensive to me. 3 stars for the rice...it was hard, not as tender as I expect sushi rice to be. However, the sweet vinegar taste was on 爌ar. Toro - MELTED IN MY MOUTH! 5 star toro. Toro should always be this way. Hamachi - good 4 star Kanpachi - good 4 star ikura - good , standard and fresh salmon - 3.5 stars it was kind of standard fresh, not exceptional. That's all I can remember that I ate. All the fish was fresh. Green Tea - was fresh ground tea leaves strained, very oishi. But I had to wait and ask for more tea. Service - typical quick Japanese style. Its the way I like it. Feed me and serve me and leave me alone. Sushi Chef was friendly enough, very talented (I always observe the cutting techniques.) He was quick with making the rice balls, while paying attention to the customers he was serving. This place would have gotten 4 stars if it had better rice. Sushi really can be hit or miss. First of all, it should always be fresh. Rice should always be tender. And the chef should be trained Japanese style (These guys were.) I was once told by a sushi chef I used to know, that he didn't eat sushi. He only ate it while apprenticing to understand the freshness while training with observation. But when he came to the States, he only wanted Hambagas...tasted better to him. My point (in a confusing way) is that excellent sushi is all relative. It depends on what you've had before and what you like. It also depends on what the fish buyer can get. The freshest Squid or Eel will never taste good to me because I simply do not like it. I've had lots of Toro, and this one is the best, but next time I go, it probably won't have the same tasting Toro, because I ate the last of that one. 燭he toro they find might not be as great a quality like tonight's. That being said, it's not the greatest place, it wasn't the worst, it was standard. Fish is fresh, chefs are trained, service is quick.

We were initially looking for a different sushi restaurant but couldn't find it so we settled for this spot and I really enjoyed it. I LOVED the eel roll and the salmon roll. So amazing. We sat at the sushi bar so I am not exactly sure what was on the menu but I have always liked sitting at the bar much more. It was pretty expensive for two people with no alcohol but worth it. I really liked it.

OMG... the fish was amazing! We will be back very soon with friends! Only one neg is that the sushi bar menu does not have prices, and neither does the check. So, no way to monitor charges or keep to a budget. 燬o, if you enjoy the real stuff, GO, but be ready for a hefty check. Well worth every dollar.

A Sushi-Gen meal is amazing in the swiftness in which $160 can be extracted from your wallet in like 20-minutes. 燤y friend and I sat at the bar (4 piece minimum I if recall correctly) and we blew through their sushi like a small town. 燱hen it comes to the service, the word "ninja-like" comes to mind. 燫eal awesome spot (as though it needed another recommendation).

Sushi-Gen is legit. When I take the train up from SD, sometimes my gf and I will stop in here for a quick sushi fix in Little Tokyo. Such a random little spot in that little strip mall with a bunch of Japanese restaurants surrounding but this place stands out. Even the lot attendant makes the mistake of asking if we're going to Sushi-Gen and then corrects himself. Fish is always super fresh and tasty. Usually pretty crowded with a short wait. Love the uni w quail egg. A lot of times we'll look over to the people next to us and have sudden urges to order whatever it is wondering, "How do I even order that?!"

Lunch costs only half as much as dinner does, but the crowd is always big. It's not as bad as it looks as long as you get there early. The sushi quality and quantity is great. The parking lot is small, so you may have to park on the street and walk over. If the crowd is too big, just go somewhere else. The sushi is indeed very good, but not good enough that you can't just skip waiting and eat elsewhere.

So I came here on the first night after landing into LA. Friends of mine took me here last Wed night. It was just the 3 of us and we feasted!! We ordered the sashimi deluxe which was absolutely fantastic. I think the assortment really depends on the day you go. Hit or miss. I don't really like ordering chefs choice of assorted anything.. but my friends advised that it is really well worth it. The assortment of the sashimi deluxe was awesome. We got some toro, tuna, yellowtail, ika and salmon. Not to mention the tuna tartare(both in regular and spicy) We also got the sushi deluxe- that was sad and I was not impressed and it was smaller than the sashimi delux. I had asked the waitress if they had grilled chicken gizzard, and they said yes- they came back with pieces of fried chicken- don't ask. Wanted to return that but the friend had already dived in to it. We also got miso soups which were pretty good- not the heavy and powdery stuff. Also ordered shrimp and vegi tempura which was alright. Including the 2 bottles of sake we ordered I think the bill came out to be $175. Since I had a good experience here and it was the only sushi joint I knew of, I took my cousin here last Sat. It was just the 2 of us and we got there around 9pm. It was packed, but we didn't have to wait. We ordered the sashimi deluxe - and I was soo disappointed. I never stuffed myself with so much tuna! That's all there was and like 3 pieces of salmon!!! Fresh, yes- assortment BAD!! We also ordered the grilled smelt fish which was sad. I've had much better in NYC. We also got an order of uni - thank goodness I was happy with uni.. ohh.. yummy uni.. Anyway, would I go back again? Maybe on a week night. Would I give the sashimi deluxe another shot?? yes, but on a weeknight- What about a weekday? No - order a' la cart

I've never been here for dinner so I'm only rating Sushi Gen on my lunch experience which has always been great...now that I think about it I've never ordered anything other than the sashimi platter...but anyway, the sashimi platter for $15 is absolutely fantastic...a HUGE plate of sashimi with 5 or 6 different types of fish that are all fresh and delicious...There are alot of sushi places in LA but you won't find that kind of value anywhere else...There can be a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth it...

One of the best sushi places I have been to in Los Angeles. The fish is super fresh, the star of the show, which is what a real sushi place is all about! No rolls here stuffed with imitation crab, tempura shrimp, and lathered in japanese mayo and sauces. My dad and I ordered the sashimi deluxe, sea urchin with quail egg, spanish mackeral, and yellow tail. Everything was delicious. The highlights were the toro, yellow tail, salmon, and sea urchin. Everything was so fresh that it tasted smooth and buttery. Mmmm...I could eat it everyday! I can't wait to go back for their lunch specials. They sound awesome as well! Thanks May W. for turning me onto this place :)

Maybe i went on a bad night? But even still, a bad night at my Miki's in A-squared would be about 7 times better....so....i mean, great sushi makes you freak out a little. This limited, frankly- boring menu was on the expensive side esp considering it's ho-hum factor. I don't mind paying those prices when your eyes go wide and the freshness awakens your palate and excites your mind- but NONE of that is happenin' here. Again I ask- does LA even KNOW GOOD SUSHI? Cuz I'm getting desperate here...I might try it again EXCEPT that I have eaten at SO MANY places in LA that people rave about only to be so disappointed! And PS, lots of Asian people in a restaurant is NOT a guarantee that it is good.

This place is definitely a true sushi place. It's been here for more than 30 years. The sushi is fresh and the service is great. The trouble with this place is that the parking sucks and there's a long wait time. The sweet shrimp was delicious and we had the tails deep fried. AMAZING!! I had sea urchin once and it was disgusting. My co worker recommended their sea urchin to me so I decided to try it and it was delicious. The texture was gooey but it was unusually sweet and very tasty. If you want real Japanese sushi, send your friends here.

Fresh fish - plain and simple and good. However, this was one of the most lackluster Omakase experiences I've ever had. My best friend and I weren't served any particularly unique types of fish and the atmosphere was very rush people in and rush them out. I've been having Omakase at a different sushi restaurant about once a month for almost a year with my best friend and this was a very "eh" kind of experience. I did enjoy that we got a good amount of fresh fish and it was well crafted, but the itamae didn't seem to put too much concern into the order in which our sushi was given. I wanted to give 3.5 stars, but Yelp won't let me and 4 wouldn't quite feel right. So I'll go with A-Okay.

I'm a big fan of raw fish... (mind out of the gutters you pervs) and I must say the fish here was fresh, the waiters friendly and extremely helpful... not to mention not too bad to look at; although they looked about the age of 18... way too young for my blood. I would definitely revist during happy hour. The only downside would be the creepy garage that you have to park in and the perfume of rancid pee as you walk towards the restaurant. Other than that... it's a go for me!

Really fresh, delicate, yummy fish in a casual, un-intimidating enviroment. We sat at the sushi bar and did a mini-omakase...just let the chef choose some sushi for us, but not a ton. Still ended up being a bit pricier than I expected for the amt of fish, but great service and really really fresh and delicious fish. I'm still obsessed with sushi-sushi in beverly hills, so this wasn't as amazing as that...but def. great sushi in the downtown area.

This is my new favorite Japanese restaurant. The sashimi is so fresh I don't think you'll find any sushi better than here. Their sashimi specials are worth every penny (lunch or dinner). Their rice is cooked to perfection! individual rice, tender texture, and just beautiful. Their miso soups are excellent as well (with clams, shrimp, mushroom or tofu) The only con, they take reservations one week in advance. and they open on 5pm on weekends and 5:30 on weekdays. (just in case you want to get in line before they open :p ) Highly recommend their sashimi/sashimi deluxe. i dont think their dinner combo's are worth it as much....

first let's say this place is located on EAST 2nd st. 爓e had the hardest time finding the place. right when you walk in the smell of fish takes over. at this point you know its different from your regular sushi spots. the sushi chef we had (did not get his name) was great! very nice and accommodating to us first-timers. DO: - get the plum wine. - try the spicy scallop, japanese mackrel, and monkfish liver. - expect to spend at LEAST $40 for a meal that tastes amazing- probably the freshest fish i've ever had. DON'T: - expect any of your regular rolls (i.e., anything with tempura, mayo, etc.). - come hungry.. you won't leave happy. overall a great sushi spot if you wanna have fresh fish and good conversation.

Sushi Gen is a delight if you are into sashimi. Plain and simple. Between two people, we ordered the Sushi deluxe and with two sides of rice. The deluxe has an assortment of everything ( seaweed, meshed spicy tuna, salmon skin 燼nd the sashimi ( yellowtail, toro, tuna , salmon) are super soft. They melt in your mouth!! I give 4 stars for the sushi. Now the reason for it being a 3 star... The wait is way too long especially if you go during dinner time. I like walking into a restaurant and being seated within the next 20 - 30 minutes. Any where that you have to wait longer than that, sends my appetite away. We had to wait an hour until we got seated and it wasn't even a weekend. Also, some of the host at the front is not very friendly, nor the waitresses. They are so busy that you have to repeatedly ask for your request and when asked, they seem annoyed giving us short answers. Toshi in Studio City is still my favorite!

I'm always asked where you can find a sushi restaurant with skilled chefs (or itamaes). 營 can't think of anywhere else in LA but Sushi Gen for having experienced sushi chefs who, combined, have over 100 years of experience. 燜or the quality of fish and artistry and skills possessed by the chefs, the price is more than reasonable... and the wait should be expected. 營f you want cheap, fast, and so-so sushi, you're in the wrong place.

The sushi restaurant market in Los Angeles is hyper-competitive; on my little block of West Hollywood alone there are two sushi spots. On the drive over to Sushi Gen I thought how can this place be so popular? It's infamous for slow service and does not even have a website. When Toshiaki Toyoshima opened Sushi Gen in 1980, could he have imagined his small, authentic restaurant (now expanded to twice its original size) would thrive in a city awash with sushi options? I arrived with two friends at 1:00 p.m. on a Friday to find a packed house with a line out the door. This is my 5th review of low cost lunch offerings in Little Tokyo and we came specifically for the sashimi lunch special. We started off with small plates of pickles, sunomono (Japanese salad that enhances the appetite), delicate tofu cubes with a lovely hint of beef broth and miso soup. The sashimi special comes in ceramic platters holding pillars of fish and others made into salads. The generous portions of tuna, halibut and yellowtail were ultra-fresh with perfect texture and taste. Equally as good were small portions of squid and crab. There was no salmon except for a cooked portion which I found to be tasty (surprising given the fact that I normally feel that cooking salmon is a waste of good fish). The chopped and spicy tuna salads were good but visually unappealing. In the end, at just $15 their sashimi special is exceptional both in terms of the quality and variety of fish and price. It ranks #1 in this series to date...but stay tuned for more reviews.

There are comparable places in the area that get close to the quality of fish here at maybe 1/2 the price. 燘ut, if money isn't an issue, and you value quality sushi, Sushi Gen is something that you would want to try. 燗ll sashimi here shines especially the toro and yellowtail. 燭his place will be your standard to which you judge all your sushi from now on.

Long wait... Difficult to park. Somewhat expensive (unless you get the lunch special), but probably one of the top sushi places I've ever eaten at. Sweet shrimp with the udon soup is AMAZING. My mouth was very happy. But everything in general was really fresh, and somehow extremely tasty even compared to really good sushi places. It never ceases to amaze me how much something as simple as raw salmon can differ from one place to another, but this place just is better. I highly recommend coming here at least once.

I had a great dinner here with a friend last night, we reminisced about other fab meals we'd shared at sushi gen in the past. mmm. sushi gen is amazing for high quality fish and good service. Sit at the bar. Don't bother asking what things cost (really? If you're out to eat sushi, don't let the cost deter you ever). Order the hamachi-kama, which is the best broiled hamachi collar you will ever eat. So buttery and delicious. Spanish mackerel with their green yuzu sauce (which they'll put on scallops if you ask), heaven. go. bring your mom.

does anyone know how to put in half stars? because they really deserve a 3.5 rating. i've been going to sushi gen for a couple years now. to summarize: -above average sushi -wonderful service (the japanese women there are so sweet!) -hiro, the lunchtime host, is awesome (call in and he'll save you a table!) the big sell at sushi-gen is their unmatched lunch special. i've skipped my noon classes just to make it.

Simply the best! 營 always come here for their lunch special. 燭he sashimi mix is around $12 with 6-7 different fishes, served with miso soup and rice. 燘ut this place is super crowded. 營 usually get there by 11:15am and be the first in, otherwise the wait can be more than 1 hour!

The food was OK, but I have had better for cheaper. They refuse to split a check (and when you have 7 people, no one can just "pay it all", and the size of their drink for the price is laughable (approx. half a can for $2.00 w. no refills). The price wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't for the above issues. That and the fact it looks like they edit their yelp page so this review wont even make it through. �Seriously guys, get a computer, or even a cheap cell phone! they all do the math for you!

They say you have to try everything twice before judgment. I'll teeter on the fence with 3 stars for now. I tried Sushi Gen last Monday for the first time. Teriyaki Chicken was very good. But the salad (chopped julienned iceberg and thousand island) would not cut it for a restaurant so highly rated in my opinion. Teriyaki beef was sub-par. I also ordered the fatty tuna, $25 for six pieces. Tempura was just okay. I will try it again, once I save up enough money to where Sushi Gen will not make a dent in my bank account.

This is a small place that has decent sushi. There were only a couple of fish that I noticed being really good, which are: yellowtail, blue fin tuna, and albacore. 燱e got the sashimi combo dinner which I think is a good deal. 燗lthough it seemed like we just got little chunks of leftover spicy tuna or something. 燘ut it had nice samples of other stuff, like octopus, squid, halibut, yellowtail, and crab. 燬o its a good little sampler platter, thats all. 燱hatever you do, don't pay for getting cold sake in a box. 燘ring your own little wooden box or something, but this is in no way worth paying double for. 燚oesn't change the taste in my opinon at all. 燯nless you want to imagine you're in a misty japanese tea garden or something i don't think its worth it. 營 guess its for the experience and all, but you can experience that at home and pay much less. 燬o just get it in the regular sake cup if you're thinking about it. �Other then that I recommend sushi gen for decent sushi on select fish at a little bit above the average price for dinner. 營 think about half the fish is pretty good and fresh and half is just so so. 燗lso, decent atmosphere and good service. 營'd give it 3 1/2 stars really.

The lunch specials are quite possibly the best deals in L.A. for fresh fish. Even though I love the weird and wacky rolls, the sushi here is straight forward and simple and it's the freshness that keeps me coming back...that and the salmon collar special where you get little mounds of various edibles in addition to your fish. Sure, there are 燼 jillion sushi places, but I've never had sashimi or sushi from Sushi Gen that tasted and smelled too fishy, like today's lunch at random sushi restaurant .

Excellent sushi. The freshness of the sushi was something I have missed since eating sushi up in the bay area. I went here with my brother and his wife on my birthday. Granted the wait time to get a table was extensive to say the least, however, it was well worth it once I took my first bite of sushi. The next time I make my way over there I'm going to make sure I can make it an early dinner so hopefully I'll miss the rush.

Nestled in a downtown funky little strip mall called Honda Square, it's no wonder there was already a line to get in. We put our name on the list and only had to wait 15 minutes on a Saturday night at 8. All of the food was incredibly fresh and well-presented. Service and hospitality was impeccable. We kept our order simple: Miso soup, edamame, spicy tuna rolls, baked clam & mushroom, fried calamari, salmon skin salad and two bottles of hot saki. We got out of there for under $50 which is the deal of the century.

yum yum yum. That is all I have to say. my bf and i sat at the bar and ordered tons of sushi and beer. It was SOOO delicious. the Sushi chef was super nice and interacted with us while we ate. He recommended different fish, rolls, and items on the menu and it all turned out to be delicious! We ordered only sushi items...toro roll was great! salmon, halibut, octopus, yellowtail, fatty yellowtail.. etc... it was all good. the fish was really great quality, in fact, I'd have to say that it's better than anywhere else we've been in LA... We saw the oysters on the half shells that looked really good but we were stuffed from all the other fish so we decided that we would go back another day!

Hmmmmmm 340+ REVIEWS and almost a perfect rating......somethings need no explanation. If you like sushi you will like Sushi Gen. I have been coming here for over 20 years (yeah I got pictures bitch ass haters) Let me say that again "I HAVE BEEN COMING HERE FOR OVER 20 YEARS" - ahhhh yes Hater evaporation in full effect. This place is very good......from presentation, ingredients, decor....you know what, im starting to sound like a food snob......eff all that. This place is the BOMB....there is always a line during lunch rush...acutally theres always a line at dinner too. Dont go between 12-2 pm or 6-8 pm, unless you like waiting for about 30-60 minutes for a table. Some items I have tried...... SASHIMI DINNER (or LUNCH) - Read the other reviews and you will see this is where they SHINE! 燣ARGE FRESH CUTS OF A WIDE VARIETY OF FISH. BEEF/SALMON TERIYAKI - I like the beef much better than the salmon. 燘eef is actually very very good. TEMPURA - My daughter is a tempura expert and this is her favorite spot. Light with excellent body, very tough to do with tempura because of the way the batter is supposed to set. CHAWAN MUSHI - I dont eat it at all but my aunt loves it. SPICY TUNA - Not as good as Noshi, but good enough. CHICKEN KARA-AGE - I have had better, slightly above average. CLAM/MISO SOUP - Excellent flavor and balance. RICE - I include this because there is a subtle art in making rice, and these people are on point. SALMON SKIN SALAD - Excellent and fresh. OYSTERS - POPS LOVES EM and they are fresh. This is all I can think of right now. There are so many other things on the menu, you just have to see it to understand. OVERALL.............. Food is FRESH and made with care, and thats the bottom line when you eat sushi. Prices are slightly a bit higher than normal but its not outrageous (if you have a job, you should be ok, lol), what do you expect with such quality food. Service is A++++ all day every day. 燭hey know how to take care of a customer. 營n all my years of eating here I cannot remember one bad experience. Overall a very very easy A+ grade. Peace and "Toirei wa doko des ka bitches?"

I've been here literally more than a hundred times but never thought of giving it a nice review. I tried other sushi places on Yelp but this is still no.1 to me. I love going there on weekdays, 6-630pm or after 9 to avoid waiting. They're a little pricey but reasonable comparing to those Americanized Sushi places in Beverly Hills. Most importantly, I never eaten anything that is not fresh. I would definitely give A for food and A for service. I've built a good relationship with chefs and waitress that I always get free snacks, and getting sake without checking ID. =)

Sushi Gen is hands down my #1 sushi bar in California. The prices are worth the fresh & extremely high quality fish. Their uni, toro, yellow tail belly, engawa sashimi, Japanese or Spanish mackerel, are among my favorites. We usually eat at the bar omikase and never leave unsatisfied. Without alcohol, omikase can cost about $100 to $120 depending on how big of an appetite you've got but you can get away for less than $40-$50 a person ordering from the sushi menu. You can expect to pay less if you order the combos from the regular menu. Great food and service!

What can I say thats bad about this place...hummm...long wait maybe...but well WORTH IT!!!!!! The cost might be a bit expensive but once you try this place you will totally understand why. For those of you who love sashimi this is the place to come too. Sashimi plate for lunch best deal in town if your in the mood and the area. Sashimi plate for dinner best experience for those of you who haven't ever tried sashimi or a sashimi lover. The salmon skin salad bomb....chkn tempura combo bomb...the best and my favorite is not the toro or white fish...but the salmon sushi OMG just melts in your mouth and call it a day...just order that and you in...they also have plenty other great items you can get on the menu.

I am always, always skeptical about sushi places even those with excellent reviews. I was pleasantly surprised with this place. The fish was fresh, cut well and it was nice to find a place that doesn't pour a shit ton of any kind of sauce on the sushi (it came on the side). The flavors are that of a good, regular, no-frills neighborhood sushi joint I remember from childhood... it sucks that this, in the states, would make it the excellent place to dine and a place you can't just walk in, sit at the counter and chat with the chef while enjoying some sushi. Despite the crowds and long waits, I'm glad Sushi Gen is around and I would go back (with a reservation, early, when they open).

The only thing that was good was the albacore tataki but there was only a few pieces for $15. overall the food was overprice and deceiving. the service: people were generally nice but since we came late for lunch they should have told us that the kitchen was about to close in 20 minutes. they didnt bother getting us tea or asking us if we want seconds. all they did was handed us our bill without asking if the food is great or not.

What i dig: salmon, monkfish liver, yellowtail, baby yellowtail, halfbeak, some of the apps are good too. What i don't: price is a bit high but not outrageous, all the fun crazy sushi you don't see in other places on the menu may not be in stock.

Heard the raves from my coworkers and decided to finally give it a try. Had their most popular Sashimi Delux that came with miso soup, tofu and pickled cucumber. The miso soup was pretty typical, but the tofu was nicely simmered in the soy sauce. Very savory. The sashimi plate was plentiful and full of varieties that included: spicy tuna, albacore, yellowtale, crab meat, cuttlefish, octopus and toro. The food was more than enough and the quality of the fish was better than most, although I found the albacore to be a bit grainy.

I was introduced to Sushi Gen last year and this place is definitely my new favorite sushi joint in LA. I'm a sashimi fan so i always get the sashimi and monk fish liver when I come here. I've had their salmon as well and its pretty good but sashimi still tops everything else. The cuts are thick, just like how they do it in Japan. The wait is always long but once you get a table, its not too bad. I would recommend this place to anybody who loves sushi.

As a resident of Little Tokyo, I've tried basically every sushi restaurant in the area and Sushi Gen has some of the freshest fish (Sushi Komasa isn't bad either). 燭here's usually a line so expect a wait but it's worth it. 燭he fish is so fresh it just melts in your mouth. 燭here's none of that gross fishy smell or taste -- just delicious sushi. 營'm a big fan of their yellowtail and halibut. 燗nd when you order halibut, they ask if you want ponzu, which is a plus. 燗 lot of sushi places I've been to don't ask about ponzu. 燭hey expect that you'll just dunk your halibut in your soy sauce. 燘ut at the risk of sounding like a sushi snob, halibut is meant to be dipped in ponzu. 燗 more delicate sauce for a more delicate fish. 燬oy sauce would completely drown out the flavor of the halibut. Regarding their combo/bento box type dishes, their chicken and beef teriyaki are pretty run of the mill. 營 also tasted some of my friend's fried sole fillet and it was really good. 燭he fillet is pounded until it's ultra thin and it has a really light batter. 營t's nice and crisp but not so thick that you can't taste the fish anymore. 燭he combos are pretty small though. 燳ou have to order additional sushi to fill yourself up. 燱ithout alcohol, expect to spend around $25. 燱ith a few bottles of beer, closer to $35.

Sushi Gen is probably the best for its price sushi place in LA. Don't expect your fusion rolls here. This place has a very small selection of rolls to choose from. This restaurant serves traditional Japanese sushi. I recommend the Sashimi Deluxe. I always order this with a side of sushi rice so I can eat it Chirashi style. The Sashimi Deluxe is $45 and should be enough for two maybe three people, depending on how much you can eat. When I sit at the sushi bar, the sushi chefs will always give me their recommendations. Friendly staff and good food. This place is great!

Living in los angeles, I frequently travel to Little Tokyo and this is my favorite place to get sushi. 燭hey have very good service amidst the crowds. 燭he sushi is always fresh and their portions are very generous. 燝oing there for lunch is a really good deal and I usually order a combination of chicken or steak teriyaki with sashimi. For lunch i usually get out of there under 20 dollars total and for dinner probably more around 30. 燭he teriyaki is very simple and tasty. 燭hey use very lean meat and once again the portions are very good. 燤y recommendation is to go for lunch early like around 11:30. 燭his place really gets busy around primetime and you can easily have to wait half to a full hour.

I never thought I'd say this but I actually was so full off sushi I didn't think I could eat anymore sushi for another month. Ok I take it back, maybe a week or so, but still, that was a LOT of food. I went for dinner and we got chirashi and sashimi deluxe. Plus an extra order of the Spanish mackerel and the sweet shrimp. Sweet shrimp was awesome, comes with fried crispy heads. But seriously, way too much food. The fish were all very fresh, and the sashimi deluxe was ginormous. We probably could've split one of those and just kept the 2 extra orders of sushi. I never thought I'd get to the point where I couldn't eat one more bite of sashimi. I also didn't know what kind of fish I was eating near the end, but I tried the toro off the sashimi deluxe. Didn't really "melt in my mouth" like people say toro is, but then again I never was a huge tuna fan. With all that food bill came out around $100. Of course, you can also go in and order California rolls and chicken teriyaki but seriously, come here for the sashimi and sushi it's more worth it.

For the 爏ushi purist who has scoured the city for an authentic sushi experience without the flashing bulbs of hollywood -- i would suggest this hidden gem in downtown LA (Little Tokyo)... The sushi is fresh and the variety is amazing, word is the sushi Chef has been a staple at the fish market for over 20 years and gets prime choice of fish.... And tasting is believing... If you want to venture out for a great lunch or a quick seat at the sushi bar.... i suggest you try -- yellow tail, toro, 爅apanese red snapper...and the eel is second to none... �燭he ambience is authentic, no slick art or art deco chairs -- just a basic interior where the attention is paid to your "sushi" not your "inner" art critic...

Been coming to sushi gen for close to 6 years now, ever since i was in High School, when it was recommended to me by a friend. 燞e said if you came here and only ordered the sashimi lunch plate for the rest of your life you'd a happy man. And i did...it was awesome...and i'm going there today. I've never had any other of their meals but i don't feel like i'm missing out, they give out generous portions and alot of appetizers that'll get your chops going before the main course. Pros: Fresh Fish, service, price Cons: Busy, Very Busy at lunch, expensive if you sit at the bar.

I am finally able to try the sushi at the restaurant instead of the take-out! Eventhough there was an hour wait for a table, the wait was worth it. The tuna was melt in your mouth! Order the sashimi deluxe because it's always a good deal and you never know what juicy morsels of fish will be awaiting you. The miso with the red snapper head was excellent! Very prompt service (they bring you the check ASAP so you don't linger) so not a good date place.

My absolute favorite sushi place in LA! Everybody knows the weekday lunches have long long lines because it's so good and so cheap! 營 can't really eat sushi at other places because its just not as fresh as Sushi Gen! I usually order take out from them at night as well. 營 just found out that they will not let me order take out in the summer because it's too hot out =( The Sashimi plate/lunch/dinner is so good so fresh and only $15(lunch), $26(dinner) and the portion is huge!

People in-the-know go to Sushi Gen for the sashimi plate. It's a weekday lunch special, and the restaurant gets pretty crowded. In fact, patrons start standing in line by 10:30am, half an hour before opening time. I've tried making reservations in the past, but that didn't always work out. Your entire party has to be present or else they might not honor your reservation. Service is usually pretty quick once you get seated. If you order the sashimi plate like I always do, it comes with rice, miso soup, cold seaweed and hot tofu side dishes. Absolutely Delicious!! The plate itself consists of approximately 15 pieces of assorted sashimi and some grilled salmon. Pretty sweet deal for everything you get! For those who aren't in the mood for sashimi, no worries! There's a pretty nice selection of teriyaki plates, sushi, chirashi, meat and fish dishes. FYI- However, if you are planning on doing the popular sashimi plate weekday lunch special, make sure to ask for a booth/table. You can't order this dish at the sushi bar. I love this place and have been going here for ages. This "hidden find" isn't so hidden anymore!

Venue The inside is actually way bigger than what I imagined from just looking at the restaurant from the outside. Its cute inside, nothing grand, just a nice authentic Japanese sushi restaurant. Parking There is a small parking lot for the plaza. The first 2 hours are $1.50 with validation. I'm not sure how much it is after that. Food I ordered the chicken terriyaki + sashimi combo. It comes with rice, miso soup, and a tofu side. The chicken terriyaki came with salad and a type of mashed potato. The sashimi was nice and fresh. The whole meal was about $15. �Service The waitresses were very nice and polite. The service was fast. Even though there were a lot of people waiting in line, we got our table in less than 10 minutes. Overall, it was a good place to eat some simple, fresh sushi (without all that jazz).

This place is not overrated. It genuinely deserves 5 stars. Visited a few times in the past few months and never disappointed. I haven't met anyone who doesn't agree that 爐his is one of the best, if not THE best lunch sushi/sashimi place in LA. Just get there around 11am, and you should be able to make the 1st sitting. If you arrive at 11:15am (opening time) you're really pushing your luck. First visit I got the Sushi Deluxe. Great nigiri sushi. Good value for the quality, but not as good as the sashimi lunch. (both $15). Sashimi lunch is terrific, great variety, super fresh everything. Comes with steamed rice (refillable). It might not seem like alot of stuff, but I eat A LOT, and the sashimi lunch with rice is actually very filling. On my most recent visit we also got some ala carte nigiri sushis. They're great too, but more expensive. 6 pieces of Albacore nigiri cost as much as a sashimi lunch! anyways, GO EAT.

I've eaten at a number of Japanese restaurants, but Sushi Gen by far stands out as one of the best I've ever eaten at. The sashimi is OUTSTANDING, the tempura is perfectly crunchy, and although the dishes are on the pricier side, the quality of the food more than makes up for it. This is also a great place for an informal date.

This is a great and authentic sushi restaurant. You will not find fancy rolls here but what you will find is fresh fish, good service and nice atmosphere especially at the bar. I have gone to this place often and they are consistant with the freshness and quality of the fish. Probably cause they are blocks away from the best Japanese fish market in LA.

Simply put, Sushi-gen is the most overrated Japanese restaurant in LA. I don't know if the other yelpers are just accustomed to bad food or if they are stereotypical white folks that have never tasted sushi. I'd rather drive all the way to redondo beach for some amaebi than this restaurant. Here are some things that i really hated about this restaurant. 1. Line was way too long during weekend. I usually go eat out on weekend nights and i had to wait outside for an hour and 30 minutes. 2. Price isn't even that cheap. You are looking at overpriced toro,uni, amaebi for the quality of it. 3. Service is slow. It's understandable in a way because there were a lot of people in the place but they should hire more sushi-man or something for faster service. I think i waited around 15 mins for a plate of sushi. 4. Fish quality and portion sucks. I was expecting bigger, fresher sushi for the price but it was small and cheap quality. As a sushi connoisseur who has had sushi at many different restaurants, I found that the quality of the fish (not high ends but ones like salmon tuna yellow tail) was decent. However, you can easily find the same if not better grade at other restaurants in LA. Do not be fooled by the restaurants allure just because its located in jtown and has recieved raving reviews from yelpers that do not know what they are talking about.

All about value. I've ordered toro sushi at another lower class restaurant listed at "market price". It cost $25. I ordered it here and two pieces cost $8. The fish is extremely fresh. The first time I went here, I have never had fresh sushi. I was completely blown away and every place that has sushi and those dragon rolls don't even compare even more. Don't get me wrong, a good spider roll is still welcome in my tummy. But now when I eat tuna, salmon, etc., I just keep thinking, I wish I was eating at Sushi Gen. I got the $35 Sashimi Deluxe which is an amazing bargain for the types of freshness of the fish. I finished it the first time. And I shared it with my friend the second time. Lunch is even better. $14 gets you a decent sized sashimi lunch. Just enough to leave you satisfied.

Definitely a great spot for fresh fish, but beware of the many pitfalls that plague this establishment. For starters, there are no reservations (which is a decision I would concur with if you are a sushi restaurant), but sitting at the sushi bar is nearly impossible due to the long wait times. 燬econdly, be prepared to spend a pretty penny. 燳ou do receive great fresh fish in return, but, compared to the other places in Little Tokyo, this place doesn't seem to measure up in terms of cost to quality.

Don't understand why this place got a high rating. Over-priced, sushi was blah & decor wasn't great. Three strikes. Thought it would be authentic Japanese sushi, but it wasn't. Our handrolls came out looking like messily rolled crayons, with a flap of extra seaweed at the end folded up on itself. They're supposed to be shaped like a funnel! Cannot believe they would allow that to come out, let alone serve it. I've gotten fresher sushi, from real sushi chefs at Hama Sushi and a better experience for much less. 燨ther sushi restaurants will also give you complimentary dessert. Sushi-Gen does NOT. Don't believe the high reviews & lines. NOT worth it. First and last time.

Eat here on a pretty regular basis, typically for lunch, and have NOT had to wait much despite what others say. 燦ot sure if its timing or luck, or the fact that I usually sit at the sushi bar, but, it seems like the wait is usually for those who choose to sit at a table. My usual favorites include hamachi belly, uni, as well their monk fish liver appetizer which is fantastic when it is served slightly warm. 燭he amaebi (sweet shrimp) which you can request to have head used to make miso is also a consistent winner, although not coming close to the traditional japanese amaebi you find in Hokkaido which is much smaller in size, very seasonal, and usually not available. 燭hey do also sometimes carry both chu-toro (medium fatty) as well as o-toro (extra fatty) depending on what you're looking for. 營 generally don't bother with the white tunas or the albacores, so I can't speak to it. 燘ut I love aji (spanish mackeral) except that like many sushi places, they tend to drown it with too much ponzu. 燜ortunately, this is an easy fix simply by asking the chef to take it easy on the sauce. 營 have yet to be disappointed by the seafood they serve here, with the exception of my last visit, where Kanpachi simply wasn't up to Gen's normal standards, but, at the same time, it the was the first time I'd been served by that particular chef (the one at the end) and maybe his knife had just been used to cut another more pungent fish. 燱orth removing a star? 營 think not (yet). 燘ottom line, good reliable fish for those who like raw fish, with the occasional specials thrown into the mix, albeit overall not tons of variety per se. 燗nd yes, they can be pricey depending on what you order, but, as others have said, there are other options as well. All in all, I think a few things need to be acknowledged, based on the reviews I've seen. 燜irst of all, being busy is a good sign that inventory is being turned over, which is especially important when it comes to fish, so all of those complaining about the wait should either show up earlier or get over it. 燗ny busy good restaurant requires some sort of wait. 燬econd, the comment made about "anyone can do fresh fish" if you have the money is a little irresponsible. 燦ot everyone can do fresh fish, as demonstrated by the host of sushi restaurants out there, including many who can clearly afford it, who do not serve great fish. 燭hose of you who have been to a major fish market like the Tokyo Fish market and understand the lengths the Japanese go to in order to secure the best ingredients will attest to the fact that selecting, buying, and having access to great fish is a challenge in itself. 燝reat sushi preparers treat the process of selecting, handling, cleaning, preparing, triming, and serving their fish much like the way fine steakhouses and serious shabu shabu places do in how they prepare, trim, and age their own meats. 營ts certainly not as simple as buy, slice and serve as some would have you believe. 燬o appreciate the unique attention on handling the fish for what its worth.

sushi gen is a machine. 爐hey pump out quality sashimi platters at top speed. 爓e got a table on a friday night (after waiting for 40 minutes) after hearing all the hype. 爄 think i would give this place 3.5 stars for now, if i could. 爀verything was good, but not spectacular. 爄 think because this place felt like such a machine compared to Sushi Go 55, where everything is small, and there is such attention to detail. 爉aybe this is sort of the downtown equivalent to Hide on the westside. 燽oth are generally good, but something about them gives me this mass production feel. �we got the sashimi deluxe platter, which had tons of fish but maybe not the best. 爁or example, i dont like how the tuna was chopped up. 燼lso the spicy tuna - not so crazy about that. and the cooked salmon? i don't understand. 爄 like my sashimi platters to be - well, just straight sashimi. 爈ike sushi go 55's sashimi plate, which comes with delicious albacore, rice, miso soup and tons of little veggies (all for about $20 or so). 爓e also had the kumamoto oysters and they were good, but i've had better (at sushi zo). overall, gen is good for the value, and i see why many people go here. 爄 think next time i'll sit at the sushi bar because that's going to be a totally different experience. 爄'd like to do that so that i can add one more star - the sushi experience is not all about getting platters. 爄t's definitely not about quantity. 爁or now, i still like sushi go 55 better - a lot of the patrons there are actually japanese, whereas sushi gen obviously caters to a different demographic. 爄 guess it's just a matter of personal preference!

Come on people, this is the real deal. 營f you want the freshest sushi served a la carte, come to this place and sit at the sushi bar. 燛ither tell the sushi chef what you want or order the Omikase. 燭hat is definitely the way to go at this place for one of the best sushi experiences in LA. 營f you're getting a table to entertain friends, talk, etc., you can still order sushi nagiri or sashimi, but this fish is so fresh that its taste changes from the time it goes from the sushi chef to your table 25 feet away. 燬eriously. 燚on't get me wrong, it will still be better than 99% of all sushi served in LA, but it won't be primo. 燗lso their dinner specials of sashimi, sushi, tempura, and teriyaki are all extremely solid. 燤y only gripe is the sashimi dinner is a little bit tuna heavy, and for some of us, we'd like to spread the love around a little bit. 燗lso, if you're expecting antics, fire, dark lighting, or indoor waterfalls, you will be let down. 燬ushi Gen does not do anything except create a clean, comfortable, well lit environment for you to sample the freshest fish available. 營f you want theatrics, try Wokcano, Sushi Roku, or the like. 燘ut, you won't have fish like this.

Although a little too small for it's long line of patrons, I can confirm it was worth the wait if all you want is plain sushi. I tried the sashimi lunch plate (upon everyones' suggestion) & enjoyed every bite, so no complaint here other than the constant buzz of worker bees & getting the bill before I even started (felt too rushed). Still, friendly place, efficient service & excellent, mouth-watering sushi! Note* Only one toilet in the women's restroom & parking's $4.

My roommate and I had mutual, very intense cravings for sushi one night, so we drove down to little Tokyo in search of a new sushi find. I recalled that Sushi Gen was supposed to be a good place, so we wandered over to Honda Plaza and strolled into Sushi Gen. For a Tuesday, it was packed, and the only seats we could get without a wait were at the bar. We ordered piece after piece of nigiri and got an appetizer of softshell crab. Everything was extremely fresh. Standouts were the japanese snapper, dusted with yuzu and a light soysauce; the yellowtail belly, which was buttery and melted in my mouth; the salmon, and the halibut. The chef told us that a lot of the fish had been flown in from Japan, and I believed him.....each piece of sashimi or nigiri was unbelievably fresh. My roomie said she was still dreaming of the taste of the snapper hours later. Even the softshell crab was excellent for what it was, it was perfectly battered and fresh out of the deep fryer- hot and succulent. Only downsides...the service was a bit spotty at times...but I think this was due to the fact that there were few servers and the place was packed. Also, the bill came out to $73 for the two of us, which isn't bad for sushi that fresh, but I have had excellent experiences at Azami for a bit cheaper. Other than that, this place was great, and we will be back again!

Hi all! �I want to share my omakase experience with ya (and to make you jealous of the dinner I had last night). �We received two pieces of sushi for each order. 燱e ended up paying about $100 per head. 燞ere is a list of what we got and the order it was presented: 1. 爋toro (super fatty toro - almost too fatty, no effort needed to eat because it just melts in my mouth) 2. 爇ampachi (one of my favorites - just enough chewy texture) 3. 爐ai with yuzu and light soy sauce ponzu (loved the yuzu and ponzu combination, came with partial skin) 4. 燼ji with grated ginger, onions and ponzu (tasted more like snapper than mackerel - ginger and ponzu works) 5. 爉irugai (one of my all time favorites, but just ok here - probably the least fresh of everything I had that night) 6. 燼nago (usually would never order cooked stuff, but part of omakase, not smelly or fishy, sauce was not overly sweet) 7. 爑ni (very fresh and clean, not muddy and salty) 8. 燼ma ebi (very good, funny how entire row had it at same time) 9. 燼ma ebi head in miso soup (soup was not salty, good use of white miso, shrimp head added a deeper flavor not found in regular miso) 10. engawa for me (engawa better as sashimi, but still very good) 11. negi-otoro maki (otoro maki was so good - I could eat 50 of them) 12. 爃amachi belly for me (so buttery, the color was very pure) Worth every dollar, including the $2.50 parking fee for the lot.

This amazing sushi bar should not be missed. 營n a land of mediocre sushi, this place is a shining star of a standout. I have been coming to Sushi-Gen forever. 燤y grandfather was a famous sushi chef who wrote five Japanese cookbooks and was a complete traditional sushi purist. 燱hen he was still alive, the only places he would go in J-Town were Sushi-Gen and Sushi Imai (now closed). 燦ow I'm ruined for all other sushi and have very high, traditional standards for sushi quality, authenticity and presentation (i.e., I HATE things like rainbow rolls, Safeway sushi, etc.). �The way to do Sushi Gen (and all other sushi) is by getting a seat at the bar. 燭his guarantees direct interaction with the chefs, and you get to see the quality and texture of the sushi you order. �This is not a commentary on Sushi Gen, but on all sushi places: I generally think managers and chefs reserve the freshest, best cuts of sushi for people who are going to eat at the bar. 營 think the assumption is that people who opt for a table are not really in it for the "true sushi experience" and probably aren't as discriminating with their sushi. 燗lso, people sitting at tables are (1) less likely to spend money and (2) are more likely to order sacrilegious things like teriyaki chicken.) 營t is for this reason that I usually discount people's reviews when they sit at tables or think that the words "affordable" and "sushi" should go together somehow. 營 prescribe to the view that sushi should be an authentic experience, where people take time to savor each unique pure fish flavor (rather than mixing them all together in some weird fusion roll), and people should resign themselves to paying good money for great service with amazingly fresh fish. OK, now that I'm off my sushi rant, here is more on Sushi Gen: At Sushi Gen, you should request to be seated at the bar in front of Toyo-San (he's the owner). 燞e will make you feel special and completely taken care of. 營f you can't sit in front of him, don't worry. 燗ll of his chefs were personally trained by him. 燭oyo-san is a quiet guy but he really loves it when people love his sushi. 燞e's really adorable. �Sushi eating is not a rushed experience here. 燳ou order each piece directly from the chef. �I have been disheartened recently by the number of sushi bars that just pass you the sushi checklist and then prepare stuff in the back, and bring it all out at once). 燭he fish here gleam with freshness - they never have that dull, mealy texture that is so prevalent elsewhere. 燛ach piece is savored separately, and there is time between servings so you can cleanse your palate with ginger, tea, beer or sake. 燛mbrace it for the experience it is, and expect to spend at least an hour and a half here. The sush itself is great. 燭he warm sushi rice is made with the perfect amount of rice vinegar and sugar, and the sushi is very very fresh. 燤y grandpa used to say that Toyo-san's rice was fantastic and not like "inaka" (farmer) rice which tends to be harder in texture and lack the delicate vinegar flavoring. 燭here is also a very good fish-to-rice ratio. �I crave the toro here. 燤y mom's favorite is the aji ("the fishier the better!" as she says), and my dad goes crazy for the uni - smooth like buttah. 燱e also really appreciate nice touches that other sushi bars don't bother with - shiso leaf on top of the salmon sushi and FRESH amaebi with fried heads, for example. 燭he sauces are also not too overpowering for the fish. 燭his place does things right. 燦o green tea bag - the ocha is brewed. 燞omemade miso soup - not out of a box. 燨shibori towels upon sitting down at the bar. 營t's kind of sad that I used to take these touches for granted. I also really like the smallish, intimate atmosphere at Sushi Gen. 營t seems strange to be in a tiny, forgotten J-Town strip mall. 燘ut once you're inside, you feel a thrill like you've discovered something special. 營 have watched Sushi Gen's popularity grow over the years and - although I feel like my hidden treasure is not so hidden anymore - I am pleased to see that it has graduated from a popular Downtown lunch spot to an in-demand dinner loaction. 營t's no-frills, but very cozy - and you also stand a significant chance of spotting a celebrity. 燭his is a fantastic place to impress a first date with your knowledge of "cool authentic holes-in-the-wall". 燡ust be prepared to wait a bit - last time I went, they still weren't taking reservations. 燭he atmosphere at the sushi bar is broadly collegial - everyone feels privileged to be there. 營 took my fiance there and in one trip, he changed from thinking "sushi is ok, but I don't see what the big deal is" to feeling like he'd never even had sushi until his experience at Sushi Gen. Finish up your experience with some mochi ice cream, invented by the local Hashimoto family at J-Town's Mikawaya bakery!

I went to Sushi Gen for the first time last Thursday and I can say that am 100% satisfied! It was completely packed with a half an hr wait when I arrived. As soon as I saw all the Japanese business men here somehow I felt it picked a pretty authentic spot. We opted to sit at the sushi bar and we thought the best way to go was omakase. Every piece of fish was extremely fresh. We started out with regular tuna and toro, yellowtail and yellowtail belly ( my fav), freshwater eel and giant clam, red snapper, albacore, uni ( sooooo sweet), scallops from Japan, and some tuna cut rolls with cucumber rolls with shiso leaves. I usually am not a fan of these plain rolls but I thought they were fantastic. There were a couple other pieces that I think I forgot. Along with that we had 2 bottles of sake. The bill came out to be $115 which I thought was a complete bargain. I typically pay around 80-$125 for omakase. The only negative thing I would say about the place is probably that their selection of fish is not as exotic as say Sushi Zo. But the price for sushi at Sushi Zo is is pretty much doubled. I was a little worried that the Chef may have went a little conservative on us because I was with a non Asian person. We really enjoyed this Sushi joint and will definitely return. Their sake list is AMAZING!

There's no doubt that the fish is fresh here. This is my third or fourth time here. It is never my first choice but my second or third. This past visit, we tried the kampachi collar which was very enjoyable. The uni was exceptional and the hamachi was very good. The prices are steeper but that's not the reason for my lack of enthusiasm for this restaurant. The food is solid but the experience feels like you've been thrown into a large herd or a big tour group... people are pushing you to move a certain direction whilst all you want to do is slow down a bit and enjoy the view. 燜or some reason I get that same feeling I do when sales people try to push me to buy (or expect me to spend a certain amount of money) while sitting at the sushi bar. Maybe it's because there is a pretty good ratio of sushi chefs to customers and you almost feel like they're impatient waiting for your order. The sushi chef's aren't unfriendly but they aren't as personable (although the guys helping the sushi chefs in the back are pretty jovial) as I would have liked. The restaurant overall has a hectic and business-like environment. Try going during the week when it's less busy and when there may be more personality.

I cannot deny that the sushi here is excellent. 燞owever, the people that work there are rude. 燬everal times I have gone there, they are trying to enforce their 4 sushi order minimum per person when I sit at the sushi bar. 燭hey have not charged me extra for not meeting the minimum but they are very rude and pushy in trying to enforce this and have threatened that next time they will charge me. 營 am sorry but after having miso soup and an appetizer, I can only do about two or three sushi orders. 營t's ridiculous. 營 cannot have a good experience at a restaurant when the sushi chief and waitress are berating me for not meeting their 4 sushi minimum order requirement. 燭here won't be any next time because I just don't go there anymore.

I have been looking to go here and see what the excitement was about. Plus I love sushi. Located in a strip mall in the Honda plaza. My first suggestion would be to try to come early. The parking lot gets full. I was fortunate enough to find a spot in the side of the mall. This was during lunch time. Place was packed. Well a little overflowing. I have no clue how long the wait was since I met my wife and friend and they were already sitting down. Browsed the menu and looked around on the other tables. I noticed 80% were ordering the sashimi platter. Also noticed that each person is required to order $10 minimum. Most of their stuff is traditional sushi. So you fancy rolls and the eek it's not cooked folks may no find this place to your liking. So me and the wife decided on one sashimi platter and one teriyaki salmon/sashimi combo to share. The food came and we enjoyed every piece and every slice. The teriyaki salmon was cooked just right. The sashimi melts in your mouth and is so fresh. I was surprised because between the sashimi, teriyaki, soup, and rice. I was full and satisfied. I have finally found a gem in Downtown. If your looking for real sushi this is your stop. I will be back over and over again.....

I've been here numerous times and what kills it is the service. I don't have to tell you about the amazing fish/food but the service an atmosphere makes me feel rushed. I go here just to eat but when I eat, I prefer to be in good company and Sushi Gen and that concept just doesn't go together. Because it's such a popular place- they whisk you in and whisk you out. You can't seem to just relax and enjoy whats in front of you because there's so much commotion and people in such a small space. But when I'm craving for some good fish, and my friend and I just want to eat, this is the spot.

after reading all the reviews on yelp, i was afraid that i would be waiting an hour to get a table!! but surprisingly, i dont think i waited longer than 15 mins! and that was a BIG PLUS for me the sushi bar is the place to be!! my chef was unbelievably funny and friendly... as everyone else on these reviews, yes..the sashimis are to die for! rarely do i order sushi dishes...but i believe it was the eel with avocado sushi roll..and it was sooo good. their rice inside the roll is very tasty and different from all the other regular sushi places. even though my birthday was well over two weeks, the sushi chefs still made me feel very special, brought out complimentary green tea mochi ice cream, and sang to me. sushi/sashimi + sake + dessert = HAPPY :) i will definitely be back!!! :)

Fish is amazingly fresh. I'm a big sushi junkie and I've been disappointed by so many restaurants until Sushi Gen. The prices are decent for the quality of the food and although the language barrier is annoying (i asked for wasabi on the side for all the sushi pieces because it's too spicy for my 13 year old sister), the food is still tasty enough to make me craving for more. You have to try the oysters! From the presentation to the actual dish, it is soooo yummy. Oysters, uni, toro, and halibut hit the spot for me!

I was eating at Hama sushi one night a couple of weeks ago and my friend and I were having random conversations with people at the sushi bar. 燬o this lady says her favorite sushi was at Sushi Gen (if that's seriously the case why wasn't she there cause it's just down the street from Hama sushi), having never eaten there I decided to try it last night. 營 started out with yellowtail and it was good, but my next two dishes lacked. 燭he sweet shrimp was fine but the rice underneath it was really dry and seemed off. 燗s for the squid, well it wasn't worth ordering. 燭he placed redeemed itself with some great Toro. 燭he uni, giant clam, and spanish mackerel were all good. 燗s for the price, well it wasn't astronomical but far from cheap. 營f I could I'd give this place 3.5 stars but being that Komasa and Hama have food that's comparable and a lot cheaper and both are nearby, 營 probably won't be back, so I'll round down and give Sushi-Gen 3 stars.

This place should really be 3 1/2 stars but since there isn't that function, i'm gonna have to round down. I ordered the $15 sashimi lunch plate which was very filling...couldn't finish it because there was so much fish and I like how they give you a lot of seaweed instead of the usual alfalfa sprouts or radish. The fish was very fresh and although tuna-heavy, still quite tasty. I wish they had included mackerel instead of some of the mounds of tuna but oh well! It seems like this place might be one of those sushi nazi places because there were a bunch of signs at the front including one for no cell phones and no substitutions. Sharing is also apparently frowned upon because there is a $10 minimum for each person so if you share, you will still pay at least $10. I would go back and try their sushi lunch special but will wait until I am particularly hungry for it cos by the looks of the sashimi plate, there will be a lot of pieces. One big negative was the additional charge of $1 for ponzu sauce!?!? Who ever heard of such a thing?! This is why I am rounding down and not up...There should be an option because I do not use the soy sauce as I find it too salty for sashimi and like the lighter taste of ponzu.

I really wanted to like this place. Getting close to 900 reviews with 4 1/2 stars rating lured me to give this place a try. Went for lunch on Monday, no wait. Had the Sashimi Deluxe (double the portion of sashimi lunch + 5 pieces of extremely chewy low grade toro), uni sushi, ankimo appetizer, albacore sashimi and two rolls (spicy tuna and california). Considering the price of the sashimi deluxe ($30), the portion was generous but I didn't find the fish of that great of a quality (as most reviewers mentioned). The fish has a lack of taste (since it was served straight from the freezer) and there is no bite to it. The uni sushi tasted just like the supermarket packaged uni but with a 1000% markup. Ankimo appetizer was served warm and thank goodness tasted decent. Albacore sashimi was a total rip-off ($21 for 6 tiny slices of supermarket quality frozen fish). Don't order it!! The rolls were okay. If you happen to pop by Little Tokyo and wanted a cheap sashimi lunch, this is the place for you (and I strongly believe the $15 sashimi lunch is why this place got such high ratings). However, if you want quality raw fish, please go elsewhere. I'm not happy spending over $100 for lunch here, should have go to my main man Sushi Masu instead!

I hate the wait. It really sucks sitting in the Honda Plaza for like an hour. But that really makes the sushi taste even sweeter. One of life's simplest pleasures is Sushi Gen's sushi bar. Their dining room isn't really worth the wait but the sushi bar is. Their toro is to die for. Their uni is to kill for. Their sweet shrimp is actually live, not dead and raw like other places. Even though one of the guys who takes down your name is like always cranky, I really think this place deserves five stars. And try to contain yourself at the Sushi Bar. It's not cheap and you can be shelling out triple digits for each person before you know it.

It's not like this placer needs another review, however everyone is right, prepare for a long wait. 燱e could not believe the wait at lunch when so many other places in the area were empty. 燱hen we were finally seated we both ordered the sashimi deluxe that came with miso soup, tofu, rice, and pickled veggies. 燦ow the sashimi came with yellowtail, tuna, kampachi, more tuna octupus, seaweed. 營t also had cooked items including salmon and tuna. 燨ur favorite probably was the spicy tuna since they used chilis mixed in the tuna. 營 didn't care for any of the cooked items, however all the cuts were big and melted in your mouth!

A billion reviews can't be wrong, so I gave this place a shot. The only minus I can give this place is the long wait. A 35 minute wait for lunch? This is kind of silly. Anyways I waited it out because I had already driven to get here. We were seated in a packed restaurant and decided to try the $15 Sashimi plate that everyone on yelp had recommended. It started out with tofu and hot miso soup. Excellente! Then came the sashimi plate, and I was blown away. I rarely come out of sushi place stuffed but I gotta say, this time by belly was full of yummy succulent raw fishies! Each corner of the plate had some different little fishy that had its own unique flavor. Had it not been for the long wait I would have given this place 5 starts, but you got to take these things into account. I guess if you come here early u can beat the rush.

Review # 478 for Sushi Gen...After a 3 day debacle of jury service that book-ended my 4th of July weekend, i was finally free (excused) and decided to celebrate by trying Sushi Gen for the first time. 營t was noon, a Monday, and the place was jammed. 燗s a first timer, the host explained that the lunch menu could not be accessed at the sushi bar (which was relatively empty), and that explained the long wait for a table. 燦ot having 30 extra minutes to kill, we opted for the sushi bar and stuffed our faces with lots of fresh, delicious sushi. 燞owever, having deviated from the lunch menu, we racked up $102 in charges(no, i don't weigh 200 pounds and yes, for those of us not producing $100MM films or making any substantial income, that's really expensive--i felt the bite). 燭he sushi is great, the service is automatic and chilly but effective, and the interior is quite comfortable. 營 think the place is great, but it's pricey, and frankly the sushi is just as good at Komasa and much, much cheaper. �Plus, the service at Komasa is friendlier. 燯nfortunately, Komasa is not open for lunch, so if you have a hankering for raw fish, and you're downtown, you won't be disappointed by Sushi Gen, but if you are there for lunch and don't have money busting out of your pockets, you might want to wait for table.

I eat a lot of sushi and have been to great ones, bad ones and everything in between. We went to this one on a recommendation of a friend, who raved about this place, but does not have a lot of experience with a lot with sushi. First, we had one issue with service. We went with a friend to this place to celebrate her birthday. Since my wife is pregnant we usually bring a bottle of water for her just to be on the safe side. I always order drink for myself anyhow and no restaurants (including all of the other sushi restaurants) have had any issues about it until Sushi Gen. When we were seated the waitress promptly said no outside drinks. We explained the situation, but she was very, very insistent. We agreed to buy water from her since she said that they sell bottled water. She brings the menu which has the water selection that they sell. We ask for one of those that has a familiar name (Evian), but she said they didn't have any. We asked for another one, Perrier (I think) and again they didn't have any. The only ones they actually had were a unidentifiable bottle of water from some small unknown country and sparkling water. 燬till they were not understanding about my pregnant wife's request. We go ahead and order the sushi dinners and a teriyaki dinner for my pregnant wife (who unfortunately cannot eat sushi for the time being). I would say that they were pretty ordinary among decent sushi restaurants. Nothing special about the quality nor the selection. It was okay. The quality, cut, and lack of anything special about the sushi definitely did not warrant the price. I've paid more for sushi many times, but it was way better and I've had this level of sushi, often for less money. So the issue would be that they don't offer value for the price that they charge. It's not that it's bad sushi, it's that you can get better for the same money or you can spend less for the same thing.

Went here last night for dinner and we had a reservation so they sat us within a few minutes (there were a bunch of people outside waiting so....make a reservation!). The service was good. We were sat quickly, orders taken quickly, food came out quickly, wait staff refilled our waters, and we didn't feel at all rushed even with the crowd waiting outside. The first thing they brought us was some cold pickled noodle and miso soup. 燱e ordered the clams as appetizer and tried some monkfish liver too. The clams came in a broth and was not that good. The monkfish liver was interesting and really had a soft melt in your mouth texture to it. For dinner we ordered the Sashimi dinner and the Sushi Deluxe Combination. It came with shrimp and vegetable tempura w/sauce (good), bowl or sushi rice, salmon skin salad (salmon skin not crunchy), muzuku with nagaimo, and miso soup. The toro was really good and melt in your mouth but everything else was okay. I think Sushi Gen is on the expensive side $$$ and not worth the wait. Although from what I've heard about the $15 lunch special that might be worth it. My boyfriend said that this place has changed and it's not as good as it used to be.

The sushi here is premium quality, really fresh. I ordered the Sushi Deluxe Combo to try out the basics - tuna, yellowtail, mackerel. Not the cheapest place out there, but considering the primo quality of the food it's an excellent value. A little bit of a wait (30 minutes) but it was worth it. I'll definitely come back to try out some of the more exotic selections on the menu.

Definitely 5 stars. 燛xcellent and fresh sushi/ sashimi. 營 usually get the sashimi deluxe platter for dinner. This place is really crowded so do plan on going there early and it also can get a little pricey but it's well worth it for the quality. 營 got the salmon collar for lunch before and it was great as well. 燳ou can't go wrong with Sushi Gen, it is the best sushi in Los Angeles!

i like their sashimi platter. 爄 used to eat here all the time. 燽ut now i am disappointed by their sashimi platter $35(?). 爄t gets less and less each time, and the portion is probably 1/3 of the size they used to give before. 爐he wait is long, too. the male host is cool and lets me go in, but the female host is a b&&& and keeps letting other people go in as if i didn't know. i spend about $80-100 each time i go, and eating only 2 people. 爐he fish is sometimes very good, but sometimes taste a few days old and fishy and not fresh. depending on the day you go, you may get a very good meal or a very yucky meal. their teriyaki beef and tempura are the best, but they charge about $24 for this. 爐hey do make very good tempura. 爄 haven't found a better place for tempura. if they can be a little more generous and consistent with their sashimi platter, then i would go back here. 爋r else i would just go elsewhere.

I went here for dinner and I must say its a different type of japanese food. I would say its more traditional. Few rolls and more main entrees and sashimi. The food was delicious and they gave you plenty. Service was superb. Food was fresh and the tea was yummy! I would go here again if I was in the neighborhood. I was not disappointed.

Fresh, fresh, fresh. 營 arrived early and joined a group of people waiting for the doors to open, and ordered the sashimi deluxe. 燭his plate had 5 large pieces of delectable toro, and a wide variety of other incredibly fresh fish. 燨ther restaurants would charge more for the toro alone than I paid for the whole plate. 燗 California roll that followed melted in my mouth. 燘est sashimi I have had anywhere.

Sure, there are hipper places in the Westside-Bev Hills area and Sushi Row in the Valley, but you can't beat this Little Tokyo institution if your thing is the fish going into your mouth and not who might be sitting three chairs down from you at the bar. 燜or someone like me, a sushi lover who is willing to spend a few bucks on a good meal provided the quality-to-cost ratio is in line, it doesn't get better than this in the city. Don't play games by sitting at a table and ordering all that other superfluous stuff you can get in any other Japanese restaurant. Do it right. Sit at the bar with a special someone (and one other couple, tops) and get the sushi--no hand rolls, no sashimi... come on, who are you kidding? Sure, you can order some oshinko, miso soup, and tempura for your date (and friends) if you must, but stay focused on what you've come for: a pure sushi experience... Luv the absence of pretense in this place. Luv the odd mix of Downtown business-types and lawyers thrown together with Silver Lake/Echo Park exiles, Japanese/Chinese hipsters, and multi-generation Nisei families in shorts and t-shirts. Definitely, my kind of place.

This is one of the most popular Sushi restaurants in downtown L.A. as can be seen by the number of people waiting in line before the doors open for lunch and the number of people waiting outside after they put their name on the waiting list. 燭he biggest reason for their popularity at lunch is the Sashimi special. 燭he Sashimi special includes mixture of fresh sashimi and cooked fish, rice, miso soup, tsukemono (pickled cabbage), seasoned tofu dish and pickled seaweed and cucumber. 燱hat makes this different from the other Sushi places is that they give you plenty of fresh sashimi at a reasonable price. 燭he sashimi special will fill you up for under $18 including tax and tip. 燱e typically go there about 15 minutes before it opens (it opens at 11:15 a.m.) and if you order the Sashimi special, you will be served within 10 to 15 minutes.

Super fresh sushi, highly recommend this place, but due to the long wait during peak hours, I'd rather come during off hours. 燞ad the best toro at this place, but really puts a dent in the wallet... time to save up for another visit later this year! 爋nly 2 bad things: long wait, parking is very limited...

I have to say this is the best sushi i have ever had in my entire life. We got there at 11:20, 20 minutes after opening. We were seated immediately at the sushi bar, unusually since it is usually very crowded at this time. Our chef greeted us with the usual Japanese announcement. 燱e first ordered a plate of yellow tail sushi. The fish tasted as if it was caught at the restaurant. Next we ordered some salmon sushi. This was the best two pieces of fish i had ever eaten in my life it was fatty and sweet and tender and oh so good. My father had also had the red snapper. he said it was the best sushi he had ever had in his life also. We finished of the meal with some tamago, egg omelet. They say you can tell how good a sushi restaurant is by the quality of the tamago and if that is true then Sushi Gen is the best sushi restaurant in America. The bill came out to $88 which since we had 5 orders each and there were three of us is actually a good price for the quality of the fish Overall my experience at Sushi Gen was the best I had ever had at any Sushi Restaurant

The sashimi special is ridiculously good in quantity and quality of sashimi. 燭he atmosphere is kinda crazy and claustrophobic with the noise and crowdedness. 營 think the owners are anti-kid because it's one of the least kid-friendly restaurants I've ever been to. 燭he food is top-notch, if you can handle the ambiance.

When the phrase "A taste of heaven" was created they must have been eating Sushi Gen's sushi. Try their albacore tuna sushi and spicy tuna roll and open your taste buds to perfection. 燡ust keep in mind heaven isn't cheap. Be prepared to pay for parking and a premium for the sushi. 燞ints: Arrive early, 11:30 AM for lunch and don't forget to get your parking ticket validated. 燱arning: Sushi Gen has the power to ruin enjoying sushi anywhere else.

Definitely one of the better sushi restaurants in Little Tokyo. The sashimi is usually of above average quality here and you sure pay extra for the quality. The downside is the wait - sometimes I wonder if I should go for a snack before I go there. The service could also use some improvement as well. I often feel the waitress/waiter could not wait for us to leave no matter how much food we order. I would have given this place 5 stars if it weren't for the wait and the service.

Given all the raves, we decided to try Sushi-Gen before seeing a show at the Ahmanson. 燗tmosphere and staff were pleasant, but let's cut to the chase: how can you praise a sushi place when the hand-rolls arrive wrapped in soggy seaweed? 營sn't it a requirement for passing Sushi 101 that the seaweed be crispy and crunchy? 燱ith the exception of the melt-in-your-mouth salmon sushi, our 9 other sushi choices were undistinguished - mostly rather bland and with a microscopic amount of crab in the California roll. 燗 disappointment.

one of the best sushis i've eaten in LA. up there with sushizo and matsuhisa. 爐he only negative thing i can say is that it was a bit pricey. 爉y bf and i sat at the sushi counter and shared 16 orders of sushi. every single fish was so very wonderful. 爓e ate whatever the chef recommended as well. 燼t the end of our meal the chef asks me, do you want some fruit as dessert? i say, sure, thinking that its going to be on the house, since we ordered and ate so much sushi. but no, they charged 7 dollars for some shitty ass cherrymongo fruit thing that tasted not so good. 燼nyway here's what i ordered that were all so deliciouso. 燾hu toro, hirame, mirugai, abalone, uni, unagi, snapper, hamachi, red clam, and some white fish he recommended. 爃e had a thick japanese accent so i could not understand. i'm gonna go back to my weekly sushi place, noshi sushi, only bc of value. 燽ut this place excellent fish and maybe a few times a year. so pricey!

If you are into traditional Japanese cuisine and amazingly fresh and tasty sushi, this is the ONLY place to go in LA...HANDS DOWN! 營'm half Japanese and was introduced to this little restaurant about 12 years ago by my uncle...who lives in Tokyo, Japan, but happens to travel quite a bit. 燞e told my mother and I that he had to introduce us to the best Japanese food restaurant in town. 燱e looked at him like he was nuts, but let him do his thing. 營've been going back ever since and have been an ambassador to this hidden gem to this day. 燭heir lunch special sashimi combo is out of this world and very moderately priced for the amount of food you receive and the quality of the food. 燚inner time is a bit more expensive, but worth every dime. 營 mean, I have seen sumo wrestlers eating here on more than one occasion! 燭he crowd sucks sometimes (actually more often than not), but it is certainly worth the wait. 燗lso, notice that the staff and people eating there are mostly Japanese? 燭rust me, this is my little secret that I love sharing with others. 燳ou will not be disappointed and if you are, you have no clue what true Japanese cuisine is.
