Smoking good. Expectations are high for ten dollar (with tax) sandwiches. Can't be just another sandwich. Because you can get those for half as much everywhere in the city. This is not just another sandwich. Slow-cooked chicken smothered in barbecue sauce. Topped with tomato and grilled onions. Ciabatta roll. Slowly cooked. Not slowly eaten. Incredible. Comes with a side of your choice. Like excellent baked beans.. High expectations were highly exceeded.

San Francisco is not known for its BBQ, so for SF, this is pretty good. I had the beef ribs, and it was very good. It was slow cooked so the meat was nice and soft. We had the potato salad and garlic fries as sides, and I'd say both were a little overpowering. Both had too many herbs and flavor. If you come here, I'd recommend trying other side dishes. I loved the glasses that water is served in! they're mason jars with handles.

I like the decor and beer selection. Plus one for carrying Shiner. The brisket is weird, it's very lean, kind of rubbery and dry but still edible. The same goes for the sausage for that matter. Other reviewers seem to love the brisket and I don't see why, especially at these prices. Just edible enough for me to eat it about once a year or so. The beans and potato salad are a-ok. I've been on the hunt for great barbecue in the bay area for years now. I'll let you know when I find it.

The smoked chicken here is excellent, a must try...however the brisket wasn't as good as the first time I tried it. The place is a tad bit pricy but you get a good helping of food to satisfy your hunger. I'd totally upgrade my review to four stars if they bring back the Carolina Sweet Hot BBQ Sauce!

Came in on a Tuesday night. ?Ordered a full rack of ribs with 2 sides. ?The food came out pretty quick with a small corn bread. My 2 sides were sweet potato fries and mac & cheese. The corn bread was small and alright. ?The mac and cheese was a small portion in and was ok too. ?The meat was dry and tough to chew on. ?The meat did not fall off the bone like I'm use to and it was not hot on the insides. ? The only plus side to this place is the cheap selection of beers that's about it.

Roadside continues an uncanny trend of underwhelming BBQ restaurants pockmarking the city of San Francisco. You wouldn't know it by looking from the outside, however. Most of these places have a healthy stream of clientele and even a few of them find themselves listed in each year's Zagat guide. I think that's all a relative effect, though. We don't have excellent BBQ, so we settle with what's available. It's not such a travesty, but it's a little painful knowing that there's better to be found elsewhere. Roadside's prices are not too shabby to tell the truth. $9 will get you a pretty nice-sized pulled pork sandwich with the inclusion of one of their sides, all made from scratch. The fries were pretty good, I like it when they leave the skins on. There's one thing I hate though, and that's decorating to meet your cuisine. Just because you're an Italian restaurant doesn't mean you should have a map of italy next to a figurine of the leaning tower of Piza. Just because Roadside is a BBQ restaurant doesn't mean it has to be decked out in rustic accoutrements and old nostalgic American memorabilia. The service is nice here, they accept cards and have a varied enough menu to keep most people happy. It's not the best, but it's not the worst either. It's BBQ, San Francisco-style.

so couple of nights ago we went and tried out Roadside BBQ....we called in the "bbq for two"..the beef ribs and chicken a bit on the dry side, the baby back ribs were excellent ..we liked the smoked flavor for sure and the caramelized bbq sauce on the beef made up for just a bit of dryness. the chicken how ever was dry. Soooooo, we had a group of friends over just this past saturday. We ordered "bbq for 10''...they hit it out of the ball park ! it was fantastic ...the chicken was moist, the ribs fell off the bone,the brisket was great...the q sauces were very tangy ...the hot sauce hot ....we'll be going back for sure. Now.. the parking sucks here on Geary, so deal with it...we did the "you wait here,I'll get the food", routine. The dude behind the counter (looks like the Penn and Teller dude) very cool and helpful. Now... their online menue is the most annoying website ever Try turning the Pig Off ! Great place,great food, good value for price.

BBQ is a must during Memorial Day Weekend and Roadside BBQ gave us our much-needed BBQ fix. I knew I wanted some pulled pork, so I decided on the Memphis pulled pork sandwich ($8.95) with a side of potato salad. The boyfriend ordered the baby back ribs ($11.95 for 3-4 pieces) with sides of potato salad and coleslaw. The pulled pork sandwich was ridiculously delicious and juicy. Definitely one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've had and definitely in competition for first place with the pulled pork sandwich I had at Baby Blues BBQ in Bernal Heights (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…). I didn't try the baby back ribs, but my boyfriend loved them, especially since Roadside BBQ uses a dry rub, which is what he prefers. They have a variety of sides and I thought the potato salad was great and I loved that they used red potatoes. My boyfriend didn't really care for the coleslaw though. We also had a slice of the pecan pie a la mode and it was amazing! The pecan pie wasn't too sweet and the crust was perfectly crumbly. You have the choice of a slice or a sliver of pie but, if you are sharing, go for the slice (it's perfect for two!) Overall, I really enjoyed Roadside BBQ - service was quick and the BBQ was awesome! Definitely stop-in if you are in the mood for some BBQ.

Best beef brisket in San Francisco. A pound of beef brisket and a side of sweet potato fries -- my go-to "I'm-too-lazy to-cook-bachelor-for-life meal." The beef brisket is so good here, it's worth being redundant. Best beef brisket in San Francisco.

The search for the ultimate BBQ continues. ?Unfortunately Roadside was not very good. ? The Good News: ?The people and the service were very good. The Bad News: ?The portions are very small. ?The ribs and brisket was very dry, and the greens were so badly seasoned that I could not finish them. ?Skip this place and make the extra effort to go to Pacifica for Gorilla BBQ

There are very few good things about Texas. These include LBJ and solid good food. I do not expect good BBQ in San Francisco unless someone has a giant smoker in his backyard. With my expectations in check, I walked in here and ordered a pork sandwich and sweet potato fries and a coke. It wasn't bad, but the fries were either burnt or not fully cooked! I also thought the pork could be a bit juicier. Overall though the food had a good flavor and was not expensive. If I come back here I may dare to try the ribs and hope not to be disappointed. Luckily though they do have Shiner to wash it all down. Last thing: service - very good. The guy behind the counter is awesome.

I had the salad with texas briskett and it was just okay. I also ordered the corn bread muffins on the side and they were just okay too. Honestly, the brisket in the salad was not cut well, there were many pieces that had fat on them and I just do not enjoy that. I don't think I would order that salad again... it just was "BLAH" and the pieces of brisket weren't good... I wish I could write a good review for this place, but it was just OK. Perhaps the sandwiches and actual entrees are good, but if you want some over the top amazing bbq salad, you will not find it here. Perhaps they should consider putting some thin fried onions on their and making a cool bbq dressing (rather than just having ranch as an option). The slices of vegetables in the salad were stringy slices and I'm not a big fan of that.

Tired of the same ol' Asian food in your mouth? Roadside BBQ might be able to fix that. It's been over a year since my last visit to Roadside BBQ and with memories of savory pork meats and tantalizing hot sauces, a group of friends and I decided to come in for some seconds. Last time, my girlfriend and I shared the "Q" (4 meats + 3 sides) but since we had our buddies along, we didn't feel like piggin' out (get it? haha.. okay nevermind). The "Big Guy" ($19.95) is the "Q's" little brother, consisting of your choice of 3 meats + 2 side platter, which seemed a tad more fitting when grubbing in from of our friends. Our choices: http://www.yelp.com/user… Memphis Pulled Pork - There were three long but thin slices of pulled pork, strikingly resembling ham that you could purchase at Costco, topped with House BBQ sauce. The pulled pork itself did "pull" apart, but was relatively dry.. Baby Back Ribs - The ribs were nicely charred and were bomb with the BBQ sauce but the actual meat was to a minimum.. Hot Link Sausages - The sausages did not fail; they were indeed spicy hot and of good proportion (a total of 2). oh, and FYI, don't mix the Habanero Tabasco sauce with these bad boys! Mac "n Cheese - A simple classic: very creamy, cheesy, and a tad lumpy -- just how I like it. Just wished they'd serve it by scoops rather than in a puny creme brulee cup cause I wanted moreee! Garlic Fries - Your standard garlic fries which amplified the Habanero Tabasco flavored by three-folds! Wooo! Corn Bread Muffin - (complimentary) Blah.. the muffin was cold. Maybe the icy San Francisco wind got to em' first or maybe they were just sitting out all day.. Did our return bring about the wrath of the aPORKalypse to our bellies? Sadly, no. The portions had truly diminished since last year.. We couldn't even finish the "Q" last time we were here and The "Big Guy" left me hungering for moreee! Though a great alternative from the countless sushi, Chinese, ramen, and whatnot eats, I just expected more. & yeah, that Habanero Tabasco is still whooping my ass..

Whats with all the 3 stars!! I like this place. The food is good. Ive tried every sandwhich and each one taste great. The sides are awesome. I like the beans, coleslaw, fries. the garlic fries are yummy too. But for me what makes this a 4 star is good BBQ sauce. I love the hot bbq and their special mustard. !!! BAM!! BAM !!!

Surprisingly good and affordable basic BBQ for this poorly trafficked spot near the Goldman Center for the Elderly. ?Not that you see many seniors there; definitely not on their diet. As BBQ, it's your basic California BBQ mish-mash, a little Texas, a little Tennessee, a little vegetarian. ?However, everything they make is well-executed with quality ingredients. ?So while it might not be an authentic BBQ mecca like Mephis Minnie's, Roadside makes a very enjoyable (and extremely filling) lunch. The SFPD eats there now, too, which is a vote in favor if I ever saw one. They also have a small selection of non-meat options: a couple salmon things, and even some vegetarian choices. The staff is exceedingly nice and friendly, and they keep the place really clean. ?Adjustments and substitutions are always possible. Recommended if you're in the neighborhood.

We used Roadside BBQ to supplement the grilled food we prepared for a large party. ?Roadside performed well and we were very pleased with the results. ?The food quality and taste for very good. ?We purchased chicken, brisket and pulled pork and all were given high marks by us and our guests. ?The food was ready when requested and very well packed in to go trays and the kitchen staff assisted in carrying it out to my vehicle without even being requested to do so. ?We were also given good instructions on how to keep the food at serving temperature for the 7 hours we needed before our guests arrived. ?The only negative we found was the slider rolls we purchased. ?These were nothing special and were, in fact, somewhat tough despite being quite fresh. ?We would used Roadside again when the occasion arises and recommend you consider them as well.

If Spartacus could have a meal before a fight it would be the Big Guy Platter. I have had the privilege of eating here twice and it has been a memorable experience each time. Its fairly difficult to find good bbq in the bay area but this place is definitely one of my favorite places. The pulled pork is to die for. As soon as i took a bite i looked to my friend...paused... and said "that is what pulled pork is supposed to taste like" juicy, tender, robust flavor. simply delightful. The brisket is good but not great. It was a tad bit dry the times i went. The hot links were not very hot but that is to my standards. Good flavor but they have a taste similar to a breakfast sausage. SIMILAR...not exact. More like a hint of breakfast sausage flavor. Good but I wouldn't recommend it. The baked beans were quite tasty and the garlic fries....well how could you go wrong. There are a variety of sauces to satisfy every pallet and i am sincerely impressed. I thoroughly enjoy Kinder's bbq and their sauces, but this places gives Kinder's a run for their money sauce wise. The staff is very friendly and quite helpful when trying to sort through the menu and make a decision. Parking sucks but i cant downgrade these guys for that. Well worth the trip and the money. I have told me friends and plan on sending more. I will be visiting again and hope to try the chicken this time.

I'm not a BBQ connoisseur. ?This place was deliciously satisfying, but there were some things that were just a tad off. Came here after a round of frisbee golf at the park with 5 guys. ?We got the combo that serves 4-6. ?full order of ribs. full order of brisket, greens, sweet potato fries, mac and cheese, corn muffin, and beans. on top of that we got ?1/2 order of pulled pork. ?we ate. and we ordered another full order of ribs, 1/2 order of brisket, coleslaw and more beans. then we finished it off with banana cream pie. OK. So obviously we ate like it was no one's business and it was definitely delicious enough for seconds. So why the 3 stars and the harsh ratings? - the brisket was just okay, nothing stellar like at memphis minnies - ALL of the sauces were gross and I LOVE sauces. All of the sauces at memphis minnies and gorilla bbq are great but the ones here were sooo weird - the strawberry sweet tea was a horrendous mess - sweet potato fries were overcooked Now for the good - the ribs- yum Mac and cheese, corn muffin, greens, beans, pie- all good but forgettable. I want to give this place 4 stars, but it's just not quite there yet. I also want to note that the people who work here are tremendously pleasant.

Our favorite rib joint in San francisco. It is spendy but we've never walked, waddled or been rolled out the door anything less than gourged into an earlier grave by cholestorol and delicious food,!! I really want to give this place five stars. We go here nearly every trip into the city. The service here is wonderful. They're eager to replace anything that you do not like which happens very seldom. Here's my insight on their menu: brisket? AMEN. Pork ribs are better than their beef ribs. The pulled pork has a vinegar sauce and is pretty good. All of the sides are AMAZING-corn on the cob is grilled and one of my favorites and the sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had. I usually get the three item combo with two sides which is a perfect pig out size for me. Brisket always, baby back pork ribs usually and maybe the beef ribs.

While ?Roadside falls a little short in the bbq rib dept, I'm a fan of the sandos. 1. ?Sandwiches - Pulled pork (messy goodness), grilled chicken on a roll (note: there's horseradish in it), and the spicy cheesesteak sandwich (much like a french dip with kick). 2. ?Potato salad is solid. ?Red potato, onion, & celery is cooked al dente so it gives you a good crunch. ? 3. ?Clean establishment. ?Ample seating for a Geary Street restaurant. ? 4. ?Location makes it easy to find, however parking is Inner Richmond street parking (ugh.) ?If you come at lunch on a weekday there is ample street parking. ?Bring your quarters and/or meter card. Feel is wood panels, benches, and refillable glass mason jars for cups. ? 5. ?Staff- Everytime I come the young, burly guy at the register (who I presume is one of the owners) is full of energy and makes the ordering process quite enjoyable. ? I'm a repeat Roadside roadie.

The grilled vegetables are delicious! The mix of broccoli, carrots, corn and more is fresh and crunchy with a perfect amount of seasoning. This is my attempt to eat a little bit more healthy. I can go for a set meal of 1/4 rack of ribs and 2 sides of vegetables. I've tried the mac and cheese and sweet potato fries which were both okay. They gave me a generous amount of fries to go with a meal. For meats, the ribs have a nice flavorful rub which goes nicely with their hot barbecue sauce. The pulled pork was okay. I'd rather stick with the ribs or try something else next time.

Five stars. Five stars. Five stars. Why should you trust me? Because I spent my first twenty-five years on this planet eating BBQ in Mississippi, that's why. Roadside takes classic Southern BBQ and makes it even more delicious without messing with the magic. The spices in the slow-cooked pulled pork are perfect. The grilled veggies are sublime. The buttered cornbread muffins stopped me and my friend from Tennessee mid-sentence. THEY HAVE SWEET TEA. Don't be discouraged by this nonsense about ambiance and such. Roadside BBQ is perfectly pleasant, and downright luxurious considering the best BBQ in the US is usually served in a dilapidated shack or from the deli counter of an Exxon. Plus, the crew here is always so friendly and welcoming. I wouldn't recommend taking an important client here to close a major deal or anything, but you better believe I'm calling the nice people at Roadside to cater my SEC game-watching parties. And no Southern belle worth her weight in grits would serve sub-par BBQ during an Ole Miss game, because ten years later, they will still talk about you behind your back for the offense. That is true.

Came here today after seeing it on the Top Eats in Sf list. As recommended, my bf and i shared the Memphis Pulled Pork Sandwich along with a side of garlic fries. (i wasn't very hungry) For someone not being a big fan of meat & burgers, I actually took more than one bite out of my bf's sandwich. i enjoyed the spicy, tangy flavored added into the bbq sauce = their famous Roadside BBQ sauce. Maybe its because we had such a high expectation going into this place.. that it wasnt as great as we wished it would be. the Pulled Pork lacked a smokey taste to it. As for the Garlic Fries, it was delicious! yummmmmieee i would give this place a 3/5 BUT the services was very warming so +1 for that :)

I love my brother for introducing me to this place after climbing at PG. They have the best beer distributors around so they get the largest selection of Shiner Bock I've seen outside of Austin. Including the Holiday edition (which is perhaps the best beer I've had in the last 6 months). The prices are decent, but of course we are in SF so you take that into consideration. the portions are solid. and there's a hug pot of sweet tea and a train whistle by the back kitchen entrance which is fun to mess around with. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED: they run out of the pulled pork and baby back ribs if you get there too late, but you can always call ahead. loved the sweet potato fries and the mac and cheese sides. the red beans are really good too. ?As for the BBQ sauces....good luck...I still can't pick a favorite, and it's really fun to combine them. Definitely my favorite BBQ place within the 49 square miles that is San Francisco.

Roadside BBQ is my dirty little secret. Often, when I've been too lazy to buy groceries, and my pantry is empty - I put on some sweatpants, hat, and sunglasses and waltz my way over here 007-style as it's on my block. And often it will be the 3rd time of the week I eat there. Why? Coz it's so goo'. My mother is from the south, so I know good BBQ. As stated in earlier reviews, there is a huge lack of good ole' southern food in the Bay Area, and that's why I adore this place. The service is brisk and super friendly, especially the owner/manager Clemon. I like the ambiance too - it feels like a place you'd find down South. Best of all obviously is the food. I LOVE their sauces, particularly "Sweet Heat". I tend to order the meaty potato, or the pulled pork sandwich. I haven't had the ribs yet, but I'll give it a try. The sides are to die for; I love the coleslaw, Mac n' Cheese, and Grilled vegetables. My only gripe is that maybe they could be a tad bit more generous with the side portions. Seriously though, if you're looking for comfort food or a hangover cure, come here. It's a little slice of heaven, and you'll leave feeling festively bloated.

I tried the mini sampler and will come back for more. The ribs, while not the best I have ever tasted, is good enough for a San Francisco BBQ place. ?I ordered a side of fries for my 3 year old, but all she wanted was the ribs. ?You know the place is good when your kid doesn't even want the fries. ? I also really digged the service, as the staff was always friendly. ?The thick wooden tables and the paper towels are just perfect for a BBQ joint. ?I will definitely be back for more. ?Thumbs up!

I walked in here for the first time on a Monday around 11am with a friend of mine to have some lunch. The menu has a large variety of choices that are reasonably priced. I ordered the ribs, with cole slaw and cornbread. I was not disappointed! I chose the hot and spicy barbecue sauce from the condiments bar. The cole slaw had amazing flavor and the meat fell off the rib. The corn bread was moist and fresh. The sauce was very HOT and SPICY! They get 5 stars for a lunch spot because: great tasting food, fast, friendly service, fair prices in a very comfortable and clean establishment. I recommend you try this spot when you're in the Richmond district!

The cashier was super friendly as soon as we walked in. I have to say he was pretty entertaining. I got the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with a side of mac & cheese. That was one large ?perfectly tender and moist sandwich. I was only able to eat half of it since it was so large, but now that I'm writing and thinking about it, I want another one. ? I will definitely return!

The sauce and service was great. They had a few choice and all of them were very good. The BBQ itself was mediocre. Not the worse I've had, and not the best. The price and portions, not impressive at all. I paid nearly $15 for a meal an drink and didn't get very full. If the meal was under $10, ?I would say this place was worth it.

My wife calls me from her school in the Richmond district. K: ?We're ordering in BBQ for lunch. Want some? A: ?Shoot yeah, I love BBQ! Get me some kalbi. K: ?No, not that kind of BBQ... like SOUL food! A: ?Yeah, SEOUL food! My favorite. Hook me up with some extra gat tu gi, too. K: ?They don't have gat tu gi! No kalbi! It's BBQ, like in the South! Y'know? Ribs and stuff. A: ?Oh. Shoot yeah, I love BBQ! K: ?Sheesh! So what do you want? Ribs? Brisket? Pulled pork? A: ?Mmmm...that's what I want. K: ?Which one? They have ribs, brisket and pork. A: ?Yeah, that sounds great! K: ?You want ALL THREE?! A: ?Have we met? She delivered a fine plate of all three with a big bowl of sauce on the side, just the way I like it. It's personal preference, I know, but I hate having the flavors of the smoke, meat, and rub obscured by sauce unconditionally. I prefer 'some assembly required.' ?All three were delicious, with the extra meaty ribs taking top honors for me. The cole slaw was chunky, and the sweet potato fries the perfect compliment. The best part? They are on par with other 'cues that charge a few bucks more. Thank you, Roadside, for expanding BBQ options in the Richmond. You are so welcome.

Summer. How I wish it would never end. I equate summer to fro-yo, cute little dresses, flip flops, water balloon fights, picnics, & most especially BBQ!!! ?Everyone interprets it differently. However, who in their right mind says no to bbq?? Not me. Ever! Craving bbq, but not in the mood to marinate and grill? Well, Roadside BBQ is the answer. SF's 7x7 list promotes their pulled pork sandwich as a must try. And it truly is. It's a husky boy portion, full of tender & lean roasted memphis pulled pork oozing out of a fresh ciabatta bread. The texas beef brisket we ordered was served in nicely portioned slices. Being slowly roasted for up to 17 hours, no wonder the meat is so succulent & tender. Mmm bbq deliciousness at its best! Both entrees come w/ side options such as potato salad, fries (original, sweet potato, or garlic), salad, mac & cheese, or vegetables. Normally, I opt for sweet potato fries w/ aioli. This time, I went w/ their nice garlicky fries mmmm. Cool condiments such as different types of bbq sauce & sliced onions and pickles are available. I loved the cute, miniature corn muffin that comes with your meal. Yummy & satisfying! Lastly, the service was awesome! Friendly, friendly, friendly was the person behind the counter. He was super sweet to my kids. :) Bottom line: summer doesn't have to end, especially not at Roadside BBQ. Friendly service and great eats. I can't wait to come back & pull that horn in the back.

I love a good barbecue. ? I was instantly happy the minute My Lady mentioned a desire to try the Roadside BBQ. ?I'd been looking at it on many trips toward Clement Street the past year, and I was eager to give it the test. ? The whole restaurant was clean, and they proudly displayed their 98% score in the window. ?I was amused to find I could scoot a chair around on the waxed flagstone floor, and after another group left we moved into a booth at the window. ? We chose two combination plates, as this was the time-honored first plate for any barbecue. ?Hers had beef ribs and pulled pork, with Roadside veggies and potato salad. ?They had a bottle of unsweetened tea to satisfy her as well. ?I ordered the baby back ribs and BBQ chicken, with thin-cut french fries and slaw, along with a diet Coke. ?The whole order for both of us was $36.10 + tip. ? And tip we did, for despite the self service and the open condiment and silverware counter, the staff made sure our table was clean, our drinks were full, and our plates were cleared when we were done. ? My Lady liked the potato salad and the pulled pork best. ?I liked the baby back ribs best. ?They had that fall-off-the-bone slow-cooked melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. ?The fries were covered with salt, which I enjoyed, and the cole slaw used vinegar instead of a more traditional mayonnaise. ?They had both Texas and Thai style BBQ sauces. ?My Lady also expressed enthusiasm for the corn muffins. ?The chicken was unimpressive, and the beef ribs were dry, so when we go back I'll probably order baby back ribs. ? There's a reason why pork is the festival food of the classical world.

[M]ona: 3.5 Stars [W]ayne: 3 Stars Average: 3.25 Stars + Accepts Credit Cards + Lots of Condiments + Lots of Side Dishes + Clean +/- Good House BBQ - Small Portions [W] So I've been craving for some BBQ and here's where we ended up. It kind of worked out because we were going to the De Young Museum and it was pretty close by. The only thing is that the food wasn't really hitting the spot. Today we ordered The "Big Guy" that included 3 meat choices http://www.yelp.com/biz_… with 2 sides http://www.yelp.com/biz_… for around $18.95. The meat choices that we got was the beef brisket, pulled pork, and the chicken sausages. For the sides we had the sweet potato fries and the mac & cheese. They also add a little corn bread on the side. Honestly out of all that food we had, I only liked the pulled pork and the sweet potato fries. This place also have condiments on the side i.e. their house bbq sauce, honey, ketchup, their "hot" bbq sauce, and some asian ginger bbq sauce. I thought their house sauce wasn't strong enough for a BBQ joint even thought Mona claims it was the best BBQ sauce she ever had. When you make BBQ, I think everything should have a good kick with the right style and this place was lacking in all areas. Their house bbq sauce in my opinion was very mild and seems like something I could've bought at Safeway. The mac & cheese was EXTREMELY dry. The beef brisket felt like it was over cooked because when you chewed it, everything just fell apart not in a good way. When I eat beef, I wanted it to be a little on the chewy/juicy side, but again it just fell apart. The sausage felt undercooked as well. When I think about hot links and sausages, I can just imagine the tear of the skin but it really didn't have that texture. The sausage still felt like it was mushy. Kind of like when you ask for fish paste at the supermarket. I think I'll try to find another BBQ spot before I try this again. I believe that there is a big area of improvement for their food.

Different attractions have different radii of influence. ?Por ejemplo, there may be an undertaking that's fabulous so long as you're no further than a certain distance away. ?Like, the bodega downstairs is amazing because it's downstairs. ?I'd give it five stars for folks that live in my building. ?Is it worth a trip from SF? ?Not so much. ?Similarly, K-Paul's has from my perspective a planetary sphere of worthiness. ?If you live on this planet, I'd recommend travel by whatever means necessary to taste Paul Prudhomme's wonderful creation. ?Get it? Roadside has a 20 block radius of attraction for me. ?If I'm within that circle and I'm hungry for bbq, this is where I go. ?Mind, I'm a fan of bbq sammiches and loose meat plates. ?I don't fancy ribs, here or anywhere else. ?I don't hate them, I just love bbq so much that I don't want to work to get it into my face. ?A shortcoming, I know, but me saying it here should be proof of how much you can trust me. ?I'll never tell you tales. ?So I've seen the ribs here and the people enjoying them, but this review is about my experience with the other stuff on the menu. Also this - bbq is in my genes (and sometimes on my jeans). ?My Mom as her first job breaking child labor laws hustled the smoky goodness at the Red Pig Barbeque in Selinsgrove. ?The spot now taken by a chain drugstore, this is where my grandparents plied their craft those many moons ago. ?Of strong simple straightforward stock, me. The meat at Roadside is succulent. ?The variety of sides is acceptable and fairly standard (you don't need to be fancy to please me), their quality and tastyness always exceptional. ?They have pickles and peppers on the sidebar and a selection of sauces to nicely accompany whatever you might have requested. ?The space is cozy, maybe room for 30 comfortably. ?The staff clearly are serious about what they do (which, btw, is an absolute bbq requirement for me). So yes, more bbq, please.

Alas, the search for great barbecue in SF continues. It just ain't here. It isn't bad, but compared to the likes of the Salt Lick outside of Austin or Virgil's in New York, Roadside is just not great enough to call a destination. It is great for big families too busy watching their kids run riot to notice what they're eating. It was busy the evening we came by to try their stuff, but I have to hand it to the crew who was nothing but cordial in spite of the hectic circumstances. We managed to grab a table but had to wait for chairs as the youth nearby were hard-pressed to part with their empty chairs since it meant putting their jackets on their own seat backs. Both Jamie W. and I went for the $15.95 Two Way Combo plates. His was made up of the Texas Beef Brisket and Beef Ribs, while the same brisket and the Memphis Pulled Pork were on my plate (see photos). We both thought the portions were on the skimpy side and realized too late that the "Big Guy" variation was probably the way to go. The brisket was the smart choice since it was indeed tender after 17 hours in the smoker. The pork was less than succulent from my perspective, while the ribs were bordering on the meh side. For our sides, we both went for the mac n' cheese, which was decent. Jamie had the grilled corn on the cob, while I had the roadside veggies to sooth my conscience. They weren't bad. Diet cokes were easily refillable, a nice plus. So is the nice counter guy. FOOD - 3 stars...passable Q AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...family-friendly and hectic SERVICE - 4 stars...really friendly TOTAL - 3 stars...not roadkill but not road-rific either

Today's lunch time road trip led me to BBQ. This place offered several BBQ plates and sandwiches on the menu along with several side dishes. I ordered to go, the 1/4 rack of Pork Ribs with Baked Beans and Garlic Fries for the sides. Homemade Corn Muffin included. Counter service was excellent! Ready to eat, I started with the Garlic Fries. Flavor was nice, but the fries were hard and chalky a real downer. Baked Beans were so-so, ?the Corn Muffin tiny but tasty. Now onto the ribs. It was good! Smoky, flavorful and the texture just right. I packed two of ?their BBQ sauces - Roadside Red mild BBQ sauce and the Sweet Heat hot red BBQ sauce. I dipped into both and it added a few notches to the palate. The ribs definitely made up for the difference...

I walked out with smoky fingers. And smoky lips. And smoky lower cheeks. And smoky chin. I can smell the smoky flavor of the pulled pork before I had even taken a bite of the sandwich. Mounts of moist pulled pork with a slaw and just a tad of barbecue sauce sit in between 2 slightly toasted buns. I was racing the juice from the meat and trying to finish the sandwich before my bread got really soggy. Unsuccessful. Juice just ran all over my hands like a faucet. The short ribs and the brisket were quite good. Maybe just a bit dry. The short ribs gave me smoky smelling cheeks. I guess I was pretty messy with it. The entire time I just wanted to go wash my face with soap. Garlic fries, potato salad, corn on a cob, and corn bread muffin were surprisingly decent, especially the charred corn. ? A mountain of paper towel sat on my right when I was finished. Amateur? Maybe. Or I was just wiping my mouth and hands after every single bite.

My cousin and his friends were visiting from Paris this past weekend and they wanted some BAR-BEEE-QUE. $22.95 for choice of 4 Meats, 2 Sides, and 2 Cornbreads. ?Now that's a great deal! ?SO and I got the BBQ Ribs (5 pieces), Beef brisket (5 slices), Pulled Pork (big pile), and BBQ Chicken (2 pieces). ?WHOA BABY -- that was a lotta food. ?We couldn't finish and SO is known to be a vacuum. ?The mac n cheese was good and I liked the potato salad prepared with dill. ? Self-serve sauce bar. ?The spicy one had a nice kick to it. ?Mild was sweet and tangy. ?Three mustard sauce was tasty too. ?Loved dipping my ribs and dunking my pulled pork.

Decent Q and slow service with the feel of a fast food ?chain. The brisket was good, the fries were great, the mac and cheese was decent. ?The sauces were nothing special. ?I couldn't taste the difference between the regular red sauce and the spicy red sauce, but the Asian sauce was my unexpected favorite.

Admission #1: ? ? The best BBQ I've ever had came from a small shack on the side of the road near Lake Travis, outside of Austin TX. Behind the shack was a perpetual plume of sweet smoke, and the meat that came out of the smokehouse was simply remarkable. Admission #2: ? ? I often miss Texas. Admission #3: ? ?The idea of a decent BBQ joint within 2 blocks of my front door is a very very dangerous thing. Roadside BBQ has a pig wearing sunglasses on the marquee. I love a pig with shades. They have tacky decor and plate glass windows. Still, to offset the silliness, they have Shiner Bock in the beer cooler. But it's all about the meat, my friends, and so of meat I shall now write. Mickey and the man went for a bite, after the man had previewed a quick quarter slab of ribs to go the other night. Here are the results: The Ribs: pork ribs slow smoked, not too dry, pretty tender, good smoke flavor. These aren't earth shattering ribs, but they are the best facsimile within reach. Achieving "good" with ribs is a pretty damn fine ?thing in my book. The Brisket: somewhat disappointing. While the flavor of the meat was good, and it was truly 13-hours in the smoke tender, it was overly fatty, which both masked the flavors, and concealed the tenderness. Still, not bad, particularly with the mustard slather provided by the cupful at the condiment counter. The Pulled Pork: as good if not better than the ribs. Tender, but not too. Sweet and smoky, but not overwhelmingly. Rich and flavored and lean. A dash of the hot vinegar on this, and I am a happy boy. No BBQ is complete without sides: ours have been the coleslaw (simple, and therefore delightful), the mac & cheese (meh. Typical of BBQ sides in that it didn't rise to the occasion.), and the sweet potato fries (excellent). The sauces range from pretty good (the mustard & the vinegar) to merely pedestrian (the standard & "hot" BBQ red sauces) to inappropriate (the "Asian" ginger plum sauce). But none of this detracts from the fact that a decent southern BBQ has just opened in the Inner Richmond, and is turning out smokin' smoked meats. Oh, and the bonus: remarkably good pecan pie is available for dessert. The crust, though a bit on the salty side, is wonderfully done, and the pecan filling is almost---almost---as good as my father's. And he makes the best pecan pie around. If you are seeking BBQ, come here. Or if you don't want to venture to the Haight, or just don't love Memphis Minnie's, I recommend Roadside as the end stop in your search for another BBQ joint here in SF. It isn't Texas, but for 2nd Ave. it's about as good as it gets.

Came here this past weekend because we wanted something different and didn't want Asian food. You walk in and I ordered the BBQ chicken plate and the sweet tea. The guy at the cashier was very energetic and friendly..nice! I went to get my sweet tea, but it wasn't as sweet as I like it. There was alittle sweetness, but I had better at McDonald's and other BBQ joint. The food came out pretty quick and it was just okay. It came out warm, but wished it was alittle warm or at least hot. There was nothing special about the food,, except if you choose the cob of corn on the side, it was the whole corn, not half...YAY! It was about $13 for the meal which included the tea, which was alittle pricey for okay food. Don't think I'll be back...=(

Not much of a fan for BBQ flavored anything. BUT. I only had 45 minutes for lunch, my colleagues were not craving for asian food (that takes out 90% of the restaurants on Geary) and we needed to eat at a place that is walking distance. BBQ Roadside. Two blocks away from Kaiser. I felt my stomach turning down already as we were walked in. Ordered the Pulled Pork platter as I have seen it in the 7x7 100 places to eat in SF before you die and chose the Mac n' Cheese and garlic fries for my sides. Pulled Pork was actually not bad, the Mac n Cheese however was a bit rich for me. The garlic fries was my favorite on the plate! If I didn't have to go back to work, I would have picked off all the garlic chunks and shove them down my mouth!

Let me start off by telling you all that I don't like BBQ sauce. ?I especially don't like ribs. That being said, until this point in my life, I had 1 BBQ sauce exception: the Western Bacon Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr. ?That stuff is somethin' else - burger, onion ring, cheesy goodness. ?It tastes sooo good with that sauce! ?It's been my one and only exception for a very long time. As of 2pm today, I now officially have two exceptions to my BBQ sauce rule. ?Exception #2: ?the Beef Brisket sandwich at Roadside BBQ. ?They give you greasy fatty brisket with sauce and cabbage on a roll. ?It is tasty! ? I got it with the sweet potato fries. ?Very good too. ?However, they were a little on the soggy side, so if you like yours crispy, you might not want to order em. Another thing to keep in mind, I ate over 2 hours ago and I smell like a BBQ. ?Not super sexy, but hey, it's the middle of the day so whateva.

Date & Time: last Friday evening, about 6:30 pm Five reasons for five stars: (One) BBQ: beef ribs (meaty, tender, not too greasy/fatty, hard to stop eating) for the bf & "shiners"(meaty ends of pork ribs) for me. Both are smoky & have a dry rub that is awesome. It's not drenched in sauce but if you want to add it, their BBQ sauce mostly tangy & a little sweet, just the way it should be. (Two) Sides: corn, garlic fries (loaded with garlic), sweet potato fries (some of the best I've had) & mac & cheese (flavorful, crispy cheese crust.) Roadside gets a pat on the back for their sides. It's all about the sides for me. There's decent BBQ in and around the city but it's rare to find a place like Roadside with excellent sides. (Three) Dessert: coconut banana cream pie. The guys behind the counter keep it cool until we're ready to eat it. The chocolate covered crust compliments the creaminess of the filling. Even on days I don't particularly want BBQ, I'm down to come to Roadside for the dessert. (Four) $29 for dinner for two is dirt cheap. We spend about $10-$15 more at Memphis Minnie's for the same amount of food. (Five) This place is well kept and very clean. I've been to other BBQ joints which are filthy because they feel it's the BBQ that matters & not the cleanliness or ambiance (which is mostly true) but having a clean, comfortable place to sit while we grub earns Roadside that extra star. P.S. i remember their corn bread being much bigger, but when we went last week, they were miniature sized...what's up with that?! I hope they go back to regular sized corn bread muffins...

I wouldn't say I had a bad experience but definitely not a WOW experience. We had the pull pork, chicken and brisket and honestly, I cannot remember how anything tasted. (Not a good thing!) What I do remember about is the mac and cheese. Loved it! But then again, I hardly ever not love mac and cheese. I was very underwhelmed by the dinky corn bread which made me more aware of how the plates at Roadside BBQ is significantly smaller than other BBQ places I've tried.

As might be intimated by the other reviews, this is a place that everyone wants to succeed, but just isn't quite there yet. ?However, apparently it's getting good neighborhood buzz as when I went it was packed. The decor's a bit kitschy, but it does seem to show a good deal of research into different styles of cue. ?Another plus is that they have Shiner Bock (yummy Texas brew which is still something I don't see all that often in the bay). ?Well, if they've got Shiner, guess that means I've got to try the Brisket....Sadly, by the time I ordered, they were out. ?Perhaps next time. ?Instead I tried the ribs, which a friend of mine recommended, and the pulled pork shoulder----Well, hey, lookie here, they've even got some hot vinegar for the shoulder! (Don't know what that Asian plum something or other sauce is doing so close next to it though). ?Again, they get points for having the right elements in place. The pork shoulder was the highlight, although I must say that neither the shoulder, nor the ribs had even the slightest hint of a smoke ring to them. ?As such, both lacked that truly smoky flavor that is the foundation for great cue. ?On the other hand, the pulled pork was plenty juicy, tender and had good flavor. ?The ribs were dryer, showed signs of hanging about for a while and almost made me wonder if they *gasp* par-boil the ribs. ?At this point, that's just some unproven conspiracy theory, so don't take it too seriously. ?Hopefully at some point, it'll be an outright mistake on my part. I had the potato salad as my side along with pickles, both of which were fine, but nothing too exciting. ?The potato salad is of the "nice new-potato Cali variety" lightly dressed and with flecks of green whereas with cue I'd prefer something plainer...say peeled russets and a hearty covering of mayo and mustard. On the plus side, you get the convenience of a "normal" restaurant setting vs having to hunt down some shack in a seedy neighborhood with hours more cryptic than the tax code...it's a good addition to the neighborhood. ?Let's hope that this new spot can only get better with time.

So I had a HUGE hankering for some good ol bbq and we decided that going to Oakland (E&J bbq) was a little too far and we should try someting in the city. So of course I checked out Yelp and low and behold there is a bbq near by! We get player parking and walk right in. It was really crowded and we managed to snag a table. We ordered: *Full rack of baby back ribs *a hot link *2 sides that come with the ribs - mac n cheese and red baked beans *2 corn muffins *Sweet potato fries *2 beers The ribs were I guess just okay. They had a nice subtle smokey flavor but didnt really fall off the bone. I guess maybe they cut away all the fat off the ribs? No idea. Anyways their sauces are great and their own bbq sauce that comes on the ribs was actually really tasty. I really wanted to try the pulled pork sandwich as i think it was on 7X7. I'll come back for that. We left the restaurant full and satisfied. The meal cost about $35 and with no leftovers to spare!

So me and Joy A. were wanting to cross something off the 7x7 list, we decided since we both haven't tried out Roadside BBQ why not try out their Pulled Pork Sandwich. As you walk in.. the place has a western type of feel and friendly service. All of their items are listed right smack in the front like any type of fast food joint. So I ordered the Pulled Pork w/sweet potato fries and Joy ordered the same with beef brisket for the kids and mac & cheese. Our food came out in 5-10 minutes! WOW fast huh? Results? A-ok a little spicy on the bbq sauce but I liked it.

BBQ in Richmond. Oh hell yeah! I was so excited when I came here for the first time. Anything that keeps my arteries away from MSG is going to be good.. even if it's BBQ. The usual BBQ ?place for me is Big Nate's. I usually get the three point combo. You get three types of meat, two sides and slices of wheat bread for $22. ?At ?Roadside I ordered the Family Pak Meal. It's around $23 and you get a one order of meat, 2 pints of sides and 2 cornbread. I got the Texas Beef Brisket. So it's the same price for a family meal at both BBQ joints.. but who's got the better food? At Roadside the ?meat was tender but you could barely taste any sauce. I would have added my own BBQ sauce to the food if I had any. At Big Nate's they drown the meat in it. ?You get 3 types of meats and a bigger portion at Big Nate's where at Roadside it's just one meat. Roadside prides itself on their sides being made from scratch. I had the mac'n'cheese which was pretty nasty. College students make mac'n'cheese so it's has to be hard to mess it up, but they did. They should call it mac'n'nothing because you can't even taste the cheese. I also had the garlic fries which was OK but not impressive. Big Nate's doesn't have as many side orders but they are all solid so I think they draw even on the side department. The cornbread..yuck. They got to come up with something better than that. I understand it's old school with actual bits of corn but it's still nasty. Of course Big Nate's gives you slices of bread so it's a push here too. The decor inside is interesting. Wood paneling, weird ass wheel and pictures everywhere. Solid booths and tables which is better than Big Nate's broken down garage sale tables. Big Nate's has a ghetto parking lot whereas Roadside is street metered parking but it's usually available nearby. Overall I like Big Nate's better. It's all about meat and portions for a fat ass like me. Roadside is a good alternative though..as since it's close to my house I'll probably go there when I get tired of the Dim Sum. But seriously, add some freaking sauce to your meat and it'll be about 100 times better.

giving it four stars for the sandwich I had the other night - After driving by this place for the last couple of months I finally jumped out of my car and grabbed a beef briskit to go on the way to Mr. Smith's. Also added on the sweet potato fries which were fantastic and almost gone by the time I got accross town - I know eating and driving is a bad idea but they were that good. I am going to go back soon and try the ribs. I wold have given five stars but I need to starve myself for a day and go back and check out the rest of the menu to get this one the full five - and I am looking forward to it. *** went back last week and got the ribs - frickin great. up to five stars. It ain't micheal mina but for a good BBQ/rib joint on Geary street - perfect.

My brother treated me to lunch here a few weeks ago and wanted to get my quick feedback on their BBQ. After ordering and devouring two orders of Beef and Pork Ribs, one order BBQ Chicken and a few sides of Mac n' Cheese, potato salad and Baked Red Beans, I thought this place wasn't too bad.... I have a thing about BBQ being smoked in-doors, because I truly feel it should be done outside in a backyard, tailgate, or any place OPEN air! but HEY, this place gets my approval for on-the-go BBQ... Roadside BBQ does have a high-end BBQ smoker in the kitchen and it does produce well smoked meats. The texture of meats are consistent, the meat falls off the bone with ease with a slight pull of your fingers or teeth. When testing out your BBQ please make sure to do the "pull test". Properly cooked ribs will not fall off the bone! The only ribs that fall off the bone are ribs that have been boiled and steamed. This process ?usually strips all the flavor from the meat because water acts like a solvent. . If you want to see if the ribs are properly cooked just slowly use your teeth to pull the meat off the bone. The meat should slowly pull away with a little resistance. BBQ Roadhouse passes with two thumbs up!

My keyboard hates me right now...if it could only avoid my sticky BBQ sauce fingers & endure another day of typing in peace. Fortunately, it will now be receiving a much needed cleaning. Months ago, hungry for some down home southern grubbin', ?I had peered through the window of Roadside BBQ after closing time. I was intrigued by its menu; Baby Back Ribs in the portion of my choice--1/4, 1/2, 3/4 or full slab, BBQ Beef Brisket sandwich appropriately named "Mr. Brisket", amongst many other seemingly wonderful dishes. Let's not forget the side dishes either; sweet potato fries, french fries, garlic fries, corn on the cob, 'slaw, etc. I finally took the plunge & gave the only southern BBQ place around the Inner Richmond a try. As I was intrigued by "Mr Brisket" before, I opted to have the sandwich (it can be ordered brisket beef only) & had garlic fries as my choice of side. Let's start with the garlic fries. I have always been a fan of the garlic fries offered at the not-so-distant neighbor's restaurant, "Q". My biggest objection to Q's fries was the lack of a dipping sauce--Ketchup or my favorite, BBQ Sauce. This is not an issue at Roadside BBQ! They have all the different sauces you could ever ask for, and they await you right next to the register...this way you can get as much of it as you like! Onward to "Mr. Brisket". With a toasted bun, slowly-cooked beef & a generous portion...this sandwich did not disappoint. I added some of the hot BBQ sauce to the sandwich itself, the starting amount of BBQ sauce just wasn't quite enough (I like to overdo the BBQ a bit if you haven't noticed). When the sandwich & fries were finished, I felt as though I needed more. Don't worry, I used some restraint & told myself there would be another day. Maybe tomorrow? Time to clean the keyboard!

Roadside bbq My fingers are sticky and covered in brown goo...I think I have some on my face, and some got in my mouth. Mmm bbq...so the beef ribs are after my heart, with flavor and daggers, they will most likely kill me, sad but oddly so very true. The hot wings, dude the hot wings...yes, totally worth it. The sides, meh. No one goes to get bbq for the sides, and if you do, take your vegetarian ass to the curb. The pork ribs are decent... The pulled pork sandwich is basically the best ive had...like no joke. The vibe is cool, the bbq sauce selection is basic but covers first to third. The pickle jar is kinda cool, cause quite frankly I like pickles. The price is kinda steep, but you know what else is steep, the price of diamonds...why because its not easy to find diamonds, and in SF, bbq is kinda like diamonds... Id recommend going here at least once...why? I dunno.

I'm a biased reviewer. You put the word BBQ in your name, and you're automatically getting four stars, unless you absolutely suck. This place was pretty good. ?Giant pulled pork sandwich and some veggies on the side for $8. ?Pork sandwich was awesome, but the three flavors of BBQ sauce I tried left a little to be desired. ?The veggie mix was excellent (and not to mention pretty). I prefer Memphis Minnies in the Haight, but this place is still pretty damn good!

Walked 6 blocks with the promise of amazing bbq, i decided to pop in for dinner the other night. Ordered a rack of ribs, some baked beans, corn on the cob and fries to share with the roommates. Ribs: dry. too dry. You shouldn't have to chew hard to get the meat off of the bone. Tasted all right though. Beans: blew hot monkey ass. Corn on the cob: went in the trash, didn't even bother. Fries: eh. Roommates: passed out It gets 3 stars though on the fact that 1. i didn't eat my corn, so i can't give it a lower rating and 2. they have pulled chicken. I will try this place again for the chicken and we will see whats up.

It's pretty refreshing to see some thing different on this stretch of Geary Blvd. ?Squeezed between the several restaurants and cafes that almost blend in with each other lies Roadside BBQ, offering up some astonishingly good smoked meat. ? Both the ribs and the chicken are smoked and flavored well without being over cooked and dry. ?4 different sauce are offered for your slathering pleasure. ?They even give love to the Asian population with their spicy Asian BBQ sauce! ?Don't forget to over order on the corn on the cob. ?It was so good, I took a couple extra to go for the Warrior game that I went to after. ? Outside of Memphis Minnie's and Nate's, we need a place like Roadside in SF!

Came here with my roommate and I didn't really know what to expect. ?Decided to go with the pulled pork sandwich, mr. brisket sandwich, a side of sweet potatoe fries and some mac & cheese. I definitely liked the pulled pork sandwich a lot more than the brisket, but I felt like both were a bit dry. ?Maybe not enough bbq sauce or they make it that way so you can add however much sauce you want? ?I had to slab more on there. I think this mighta been the first time I had sweet potatoe fries and it was gooood. ?Its very different from your ordinary fries and it was a nice surprise =D. ?The mac & cheese was pretty grub too, but I think it might have been a lil much if the side was bigger. ? Overall, it wasn't bad but wasn't amazing either. ?I'd come back if i was really realllllly craving bbq again.

This place is absolutely delicious! GF and I wanted to go eat somewhere but we didn't want to order two separate dishes since we weren't that hungry. ?Roadside BBQ was nearby and so I suggested we stop in. ?It was a great idea because one order filled us both. Once there, we ordered a combination dinner. The chicken was roasted just right and the ribs were very flavorful. ?In addition, Roadside has 4 different types of sauce you can dip the meat in. ?I don't remember what they are but yum yum. We also had sweet potato fries, mac and cheese, and corn bread. All of them were so good. ?I specifically recommend the sweet potato fries and corn bread. This is a reasonable place to go to for dinner if two people shared a plate. ?I think it's roughly 15-17 dollars per plate. ?It breaks down to approximately 8 bucks per person for us. ?Not bad considering the quality of food. ?However, if you come alone, it's a bit pricy. I mean, for the price you can probably do a little better. ?But then again... They obviously use high quality ingredients and the product is near perfect.

This place caught my eye driving by this evening. I was actually on my way to try Q for take-out... Got a full rack w/ 3 sides, it cost me like 22 bucks. When I got home, I was shocked to see that I actually got a 'full' rack! It was a ton of food, even for the two of us. Ribs- I'd give them a 8 out of 10, which is pretty damn good. Anyone can spice/smoke the hell out of meat and cook it down till it's tender and falling off the bone, but the challenge is to do this and allow the flavor of the meat to come thru. Sides- The sides just weren't memorable. Got slaw, mac/cheese, & sweet potato fries. The slaw was hippie-like and not southern, the mac/cheese was the opposite (sorry, hippies make better mac/cheese than the South does), and maybe sweet potatoes aren't meant to be fries (they didn't seemed to have been blanched, I'll test this in my kitchen sometime). Sauces- Agreeing w/ the review below, the sauces come off as bottled sauces but still very good. I liked the mustard sauce and the hot Carolina vinegar. Oh and that asian-fusion sauce is just about as ridiculous to even have near a smokehouse.. as to have mint jelly near a chicago slice -it just doesn't work y'all. Atmosphere- The place seemed too bright for some reason, a little soulless and formulated. So I think the place has only been open for a few weeks now... never the less, it's solid and I expect it to stick around. Were the ribs and mac/cheese better than what I may have picked up at Q around the corner? No way. But for less than what I would have paid at Q, I overfed two folks with some traditional-like BBQ and got it togo in less than 5 minutes.

I've driven by Roadside BBQ for years and never seen anyone in this place. Tonight I took the family out for BBQ ribs. This place was packed, the staff was friendly. ? Easy to find parking. ?That's the good news. The portions were small and the full slab of ribs was not even warm and very dry - almost burnt. ?My cornbread had a hair in it...

Is Roadside BBQ the best BBQ in the city? No, not by a long shot. But it's still pretty decent anyway, so go ahead and try it out if it's too late in the day to go to that funky little spot on Divis that keeps changing its name. I find the pulled pork here to be hit and miss, sometimes it's good and sometimes it's a bit dry. I like the brisket a lot, but I wish they'd trim the fat off of it before they give it to you, like most other places do. There is also a surprising lack of sauce on stuff, but I think that's because they intend for you to add your own. The sides are all delicious, though I would steer clear of the mac n cheese, because that's another hit and miss item. The service here is quite friendly, so don't be afraid to leave a tip!

The portion size is a little disappointing, but the food is pretty good. The brisket is very tasty, nice fat on the meat , the hot bbq sauce is sweet but has a kick to it. It's a friendly staff, usually some pretty decent sounds playing old blues and country adds to the bbq atmosphere. I have been going here for years, since my days working the bar at Irelands 32. It would be nice to see bigger portions but that won't be enough to keep me from stopping here again.

I've been here a few times, and have somewhat mixed feelings. The pulled pork and brisket are both good, but can be a bit dry. They definitely need a good dousing of the sweet heat BBQ sauce. The ribs I had were a bit on the dry side, and the sauce didn't help to much to make it any better. I've had the sandwiches and they are also pretty good. The sides are very good, though. A good Mac and Cheese with a crunchy topping, and good cole slaw. The corn needs a good dunk in butter. My roommate loves the beans. If you get sweet tea, be sure to put plenty of ice in your cup because it melts fast. The garlic fries with "happy mouth sauce" didn't make my mouth too happy, and they need much more garlic to appease me. Service is friendly. All in all, it's a descent ...(pun intended, and you know who you are!) ... place for BBQ.

Okay, here's the deal. We're in San Francisco. Not Memphis, St. Louis or Texas. San Francisco. So while it's very tempting to woefully compare Roadside BBQ to the hundreds of excellent bbq joints in the country, one really should avoid this exercise. What one should do instead is consider ?this one of the few places in SF where you can reasonably enjoy this type of food, with portions of your choosing (4 different order sizes for ribs, for example). I don't find the prices to be too high, considering that it is an actual restaurant that serves food on plates (unlike so many bbq joints), but maybe that's just me falling for aesthetics. In any case, it satisfies my cravings, and finally...Mac 'n Cheese that doesn't taste like Kraft slices. Special nod to: non-fatty ribs and pecan pie.

Roadhouse BBQ is A-OK, nothing special or memorable but does the job when you're hungry and need a quick go-to place. Kind service with a smile can always be counted on. ?Parking can be tricky. ? If you don't want self service where you order at the counter and get your drinks yourself, you should probably not go here. ? Their smoked brisket and barbecue chicken are consistently good. The sides need work- corn bread muffins are dry and flavorless, baked beans are good, but could be better. ? Mashed potatoes & gravy and mac n cheese are both tasty. ? This is classical comfort food- nothing to write home about but definitely worth going back.

For the second straight day, Matt was in the Richmond District, and for a guy who seldom comes out there, he was amazed how many good restaurants are there. This place is another one of Matt's bookmarked place. Co-worker and Matt dined here for lunch. Also, there are mixed feedbacks about this place. Matt will never back down any challenge. We both had sandwiches. Matt had the Memphis Pull Pork sandwich and co-worker had BBQ Chicken. ?Both our $8.00 sandwiches were in a Grilled French roll and come with a side of Cole slaw, but we wanted cheese in our sandwich, so an additional $.75 extra was charge for melted cheese. With the cheese, it made a huge difference in taste and was ok. After work, Matt enjoyed this so much that he came back in the early evening hours to pick up dinner for the rest of the Fantastic-4. Matt ordered a full-rack of baby back-ribs. The full rack costs $20.00 and comes with 2 sides. Matt got Macaroni and Cheese and Steamed Vegetables. For the second straight day, and with our busy schedule, none of us wants to cook. With a meal that feeds a bunch of linebackers, the meal is overly matched for the kids. So Matt called for backup unit: "the niece." She'll eat anything that looks edible and gourmet-like. The five of us had dinner together. The tender baby back-rib had very little fat and fallen off the bone, which is easy for the kids, whose face looked like they were in camouflage painting. The sides were even-steven. Even with niece to the rescue, there were still a good amount of leftovers, adding to the totals left from Thanksgiving.

Oh Roadside BBQ...you get me into all sorts of trouble. ?You are just TOO damn good. ?I can never decide between all your tasty sides of mac n' cheese, corn bread, sweet potato fries and so on...Why do you do this to me? ?After Bay to Breakers when I hadn't eaten in almost a whole day, you were there enticing me with your wafting BBQ scent. ?Your smoked BBQ chicken sandwich with avocado is always flavorful, fresh & FILLING. ? At first glance, you look similar in layout and style of menu to Asqew Grill but you are ohhhhhh SO much better. ?I have heard great things about your BBQ plates with 2(!) sides AND a corn muffin but I have to admit that I am a little scared of what it would do to me. ? I always think of the time my brother once tried to eat a HUGE Thanksgiving meal after not eating all day. ?After he rapidly consumed massive amounts of food, he had to go lie down never to be seen or heard from for the rest of the day. ?I think that this is what would happen to me if I had the BBQ plate. ?I want my stomach to be happy with me so I am stickin' to the regular portions. ?Now for next time, sweet potato fries or mac n' cheese? ?It's a tough decision, ALRIGHT?

Wood paneling everywhere. ?An old green gas pump in the corner by the beverages. ?The always popular country photos and metal signs hanging on the wall. ?This place looks like a bbq joint even if it is too clean. ?The menu is on wood blocks hanging from the wall behind the counter. ? The place looks like a chain because they have their branding and signage down. Luckily it is not. ?Nice menus, they even have a nice Roadside sign on the beverage machine. ? The one downside was it only had one cash register and the place was jumping. ?The line was to the door, about 6 deep. ? I had the 1/2 rack of ribs - take out. ?Wrapped in foil, perfect, this is one big 1/2 rack. ?Dry bbq with a nice smokey smell and flavor. ?The meat was nice and tender, and just a bit too fatty for me...they were pork ribs. It was 12.95 for the 1/2 rack and you get two sides plus cornbread. I found the cornbread muffins to be one of the big highlights. ?With big chunks of corn these dense and tasty breads hit the spot.

Since this place is close to my home I have gone to this BBQ place many times. I either get the BBQ chicken or the ribs, obviously. The order comes with two sides which are simple but very tasty and made with wholesome ingredients. As for the meat, its always prepared with the southern style roadhouse feel. They have a wide collection of sauces for your meat and the sweet tea is a transcendental bliss, maybe I'm exaggerating but it's worth a try. Also, the collection of beer and wine is excellent because it gives this BBQ joint a better atmosphere (You can drink liquor and eat simultaneously!) and an automatic star because when you have ribs you might want a frothy glass of Sierra Nevada. One thing that can be a turn down is the fact that if you eat here and it's busy, which happens on occasion, the door when opened brings a windy chill, but then there is always their take-out service....

Damn, I was all set to give this place a stellar review, and then I went last nite for another visit. Big mistake. I went in, and the place was pretty dead, with only a couple people sitting/waiting and no one at the counter. After a few mins. I finally was waited on, and placed my order. I like the meal deal where for 8 or 9 bux I can get a meat portion (I generally get chicken) and 2 sides (I tend to get the mashed taters and veggies). Normally, it's relatively quick (about 10 min. or so) and the food is pretty tasty. This time, everything that could go wrong, did. I wanted to pay by credit card, but their machine was either malfunctioning or the guy wasn't swiping it correctly.(I called my company to make sure it was all good, and it was). I paid cash, and waited for like 15-20 min. Eventually, I got my grub, and without double-checking closely, I raced back to my nearby abode to chow down. On the way back, I purchased a six-pack with my credit card, just to make sure I had plenty of brewskis, and that the card was indeed working. That took about a couple mins., as the store is right across from Roadside, and my place is across the street from there, all within a block. I got home, tore open my grub--now ice cold--and found my order was screwed up. They gave me ribs instead of chicken! So, I had a choice: Go back, wait another zillion years, or just reheat it and munch. I munched. I was hungry NOW, dammit! Luckily, I had some BBQ sauce at the crib to put on the ribs, because, when I order the chicken, I like to just use Crystal Hot Sauce (the best). That being said, the ribs were still pretty good. The veggies were not up to snuff as usual, but the taters were fine. Oh well. Overall, this place has been above average, so maybe I caught 'em on a bad day. Maybe.

Man, BBQ lovers are tough ass critics! I'm tough on burgers, not BBQ. BUT I am glad that the others who have reviewed this place all think that Roadside BBQ is a place that they wish would succeed. Anyway. I was stoked that this place opened up in the neighborhood, but they opened up in one of those store fronts that might be jinxed, cuz a few Thai places have come and gone just in the last few years. For non-die-hard-bbq fans, this is a good find. It's a breath of fresh air to find a 'q spot that isn't small and ghetto. House of Cat Fish n Ribs, ghetto. Joe Johnsons, ghetto. Big Nates, kinda ghetto. Memphis minis, mostly just small. Roadside BBQ is good for families, single dudes and dudettes, couples... of all ages. There's a really good vibe going on there which is important because sometimes take out bbq spots and their flourescent lights just kind of feel like you want to slit your wrist. Onto the food: Some complained about the smaller portions, which is true. But it's small as in, "I want to finish my meal and not bloat and feel like shit, but don't feel like I got gypped" small, so it's a good size IMO. I got the brisket, which was $10.95 and it came with 2 sides, which I think is fair. Brisket: I am a lazy ass and I always end up getting a sandwich at bbq joints so I don't have to deal with bones. So since my dumb ass just found out that brisket has no bones, I ordered it. It was plenty tender and juicey. It was a bit fatty, but hey, that's a plus by me. I thought the temp was ok since it wasn't take out. The Sauces: I have nothing but love for that Asian ginger sauce that a few people seem to hate on. It's kind of irrelavant, but I really liked the taste of it. Sides: I got the veggies and garlic fries. Garlic fries are of ballpark caliber, but I wish I got a bit more. The veggies I was very happy with because it wasn't all chopped up the same size meant that it was fresh. Carrot slivers, string beans, corn, and broccoli. Yum. Cornbread: Probably the only negative thing about my meal. I liked the bits of corn, but it seemed a big soggy and could have used more sugar or butter. It tasted a bit sour too. I went on a Thursday night around 6 and the place was already going off. However, we got a booth and the food came pretty fast. I'd totally recommend this place and will be back soon in hopes that they will improve their cornbread. 12/16/06 CORNY CORNBREAD UPDATE!!! Yes! They definitely have been improved! It's moist and it has a crumb-y texture that's filled with wee bits of corn niblets. Awessoome.

I've been here a couple of times now and I agree with the 3-star consesus. Service has been pretty slow on each occasion - I know BBQ isn't supposed to be rushed but it seemed that things were mismanaged. As a matter of fact, on the last visit the guy taking the orders seemed to be overwhelmed and it wasn't until later when the crowd died down that the manager finally came in to work to help. The BBQ itself is great with the brisket being excellent. The sides are another story. They seem kind of bland and more of an afterthought. Don't get the mac-n-cheese! If you're in the hood, want some American BBQ, and got some time on your hands, then Roadside isn't a bad choice.

Nothing "special," but it's the only legit BBQ joint in the Richmond, and more importantly: The brisket: grub. The ribs: grub. The pulled pork: grub. The sweet potato fries: grub. The Mac n Cheese: hmm...i don't know how to accurately describe this.... i think the word i'm looking for is "grub." plus, there are at least three or four different sauces to choose from (not that i have any problem with the standard BBQ sauce at most joints... but having some choices is nice too). I've only gotten takeout from here -- the restaurant itself isn't anything to get excited about, but who cares? The grub's the thing.

Well, I am happy to report that I LOVE my new neighborhood, the Richmond, and this will be the first of many reviews in that area. Me and a friend came here for Sunday brunch, and I have to say, it is exactly the kind of place you would want to be on a Sunday afternoon, especially if you are nursing a hangover. There are SO many choices for meat and sides. ?We were in heaven. ?I got the spicy chicken sausage with mac & cheese AND garlic fries...gross combination, I know. ?What can I say. ?My friend got chicken, mac and cheese, and corn. I can't complain about the food...it was pretty good and really filling. ?Especially the corn, I tried that and it was great, plus the corn muffin it comes with is really good. ?The garlic fries, however, were just REALLY garlicky...I honestly brushed my teeth 3 times plus listerined about 4 times, and it took hours to get the taste out of my mouth. ?I feel sorry for my boyfriend.

Sometimes you meet someone who's cute - not hot but a solid "I can hold my own at a party" cute - and you're thinking maybe you'd like to be more than just friends. ? At this point, their personality plays a large role in whether you'd rather have "amour platonique" (the concept of non-sexual love) or "amour platonicien" (knockin' boots love according to Plato.) And so it is with Roadside BBQ: ?their BBQ is cute but it's their side dishes make us Friends with Privileges instead of Just Friends. My favorite two are the Roadside Veggies and the Garlic Fries. ?The latter is great for: 1) ?Turning the undead 2) ?Turning unwanted advances from a date gone bad (If they still want to kiss you after Roadside garlic fries, they must REALLY like you...)

Oh, yay! A BBQ place near me! :) Yesterday I was driving around with a friend and we were talking about where to eat. I think it was as we past Pac Heights I got a whiff of something smoked and then inspiration hit me: I needed BBQ. Good sticks-to-your-fingers-deep-penetrated-smoke-?juicy-fall-off-the-bone BBQ. Ever since having beef ribs in Austin I've been craving that unhealthy carcinogenic glazed goodness. Diet be damned, I must have BBQ! So I turn to him and he says he thinks there's a place that's on Geary ... near the Asian restaurants? Really? Oh yeah! The little corner shop with the pig sign! Roadside BBQ! So we step in and look up at the yummtastic menu: 1/4- , 1/2-, 3/4, full, and an ever larger rack portion of BBQ goodness! Plus sides galore. Sure there's the usual mashed taters, coleslaw, baked beans, and salads, but they also happen to have sweet potato fries, and some other really unhealthy calorie-bomb items which I can't remember right now. We ordered a 1/2 rack, sweet potato fries, slaw, and a salad. They have a variety of extra things like vinegar, BBQ sauce, Crystal hot sauce, and other bottles of stuff---just in case you want to add more condiments. I went through the salad first and tried the fries next. I have to say, VERY GOOD sweet potato fries. I could probably eat those forever. Big chunky portions, slightly crispy on the outside, and big salt crystals clinging to the outside skin. But, ah, the main course: ribs. We split the half-rack even, and I cut my half down into grabbable portions all prepared to get completely covered in BBQ sauce. I mean, I like the kind of charred thick layer of sauce that just clings to everything, every bite, to your lips, and no napkin can wipe it all off. I tore off a few paper towels in anticipation. The ribs are kinda deep red, only a tad bit of charring. Hm. I bite into it, and it's tender and flavorful. They definitely have the sauce down, but it kinda goes "moosH" rather than "crunch". The meat isn't exactly falling off the bone, but it does pull away nice and easy. The overall taste is ... sweet. It could be a bit more smoky. The aftertaste, hm, more sweet than meaty. Overall I have to give it 3/5. The meal has "solid performance" but not exactly a write-home. Maybe it's a bit much to ask for that kind of crystalized smoked glaze without having a serious BBQ setup where you can pollute the air. But, still I woulld go back. Mmm! Times visited: 1

UPDATE: 12/24/07 - I finally returned a few days ago this time ordering half a rack of Baby Back Ribs with macaroni and cheese and sweet potato fries. ?The ribs were excellent; they were smoky, tender and quite meaty. ?They've improved the corn muffin which is moister now, and even though the macaroni and cheese was pretty average, I was quite happy with the sweet potato fries which were crisp, flavorful and meaty. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Memphis Pulled Pork Platter was smoky and very good. ?Most of the meat was quite moist and tender; however, there were a few strands of pork cooked to a crisp that were a bit tougher to chew. ?A tangy barbeque sauce is drizzled over the meat. ?The sides that I chose were not too extraordinary. ?The mashed potatoes were okay, but the so-called "gravy" was watery, season-less and warm. ?The creamy-less cole slaw was tangy and actually okay which is a huge compliment coming from a guy who does not like cabbages. ?The corn muffin was gritty and tasty with a few kernels of corn in it, but it was so dry I would have gagged on it had I not washed it down with a drink. I'll have to experiment with the "RoadSides", but the meat was quite enjoyable. ?The prices aren't too bad and the portions are good. ?I had to remove a star because nobody came around to clean the tables. ?There were at least four tables with dirty dishes and cups, and I had to clear someone else's dirty set of dishes in order to get a table.

oh yeah. I forgot their heavy-handed dose of "hickory smoke" on everything. yuck. oh, and why? (I've had the ribs and the chicken.) my mom is a russian import and makes way better bbq than these guys. until someone can top hers, I'm sticking to Mom's Place. corn muffins are ok. a little oily, but I like that they have creamed corn mixed in. sweet potato fries were a little soggy in places and dried out to death in others. the sign of a lousy sweet potato to start. cole slaw is not bad. more vinegary than mayonnaisey, with red and green cabbage, carrot and jalapeno julienne. nice crunch. let me know if there's a better place to try and I'm there. thanks! now off to try and remove this hickory smell from my hands...

Mmmmm meat good. ?Sides decent - esp the garlic fries. ?The BF and I split a combo with ribs, brisket and pulled pork. ?There was PLENTY of food. ?The sauces were really wimpy even after we added a bunch of hot sauce. ?The pulled pork was the best and surprisingly not that fatty. ?The brisket on the other hand was like half fat. ?ewww.

Yay! ?Finally there's a place with great ribs in SF. ?No more trekking out to San Pablo in Berkeley to get me some decent Q. ?The ribs were very good -- tender and little peppery. ?I like the way they were served dry, so I was able to choose exactly what sort of bbq sauce I wanted. ?I ended up using 2/3 hot + 1/3 mild. ?Perfect. The sides (mac and cheese and garlic fries) were sadly uninspired. ?To be fair, that might be because I got it take-out, so the sides were luke-warm. ?The mac and cheese (baked) looked good. ?Anyhow I didn't care. ?I went for the ribs. Four-stars because this was my first time. ?It'll be five easily if the ribs are consistantly this good. Joey Altman (from KRON 4) was there. ?He said (to a table of cops, not me) that he was an friend of the owner. ?It's a celebrity sighting of sorts, I suppose. -- Ya, the ribs are so consistently good that five stars is absolutely warranted. -- They now have beef ribs, too! ?They are quite excellent unsauced. ?A little three-mustard or chinese ginger sauce and they become spectacular. ?The only drawback for me is that they don't offer a full rack of them. Okay, perhaps their non-rib offerings aren't spectacular, but if you don't want ribs, what are you doing at bbq in the first place?

What's this? A good old fashinoned BBQ place in the middle of chinese food row? Hot damn! This place offers well cooked meat that will leave you wanting more. Great flavors, great choices, and pretty quick too. Better enjoyed to go but you can eat there as well. Often busy but you won't wait too long. This place is a bit on the more expensive side but would you rather have an awesome BBQ sandwich or a whopper? You choose. I like real meat myself.

Better than average! ?The pulled pork sandwiches were piled high with porky goodness, though I'd rate the pork as a bit on the dry side. ?But slather enough BBQ sauce on there and it more than makes up for it. ?The 2 main sauces - their house sauce, and a "hot" bbq, both tasted remarkably similar and neither was all that hot, but they were pretty tasty. ?I liked the house sauce a bit better, my friend the hot one a bit more. ?They also had an Asian hot sauce, which I skipped, and vinegar for you Carolina types, which I also skipped, cuz I don't put no vinegar on my BBQ. Sweet potato fries were very fried -a bit more than I'd prefer, and also salted, which is great on regular fries, but I'd rather keep the sweet ones sans-salt, and put a little hot pepper on them instead. ?But they weren't bad. Corn muffin was heavy on the corn in a good way, and only very faintly sweet. ?Good eatin'. Mac & cheese had a great non-Kraft flavor (thank god), with a cheese crust top. ?Also good eatin'. Inside, it's all wood paneling, with some random Texas-y signs and suchlike. ?Authentic? ?Not really. ?But the BBQ is good, so who cares?

Dontcha just LOVE that smokey smell that stays in your hair and on your clothes after? Like a lingering ambiance that reminds you later that you did actually leave the house today. This place is good mostly because it's so different for the Richmond. Sweet Potato Fries: what do you think, is there any nutritional value left after the frying? Yummy. The "spicy" Chicken sausage. ?Does any one know why the meat sometimes pulls out from the skin? - leaving you to pull some nasty (gross, I hope no one is watching...) -membrane from your mouth? It was tasty but there must be a way to not have that happen? THOSE baked beans: ?EWwww! what happened? no no no. that was a waste of 2.5 bucks. The slaw was good though. One more issue I had is this: ?I just want a side baked potato. NOT a "stuffed" with dairy (4 dollar) thing. JUST A FRIGGING POTATO ! ?-Like what if I happen to have a lactose intolerance? and I want to substitute my mash for a simple potato. They just couldn't sell me a potato for like 2 bucks or something? apparently not.

I pored some Louisiana hot sauce on the garlic fries and relished in the sensation.The spicy BBQ sauce was not spicy for my standards, but it did the job.

I have to admit that I'm hardly an easy person to dine with casually. The bf and I often have a hard time deciding what to eat because I get in these moods of being unable to come up with one thing I want to eat...yet adamantly refusing every suggestion he proposes. This guy has a lot of patience, I tell ya. Weekend brunch/lunches are the hardest for some reason. Maybe it's because my normal eating schedule is thrown off by sleeping in until mid-morning; therefore making me even more indecisive as to what I am willing to place into my stomach. At any rate, the bf suggested Roadside last weekend, and surprisingly, I didn't put up a fight. Nope, I rode in the car and was even helpful in searching for a parking spot. The reason? Being a Southern belle, there is nothing I enjoy more than a good BBQ. ? The menu at Roadside had plenty of options. A lot of sides to choose from and, of course, sweet tea. I went with the Pulled Pork Sandwich with Grilled Veggies. The bf got ribs with Veggies, Corn Bread and Mashed Potatoes. At the self-serve bar, we loaded up on the different bbq sauces. I liked the ginger-infused bbq sauce and the 3 mustard mix. The portion sizes were big. Taste-wise, it was okay...above average. Keep in mind that I'm going by Confederate state standards here. I ended up just dousing my sandwich with a lot of sauce because they didn't put very much on for me (maybe this was on purpose given the sauce bar?). I like my bbq saucy and messy. It's a clean, casual spot that offers a change from the usual Inner Richmond food scene and just short of a "Y'all." It even made me a little homesick. One day I'll take the bf back home for some real Southern cookin'. Until then, we'll be having peaceful, protest-free weekend lunches at Roadside.

this place used to be one of my fave BBQ joints in the city, but Baby Blues has now replaced it. This BBQ joint wins my "best side dishes award" since no other place has really good sides, and I love the roasted corn and sweet potato fries here. I like Roadsides beef ribs but ?As another reviewer said, the beef ribs at Roadside have very LITTLE MEAT ON THEM....especially when compared to the huge Flinstone bones at Gorilla BBQ in Pacifica or Baby Blues. ? Their pricing is a bit cheaper than other SF BBQ joints so thats a plus. And their coconut cream pie with chocolate dipped crust is the BOMB! ?Get it, definite 5 star dessert. Parking can be tough.

I live a block away from roadside ... it's dangerous. I swore off the ribs after having them about a hundred times. that shit is good. so, after giving up those tasty but fatty ribs I moved onto other mouthwatering dishes. the loaded baked potato is to die. ?best garlic fries ever ... ok, so it's hard to be on a diet while eating at roadside. but their salads are great too. they have this amazing homemade bbq vinaigrette dressing and they put fresh corn and green beans in the garden salad. love it! food aside, this new place still has some things to figure out. when we're done eating we're always confused about whether we should clear our own place or if we just leave the dishes at the table. and when they call your name to get your food you have to go around all the people in line. it's just a little awkward. also, they should def have salt & pepper at the tables.

This place was so disappointing. The meat was way, way too dry and lacking of any kind of flavor. It seems they forgot the most important and essential part of barbeque: SEASONING. You can't just drown it in sauce afterwards, people, things need to marinate! The brisket tasted like it had been sitting under a heatlamp all day, and while the ribs were decent, they weren't anything special. The decor was fun, and they have a great location since there's nothing like it around the area, however the food made me wish I had taken the bus to Tommy's.

My favorite thing was the SWEET TEA, yummy! ?I heart sweat tea! ?If I lived in the South, my diet would consist of any kind of fruity cobbler, pecan pie and sweet tea! ?Just so you know though, the fries and baked beans come in a close second. My least favorite thing was the pecan pie. ?I was really looking forward to eating some when I saw that it was on the menu, but in reality it was a slice of nut pie. ?Hardly any gooey, sweet filling, just pure nuts! ?Maybe I got a funky pie or something...one can never tell! Aside from that, the people are friendly, there are lots of tables (even a few booths to choose from), and grab one because the place can get packed! ?Oh, and you are bound to find a parking spot in under 5 minutes on Geary street.

Driving back down Geary we spotted this place and decided to stop in and get something to go. We entered and browsed the menu for a bit.They have a selection of salads,stuffed potatoes,sandwiches,decent selection of sides to go along with the meal and of course the BBQ. So my friend did the ordering and I told him that I wanted some also.He got the 1/4 rack,which was a rather small portion.I thought to myself what the hell is he thinking.I am a woman who loves and embraces her food and I don't consider myself a nibbler.We also got the potato salad because I love potato salad and couldn't think passing that up. I really don't eat BBQ often,but I know what the good stuff taste like.We thought that the BBQ was ok tasting,nothing exceptional or over the top.The potato salad was ok. If you are in the neighborhood this place may be worth a try.I mean the prices are not that bad,but let me say the parking sucks. Overall,the service was ok and what is a little nice is that they are open late and cater.

So, I read on the 7x7 list that I "have" to try this place out before I die. Apparently it's that good. So one night my girlfriend and I decided to check it out, not too crowded, parking was easy (for Geary that is). She ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I ordered the ribs, the ribs were a bit dry but the complimentary BBQ sauce they gave you eased that up a bit. The pulled pork sandwich was decent, it wasn't great, the flavor was alright, but it really wasn't to die for (7x7 told us it was). I would come back, but I prefer Hard Knox BBQ more.

I ordered a 1/2 rack of ribs, mac n' cheese, and mashed potatoes with gravy, and a stella. It ended up being $18 (!?!). The ribs were rather dry, but the sides were alright. They also offer some grilled vegetables for you vegetarians out there, which is rather nice. I'm not sure why my friends like this place so much, though.

I knew I was in the right place when I picked up a pork rib to dunk it in the mustard sauce and half the meat fell off the bone -- awww, yeah. Then there was the juicy, smoky pulled pork, which my dining companion didn't really want to share, and who could blame him? Both the mustard sauce and the vinegar sauce had the right balance of tang and heat. We finished up with pecan pie as good as I've had anywhere, with crispy, slightly salty crust offsetting the sweet pecan innards. On the basis of those things, I want to give Roadside BBQ four stars. On the other hand, the hot and the mild Texas-style (tomato-based) sauces weren't bad, but they weren't that good, either; in fact, we agreed they tasted like they came from a bottle. The sweet potato fries, though delicious, were limp and soggy where they should have been crisp. Worst of all, the brisket was disappointingly fatty. So I'm taking away one star. Then again, I can walk there in five minutes... Okay, I'll put back that star. Hand me the Alka-Seltzer.

I ordered a combo dish: 1/2 Rack of Ribs, Mac & Cheese, a side salad with ranch dressing, and a cornbread muffin. $12.95 Added a Sprite $1.50. The ribs were good, they are soft and juicy, but the bbq is dry. It tasted better when I pasted some extra bbq sauce on it. Cornbread muffin tasted really good. I just wish I could have eaten the whole thing, but I was too full to eat it all. It even had real bits of corn in it. The ranch dressing was watered down in the side salad, but it still tasted good. Mac & cheese was horrible because I did not taste any cheese. Also, it was all clumped up and formed the shape of the corner of the baking dish. The seating arrangement is tight if you are sitting at the tables and I almost slipped when the rubber mat I walked on started sliding because the floor was wet.

The cashier was friendly, inviting and very straight faced humorous, I felt I was in for a treat! I had the Smoked BBQ Chicken and the Texas Beef Brisket. Both kinda dry, but slathered with sauce and you can barely tell. The Beef Brisket was a little overcooked, making it more chewier than expected. I kept thinking I shoulda tried the ribs and the pulled pork. The sauces were good, not too smokey or sweet. Mild, Spicy, and Asian. I love spicy but I couldn't tell the difference between the Mild & Spicy. The Asian was a nice sweet, gingery sauce. They have a great selection of sides, but come in really smaller portions than I would like- especially the mini cornbread muffin that comes with every order. I chose Mac n' Cheese and Garlic Fries. Both pretty good! Garlic Fries were nicely seasoned. While eating I took a glance into the kitchen. I noticed the cook take out a 1/4 slab of ribs and place it on the stove to reheat. I couldn't help but watch. Really? I guess I've been spoiled with ribs straight off a hot charcoal and/or mesquite chip grill or smoke pit. *sigh* I miss the Nugget Rib Cook Off . All in all, I'd come back again if I'm craving BBQ and Gorilla BBQ is sold out! I do like that Roadside is opened a little later...

In the olden days of yore, I was a truck driver, and I roamed all across the land. One of the bonuses of my job that stayed my hand every time I fantasized about plowing my bald-tired pickup into a Murano was trying every taco truck and barbecue shack in the metropolitan region. I ate a lot of smoked and grilled murdered animal. Some good, some bad, and the meat at Roadside BBQ is more good than bad. My approach to barbecue is to control the experiment: I order the same thing at every place, so I have a basis for comparison. You can't compare apples and links, you hear? One of the things I appreciate about barbecue joints is the standardization of menu options. Every place has pork ribs, and calls them pork ribs. Unlike smoothie/juice bars that all have a version of tropical smoothie, but call it by different silly names--Mango Madness at one place and Tropical Tantrum at another. That way, every damn smoothie place I have to study the whole menu all over again and can't just order The Usual. In the interest of having a perfect laboratory environment, every barbecue place I visit for the first time, I order the ribs and brisket combo. These two dishes show the mettle of the business. Don't bother ordering chicken unless you keep kosher, and links don't showcase the cook or the meat. Ribs and brisket, son. At Roadside BBQ, the ribs were excellent and the brisket was ok, the difference residing in the flavor. Ribs were tender, moist, and not gristly. Yet my brisket was a little dull. My major complaint about Roadside BBQ was the self-lubricating approach to sauce. They had a choice of sauces on a consol, and the meat came un-sauced. The hot sauce was smoky and sweet with a slow burn, just like my gonorrhea, but I'm opposed on principle to self-saucing. Unless it's the top of the line motherfucking swine (and cow), which this most assuredly wasn't, the meat should be dry-rubbed, marinated, basted, and sauced before it ever reaches me. I also evaluate barbecue places by the choice and quality of sides. Some places offer ONLY potato salad. Roadside BBQ, to its eternal credit, had a great many choices, and I went with the sweet potato fries and coleslaw. The fries were fantastic, and the coleslaw was tangy and mercifully bereft of mayonnaise. While I won't be abandoning Memphis Minnie's transcendent brisket for Roadside, if I find myself, as I did last night, killing time in the Richmond before a gig, I might belly up for some satisfying ribs and fries.

I just moved a couple of blocks from this spot and I LOVE bbq so I had to try it. ?I actually wasn't expecting too much because I hadn't really heard any raving reviews about it, and it just surpassed my expectations by a nose due to the delicious sides and sauces. The fresh off the oven corn bread, warm cheesy and crusty mac and cheese, and the light and crunchy coleslaw were all delightful! They have a choice of 5-6 different sauces and I liked each one of them, although I could use some spicier sauce. Now on to the actual bbq...I got the Memphis pulled pork and was pretty disappointed. It wasn't very flavorful, tender, or even warm. I had to put a ton of bbq sauce on them for flavor, and it still wasn't that good. I'm definitely coming back here since it's so close, and I'm going to try to ribs and brisket next time.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich to go. When I sat down to eat it, maybe 5-10 minutes later the bottom bun had turned into a complete puree. I ended up having to eat the pork (very bland) with my hands. If they didn't already, my coworkers now think I'm handicapped. The ribs and a few other dishes didn't look half bad, but the pulled pork sandwich was awful. And what good is a ?BBQ joint without a good pork sandwich?

Roadside Barbecue, I really, really wanted to love you. I wandered into Roadside Barbecue this weekend due to a decided lack of anything that resembled food in my fridge. ?Not an unusual state of being for my fridge, but I digress. ?I wandered in hungry and excited that my new neighborhood came complete with a Barbecue joint close by and ready to be impressed. I ordered a 1/2 rack of ribs with macaroni and cheese and sweet potato fries. ?I tried their mild sauce on 1/2 my order and their hot sauce on the other 1/2. I was singularly under impressed. The meat was tender which I give them a star for, but their sauce SUCKS. The macaroni and cheese was tasteless, not very cheesy, the baked topping with the crumbs on top was a nice touch, but what was underneath was so bland that it negated what is usually a good sign for mac and cheese. The sweet potato fries were awesome!!! ?The best I've tasted and I imagine I will go back for those. The cornbread muffin...oh what a sorry excuse for a muffin. ?If you took one on those super cute itty bitty cupcakes and divided it in half you would have what roadside calls "a muffin" ?sad really, because the 1/4 bite of cornbread that you got was actually pretty good, the size is truly laughable though. The service was adequate. I have friends who have told me I need to go back and try the brisket sandwich, which I will do to assuage them, but I don't hold out much hope for them due to the issue with the sauce.

Maybe all those BBQ shows on travel channel set my standards too high, but I came out disappointed after trying Roadside. We got the Q for two meal and split it. Our plate had ribs, pulled pork, grilled chicken, brisket, corn muffin, grilled corn, mac & cheese, and sweet potato fries. The fries were good. Crispy but soft on the inside. The pulled pork was also good. Very tender with some tasty sauce. The ribs were small and very dry. Not my favorite. Also their chicken was dry. A real let down. Brisket was ok. Tender but nothing crazy. Everything was mediocre. I really wish SF had better BBQ joints but that's wishful thinking for now. After the very dry experience I dunno if I'd try this place again. Time to try Memphis Minnies I guess.

This place screams "Western" as soon as you walk in. Its small, wood paneled, and has an Ox skull hanging on the wall. You can tell Roadside BBQ is new; Its clean and doesn't have that "rough" feeling you would probably expect from a BBQ house for better or for worse. Not many people go here because the neighborhood itself is rather barren. The atmosphere is topped off with country music and thankfully not Alice 97.3. My parents have been raving about this restaurant for awhile, telling me how tender the ribs and brisket are. And I am compelled to agree. I had Roadside's beef brisket burger. It is tender as advertised and overall very good (in the menu, they say that their brisket are even cooked for 13 hours). My main complaint is that as soon as I dove right into this meaty bundle of joy, the bread bun began to fall apart. I essentially had to use my fork for half of the meal, which is by all means a travesty when eating a burger. My side dish, the macaroni and cheese, certainly looked appetizing. Notice the past tense there. The macaroni was a little overcooked and unfortunately lacked the cheesiness I expect when I eat, well, macaroni and cheese. The macaroni wasn't warm either. It was simply at room temperature--a no-no. Roadside BBQ definitely has some good BBQ. There's no doubt about that. I especially love the extensive BBQ sauce selection they have available to dab whatever slab of meat you ordered. Just don't expect much more than that. And hey, the prices are pretty good too.

You know how there are some things that you *know* are a bad idea even before you start? Operating that rusty chainsaw without a tetanus shot...wearing that emerald-green lamé Prom dress...blowing some guy in the photo booth of a bar after you've had 10 vodka tonics. These are things you know, before going in, that they will come back to haunt you. Roadside BBQ was precisely that experience. Okay, so I know, I'm a snotty snot snot about BBQ. I grew up in Texas, fer chrissakes. There aren't many things that Texas does well, but slow cookin' meat is one of them. And when I walk in and see a place that is well-lit, immaculately clean, and has "vintage" advertising on the walls, I know I am not about to have an authentic BBQ experience. I should have just turned away then and there. BBQ places should be grimy with years of smoke coating their walls, and they should not have a wall menu that was designed to look like cowboys branded it out on the range. I knew this place would make me angry before I even began, so really it's my own damn fault. Enough about the aesthetics though. Let's talk about the food. Wife and I split a plate. We got the "Memphis pull pork" with sides of sweet potato fries (another thing you'd never find at a Texas BBQ joint) and mac n' cheese. It also came with a corn muffin. People in Memphis are rolling over in their graves right now. This was not succulent and juicy pull pork, full of flavor, greases dripping from your chin, full of smoky goodness. This was some shredded, boiled meat swimming in juices that looked more like water from the boiling pot and drizzled with horrible-tasting sauce. The mac n' cheese was tasteless, even though the guy at the counter said it was their best side. The most edible thing were the sweet potato fries, and even those weren't that great. The corn muffin just out and out sucked. They also had an assortment of sauces to choose from, sauces that should never be allowed to make an appearance in a BBQ joint, things like Asian ginger BBQ sauce. WTF?! Look, I'm not unrealistic. I know that searching for authentic, soul-warming BBQ in the Bay Area will only result in a series of heartbreaks. I'm not expecting Texas good (for God sake's, I shudder to think about what their "Texas brisket" tastes like), I'm not expecting to taste something Salt Lick-worthy, but I am expecting to taste something that tastes edible, even if it doesn't taste like the BBQ I grew up with. This place was not that. It was just really fucking unpleasant. I left this place feeling angry at food.

I was in pork heaven, everything on the menu looked good, so rather than debate with myself I went straight for the 1/2 rack of ribs with 2 sides and corn muffin. Once I got my smokey bbq platter I went to the ketchup pumps (yes pumps, there were 3 bbq sauces, honey, mustard sauce, horseradish sauce, etc.) and poured about twice as much bbq sauce on to the plate as there was food on the plate. I looked like a ferocious man beast and protected my food like a pitbull guarding his bone. No one I mean no one should get between a man and his bbq sauce.

We personally didn't like this place because the meat was just flat out way too smoky, but not in a good way We looked in the back and didn't see a pit or even a grill but we did notice a "cookshack" style smoker which I don't like because they don't let any air in or out concentrating the flavor of the wood to a point that it just overpowers the flavor meat.... Don't get us wrong we love smoke but I do think that the meat is the most important flavor and any BBQ dish (well not sides)

Parking is a pain and when you think the smell of BBQ is worth it to lure you into this establishment, you sadly regret that decision when you take the first bite of your ribs. Not that it was so horrible I had to spit it out, but after looking at my receipt and confirming what I paid compared to what I just put into my mouth, the numbers didn't seem to add up. I wouldn't go back, and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody either.

I was desperate for a taste of bbq, hell I didn't even care if the animal was still moving, I needs me some grubby ribs. The decor is very reminiscent of old bbq southern shacks...lots of wood panelling, even the menus are on wooden plaques. I ordered the quarter size ribs $8.95 (not going to go crazy and go full hog), that came with 2 sides (I ordered roasted vegetables and sweet potato fries) & cornbread muffin. An unlimited $1.50 soda fountain was probably the best part of the meal...god knows I needed it after eating all that food. I don't know why people are griping about the sauce, I mean there's 4 varieties to choose from...Regular bbq sauce is sweet and tangy (I love sweet!!!), spicy bbq, Asian Ginger BBQ and some other sauce that I glanced over. ?I think if you're a true bbq person, then anything but your own homemade sauce will always fall short. So until then, our pitiful few SF bbq houses will have to do. The great meal experience is never without police protection...I must have hit the motherlode of police luncheons, cause there were tons of our uniformed friends just swarming around the place like bees to honey. You can never have enough people armed to the teeth with 9mm handguns. Only inbred hicks and mental head cases would come here looking for a quick smackdown...hahaha... As to my meal...my roasted veggies were a bit on the raw & crunchy side..I think they should add maybe more roasted corn for sweetness, they did load me with tons of broccolli. There were real corn in my cornbread, and drizzled with sweet honey, was in of itself a great dessert. ?The ribs didn't fall off of the bone, but dipped with enough bbq, it was tasty. I'm giving this place an extra star for the scrumptious sweet potato fries...Dang that was good. Parking is always a challenge, but take the bus, you can't go wrong. The counter servers were nice and the place is relatively clean. I'd come here again to try out their garlic fries ^_^

only 1 star Ok lets start on taste, non-existent, wether you get the brisket or the ribs, you can taste lighter fluid, the baby back ribs were dry the meat on the rib was not alot, , I think they do an 18 hour sit but there are other places in the city that have the Q sit for longer and are not dried out. The only thing that saves this place is there sauces, and the service. On the night out with a few friends hit this place up hoping for some good Q sad to say we found the chain type Q, McDonalds kind of Q. would not go back first impressions of this spot not really Q more or less lighter fluid taste, bland meat. food * sauces **** price $$ ambiance *** wooden paneling wooden floors, wooden chairs, wooden tables, alot of wood haha service ****

I'm from Southern Missouri. ?That means barbecue is a mix of Memphis sweetness and Texas spice. ?Then I moved out here and was overwhelmed by Korean BBQ. ?I missed my home-cooked meals and all the options in one place. ?Yes, there are other places to get this in the city, but I think this is one of the better ones, and definitely one of the cheapest. ? ?The coleslaw is a great low-fat one (no mayonnaise, mostly vinegar), the sweet potato fries are the best I've had in the city (way better than Zebulon's!), and the sauce choices have something for everyone. ? The baked beans aren't all that great, and the salads are kinda weird. The corn muffins are more like Missouri/Texas corn muffins than southern sweet ones. All in all, a pretty good meal.

After passing by this place many many times and wondering, "how good can this Richmond dicstrict place be?", I decided to try it and invite some friends to come along. Another one of our buddies, who's a total foodie, said he never had ribs and meat so tender in his life. And this guy is picky. So I guess we had to give it a try right? I don't know if it was because I had high expectations or what, but this place let me down a little. Yes, the meat was tender: Fell right off the bone (if you got the ribs) and was able to be cut by a fork (if you got the brisket). BUT, this tender meat was quite dry. I had to add sooo much BBQ sauce just to moisten it up. I think that the meat this place uses is too lean... good BBQ meat needs plenty of fat to keep the meat moist in my opinion. And the flavor of the smoker didn't seem to truly infuse the meat all the way. The sides were okay I guess, nothing to write home about. Prices were a little more expensive than it needed to be, but not outrageous. I think I'd rather hit up a place in Western Addition for some authentic Southern BBQ. This place gets a bump up to 3 stars only because they have domestic beer for $2.50 and imports for $3. I thought that was a good deal and probably the only reason I would come back.

I was so happy when this place opened up in the neighborhood. the Richmond offers just about every kind of food but at the time they had no real BBQ places. My expectations were high and this place definitely met them if not exceeded them. Trying to find quality BBQ in SF has always been tough but Roadside BBQ is a great choice and the quality of the food never changes. My personal favorite is the Texas Brisket but the ribs are good as well. I really like their mac & cheese and their corn on the cob and don't let me forget that tasty cornbread that I always wish I ordered extra after the fact. The desserts are good but I'm usually to full to eat anymore by that time. I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try if you are craving BBQ. Don't expect top notch Southern BBQ but for the city its one of the best choices.

Was craving for BBQ meat and this was the closest place I could find around this area. ?The bbq ribs sounded delicious but due to the fact I was taking it to go, I thought I would starve trying to eat it with a plastic knife. ?Therefore after reading some reviews on yelp and debating what I would get, I decided to try out the Mr. Brisket sandwich with garlic fries and corn muffin instead. ? Supposedly the menu said only one side dish but when I ordered my food, I wanted the corn muffin in the first place. ?The man who took my order said it was small and I can pick something else and he'll add the muffin in for free. ?So I had a good experience with their service. As for the food, I thought the fries were too soggy and seemed like it was soaked in oil. ?It was a little spicy so I'm assuming it was spicy oil they added onto the fries. ?It definately had lots of garlic flavor and I really liked the taste but too bad it's too soggy and oily for me. ?The muffin was a little bland and the sandwich was not bad. ?I liked the sourdough bun and their sauce but I didn't taste the smoked flavor on the brisket like they mentioned. ?The brisket was very tender though. ?I wouldn't pay $9 for this dish again but I would like to try out their other food on the menu.

I came here with some friends to try 7x7's Big Eat SF 2010's 100 Things To Eat Before You Die: #85. Pulled Pork Sandwich from Roadside BBQ. A very nice lacquered wood environment as we approached the counter. We saw the Memphis Pulled Pork (under "Sandwiches") on the menu that came with one side dish. We then saw the Memphis Pulled Pork Platter (under "Wood Smoked BBQ") that came with two side dishes and a corn muffin. We figured that we were just getting a extra side and a corn muffin for few bucks more in our quest for the Pulled Pork Sandwich. Little did we know, the platter just served the Pulled Pork by itself, no bread. Still, we got the main deal, which was that Memphis Pull Pork meat. Man it was a very moist portion. With coleslaw as one of our many sides we shared, we attempted to get the same effect of the sandwich taste as it contained the coleslaw. I'd have to say it was pretty darn good. The sides overall were...eh! The sweet potato fries were a little overcooked. The garlic fries were good though. And the corn muffin was pretty tiny. Spending around $14 bucks for the platter, I was a little turned off by the price, but content with the taste of the meat. My friend was so determined to get the full-experience of the Pulled Pork Sandwich, that he ordered it after we finish our Pulled Pork platters at the end of the night. He said it was for his "girlfriend," but me and my other friend assumed he was just gonna devour the sandwich himself anyways. In our eyes, the Pulled Pork was pretty good! 3.5 Stars!

The rolls of the paper towels on each table and bench-like booths called me. ?I looked at the menu and chose BBQ chicken, which comes w/two sides and corn bread. ?There are no hush puppies! ?I had to go w/two pretty boring sides, instead. ?That was my first let down at Roadside BBQ. ? The chicken was yummy - tender, not fatty (once I took the skin off), not undercooked, not overcooked. ?It wasn't cooked in much sauce, but I walked over the BBQ sauce bar and picked out a couple of dipping sauces to try. ?I picked the Asian ginger BBQ and the hot BBQ. ?The hot BBQ was the better of the two, though neither was especially extraordinary. ? That was my second let down at Roadside BBQ. ? Still, I was generally pretty happy and planning to give it three stars. ?Then, my tummy started to hurt within minutes of leaving - it had been fine for weeks - the only explanation I can think of was my food. ?That was my third let down at Roadside BBQ.

I am confused by the other reviews, because after many many visits over the last couple years my experience has been different from the negative remarks. ?I don't feel that the service is slow at all. ?The food is very good in quality and the portions are large. ?I'm not sure why people think it's slow unless they are going when it's really crowded. ?I've never really felt like the wait was long. The only thing I might agree with is that some of the sides are a little bland, but the french fries, garlic fries, sweet potato fries, potato salad, corn on the cob, and green salad are all good. I come from the midwest where bbq is a much more prevalent than here, so I feel like I am qualified to judge the quality of the meat. ?I think that the ribs and brisket are very good. ?The brisket is not as mushy to the touch as the brisket at Brother In Laws, but it has a better texture as a result. ?I think it is superior to the brisket at Memphis Minnie's, and you get a much larger portion for your money. ?I have also had the chicken which was tasty. They have four different flavors of bbq sauce to choose from. ?I like to combine the asian with the spicy for a perfect blend of sweet and spice. Often my husband and I will order a family pack which gets you a huge rack of ribs, a pound of brisket, four corn muffins, and four large sides of your choice. ?This is enough food for at least two, if not three, gut busting meals and it only costs about $45.00. ?We have gotten this combo many times during peak dinner hours and they only ever made an error one time, forgetting to include a potato salad. ?We literally keep their menu in our car so if we have a sudden need for bbq we can order on the way there. I also appreciate that Roadside is extremely clean and you can see your food being prepared. ?There are no secrets here. ?If you are someone who is skeptical about restaurant sanitation as I am, this is a safe place to dine.

Memphis style pulled pork sandwich: looks dry at first, doesn't it? Well, I added sauce (a ton of it) and it transformed into deliciousness. Coleslaw (which I usually hate, as most of the time coleslaw is made to look like slop) on top is a brilliant addition. The coleslaw is crisp, just a tad acidic, and clean. Combo plate: Baby back ribs and Texas beef brisket. The brisket was....well, I didn't eat much of it. It was too dry. I hate this description, but it was cardboard. The texture wasn't pleasing either. On the other hand, the baby back ribs were delicious and tender. Sides: had the garlic fries, which were (surprise!) super garlicky; if you like that sort of thing (which I definitely do), this is for you! Also had the corn on the cob, which was grilled, and the mac and cheese, which was a little chunky looking (as I think mac and cheese should be). Both were good. A solid 3.5 stars. Sitting in the restaurant for an hour, I commented that it was "a man's restaurant" in that, no other females walked in the entire time I was there. Somehow that made it feel more authentic. Parking (meters) on a Saturday afternoon was easy.

Good basic reasonably priced BBQ in the Richmond. Very, very clean place. The owner is a stickler to details and cleaniness. The staff is also on top of things. Recommended ? ? Ribs are pretty good. ? ? Pulled pork is moist and flavorful. ? ? Sandwiches items comes with a side and priced just right. ? ? Sides: safe bet on veggie and garlic fries ? ? Brisket...only the fatty side is pretty good. However ? ? ? the chicken are alittle too dry for me. ? ? ? Brisket are oversmoked or overcooked. ? ? ? Mac&cheese is a hit and miss (especially if it was sitting around too long.). This place have room for improvement to push it to the top. They could either cook it the same amount of time at lower temp or less wood or pellet. The smokiness was not the issue...the over cooking.... If they solve the overcooking (caused dryness) ... I will increase my review to 4 stars!!! Yes...I am a regular...I would love to see them top the other places by modifying the cooking technique to cut down the overcooking!!!

Well, I had plans to go to Gorilla Barbecue on Sunday but the timing of the NFL playoffs made me consider somewhere closer. So I go to Yelp and find Roadside BBQ and it became the worst pick of the day (worse than picking the Chargers over the Jets). I ordered the Big Boy with baby back ribs, brisket, pulled pork and macaroni and cheese. Baby back ribs - 4 bland gray ribs, tasted like boiled ribs not smoked ribs. I feel bad for the little baby pig that was sacrificed and subjected to being this meal. Brisket - 3 thin slices of overcooked, tasteless gray meat with some nice chewy fat attached to it. Mmmmmm, scrumptious. Pulled pork - was juicy but in a bad watery way. My plate of meat was soaked with water from the pulled pork. I guess it was sitting in a warmer for a long time and gathered a lot of condensation. I drenched the meat in barbecue sauce otherwise it would have been like eating a mop without barbecue sauce. Macaroni and Cheese - nothing special. An instant mac and cheese with extra cheese thrown in could contend with Roadsides. Cornbread muffin - why is it smaller than a Hostess mini blueberry cupcake? Or is it a Hostess mini blueberry cupcake with a kernel of corn stuffed in it? hmmmm Barbecue sauces - so so, tasted like spruced up Kraft BBQ sauce. This is probably my worst experience in barbecue ever. This place made me want to subject myself to the bad service at Brother-in- Laws (RIP) but at least they had real barbecue. I paid over 21 bucks for this joke of a meal. Don't make the same mistake as me, drive to Oakland, Berkeley, Pacifica, ?SOMA, or the Mission if you want barbecue.

Kind of reminds me of the BBQ Joints in texas. Not overly impressed but it's decent BBQ in a pinch. Just don't tell me that it's awesome cause I'm more of a fan of the dry rub Memphis style. Again, solid. Not super.

I know I keep comparing stuff to LA and while this ain't no Lucille's BBQ from SoCal...it's good BBQ! Really smoky flavor! My friend and I both got the "Big Man Plates" (hey...we're not big girls but we just love food!!! And it's enough food to last for 2-3 meals!). We loved the pulled pork the best. The beef brisket and baby back ribs were decent but slightly on the dry side. Of the sauces (BBQ, hot BBQ, "Asian" BBQ which tasted like Chinese Chicken Salad Dressing, forgot the others...) I liked the straight BBQ best. I also got mac&cheese (yum!) & sweet potato fries as my sides (hey...if i'm gonna eat major carbs I'll do it right!). p.s. My friend Amy who said she's too lazy to sign up for Yelp asked me to put on my post that she gives 2 thumbs up!

Is BBQ authentic when you can taste lighter fluid? If yes, then Roadside is for you. Fast food and bbq is an oxymoron. Those two words contradict each other. This place is cleannn though.... ? 3.5 stars.

My work had the Roadside BBQ catered for about 12 people for lunch. It was a real hit around the office. I would recommend the pulled pork then adding a bunch of your own fresh bbq sauce to it. The coleslaw was fresh but very peppery, therefore making it spicy, which was not my favorite! I did like the red potato salad, it wasn't full of crazy mayonnaise and it was seasoned well. The potatoes were diced at nice size, but I would have liked more dill. The beef brisket was too fatty for my liking. The corn bread muffins were small but very good and had fresh corn in them which was delicious! I could have eaten more of those!

I would say a solid 3 star place. Clean, spiffy decor, nice customer service, pretty wide selection of meats/ribs and sides. The pluses are definitely the sides, my favorites are the roadside veggies and the sweet potato fries. The beans are kinda okay and the unfortunately the corn muffin is really a hockey puck as mentioned here by other reviewers. Everything else is not too bad. The minuses are, sometimes, since I've come here a lot, the meat's inconsistencies are too much too ignore. My husband and I can have good juicy brisket on one visit and then dry meaty mess on another. Same goes with the ribs and the chicken. So why do we keep coming back? It's close, and it's not all that bad. Plus when you have a hankerin' for non-Korean bbq out in the Richmond and convenience and quickness is an issue, Roadside will do. They also have a range of bbq sauces to accompany your meal. I personally like the Asian ginger one for my sweet potato fries. I'm not saying that this bbq place has better sides than meats, because that would be kinda sad. But Roadside BBQ is cutting it pretty close, I think.

Back in my college days when I lived on Geary near USF (2007), I always had a craving for BBQ... So Roadside BBQ definitely caught my eye. ? Back then, the service seemed slow, but the portions were pretty big and the food was flavorful. ?My husband and I would crave until we got more BBQ! When we moved to another part of SF, we ended up not coming back for a while... until this past weekend. ?The service speed definitely improved, but it seemed like it was at the cost of smaller portions and mediocre-tasting BBQ. ?We ordered for take-out and the mashed potatoes tasted like the metal tin container they put it in for orders to-go. ?The cornbread that I used to love and order extras of are now dry and break apart easily (they broke on the ride home before I could even open the container). ?The ribs weren't super tender and the mac & cheese was lacking. The two of us ordering the combo meal w/ 2 sides then adding one drink on top of it was about $28. ?Meh. ?Time to find a new BBQ joint. Street parking only (metered) & credit cards accepted.

After some of the serious praise that Roadside BBQ received in some of the other Yelp reviews, I was pretty eager to check it out, particularly since it's close enough that it could have become a regular destination. Unfortunately, it was not to be. ?Walk in and the environment is full of old-timey folksy signs, but they're brand-spankin' new and affixed to simple sheetrock walls in a very modern and clean setting. ?The generic restaurant space doesn't really speak "bbq atmosphere", but I wasn't about to judge their food on that basis. Stepping up to the counter to order, I asked the gentleman behind the counter "what shouldn't I miss?". ?I often use this technique to allow restaurants the chance to have me try the best of their best so that I can become a loyal repeat customer. ?Sadly, the answer was "It depends what you want - we make it all here and it's all good." ?Sorry - too generic...and not terribly helpful. I chose the 2-item combination platter with the ribs and the chicken and that comes with their cornbread and two of their sides. ?Based upon earlier Yelp reviews, I chose the Mac&Cheese and the fresh vegetables (to create at least the illusion of balance and health in the meal). ?You choose what kind of BBQ sauce you want over at their condiment bar - the meat comes completely un-sauced. Net Net Ribs were OK - somewhat flavorful, not falling off the bone tender Chicken just OK - white meat dense, not very moist or flavorful Cornbread - OK, could use some butter (none avail), not up to the level of the fab jalapeno cornbread at Los Altos Grill Mac&Cheese - I think I'll stick with Kraft or Stouffer's - like most interpretations of M&C, not very flavorful - kind of a waste of calories Veggies - excellent, actually - flavorful, fresh, and cooked crisp! The staff were pleasant and the prices not cheap, but not crazy. ?I wouldn't rush back here - I think I just have to continue my quest for fabulous BBQ that could live up to what you'd find at Everett & Jones across the bay or Los Altos Grill on the Peninsula.

I had my very first dry rub rib. I could see the pink, and the little smoked color on the outside of the rib. It was like cutting down a tree and looking at the rings in the tree to see how old it is. But instead the ribs would have a special smoke ring showing how it was smoked. Eben though ?I only got the kids meal and got only three ribs. I wanted to order more. I could taste the smoked goodness in the ribs. I also had the option of pumping regular and spicey bbq on my ribs. I thought they made a great rib, and my fingers smelled like smoke for the rest of the day. I would prbly go here again for sure.

Despite the current 3 star rating, i'd have to go with 4 stars since everytime i've been here i've been very happy. It can get crowded at times but i tend to get it as a late lunch or early dinner (since you WILL be full). Their cornbread is bomb and so is their mac and cheese. however, i'm not a fan of their cole slaw. Prices are on the fair to+$ side depending what you want. If you're ever in the mood for bbq hit up the roadside and you shouldn't be dissapointed.

(1.5 stars) OK so me and my husband, desperate for decent BBQ near the sunset district, have tried this place 3 times now, hoping that we went on an off day. Ribs were not close to falling off the bone, had an OK smoky taste. Pulled pork sandwich was OK, somewhat tender. Sides are a big fail, coleslaw too vinegary, veggies obviously frozen. Prices aren't too high, but ultimately are too high for the quality of food. All in all, we were never satisfied.

Penguins love our BBQ stuffed potatoes and we love this place providing them for us! Friendly service, clean restaurant, ample menu, large portions, tasty foods! They even have pickles and japs and different sauces to add to your dish, just like back in Texas! Yee haw!!!!!!! Oh, and don't forget a slice of pie, they say they're made fresh in store daily! Can't wait to go back for more nom!

I'm from SF, so I don't pretend to be a barbecue expert, but this place was great--I'd put it on par with Memphis Minnie's. The restaurant itself is really clean, and much more nicely decorated than I expected walking in. The folks who work there are really personable, too. On food: I got the pulled pork sandwich and in an effort to at least be a little bit healthy, the veggie side. The ingredients seem of good quality--the bun was both tasty and toasted, the pork tender and neither greasy nor drowning in sauce (it had some sauce on it, but they also have sauce out in the condiment area in case you like your stuff with more). I expected a pretty good sandwich, and it was! The veggies are what surprised me, though. I didn't know what to expect and really pleasantly surprised with a mix of green beans, grilled corn, shredded zucchini, broccoli and shredded carrots. They were perfectly cooked: just crispy enough and not at all greasy. They could have been seasoned, but some salt & pepper fixed that. I will definitely be back.

This place exists to serve a need; to satisfy my Texas-sized BBQ cravings when I can't deal with the parking hassle of Memphis Minnie's. As far as ?San Francisco BBQ joints go, it's not bad but Roadside just didn't make the grade. Their BBQ sauce is entirely too sweet, the ribs were not fall off the bone tender, the hot links tasted Safeway-like, and the worst offense in my opinion, cutting the brisket into 1 inch slices. NO. Just no. Go to any place in Texas to see exactly how brisket is supposed to be presented, thinly sliced in 1/8 - 1/4 inch slices. On the plus side, they offer three kinds of Shiners and parking is easy... and that's about it.

The pulled pork sandwich was a-ok, especially dripping with cheddar and hot hot hot bbq sauce. ?The sweet potato fries were oily and hot, and exploded with sweet oil when bit. ?The ribs were good, there wasn't a whole lot of meat on them, but they were flavorful (ever so smokey) and perfectly textured. ?The garlic fries needed salt, but they were SOOO GARLICY!!! ?Yummers. I would recommend this place for an early Sunday dinner (like around sunset, on a warm day). 4 stars for you, Roadside.

Ok, it is entirely possible that I don't know a good BBQ from the rubber shoe sole, BUT I really like this place. Living in Richmond district, we are not exactly spoiled by BBQ places, so I am pretty excited to have The Roadside BBQ within a few blocks drive. Their baby back ribs are yummy! They don't taste boiled or overcooked, as I have experienced in some other places. And meat does come off the bone very easily. BBQ chicken is not a typical grilled meat. It almost tastes like it is smoked rather than BBQed. Which is ok, as long as you don't expect crunchy-skinned, juicy chicken right off the grill. From the sides, coleslaw is one of my favorites. It seems they add citrus or apple to it, and it is vinegary not creamy. Definitely give it a try. Garlic french fries are good too. But I guess it is really hard to make them bad. Potatoes and garlic....mmmmmm... Baked beans are very tasty. It is not vegetarian dish, so be aware :) Oh, and I like their three mustard sauce the best. So, if you are deciding whether you should do dishes or cook dinner tonight - do the dishes, and order from this place. That's what I am doing tonight!

solid bbq, good sides. my favorite thing about this place is the freshness of ingredients. Their sides are very good and surpass, by far, what most bbq joints in the bay area have to offer. The bbq was very good, and mostly moist, but I'd have gladly given up the dry rub and bbq sauce condiments (which are all very good) for a slathered rack of baked on bbq sauce goodness. Why don't bbq places caramelize their sauce onto their bbq?? more on this later.

First off, I'm not TOO picky when it comes to BBQ since I've lived in Southern California for most of my life. Roadside has its attractions and bombs, which I will now present fashionably... PROS: -Pork ribs are tender as hell. -Pulled pork sandwich is served on fresh grilled ciabatta with coleslaw dressing. -The sauces. OH THE SAUCES. The three mustard slather and asian sesame are worth covertly stealing. -Sweet potato fries are just so goddamn tasty. -One of the few places in which I order the plate of chicken. Heavily sauced and juicy. Yes please. CONS: -The sides are usually too dry, especially the baked macaroni. To give them credit, baked mac and cheese is extremely difficult to successfully pull off. -While the pulled pork is tasty, it is a tad bland. But throw some hot carolina vinegar (use lightly...it's fucking hot) and some BBQ sauce and you're ready for deployment. -They run out of certain sides fairly quickly. Strange, considering they're not all that great. So if you're nearby and you need a break from soyburgers, I'll recommend Roadside to ya, but I'm sure there are better BBQ joints in the area. I'm just too lazy to look.

I would've given another star, but our meal on a Friday night @ 7 pm was completely ruined by two families that had over run the place with their children aged toddler to teen. Additionally they seemed to be friends, if not relatives, of the owner(s) so the establishment did nothing to curb the behavior (which included twins jumping up and down behind a connected booth seat). It was the worst sort of lazy, parental neglect I've seen and I've seen some bad stuff. ? My friend and I hadn't seen one another in a long time so it was an important occasion to us. It is a family place, but that doesn't mean it's a playground -- respect for others should be shown. No one else was acting obnoxious. Them finally leaving, HOURS later, created immediate peace. Unfortunately we were ready to go about then too. That aside, this was my first time eating here, so I got the classic beef spareribs ($10.95) came with a choice of 2 sides and a corn muffin. I got a Shiner heifenweiser $2.50 to go with it. DARN GOOD CHOICE! Excellent crisp beer. Paired perfect with the meal. Never tried the brand before. My eye also caught the black beer (I'm a sucker for those), but I'm glad I went with the lighter simply because I hadn't had it in a while. Meat was perfect, the exact flavor one would ever want and went particularly well with ones choice of sauces at the counter. I tried the traditional sauce with some of the spicy Asian one. Plenty of meat on only two ENORMOUS ribs (3 would cost $15.95). The corn muffin is very small, more like a hush-puppy shaped like a muffin without much flavor, but it had bits of sweet & tasty corn in it and goes well with a smidgen of honey and/or butter. The mashed potatoes were creamy but also bland without gravy. My friend got the gravy -- soupy (I like that), true meat flavor, but there was an uncommon sweet quality; not overpowering, just unusual. I liked it. My plain potatoes came with a sprinkle of green onion, that was a nice touch. With only half a pat of butter, they also came to life. I'd rather add my own flavors and butter, nice for a calorie conscious person too. I also got "Roadside veggies". Very nice, smokey flavor, FRESH, especially the corn which was as crisp & sweet as could be. My friend got the grilled corn on the cob and loved it. ?Came with butter that wasn't even needed (and I put to better use on my muffins & mashed potatoes). ?They also got a combo meal ($14.95) where one can choose TWO (or THREE $18.95 "Big Guy") items off the menu and still get sides -- great idea! The brisket and baby back ribs was the choice. The baby ribs had just the sweetness you'd want, far more delicate than the beef ones. The brisket went nice with mustard. The staff was VERY friendly. The music was jazzy without being dominating. The place was super clean (where many sf places fail that don't do BBQ). So I don't fault them there. But those rowdy families completely ruined our meal -- they acted like they owned the place, which if they do, is unfortunate. Kept us from getting dessert, but we were quite tempted to try the pecan pie and coconut banana cream pie. I took half my meal home and it reheated very nicely with my housemate, who also thoroughly enjoyed everything (mixing the mashed potatoes with the veggies is also a good flavor option). So maybe takeout is the way to go or a less busy night? ? Oh and as a note to all caretakers: it is disgusting to put diapered babies on top of counters, near cashiers, where FOOD and/or BEVERAGES are served (which I've experienced in various locations, including Starbucks). But if you like BBQ, this place will hit the spot. No wonder it's stayed in business for years where other places couldn't. Just...curb the rowdy, rude customers even if they are family. It's not cool and makes the customer feel trapped.

Dear Roadside BBQ Management: ? ?Thank you for your existence! ?There are so many nights when my lazy butt does not want to cook, nor take the bus for that matter. ?When I am left with no other choices but to eat out I have to choose between: pizza, Chinese, Thai, sushi, unidentifiable Asian noodle restaurants, and Mels. ?But thanks to you, I can choose to pass on Clement street and save the greasy Geary pizzerias for after hours.

So I was recently back in Nashville, TN (my real home) for a few days, but for some reason did not go to Jack's BBQ, which I consider to be the balls. Got back to San Francisco last weekend and headed out to get some groceries at Trader Joe's with my roommate. We were both hungry and figured a full meal before shopping would keep costs down. I remembered Roadside was close so we walked over. I wanted Roadside to be better than 2 or 3 stars, but it really wasn't. I ordered a double meat combo plate with 2 sides. The brisket was dry, ?and a 3 slice portion was a bit small. The pulled pork was pretty good. The mac and cheese and slaw (sans mayo, a serious plus) were fine but nothing special. Kudos to having several different types of BBQ sauce. I liked the hot/sweet BBQ the best. After the meal, my buddy and I decided Memphis Minnie's is still the best BBQ in the city, though I'm still not a huge fan.

I don't know how you can't like this food. I feel like a champion after I eat here. If you're going to give it a try, here's what you should order (depending on how much food you are going to get): 1. Pulled pork (Dip it in the hot vinegar!) 2. Chicken sausage (I don't even like chicken sausage, but this is delicious.) 3. Baked beans 4. Beef ribs 5. Brisket (The fat is the best part. Dip it in the spicy BBQ sauce.) 6. Sweet potato fries (They're not any better than anyone else's, but I think they go well with the meat.) I've had other dishes, but they weren't rave-worthy. My friend really likes their macaroni and cheese and their cornbread, but this isn't my friend's review, now is it?

Okay so I know that there are two very distinct camps when it comes to BBQ -- saucy or dry rubbed...at least that's what I've learned from watching the Food Network. People take these things very seriously so I won't even attempt to blah blah blah about BBQ except to say that this place is probably someone's preferred variety...just not mine. The pulled pork sandwich is #85 on this list: http://www.7x7.com/conte… Initially, I was kinda disappointed. Where was the BBQ sauce? It wasn't what I was expecting, but no bones about it -- it was good. Great bun and lots of meat...both important qualities in a sandwich. Other things I'm fond of: * The corn muffins. Small and moist and corny and sweet. * The sweet potato fries. * The garlic fries. * The service: Always very friendly and speedy. Things I could do without: * The corn on the cob: It's too charcoal'y for me and smells like popcorn. * The butter packet in the to-go bag: By the time I got home it had melted all over the bottom of the bag and I nearly had a butter/couch emergency. I'm glad I didn't have to make a panicked call to my mom going OMG HOW DO I GET MELTED BUTTER OFF THE COUCH??? because then she'd want to know why I wasn't eating my butter at the table like a civilized person. * The ribs. Again, it's probably a matter of preference, but I like mine sweeter and saucier. Bottom line: You could talk me into eating here again but I'd probably just stick with the pulled pork sandwich.

The last time I went to Roadside they were out of the Texas Beef Brisket so I returned last week and ordered it, and boy was I disappointed. The brisket was overly stringy and fatty. It had none of the great smoky flavor of good bar-b-que beef and lacked the nice pink line that showed it had been smoked for hours. The texture and mouth feel were terrible. it was like chewing on strings of fat with tiny bits of meat connecting them. I don't know if they used a poor cut of meat or the cook sliced the meat with the grain instead of against it, but this was, without a doubt the worst BBQ beef I ever had. On the plus side the other dishes were still good. My friends meals, the pulled pork and the chicken were good and everything was nice and hot this time. Maybe there is potential here at Roadside BBQ but I doubt I'll be giving it a third try to find out.

I was not impressed. The only thing I like was the roasted corn cob....and my diet coke. The meats each come with 2 sides and cornbread, which is great. and they also have great combos like the Two Way Combo and the Big Guy Combo. But great value does not mean the food can lack in taste. My pulled pork was moist and juicy. But it had no taste! Even with the different barbeque sauce provided, it just tasted like...stuff...and sauce. C'mon now! Where are the barbeque flavors?!

"BBQ" is my favorite acronym in the English language. ?No, it's not because I'm part Korean . . . but it's because of places like Roadside BBQ who create such delicious entrees of BBQ'd meat. ?I am shocked that Roadside BBQ has a 3 star rating. ?The lower ratings were probably given by easily irritable old people and competitive BBQ spots. ?C'mon, let's not get politically correct over here . . . old people do love to complain. ?I digress . . . let's continue with the review. ? While searching for a great BBQ spot on Yelp, we stumbled upon Roadside BBQ. ?We checked out the location as many of the BBQ spots in SF were in somewhat ghetto neighborhoods. ?We noticed, "Inner Richmond" as the location and we were shocked! ?Who would've thought a nicely rated BBQ spot would be located in the Richmond District, right?! ?I guess Chinese people do love American BBQ too! ? We arrived at Roadside BBQ on a late Sunday evening. ?The restaurant wasn't too crowded and it reminded me of a fast-food restaurant setting. ?All the walls were glass with a lot of bright lights while having a huge menu above the cash register. ?I recommend taking a look at the to-go menu as it was easier to read and understand. ?I ordered the two item combo. ?I decided on the beef brisket and the spicy chicken sausage. ?My sides I chose were the mac and cheese and the sweet potato fries. ?The meal comes with cornbread, which was very disappointing (keep reading and you'll know why). The beef brisket was very tender and juicy. ?The spicy chicken sausage was awesome and probably a step above the beef brisket. ?I was pleasantly surprised to see that the mac and cheese was made with REAL cheese while having a slightly crunchy top. ?Roadside BBQ probably throws the mac and cheese in the oven before serving. ?GREAT IDEA! ?The sweet potato fries were ok. ?I've had better sweet potato fries at the Elephant Bar . . . go figure. ?The fries were not crunchy at all and they were very dry. ?Let's talk about the cornbread! ?The diameter of the cornbread was the size of a silver dollar, no joke! ?Who makes cornbread that size?! ?Anyways, the good news is, they have sweet tea. ?I would definitely try the sweet tea. ?According to my friend, sweet tea is iced tea that is brewed simultaneously with sugar. ?It's quite tasty. ? As stated before, I love BBQ. ?I've been to Everett and Jones as well as Memphis Minnie's, among other random BBQ joints. ?I would rank Everett and Jones as #1, Roadside BBQ #2 and then Memphis Minnie's as #3. ?Trust me; it's quite a compliment for Roadside BBQ to be sandwiched between those two excellent BBQ restaurants! The reason why I'm not giving Roadside BBQ a 5 star rating is because the wait was extremely long (we waited almost 20-25 minutes to receive our food after ordering), there were limited seating and the cornbread looked like it was meant for a leprechaun. ?The sweet potato fries was subpar and you would expect better from a BBQ restaurant. ? Although, I do have some complaints, I would definitely come here again. ?Heck, I gave them a 4 star rating! ? For those who were offended by my posting, let's not get too sensitive here . . . I love old people, Chinese people and leprechauns.

Since my buddy was craving for some BBQ we decided to hit up this place. I have to admit i was quite skeptical of this place. We ordered a green salad, which was very good. Had a 1/2 rack of lamb. The meat was tender but as my friend pointed out, the flavour has not soaked into the meat. ?The BBQ flavour was very normal. There is nothing to rave about it. Their sweet potatoes was delicious and deep friend. So controlled intake might a better option ~smile. I thought the BBQ sauce, was boring. Also I thought it was little too sweet. Of course they had good amount of spicy sauce available which I made good use of to rectify the situation. The staff is very friendly and helpful. This overall is an ok place and i will surely go back for more. This is surely some thing different from the asian food available in Richmod.

This place has captured the hearts of metermaids and run them afoul of the law. ?Last time we visited, a parking ticket lady stopped and parked in front of the fire hydrant in order to grab a quick bite to eat. ?Just one more instance of the lengths people will go to eat some Roadside BBQ. Service is lightning fast and just as good. ? While the place has the feel of a chain resturaunt, the food is suprisingly good. ?It could use a wider selection of sauces, but those that are provided are good. Portions are huge for the price. Sides are alright. ?The corn on the cob seems to lack a little flavor, but it is grilled so that somewhat compensates. ?The beef ribs are crappy, but what they can do with pork is amazing. All in all, great place for pork BBQ, stay away from the beef

I've never gotten to a point of craving a burger so bad that I'd goto the nearest McDs. ?However, I've gotten to the point of craving BBQ bad enough to stop by Roadside. ?About a year ago on my way to D&A Cafe I saw Roadside and was INITIALLY overjoyed at the presence of a BBQ place in the RIchmond District. ...then I actually tried their food... ? Call me spoiled for growing up in Oakland when Flint's used to have a line out their door, or for visiting Austin a year ago, or even my LA to SF stopover at Willow Ranch, but Roadside was a major disappointment. ?Kudos to them for location, cleanliness, and side dishes. ?(Sweet potato fries, cornbread) My definition of a "Good" BBQ is a sauce that you'd want to get a straw for it to drink it separately and then dump it all over the meat that's supposed to melt in your mouth. ?Their meat is closer to jerky meat, and even with 3 choices of sauce...no thanks!!!

On my route to work everyday, I always pass by Roadside BBQ. ?So when it was first being remodeled, I was probably one of the first to even know about this place. ? So you know I've been wanting to try it for a long while but something always held me back. ?One, of course was that the reviews here on Yelp were underwhelming and I do trust the Yelp community quite a bit when it comes to food. ? But I did have to try for myself and I finally did. ?There were just too many things wrong for me to even give it a 3 Star Rating. ?We tried their Ribs, Mac and Cheese, Hot Link, fries and cornbread and I'll give you my opinions on each of the items. ? First, the ribs. ?The flavor was not there. ?It was really, really bland. ?No sauce could fix it. ?Not even any award winning sauce from a BBQ expert. ?There was just no taste in the meat. ?The texture was not there. ?My personal opinion is that ribs should have a seared exterior and then the meat being real tender and fall off the bone on the inside. ?I'll admit, it may not be the easiest thing to do but if you are a BBQ restaurant, you should be able to get it somewhat right. ?The BBQ sauce was average as well. ?But like I said, even if the BBQ Sauce was Top Notch, there really is no excuse for tasteless meat in a BBQ Joint. ? The Hot Link was actually the only thing that was okay and decent. ?So if you do choose to come back here, I'd say get a Hot Link. ? The Fries, well let's just say I've had better. ? The Mac and Cheese also was tasteless and the texture also was not right. ?It was too soggy and I've tasted a lot better mac and cheese at restaurants, friends parties, packaged ones from the store. ?I can't say that I've had other mac and cheese that underperformed like this one. ? The Corn Bread was small, the texture was not good. ?It seemed like is was old and not fresh. ?For Good Corn Bread, you can't beat Hard Knox. ? Everything came out cold as well. ?That probably added to the reason the food was not good. ?I think it's fine if the ribs are premade and they just need to reheat it but they really need to make their food piping hot when it reaches the customer. ?Everything tastes better when it is piping hot. I'd say if you do HAVE to try this place for yourself, order it to go, get ready to add some flavoring to the meat from your seasonings at home and either put the food in your oven or microwave to make it piping hot, then Serve.....

Its a little pricey for what you get, but I'm still a fan. ?Their sides are all pretty good, sweet potato fries/mac and cheese being my personal faves. ?I've gotten the roadside shiners several times and I never really know why I keep getting them, because they are pretty dry. ?I guess when you cover them in any of their delicious bbq sauces, its good no matter what. ? I tried the pulled pork sandwich last night and I'm totally sold. ?Whether or not the pulled pork was the best ever, the Kaiser roll ?was unbelievably soft with a perfect crispy top crust. ?The bread definitely made the sandwich, but the mustard medley and asian ginger bbq sauce gave it cred too. ? nom

Whenver I order ribs, I want to love them. ?I mean friggin LOVE them. ?Anytime I go willingly against my own long-term health interests I really want a pay off for the short term. ?That wasn't to happen here. I didn't love the food here, but I liked it. ?We ordered take out. ?They have a pretty expansive menu complete with any number of artery clogging dlicacies. ?I ordered ribs with mac n cheese, and french fries. ?Everything was very good. ?I like the meat to just fall off the bones when I'm eating ribs, and so I have a preference for a different rib prepatation than how they do it. ?Still, the ribs were good. ?The service was speedy. ?The sauce was good -- I got the hot sauce which wasn't very hot at all. ?To finish it off, we split a slice of pecan pie--which was very good. ?I'd order from there again.

No idea what all the hate on Yelp is about, but Roadside BBQ is among the best in the city. Their ribs are pretty awesome, sides are better than most others', and the portions are just right. Everytime I come back I get the same thing (because it's so damn good) but I'd like to try the beef brisket or pulled pork one of these days. Easy 5 from me!

I'd been craving bbq for a while and finally stopped off at Roadside on my way home. Really wanted to like this place, but the food was aweful. I got the pulled pork sandwich, which I didn't even finish and my friend had the baby back ribs, which were even worse than my sandwich. Tossed everything and ordered Thai food. ? Will never ever go back.

I've seen roadside bbq before many times driving on geary, but never really considered this as a go-to bbq joint due to its initial appearance as a chain restaurant with its exterior. Finally we decided to try this place and get some take out to enjoy at home. Items ordered: pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and beef brisket. Sides: corn muffin, mac and cheese, sweet potato fries, etc. I can honestly say that for all these items, "eh" and I've had better. Let me start by saying that the pulled pork sandwich was probably the best out of the three entree items. But disappointing was the fact that none of the meat seemed to have any flavoring or seasoning, and they expect you to douse the meat with bbq sauce, which i did not care for at all. I'm more partial to a sweeter bbq sauce, but the one here just seemed to be spicy. If you're going to have any type of bbq besides memphis dry rub, your sauce better be awesome if the meat has no seasoning. *Shaking my head* bottomline, in my opinion, this is not good bbq. about the same taste as costco or safeway ribs. i'm sorry, but i can find another place to spend $20 on a full rack of ribs.

I'm from Atlanta and picked Roadside after reading many reviews of other places. I also am a little stunned by the plethora of negative reviews this little joint got. I'm a southern BBQ (Memphis & Carolina, I don't discriminate) kind of guy and my expectations are high. If I'm going to compare BBQ to BBQ, why wouldn't I rank this place against the true BBQ of the South that I'm used to. That's a retorical question. I would. And in this case Roadside holds it own. The sauces are excellent, the pulled pork was very good and the garlic fries were also awesome. Corn muffins were sweet and had the perfect texture. The ribs were OK, not excellent, but not bad at all either. The fact that ?they had sweet tea is huge. However, it's hard to compare real sweet tea from the south with here in San Francisco. It left a little to be desired. The only real downside to this great BBQ place is the platter size, which is very small. I ate 3 orders of meat (2 pulled pork and 1/4 ribs) and was still a little hungry afterwards. However, I will def be back again!

My friend, who happens to be a fellow Tennessean, took me here for a late, 2 months late, birthday dinner. He swore up and down that this was the best BBQ he's ever eaten. Meh. We both ordered the pulled pork platter. We sat at one of their comfy booths. This place is clean. Highly impressed. Maybe it's because it's in the Richmond District??? Anywho, service was great. Got our food right away. The pork was very tender, but lacked flavor. I had to add a lot of the spicy BBQ sauce (deeelish by the way) to the pork. I got a side of veggies that were buttered perfectly, and another side of garlic fries that were crispy and not too overpowering. It was great. The cornbread, on the other hand! Another reviewer described it perfectly. It was the size of a silver dollar! AND it was DRY! Gag! Sides were good, pork was tender, but mediocre, cornbread, pass.

The 2010 7x7 Big Eat SF Pulled- Pork Sandwich with a side of mash potatoes Take out Decor- Clean, spacious, orderly. Plenty of seating. Location- Hard to find parking thus take out Staff - All of them were behind the counter. Very friendly and funny. Food - Everything was tasty and went well with each other. I loved the bread. I am a huge fan of the bread. The mash potatoes were good too. Definitely won't mind coming back and actually eating it there.

The reason why I first entered the restaurant? Freezing your ass off outside and watching people munch on ribs and mac n' cheese has that effect on you. And then the angels started singing, I saw the headline "Bay Area Bargains" on their window. I entered and looked at the prices. Not such a bargain. Service was friendly though, the restaurant was on the cold side. I think they only thing they use to heat the place is the stovetops they were using in the kitchen, ESPECIALLY when the door opened and gusts of wind blew in. Freeeeeezing. As for the food, it was okay. I've had better. The pulled pork was tough, the ribs were lacking in flavor so don't come here for their meat, but their sides were absolutely delish! Corn bread from scratch, creamy mac n' cheese, sweet potato fries, garlic fries? MMMMMMMMMMM I'd go back just for the sides. Hell, come to think of it, I just might make a trip now... *door shuts*

Me and my friend were scouring for BBQ on a Sunday afternoon and this place rightfully hit the spot. There's a decent variety of choices, between meats (chicken, ribs and brisket), sides and how you want it - sandwich or plate meal. I ordered the beef ribs, which were big and tender, if a bit bland in some spots. ?I didn't try any of the sauces, which I will next time. The mac 'n cheese was a tasty and hearty side. ?The coleslaw was not a mayo-based side - I think it's vinegar-based. ?It's okay. ?There's plenty of other sides to try next time. I didn't find anything wrong with the service at all. ?There was enough good in the meal for me to try it again some time.

I've always seen this spot but wasn't intrigued to coming here until I saw #85 from the 7x7 top sf 100 things to try before you die which i've been using as my bible. ?i tried the memphis pulled pork sandwich which i thought was pretty good. ?they used a type of kaiser roll which really made the sandwich. ?and i ordered the mac & cheese for my side - just ok. ? the true test was when my bf ordered the "big guy" - any 3 meats - he requested 2 orders of brisket (his fave) and an order of ribs. ?his order was a rip off for $18.95. ?in the 2 orders of brisket he got 5 slices which is more like 1 order in TX. ?they claim it's weighed by oz - rmfe (roll me f'in eyes). ?he chose sides of potato salad & baked beans - both average. ?the corn bread that was a mini mini muffin - bite size - just ok. ?overall this is 3 star kinda place. ?i don't need to come back - been there done that. however, 4 stars for some true country music.

Mmm... I like. Did the $22.95 for a full rack of ribs, two pint sized sides, and two cornbreads. Rack of ribs = Good. Tender. Could be more tender. Good rub. Sides: Sweet Potato Fries = O.K. Not as good as the ones from Pacific Catch. Need to be sweeter. Nice crispiness though. Mac&Cheese = Deeelicious. Some of the best mac&cheese I've ever had. Cornbread: Too small. Very tasty! Wish they were bigger! BBQ sauce: The original was my favorite. Spicy in second. Wish they weren't so cold. I like my sauces somewhere between warm and hot. Overall, good deal and tasty food for two!

Came here on a Monday night and it was very empty...sometimes this place is packed, and other times its really empty. ? I decided to share an order of pulled pork sandwich + garlic fries with a friend - total for both of us was around $10. Its ok, not too expensive, but not cheap. The fries were ok, but it can be a little thicker. There sandwich is a little dry. I loaded the moisture through the sauces that they have on the side. The sauce is really what makes the sandwich great, although thats also what makes it messy. ? The service was great! The guys were very nice and had our order out very quickly. They were even attentive enough to give us an extra plate without us asking (since we were sharing),. ? One big downside for me is all the animal stuff around. Its unnerving to be eating a pulled pork sandwich with a metal pig staring at you.

Yum Yum! I get the Meaty Potato With the deisciously smoked Beef Brisket; so tender it melts in your mouth. I like to get a side of the roadside veggies, which is a lightly stirfryed medley of fresh veggies; ?broccoli, green beans, jjuienned carrots and zucchini, with corn that has been freshly cut off the cob. I like to mix the two together.....throw on some of the mustard slather, or Asian BBQ sauce...and enjoy! I have tried their sandwiches...and they are ok. The Ribs are yummy. Their chicken is really tasty too. All heir sides look really enticing, however i have only had the sweet potato fires which are good. Reasonably priced for BBQ. Don't forget....go for the loaded meaty potato! definitely the best bang for your buck and sooo soo tasty!

I was a little eager to try this place since I pass by it all the time and it's easy on my wallet. I'd tried the Memphis Pulled Pork Sandwich--Slow-cooked and served lean and tender. Served "Memphis Style" --topped w/ homemade cole slaw. The Memphis Pull Pork Sandwich was the item to try on the list. The bread is very soft, and the pulled pork was tender but not too flavorful. I had to add some BBQ sauce to enhanced the flavor. There is a bit of cole slaw in the sandwich but I felt like it would taste better if there are more. If only they add more cole slaw for the extra crunch, because otherwise, I felt like I am eating a sloppy joe but of course, with better meat. I also tried the Smoked BBQ Chicken--Marinated, seasoned and slowly cooked for 4 hours until tender and juicy. The chicken was just okay...it was a bit dry. Other than the skin, the meat was not very flavorful. The vegetables on the other hand was very moist with grilled flavor. The corn bread broke apart very easily and was too soft to my likely. I was a little disappointed with the BBQ meat there, but at least they have a couple of BBQ sauces to choose from--spicy one, honey mustard, etc. I think I would only go back convienent-wise, otherwise I'll go elsewhere.

The review is based strictly on take out, so I don't know how good (or bad) the place is inside. We had only about an hour left before the flight and our friends grabbed loads of food from this place. It was definitely decent, though it was not that great of BBQ. The fries were a bit soggy and the pulled pork was a little dry, but it was still decent....

People in SF bemoan the lack of good BBQ places, so I am on a quest to try all the ones in that category to find the winner and Roadside BBQ has been on my radar for a while. I've heard it's good, great, mediocre, but there is only one way to find out how it really is, so one night I went there with my family for a casual dinner of meat'n'stuff. Roadside is similar to other BBQ restaurants (like Memphis Minnie's) in that you order at the counter and then get a seat and they bring the food to you. I ordered the brisket sandwich -to check off another thing from 7x7 Big Eats 2009 list -while my family opted for a meat combo of ribs, chicken, as well as the pulled pork sandwich. Roadside also has a decent selection of American beers in the bottle and I chose Lagunitas IPA to accompany the meal. The food arrived really quickly. I asked when ordering if the sandwiches could be cut in half, and they were happy to accommodate. The servers also made a couple of extra trips to the table to check on us and bring us extra hot sauce and things like that. Everyone was really friendly and helpful, which contributed to the enjoyment of the meal. The food itself was fairly good, but not great. The brisket sandwich was flavorful, but somewhat tough. The ribs were bit dry and not as tender as at some other places. We wished there was a good, spicy BBQ sauce to put on the meat, but alas, the sauces there were not what were looking for, since they were more on the sweet side. In a nutshell: decent BBQ, great service. I'll probably stop by again after I try their competitors in the city.

It's BBQ. With a Southern flare. ?I came down here with one of my old college buddies, since we figured we could get a good helping of meat while we caught up. When it comes to this kind of BBQ, the status quo is a little place back in Texas called Rudy's. ?Not surprisingly, this place just didn't quite come up to muster. For some down-home country bbq grubbin', we used to go to Rudy's. ?The meat was served on wax paper, placed in big plastic trays. ?They gave us lots of sliced bread. The idea is to pile on some meat onto the bread, slop on some of Rudy's BBQ Sause (spelled with an "s"), and gobble it down. Plates not necessary, and utensils only used for side dishes. Roadside seemed to get some of this right, having large portions with sides. ?The brisket was very fatty, which usually means it was tender and tasty. ? Maybe I'm used to getting slightly leaner brisket but this was just too much fat. ?And where was the bread? ?Maybe Californians just do it different. ?But if that's the case, don't call it Texas BBQ, or have any menu items mention Texas. ?Maybe that's what threw me. ?Or it was the decor. I also would have liked more gravy on my mashed potatoes. ?And less blackened corn on my corn-on-the-cob. ?Seriously, did they leave the corn on the grill all day? If you're going there anyway, get the sweet tea. ?Theat was one redeeming quality. ?I hear the Pulled Pork was really good, too. So I might go back for that. ?Although when you think BBQ, the only options should generally be some sort of beef or pork ribs. ?There's really no reason to eat any other animal, because then you're just wasting valuable space on the grill. Three stars for willing to come back to try another item on the menu. Also because the sweet tea was good.

:( How excited was I that a BBQ bistro opened in the Richmond? ?It took 3 visits to Roadkill for me to get over my fervent hope that this place will serve me up some good ribs, chicken and brisket. ?The first pang of worry came when I could not smell the smoker a block away, then 50 feet away, and still couldn't smell it at the doorstep. ?Maybe all those warm, mouthwatering, inviting BBQ aromas are being ventilated elsewhere, I thought to myself. ?But... but those smells sell so... why, WHY would they do that? Could it be that their smoker... sucks? ARGH! ?What a disappointment. ?BBQ'd food in which smoky-ness is a light flavor is NOT FOR THE WIN. Ribs: ?two elements can be used to determine good, smoker-cooked ribs: does the meat fall off the bone or does the meat come cleanly off the bone. *harsh buzzer noise* Roadhouse produces neither. If you enjoy biting the meat off a rib until threads are stuck between all your front teeth then maybe you'll like these ribs. They do offer plenty of toothpicks. Brisket: ?It is dry. ?It is gray. ?Slices are cut thicker than usual for a BBQ brisket. It is... almost without flavor. ?It is okay if you slather on one of their sauces. Chicken breast: ?moist. ?I wish I could think of some clever adjective to offer you the up-side of their chicken but after careful cogitation the only one I can come up with is "unmemorable". The sides: ?decent corn muffins and mac. ?That's a compliment! ?The coleslaw is just awful and should be carefully scraped to the edge of your plate unless you enjoy a dry slaw that tastes vaguely of vinegar and celery seed. The sauces: ?a very good selection of savory and sweet sauces (some hot, some not) to pour over your meats. ?You'll want lots of sauce to compensate for the lack of smoke flavor and the lack of bold spice rubbed onto the meats. The sauces are a highlight of an otherwise disappointing and flavor-void experience. Roadhouse surely has a smoker somewhere in their restaurant or hidden in some nearby building - ?they have a picture of it on the website and we all know that 'teh intarwebz' never lie. ?But wherever their smoker is or however it works, it aint doing it's job IMO! Pass on this place.

ok after trying several of the items over the past few months i felt it was time to review the place. For those that love this place, i truly feel sorry for you, maybe its because i grew up in a redneck -okie - down home kind of place but this is truly a poor attempt at bbq. It seems to maybe have potential, but the majority of the meats seem to be bland. The brisket was far to dry, the pulled pork was well overly liquid laden and seemed to have been left on for a bit to long. There should be some sort of texture to it, not turn into paste as you chew. Hot link, well you can't really go wrong although it was dry, again timing in the smoker. The ribs, mediocre at best. The sides, umm well the mac and cheese was very dry, almost paste like and little flavor. Mashed taters, ok, you could tell they were made with real potatoes, but thats about it. Slaw, pretty standard nothing to write home about. Red beans, umm again not alot of flavor, and very pasty, its been on the stove too long and no liquids have been added to replace those lost by steam. either that or they add a ton of corn starch to thicken everything up. ?Cornbread, umm ok so when and where in bbq does a haute cuisine size button belong on the plate? These dont seem to age well, if not right out of the oven, absolutely horrible, if fresh they are not too bad. As for the portion size vs cost. They have these articles on the wall written by i dont know who but they claim that roadside bbq is affordable blah blah blah. NOT. I've prolly been to well over one hundred, thats right ONE HUNDRED different bbq joints. these have to be the smallest portions of anywhere. I tried one of the stuffed meaty potatoes, lol. ok gigantic potato, a smidgen of meat and some other stuff, completely unsatisfactory. There are fast food places that have better stuffed potatoes. ? Maybe the owners/cooks should try and travel out of the city and try some real bbq, then they might realize what they are missing. The bbq sauce, sweet tea, banana pudding/nilla wafer thing, and the music are all good. So far i havent found a good bbq joint in the city. Any suggestions? I'm tired of spending 20 bucks on a five dollar portion of mediocre meat.

I was looking forward to a quick bite to eat here before getting to a museum exhibit on a Friday night. ?The smell permeating the restaurant didn't disappoint . . . smoky and hunger inducing. ? But then . . . badness. ?There were maybe two groups of people in front of me to order. ?And it took at least 20 minutes for me to get to the front. ?Because the guy at the register took one group's order. ?Then he took a phone call. ?Then he took five minutes to input the phone order. ?Then he took another group's order . . . you get the idea. ?It took a ridiculously long time, and I'm pretty patient when it comes to waiting in line. ?But when it's an establishment that takes counter orders and there are only 4 people in front of me, I expect it to be a little faster. ?The man at the register may have been new, but honestly, it's their bad for having a newbie at the register during Friday night dinner rush. At least after being completely annoyed by the inexplicable lag in service, the food came out quick and was pretty good. ?Pulled pork sandwich was really juicy. ?I wouldn't go out of my way to go back though.

I need to start off by saying when it comes to BBQ i am picky! I feel that when it comes to the grill, I would rather fire up my own and make it at home. I enjoy the smell as its cooking, the change of the food from plain to flamed! When it came time to try #85.Pulled-pork sandwich, I pulled the trigger only because I was in the neighborhood.... Sort of... I won't bore you with the details of getting to and from because that is a whole other story. I get to Roadside and there is a decent crowd. I took a minute to survey the scene... Everything looked pretty good from what I could gather... I order the pulled pork with a side of sweet potato fries, Potato Salad, and corn bread. I also ordered the chicken tenders and fries, (for the wife). The pulled pork was ok. The pork was pretty tender but lacking in flavor. I think of pulled pork soaking in BBQ sauce for hours. Not drizzled with some sauces, but thats just me. ?Roadside, you get the third star for your "Sweet/Spicy" sauce... Hot Damn! I soaked the rest of my sandwich in that and it took that sandwich to another level. The cornbread definitely hit my list of top favorites! It was so good, my wife ate most of it lol... The potato salad was ok. I am secretly on the quest for the tastiest potato salad, unfortunately this won't make my top ten list. The chicken tenders were ok. Nothing too exciting, but they weren't bad or anything like that. Again, the Sweet/Spicy what incredible!!! I love a good sauce and this one will stick in my mind for a while!!!

I've driven by a million times and kept saying to myself, "I'm gonna try that place next time." Well, I finally made it! Came here with a group of friends and we got the family pack, which is an excellent deal. We each paid about $8 between the 7 of us and got stuffed. - BBQ Ribs: yummm, tender and the dry rub was good. the bbq sauce was just OK - BBQ Chicken: it looked dry, but quite the opposite - juicy. the dark meat was much better than the white, but both were good - Mac & Cheese: okay nothing special - Beans: a bit sweet but good - Salad: nothing special

Came here with my friends who are doing the 7x7 Big Eats in SF, this is one of em - pulled pork sandwich. Yum! If you read any three words of my review, read this: SPICY BBQ SAUCE. It makes everything 100x better than it already is. I poured it all in my sandwich and dipped each fry like 3 times... my sandwich was leaking pork juices but that's ok, it means it's real meat. =P It was messy, but delicious. Garlic fries are really garlic-y, no cheaping out there. By the end, I was stuffed, reeking of garlic, and my stomach up to my esophagus and my oropharynx were all burning a nice warm fire due to the spicy sauce. SO GOOD. I want more!!!

Having recently moved to the area and an avid BBQ fan I just had to try this place and I am sure glad that I did. ?I tried the "Texas Two Step" starter that had a Memphis pulled pork sandwiched that was lean and well seasoned and had a great smokey flavor. ?The plate also came with Texas brisket was just as good as the pork. ?I also had the French Fries which were cooked to order and nicely done; crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. ?The place was clean and well kept, and the staff was attentive and intuitive. ?I will come back to this place for sure!

First off, I slightly prefer Memphis Minnie's because their Carolina sauces are sooo damn good. ?But, this place doesn't disappoint -- it is a close second. ?My only complaint about their pulled pork is that there isn't enough of it! ?You can also pretend you're eating healthy by ordering a side of green vegetables. ? The interior decor is clean, but you will still smell like BBQ for the rest of the day if you eat here. Overall, it is a fine addition to the Inner Richmond.

I wasn't impressed. Your slightly better than average BBQ place. First time in there I tried the brisket plate. Brisket, fries and coleslaw. Brisket was cooked wonderfully, seasoned pretty good, nothing to write home about but pretty good. I dig into the coleslaw and instantly get attacked by the black pepper brigade. I don't know if it was a bad day or something but there was way to much pepper in the cole slaw. The fries were delicious, perfectly seasoned and cooked. Second try I get a pulled pork sandwich with fries. Again, it was alright, I expected more flavor from a PP sandwich. There spicy BBQ sauce does not have any spice to it at all. Both BBQ sauces are way to sweet for my palette.

Let's preface this with the fact that I grew up in Atlanta. I know BBQ and soul food inside and out. Like finding great sushi or Mexican food in Atlanta, it's about as likely as finding good 'Q out here. Most simply, I've yet to find it (other than what I make at home, although I am constantly hearing about how it's possible to find it in Oakland). So, I went to Roadside with very low expectations, which was good because I was not disappointed. The sauces (including the "NC vinegar", which at first had me a bit excited) were completely uncreative and unauthentic. The babyback ribs weren't any better than what they sling at a Chili's or TGI Friday's. I'll give credit for a pretty decent attempt at Southern-style mac 'n' cheese, though. It's the best I've had in the seven years I've lived in NorCal. Otherwise, it looks like I'm just gonna have to stick to my "ain't tellin'" recipes for when I need a good plate of 'Q.

So there I was at the J.C.C. working out, and for reasons I still don't understand I started feeling yucky - as in a cold sweat. I wasn't having a heart attack, I knew that. It was weird. And what came to mind as I was contemplating my not-feeling-so-goodness. I'll stop by Roadside BBQ on the way home and knock whatever this thing is out of my body. And so I did, and I feel 82.6% better. And no I wasn't hallucinating. I don't think. R.B.B.Q. has been added to my standard places that I do takeout on my way home from the gym, or a meeting. It's not a go out of my way destination and for good reason. Sideline: MY HISTORY WITH B.B.Q. What does a Jewish boy from NYC know about 'Q? (Stick to pizza and pastrami and bagels and street vendor pretzels right?) Wrong! You see Alan Starr and I have a tradition the first night of the South-by-Southwest Music Festival in Austin, TX. We pig out on BBQ at the Ironworks (which we think is better than the Salt Lick despite the ratings.) So, what constitutes good BBQ? Well in the case of the Ironworks it's eating it next to indie rock stars, the availability of Shiner Boch, and endless paper towels! Oh, and the meat and sauce are good too. What I'm sayin' is: BBQ isn't Coq au Vin. Or even sushi. It's PERSONAL TASTE. The scoop on the Roadside (yes, he is FINALLY getting to the subject at hand.) Corn Muffin: Fair to middlin' at best, it tastes okay though. Ribs: Had them a second time tonight - and well, I crave the ribs at the Buckeye Roadhouse, and this ain't them. Chicken: Just fine. Veggies: Really delish. Mashed Potatoes - okey dokey. The sauce (I'm not one for the hot variety.): Lacks distinction. So, why am I giving them four stars? For effort, gosh golly jeepers! Because the place is clean, the service is friendly, and heck - did you really expect to find killer B.B.Q. on Geary? (If so, go back to Start and collect 500 points just to make yourself feel good.) Roadside has soul because they try hard, they are pretty fast, and when I can't get to Austin (sorry, Brothers, uh, Lilly's never knocked me out - despite it's "authenticity." So, they get four stars for that. If you want gourmet chicken, or ribs, or brisket, that ain't in the B.B.Q. department folks. (Oh and feel free to critique my alternate use of BBQ and B.B.Q., I just get lazy sometimes with those darn periods y'all.)

Once upon a Friday night I was hanging out with a former co-worker, now friend, in the city. ?Being in the Inner Richmond district, I was not in the know of what was around except for nearby Japantown. ?We opted out of Asian cuisine and decided to have some good old Americana fare. ?My friend suggested Roadside BBQ and it seemed like a great idea. ?Neither of us have been to this spot before so it was a new dining experience. Upon walking in, I noticed a sign that read "Wood-Smoked meats." ?I'm thinking this place is on to something -- most BBQ spots today either liquid smoke their meat or they just cook the meat and slap on the Que sauce. ?Now i'm intrigued. ?I take a few minutes to study the menu, there was a line of 4 people in front of me and decide upon a two way combo. ?For a reasonable price of $14.95, I had a choice of any two smoked meats, two sides, and a corn muffin. ?It was a touch choice between the Chicken, Beef Ribs, Baby Back Ribs, brisket, pulled pork, or spicy chicken sausage. ?You normally don't see beef ribs so I decided to try that. ?I also chose the beef brisket. ?For my sides, I decided to have the mac and cheese and their sweet potato fries. I must say that my combo was off the hook! ?The portions size was big and I didn't feel like I was over charged. ?The brisket was very tender and juice and the beef ribs were very flavorful. ?You can seriously taste the wood smoked flavor - very smokey, spicy, sweet, and salty. ?MMM. ?The sides were very good too; the mac and cheese was creamy and melty while the sweet potato fries were crunchy and salted just right. Roadside BBQ also offers several different types of sauce -- asian ginger infused bbq sauce - sweet and gingery. ?Regular bbq - smokey and not too sweet, hot smokey bbq - like the regular but with jalepeno so it's a bit chunky. ?All the sauces were good. I really wasn't sure what to expect walking into Roadside BBQ but I left fully satisfied.

So, I go here all the time. ?We usually order to go because parking can be a pain. ?This area has too many tasty restaurants and not enough street parking! ?They have a small staff but are super friendly, even when they get really busy. ?And I can bring kids here! ?They like the food AND the environment is suitable. ?Thank you, thank you. I put that they're price range is moderate, but it really depends on your appetite. ?I've managed to get outta there a few times for under $10. ?This is one of my favorite things about this place-- you can get something to snack on or a feast if you're starving. ?There are so many choices! ?For example, their rib orders come in 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, or a full rack of ribs and you order the same way with chicken. ?The roadside veggies have all the good grilled veggies and none of the bad ones (broccoli, carrots, zucchini, corn). ?Good sides, good desserts, a variety ofdifferent bbq sauces to choose from-- we love it. ?I'm a huge fan of the sweet potato fries and love the loaded baked potato with chicken. ?If they hadn't messed up my order Friday night (for the first time ever) I would probably be ordering it right now, this review is bringing back some delicious memories.

My boyfriend went here and since he doesn't have an account this is his experience: He ordered the "Big Guy" that cost him $22. The mashed potatoes tasted like the instant kind, Beef brisket was overcooked, the ribs had no smoke ring and didn't taste like much, pulled pork was okay but not something he would order again, he said the cornbread was okay but has made better himself (he makes good cornbread), and the mac and cheese was probably the best part. We went to the Best of the West Rib Cook-off in Sparks, NV so he has a lot to compare this too. So overall this place sucks.

I got a smoked turkey leg with two sides for $10. The mashed potatoes were the best thing about the meal. Not a good start. The turkey leg was good, but pretty flavorless. It was basically just meat. Plain, tasteless meat. Mac and cheese was passable but a little dry. Corn Muffin was both tiny, and very cold. Almost as if it had been sitting around for hours. Look into the kitchen. Oh that's why, it had been sitting in the kitchen for hours. Maybe it's because i BBQ a lot myself, but this place didn't cut it at all.

The meat was just alright. Disappointing for a BBQ place. I split the Q2 with brisket, pulled pork, and pork ribs with some friends. It wasn't bad. Slap a generous helping of the tasty BBQ sauce and it was pretty good. But I've definitely had better BBQ. If I had a group of friends and we were in the neighborhood I wouldn't object to going here, but I don't know that I would recommend either. For the good - the service and staff are super nice. Really friendly! They even gave us an extra cornbread so each of us could have our own (there was 3 of us and the Q2 comes with 2 pieces of cornbread). But the real surprise. The grilled corn on the cob is really good. I'm talking REALLY good. I would absolutely make a pit stop here just to get the grilled corn on the cob.

My provisional 3-star rating (an upgrade is in the cards) is only a place holder until I go back and further explore Roadside's menu. ?In the interim, allow me to write that Roadside BBQ was a pleasant surprise. ?Imagine, a very good BBQ nearer my home than Big Nates. ?As I do whenever I eat at a BBQ joint for the first time, I ordered the combination plate; actually the BIG GUY combination plate. ? Baby back ribs, pulled pork and, menu-newcomer, beef ribs was the call and all were accompanied with 2 sides of coleslaw. Roadside versus Nates is a dry-rub barbecue and the smoky flavour and taste was offered and delivered. The coleslaw was not for me in as much as Roadside was over generous in their application of vinegar to the recipe. I will without any doubt go back to eat more of their delicious ribs, try the brisket and sample a few more sides to determine if the coleslaw is simply an aberration or Roadside is a BYOS (bring your own salad) kinda place.

Meh is right. The only reason I came in here was to knock another off the 7x7 list. I don't understand why the pulled pork sandwich was on the list. I mean, it's OK, but really? One of the hundred best things in the city? Nahhhh.... The bun is tasty, but the lack of 1. meat and 2. flavor in the meat was surprising. The slaw on it was too chunky, and I am pretty sure there was more slaw than meat. The bottom of the bun was completely soggy from the sauce. We also got a side of sweet potato fries, which too were soggy. The service is friendly, the place is clean and well kept, but there isn't much that would bring me back.

After 20 odd years of an on-again, off-again college career, I've finally graduated. Hooray for me!!! So, L, now what're you going going to do? Well, I'm not going to Disneyland (sadly), so I guess I'll just... get BBQ? OMGWTFBBQ!!! That's just what I did... with five of my friends... and it was good! We were starving so we started off with some garlic and sweet potato fries while we waited for everyone to arrive. We all got a combo plate and almost everyone had the beef brisket (which I thought was delicious, but had a tad more fat on it than I'm used to seeing.) I also had the chicken which was super fall-off-the-bone succulent! I have no idea what my friends thought about their plates - there was an order of ribs, pulled pork, a pulled pork sandwich, and spicy chicken sausage - but I didn't hear any complaints, so that's good, right? I was the only one who still had room for dessert so I took a slice of the coconut banana cream pie home with me. I definitely recommend getting at least a sliver of this magical mouthful of heaven. First of all, why should anyone have to choose between banana cream or coconut cream pie? Combining them is brilliant! But then... but then... wait! It gets better! Then, there's a hidden layer of chocolate over the crust! OMG! Fer reals.

Roadside is good. I've had their pulled pork, shiners, ribs, and brisket. Of those four, I would recommend the shiners (great texture) and the pulled pork. In terms of sides, I had the garlic fries (really good but sprinkled with a ton of paprika) and grilled corn. Oh, and the corn muffins were good, too.

Hey, this is decent BBQ, especially for the City. I like the moistness of the pulled pork and its pervasive smokiness. They have fantastic smoked chicken, too -- a slightly unusual BBQ item that I'm glad I finally tried. Even the chicken tenders on the kid's menu are good! My favorite aspect of Roadside is the fact that their plates are actually fairly well-balanced. I always get enough veggies along side the meat to make eating here an event that doesn't feel like it will kill me if I indulge in it more than once a year.

This is not it for good ribs. Ribs were dry and not tender. Kitschy interior; the whole place feels like an imposter though, not "roadside" enough, too purposeful. And hello, where's the baked beans? It's like this, if you don't have baked beans, you better have something so good that I forget that I want baked beans. I still want baked beans. And I want my ribs cooked a little longer. It will do if you're too lazy to get out of the Richmond district, but I'd rather spend a little more money and time and go get some real southern cooking elsewhere.

I love this place. Finally, a casual BBQ joint without fatty ribs located in SF, and in my neighborhood no less. The Memphis dry rub is awesome, and the spicy chicken sausage is delicious too. I will go back again for the BBQ chicken soon! They also offer a good selection of different sides like corn on the cob, red beans, sweet potato fries, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, other stuff too and the plates all come with a corn muffin. Yummy! I am getting hungry just writing about it. Addendum: I have been back to Roadside many times to get the pulled pork platter, and for some reason I keep ordering it over and over again. It's addicting!

I REALLY love meat. ?Their chicken is ok but a little dry, and while I love the fact that their brisket it lean, it too is a tad dry. ?However, the ribs are fabulous and the pulled pork is TO DIE FOR! ?Especially with the yummy hot vinegar they have. ?The corn muffins are good, as are their other sides, but I'd skip the veggies next time - they weren't bad, but they didn't scream "eat me" like they should have. ?The main reason I can't give them 5 stars - they don't have greens. ?In my humble opinion, BBQ and greens go together like BBQ and beer, or like BBQ and fire, or like BBQ and meat... you get the picture? ?So Roadside, if you're listening, some collard greens cooked with a ham bone and some onions would get you that 5th star I'm holding onto. ?

The first time my husband picked up some food from this place for me I thought it was the worst BBQ there was. He ?order ?babybacks, smoked chicken, and garlic fries. The best one was the fries but everthing else was terrible. So the other night I drove down Geary looking for dinner for hubby and the guys I saw Roadside BBQ pretty busy and thought I give it another try. Must of circle the long block like fifteen times until I gave up and block a drive to run in and order my food. I got some babybacks,pulled pork, beef ribs, and garlic fries. I didn't order the chicken cause that nasty taste is still stuck to my head. The pulled pork was o.k and every thing else was the same. The fries didn't taste as good as before. I don't think I'll ever gonna come back anymore. Don't like to be disapointed too many times.

I have to say first that I'm not a big BBQ fan. I've had my share of BBQ in Texas and elsewhere and it is good, but it just doesn't suit my palate. We all had the pulled pork sandwich and various sides. The sauces were quite good here and I love that they had a grilled veggies side. I would definitely go back since it was cheap, but again it's not my favorite type of food to eat.

My friend and I each ordered the pulled pork sandwich after deciding to try something on 2010 Big Eat SF 7x7 list. ?http://www.7x7.com/2010-… ? I got a side of grilled corn and he got sweet potato fries. ? They make the sandwiches super fast so come hungry and ready to dive in. ?The sandwich was bursting with pork, but the bun was too soggy and greasy. ?The meat was tender, but lacked flavor. ?I had to slather on BBQ sauce after each bite to fully enjoy the meal. ?I wish there was more of a texture contrast b/c the bun was soft and so was the meat. ?More cole slaw would be great in this sandwich. The grilled corn and sweet potato fries were well-seasoned, but nothing mind-blowing. Not quite sure why this sandwich made the list...I think it's going to be tough beating BStar Bar's pulled pork sammie which has so much flavor, additional sauce is not needed.

Okay so I am no BBQ expert, I will admit that but here is my take on Roadside. When they first opened they were very good, recently (such as tonight) not so great. I think their cooks must have changed or something. The menu is the same but the taste isn't and tonight I had an evacuation after eating within 30 minutes of the chow down. Not pretty. I do not know if the food is not to temp or what that is all about but I can just about tolerate anything even McDonalds but tonight not here. If you read my other reviews I can be an ass and I am not trying to do that here but I hope the owners are tasting the food and know what is going out because after tonight I may not hit them up for awhile. Frankly Everett and Jones in Berkeley is way better although there is a gang of attitude served with their Q. Best wishes and be sure you know where the bathrooms are at if you eat there tonight.....

Everyone has a different opinion on what a good BBQ plate should taste like. I personally think a good bbq should have smokey flavors and the meat should have been marinated prior to the day it's cooked and it should fall off the bone... Just like BUH-TUH!! Taste so good, make you wanna slap yo mama!!! This place has that!! They also got all the good ol southern sides that you would typically associate with a bbq! Their mac -n- cheese is screaming and the baked beans are also on hit!! If you are ever in the avenues off Geary street in the city and feel like getting down and dirty with some delish bbq, then make a stop at the Roadside BBQ joint!!

I ordered a quarter pound of baby back ribs and it was totally not enough. ?I should have ordered half a pound and ditched the sides. ?I got the mac and cheese and corn because they traveled well and my order was to go, but they did not hit the spot as well as the ribs did. ?The dude who works the register was super nice to me and I would definitely go back if I had another craving for ribs.

I had walked past this place quite a few times and finally went in for take out. The place looks authentic and I really wanted to like it, but I was really let down in the end. I ordered a grilled BBQ chicken sandwich with cheddar (75 cents extra) and a side of garlic fries. The sandwich had no BBQ aspects at all - luckily they had sauce to put on the side. It also had a guacamole on it that had way too much cilantro. The chicken was dry, thin, and overcooked. The fries were downright gross - they tasted like they were still frozen and they had a nasty sogginess to them. The only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because the place has awesome Texan decor and is in a city that seriously lacks this type of food, plus the staff was reasonably friendly. But Roadside sets the bar uncomfortably low. Pass.

FInally. A god damn good bbq place in San Francisco that I can actually sit down in. The meat falls off the bone, the mac & cheese is creamy, the hot links are spicy yet flavorful, and they have good sweet tea. I would seriously say this is the best BBQ place in the city. Much better than Memphis Minnies (who's meat tends to be too dry and not even compensated for by being super saucy) and much nicer than Johnson's BBQ (where I pay for my food before I eat it and then when I'm leaving the place the woman is convinced I didn't pay for it)

I think one of the best things about this place is the smoked chicken. if you are in need of good flavored chicken and do not want to buy a whole one from costco, these guys have it. i wish their ribs and other meats had a bit more "BBQ" flavor to them, and i would aggree with jason d. that this could be solved with a tweak of the prep work. i liked the clean atmosphere and the service was polite and efficient. bottom line: if you want BBQ that is healthy and still good tasting this is the place, if you want savory dripping ribs, then this isnt it

Better named ROADKILL. ?I usually test out the pork pulled sandwhich before anything else. ?If they can't make a decent one, it's a tell tale sign. The meat was dry...the bun was soggy due to some sauce that was concentrated onto the center. ?I've had really good pork sandwiches, and this one takes the cake as the worst I've had. ?The baked beans were not fully cooked!! ?And the sauce tasted strongly of too much ketchup. ? And not that it even matters since I only took one bite of the beans, but they forgot to include napkins and utensils with my to go order. ?I threw most of it away. STAY AWAY...or go and try it for yourself.

I give it one star for the sweet potato fries...they were about the only fresh thing served to me Chicken - drier than dirt. very little to no flavor baby back ribs - ok flavor, rather dry Mac n cheese- also dry cornbread...sucked. ?How can a BBQ place have bad cornbread? ? Brisket - fatty, but ok. All in all, I really wonder how long this food sat around being heated before it was served. ?Pretty much everything tasted as if it were cooked in the AM and kept warm all day until ready to serve. This food would be worth it if it were around $5, but it wasn't...it was $30+ for two meals.

This is a real BBQ place with slow cooked meats. ? Now, I must give a disclosure that having lived in Kansas City for some time in the past, I am a KC vs. Texas BBQ fan. ?I like my brisket sliced thin with bread and bbq sauce to make ad hoc sandwiches, and while Roadside has corn bread, it wasn't the same. This place is clean, family friendly, and the kids menu options are great and just the right portion for a pre-teen. BBQ sauces are a bit too tangy for my taste compared to many others I am used to. ?I prefer less vinegar, a little more smoke. Some of the dishes were excellent. (A+) ?Among these the smoked chicken, shredded port, beef ribs, corn on the cob and mac-n-cheese. Others were quite good (A-) but I have had better in other near by establishments: BBQ Brisket, Corn Bread Some of the BBQ sauces are interestesting (three mustards mix or the ginger sauce) and make a nice compliment to especially the chicken. The restaurant also has a good beer selection of different makes and styles, from the large manufacturers or small brewers. It is comfortable seating, easy enough to parking, family friendly, and decent sized portions for adults and kids. Evaluation: For good bbq with drinks with family or friends, this may be one of the best places in San Francisco For focus on the BBQ experience in a hole in the wall setting, Big Nate's is my favorite in the city PS: " Big Guy" plate where you can choose multiple options is good but you don't have to be that big of a guy to finish it up. ?I could wrap that up and desert no problem, where as the traditional BBQ join big guy plates, I would have a hard time finishing. ?This place needs a five-meats dish to really challenge the eater :)

We were really rooting for this place when it first opened and for its first six months, it was good. ?Tasty, reliable, generous portions, good service. ?I don't know what happened but it's gone way, way down hill. ?For the past FOUR times we've ordered TO GO food, they've gotten our order wrong (usually they've forgotten something). ?Also, the food is now really unpredicatable ?Some days, the brisket will be really tender and tasty, others it's dry and leathery. ? We used to see the owner there a lot in the beginning but haven't seen him in a long time ?- and it shows. ?His restaurant, and staff, need more TLC.

Very good BBQ. The sandwiches are great but of course nearly impossible to eat without them crumbling in your hands and the juice running down your cheek. Just the way it should be! :) Seriously I like the beef brisket rather than then pulled pork. The pulled pork is good but didn't have much flavor. Come to Hawaii and enjoy the "kalua pig" or go to a good Mex place and have "carnitas" and I think you would enjoy the pork more in those places. ?The fries are good. The baby back ribs looked good... maybe next time?

The brisket was good as long as it's fresh (don't get it for pick up, it wasn't as good). The pulled pork could be more flavorful. The mac and cheese was okay and could be better if they used a stronger flavored cheese. The cornbread seemed like it came from a box. The sweet potato fries were pretty damn good, but could use more salt. All in all, tasty food but not the best barbecue I have ever had. However, because of it's close location to my apartment, it's a good choice for dinner, though a little pricey for barbecue.

Just to happen to stop by for a quick bite and ordered the Pulled pork sandwich since a lot of my friends have been raving about it. I ordered to go but you can take as much bbq sauce as you want. 5 different flavors in total, my fav is the spicy bbq sauce. The sandwich comes with a choice of sides so i ordered the sweet potato fries. For some reason the edges of the fries were a bite burnt but I still ate it. So whatever you get, you must drench it in their bbq sauce.

The beginning of the story was that I came here with Sir Pirate after work on a lazy weekend. I was starving and since Sir Pirate told me he would eat some of my food, so I ordered a combo. Combo is 2 choice of meat, 2 sides and 2 mini corn bread. I ordered the ribs and chicken, sweet potato fries and veggies. The food came pretty quick and portion was HUGE (probably because it's combo). They have a good selection of interesting sauces and I tried all them. Love them all and particular the spicy one. The ribs and chicken were alright, nothing particularly impressive, probably because I'm not a big meat-eater. Like all other reviews, the sweet potato fries were GOOD. LOVE it. The grilled veggies were also good, at least I dun feel as guilty afterwards. So the ending of the story? I finished all the food by myself. Sir Pirate just nibbled on some of the veggies and fries. Everyone was amazed how a tiny asian woman can finish all the food by myself. Moral of the story: come here hungry and you'll leave happy. AND, don't ever trust the words of a pirate.

It's pretty par as far as bbq joints go in the city. My stuffed potato was pretty delicious but my friend's order of ribs looked and tasted like three bricks of overcooked cow. It's a restaurant that has the word "BBQ" in the name, how on earth do you screw up the ribs? Everything vegetarian about this place was pretty tasty, everything bbq about this place was just standard. The decor has that corny but still cute feel to it, not like you're really in a roadside bbq and the staff isn't about to act like it, so the scenery's just for chuckles. To quote Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag from the Simpsons, "If you like good food, good fun and a whole lotta crazy crap on the walls, then come on down."

I stopped by here coz the body was demanding for charcoal, mac&cheese and meat!!...Roadside BBQ is an easy choice once you live around inner richmond. I came here couple times already..all side dishes are decent. nothing blew my mind. unless people!! unless their beef brisket and spicy chicken sausage. Brisket is well-tender and flavorful. the sausage is good good but i don't know that they made it or it is package from supermarket somewhere. the bbq sauce is ok. the spicy one reminds me of Thai tamarind sauce for BBQ chicken..maybe new american bbq +san fran influence= asian flavor.The price could put you off if you didn't pay attention on the family combo options or plate of 2or 3 or 4!!! I would recommend to drive further for couple minutes and go to Memphis Minnie's on Lower Haight..but if you're looking for place to satisfy your urgent charcoal demand, Roadside Bbq is not a bad idea..

We are constantly on the lookout for a lunchtime outing and a coworker found some really good reviews for Roadside. Not sure what Roadside they went to, but my experience didn't live up. Now I have to admit, the food is fine, the counter guy was hysterical--but the barbecue is not barbecue. Disclaimer: I am a Kansas City boy, and I loves my barbecue. Unfortunately, Roadside did not measure up. For me, a little too far out of the way. If I am craving barbecue, a trip to Memphis Minnie's will be in order.

So after a long dat at Golden Gates park Hardly Strickly Blue Grass Festival one my friends suggested we go to dinner at Roadside BBQ and so we went. Other than driving around for 20 mintues looking for park the evening went fine. The service was excellent when we arrived we asked if we could move tables togethere to accomadate our large party and the said it fine. Then he suggested we get Q for 10 it was prefect to plates of mash potoatos, potaoto salad was delicious, corn muffins, pulled fork, baby back ribs, grilled chicken.

There aren't many BBQ places in San Francisco, so to find that one had sprung up near my house in The Richmond was a nice surprise that had my mouth watering before I even walked in. ?I love BBQ ribs - the kind you hold in your hand and tear off with your teeth. ?I was hoping that this place would dish out the ribs thick and juicy the way I like. I got a half rack that came with two sides. ? The ribs had good flavor and came off the bone nice and easy. ? ?One problem - the sauce, which you pump like ketchup from a side stand, was not hot enough. ?A tasty surprise were the sweet potato fries - melt in your mouth. The place is clean with a comfortable vibe. ?A couple cops on break were just finishing up two booths down when my friends and I sat down to our beers. ?Fortunately they didn't recognize me. The owner is Pancho, who also owns the Pancho's Mexican restaurants. ?I like Pancho's which has always has fresh ingredients. ?That gives me confidence in the kitchen hygiene, which is important when you're talking about meat. If you like BBQ and getting your fingers messy, Roadside is definitely worth checking out. ?Vegans and vegetarians stay away, this place is your arch-nemesis.

Good food, but I feel like this place shrunk their portions or something. ?I don't like dropping around $17 for food and a drink to see a bunch of space on the plate. ?4 strips of brisket, a pinch of garlic fries, and Mac and Cheese. ?The Mac and Cheese is pretty good, and you get a reasonable size bowl as a side, but you can tell that the boss-man got on these guys about portion control. The sandwiches are cheaper, and I feel like they are $ per $ a better deal.

I had the 2-way combo with beef ribs and beef brisket. My sides were mac&cheese and cole slaw. With a drink, the total came to $18. The brisket was well seasoned, lean, and very tasty. I would've like a bit more, but, meh. No big deal at lunch time. If I would've gone there for dinner, I'd've wanted more. The beef ribs were a little disappointing. They tasted over-smoked, but the meat was lean and tender enough. It was as if the silverskin was left on, because the meat was a bit difficult to get off the bone. And the ribs were a bit skimpy on the meat. The sides were good. I liked the mac&cheese but the vinegariness of the cole slaw was a bit overwhelming. Portion was decent. All in all, I think it was a good place that I would visit again.

I have been here a few times; dined in and also phone the order to go. I minus a 'star' because of the lack of parking! But given the location, I am not surprised. ? The staff are friendly and the place always seems clean. ?I like the variety of sauces and condiments it has (including jalepenos) Things I have tried: + hot links (SPICY but i do love them!) +spare ribs (always very meaty and tasty) +grilled veggies +mac and cheese +grilled chicken sausage (i've had better, if you had to choose, pick hot links!) The sandwhiches look good, I have not tried them but my friends have and them seem satisfied. I think they are a little pricey? 3 meals cost $45.00 maybe that is normal? I don't know but that does tear into my weekly budget if we choose to go there for dinner. I like it overall, and will keep going back! but rememeber, parking sucks to be prepared to walk a little bit or double park ..

I tried the baby back ribs, beef brisket, pulled pork, and the BBQ chicken. Everything was poorly seasoned, tough, and dry.

As far as BBQ goes, this place is great. The brisket is amazing. Only downside, it's expensive. Like ... crazy expensive for what you get. I got the small order because I figured, for $11, it should be a decent amount of food. 2 strips of brisket. Not joking. Maybe it's just a lesson to be learned, and next time I should order a large plate ($14), but for the value, get the sandwich. I'll be back though. I'd only been there once a year ago, and me and my friends still remembered it. It's pretty crave-worthy.

A solid 3 star to be proud of. I split two orders with my bf and it was pretty tasty for a $25 dinner. The pulled pork sandwich was great and the ribs were a little dry for our liking but still pretty decent. The sweet potato fries were great, as was the side salad. We didn't leave feeling overly stuffed or that we had just eaten an entirely greasy meal, which says a lot for a bbq place! Would be good for a group but the seating is a bit tight, groups of 6 or less would be golden.

***Updated*** Times visited : 6+ After reading some of the reviews on yelp (which were mostly negative), some friends of mine said this joint was tasty so I gave it a shot. ? Heres my $0.02 on why yelpers are hating on this place : -maybe because this place is clean -maybe because you can actually order a beer -maybe because the 8 or so meats and 12+ sides offered on the menu, ARE ACTUALLY AVAILABLE! UNBELIEVABLE! where do the people who run roadside get the audacity? -maybe since the corn muffin is homeade with lots of REAL corn -maybe because the employees practice excellent food service ability -or maybe its just because the corn on the cob comes with its own container of BUTTER, no not KFC imitation margerine, BUTTER. I used to be a Brother in laws / Lilly's fan, but after today I'm going to have to jump ship. ?For me this place combines all the pro's from lilly;s and memphis minnies with none of the negatives. This place seemed to catch some slack for lackluster bbq sauce and its ribs. ?This is why you guys are wrong. 1) ?sauce? who the hell cares about sauce, bbq is about the MEAT. 2) this place offers BABY BACK RIBS. ?do you people not know what that is? maybe people rather eat chunky pork ribs that are usually tough and still have a raw pork smell near the bone. Maybe because this is a new establishment people want to be over critical. ?Of course maybe I just ordered the right thing on the right day, thats why i'll be making a return visit very soon. ?This place is quality thats for sure. ***Updated*** So I've been here a couple times and tried all the meats.... BABY BACK RIBS - Yes by themselves, these ribs are a tad on the bland side, the trick i've learned is not use BBQ sauce. ? Slather those ribs with the free honey packets they give, the honey makes a huuuuuuge difference. THE CHICKEN- I see absolutely no faults with their chicken. ?Ive had it about 4 times and each time it was melt off the bone tender. ?Again don't bother with the bbq sauce, the HONEY is the way to go. BRISKET- Not a fan, a little tough for my taste. Pulled Pork - Juicy & tender, but its missing a little something...

This place was an overall disappointment. 1. The Ribs Completely bland! You have to pump your own sauce on them, otherwise it's just meat with no seasoning of any kind. The meat was soft and peeled off the bones very easily, but nothing made up for lack of taste. If you order to go and don't know that they don't put sauce on the ribs, you may end up with plain meat when you get home. Apparently it's too much to ask for a few containers to be INCLUDED when you order the ribs. Kind of ridiculous, if I wanted to make my own BBQ I would have done so, rather than paying $18 bucks. 2. Side Dishes I ordered mashed potatoes and veggies. I never tasted more tasteless mashed potatoes, there was NO FLAVOR to them whatsoever. Veggies pretty much tasted like nothing either, no matter what I put on them. Conclusion? SF is not exactly the place for best BBQ in the states, which is why this place is busy (there just aren't many BBQ houses in the city), but there's got to be a better way. This place isn't cheap, for the kind of tasteless stuff they sell. I definitely won't be back.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mac & cheese as a side. ?The pulled pork meat was decent and the bread could have been good, however when putting it together they doused it with some clear liquid in a squeeze bottle and THEN doused it again with BBQ sauce that honestly didn't really have much of a BBQ flavor as a tomato vinegar one. ?The result made the bottom bun totally soggy and unedible. ?The mac & cheese was stone cold and the crumbly topping on it soggy and kinda gross. ?Not to mention that the metal to-go tin made the mac & cheese taste kinda tinny. ?

I had driven down Geary street numerous times and failed to notice Roadside BBQ! HUH? BBQ ON GEARY STREET!? With the overwhelming domination of Thai, Chinese, Russian, Irish, and Korean restaurants got me thinking...WTF?! REAL AMERICAN BBQ ON GEARY STREET??? I finally said to myself, "What the hell, let's give it a try!" So, one rainy afternoon I went there and tried numerous items...keep in mind that I was sharing it with other people...I don't want to give the wrong impression that I gorge myself and eat till' it hurts... So, I, or should I say, "WE" shared the pulled pork, brisket, and hotlinks and it was all good, not great. The asian spicy /sweet sauce was pretty darn good and the sides were mediocre: 1) Coleslaw had a nice tasting dressing. 2) Baked beans tasted like what baked beans should taste like. 3) Mac and cheese was not what I expected...a little weird on the textural side. 4) Cornbread would make Elvis Rock and Roll in his grave forever! YUCK! Overall, I think this would be a good place to fulfill your "Q" needs momentarily... Uhhh, I think I'll wait for the BBQ cook-off in Reno! See you guys there!!!

i lived right across the street from this place. The garlic fries are to die for as well as the sweet potato fries. The beef brisket is tender and delicious. the food is great to eat also when you're drunk. its slightly greasy but not overly...its just a great food. i never ate in though i always did take out. They have a variety of bbq sauces for everyone's pick. they have an asian bbq sauce thats pretty good. love it! parking is kind of hard to find because you have to park on the street and you know how it goes in inner richmond. there's no parking anywhere.

I've been feed BBQ all my life. My folks are from Texas but I grew up in Bakersfield...save the jokes!! But this place is no joke when it comes to great BBQ in the city!! I took my girl for the first time last week for lunch. She's a foodie and has been teaching me the "finer" foods in life. But her eyes rolled back in her head when she chopped into their BBQ Chicken. I've never seen her pick a bone clean like she did that day. Points for me!! ?She loved it!! I had the Beef Brisket sandwich w/ BBQ bean...PERFECTION!! This was only the second time I've ever been there and it's now going to be a destination for me. On top of that, the service was great!! I'm not sure of the man's name but I think it was Carl. When my girl asked for a take home box (she still had some side dishes left over). He went to the back and came out with a little sampler of a few of their other offering for us to try. He wanted to make sure we had a full meal when we got home. WHO DOES THAT!! KNOWBODY!! What a nice gesture and he earned a pair of loyal customers. Sometimes is not just about great food, it's about the great people who bust their asses to bring it to you. Please try them out...they deserve the chance. ?Cheers!!

Being a member of the Richmond YMCA, living in the Haight, and being averse to public transit when the walking distance from point A to point B is only a mile or two, I have had the chance to walk by Roadside BBQ countless times. After a good run on the treadmill, the smell of of a smokehouse barbecue is almost irresistibly enticing, but somehow I've only stopped here once. Maybe because I'm always soaked in sweat when I'm in the neighborhood. I had the brisket, which was good but not great. What I'm really looking forward to is the pulled-pork. Writing this now is making me want to go back. Also, for some reason I ordered a vegetable medley instead of french fries. That was a mistake. It's a barbecue joint. You don't order vegetables unless it's an ear of corn and said ear is slathered in butter. A big plus is that it's very inexpensive, something like $8.00 for a sandwich or so. AND OMG I ALMOST FORGOT: they have Lone Star bottles. It's the only place in SF I've seen so far that has this excellent beer. The PBR of Texas.

For a BBQ spot in the Richmond the Roadside BBQ was really good my only gripe is that is was a little skimpy. I ordered the two meat combo with chicken and brisket. My chicken was good nice amount of their rub on it. The brisket was cool not the best nor the worst. It was pretty cool ?but it wasn't super tender, in other words I couldn't easily cut with a fork. The BBQ sauces were good the good thing about them is that there were several different kind including an asian one can't remember the name of it. The service was really good. Oh and by the way the hotlink was off the hook

Roadside BBQ is much like Dio's "Holy Diver" album- it holds up and it'ss always killer whenever you experience it. It's worth the trip form wherever you are for some killer BBQ. They have it all- chicken, beef, pork, sandwiches, sausages, etc. Perhaps best of all, plenty of effort goes into the sides, so they're not an afterthought at all- garlic fries, mac 'n cheese (hearty), cole slaw (that's NOT soupy), red beans and corn on the cob. The combo plates are ginormous and usually come with tasty cornbread. The downside- parking can be a bit tight in the area during the dinner hour. And the last time I was here, the service left something to be desired.... they have a great menu selection so I was probably hesitating in making a selection, but the surly woman behind the counter was making it clear I should order. Like, NOW, or she'd drag me in the back and make me bob for french fries in the deep frier. Mind you, there was no line behind me and I was not even standing at the counter, just looking at the menu. But that bad experience aside, I think this place rules. I dragged my 2 bandmates there for "band meeting night" and they both expressed hesitation before we got there, so I told them to stop being such wimps. They agreed that their lameness was extraordinary and that they were definitely wearing skirts, so once I got them to act like men and give it a shot ?they both said they'd be back for sure! One got extra food for his girlfriend and the other said he'd even drive in from Oakland to come back.

Granted I'm not a BBQ expert, but I know what's good. The meat here was tough. Ribs were tough....pulled pork was not as tough, but was flavorless. Chicken was gross - don't get it. The vegetables were good. Sweet fries were good. Mac and cheese was swimming in oil. I would only come here to get my bbq fix out of the way.

I have to eat here about once every six months to remind myself why I don't like this place. ? The meat is so-so, the sides are downright bad, and it's WAAAAAY overpriced for what you get. ? However, since we have so few BBQ joints in the city, sometimes we're forced to suck it up and take one for the team. ?If you find yourself in this situation, I would recommend the pulled pork with beans and fries. Avoid the mac & cheese and mashed potatoes at all costs.

I am not sure why this place gets such bad reviews? I think Memphis Minnies has a slight edge over this place, but his place is cheaper than Memphis and the food is delicious. Today I had the Beef Ribs and Chicken and both items were juicy and delicious. It was a great BBQ meal. ?My friend had the pulled pork sandwich and loved it as well. I would definately go back here

Roadside definitely hits the spot. So, as a white kid growing up in sf in the 70's I was very fortunate to have a dad who was always scouting out good rib joints for us so I was lucky to have been exposed to some awesome BBQ -- usually African-American owned with an awesome southern influence. ? Unfortunately all of those places have been long gone and good BBQ hard to come by until now. Roadside BBQ definitely hits the spot. Don't get me wrong, the absolute best baby backs are at my favorite mini chain in Texas and New Mexico called Rudy's Country Store but Roadside BBQ definitely fills the void when I am home. Pretty extensive menu. Including a smoked turkey leg combo which I "have" to come back and try! They also have salads and grilled veggies for vegetarian types.

I had a great lunch here the other day - really good food. ?Took a while to get it, but I liked that because it made it clear that they weren't slopping it on a tray. The smoking of the meat was evident, the variety of sauces was interesting (try Asian BBQ sauce!), and the sweet potato fries rocked. ?It was just all very, very pleasant.

In brief: - Uber-friendly service, walk up counter with clean atmosphere, but a little corny and didn't have a "homey" feel to it - everything was too shiny and shellacked - Food lived up to expectations, juicy, flavorful and plenty to eat - If you're not a BBQ-lover, you can still find dishes that suit your more mild tastes - Favorite thing on the menu (so far): Macaroni & Cheese In depth: - Not very busy on a Wednesday night, we got to the counter and ordered right away. The menu was a bit confusing, but once we placed the sections it all made sense. Step back and you'll see what I mean. - The platters are a bit pricey, but I just went with the Memphis Pulled Pork sandwich for $8. We were there to check off the 7x7 100 Things to Eat list, and I was not disappointed. The pork was tender and dripping with light juices, mixed with coleslaw and topped off with an equally delicious toasted bun. - The sandwich was not a full-throttle BBQ experience, but it got the point across without being too strong. I personally don't love BBQ, so I was happy that it did end up being too saucy. Also had a side of Mac & Cheese, which was sooooo delicious. I would go back just for that. - I couldn't eat it all by its lonesome, so we also ordered a Veggie Stuffed Potato. It's like they couldn't decide whether they wanted it to be healthy or not, so they just threw everything together. A GIANT baked potato stuffed with melted cheese, butter and a variety of fresh and perfectly steaming veggies (broccoli, green beans, corn, carrots, strips of squash and zucchini). - Overall, totally worthwhile and yummy. I will be trying their pies on the next visit, since I hear they are to die for. For now, 3.5 stars and a :) cause I'm more than satisfied.

This place is going down hill. ?They used to have much better food when they first opened. ?I ordered take out of the beef ribs because their baby back ribs were sold out. ?When I got home and took the ribs out, they were so burnt like they were charcoal. ?I guess it was close to their closing time and they just threw the garbage into my to go bag and hope I just walked away with it. ?I walked away with it alright and will never return. ?Cannot believe they would do something like that. ?The ribs were uneatable and I had to throw them away. ?The coleslaw were tasteless. This place sucks.

I am always optimistic when I go out, but there are a few things that can quickly ruin my perception of a place. ?Service tops that list, but something that happens less often though is just as frustrating is the feeling of being nickel and dimed. Like many others that have posted reviews on Roadside BBQ, I am constantly fighting the craving for BBQ, though have minimal options living in the Bay area. ?This past Tuesday, the wife and I were heading to Pacifica to try the highly recommended Gorilla BBQ. ?Thank goodness my copilot checked their hours before we went too far, because they are closed on Tuesdays. Determined to satisfy our original dinner choice, we headed north to the only other BBQ we haven't tried; Roadside. I'll get to the point: I felt totally screwed when it came to portion size and price. ?Our "large" order of the pulled pork meal had less meat than would have filled a sandwich. ?The portions of the sides were fairly minimal, and the corn muffin was a joke, about the size of a half dollar. ? When finished, we realized we were still hungry for some sweets and were enticed by the pecan pie, but then realized they offered a "slice or sliver," the former a full $5. ?We stopped elsewhere for sweets. While the food was solid, albeit nothing special, my overall perception of the place was totally ruined by the fact that I was $37 poorer for 2 very measly plates of food and 2 drinks. ? I am not a supporter of trashing places based on a bad experience, but I can only hope that this serves as my comment card to the ownership that the price/portion ratio is way off. ? In short, while the food and service was satisfactory, I won't go back because of the lack of value.

The Texas 2 Steps (2 bread rolls), (1 steak, 1 pork) were good. There are variety of BBQ sauces: Asian, Sweet Hot, and Sweet Mild. This sweet Carolina vinegar taste good when adding on food. ? ? The chicken was a joke because it was dried up. I mean where's the juicy flavor of the meat? The mac n cheese was dried up too. The muffin was tiny, and the corn on the cob taste plain. Why I spent hella money on food that doesn't satisfy my stomach? If I want a low grade chicken, I might as well shop at Costco and buy their baked chicken.

I love me some BBQ, and Roadside hits the spot. I'd walked past this place many times (going to and from the gym: HA!) before eating there one weeknight after work. Service was friendly enough; the menu is extensive, with an admirable selection of sides. I got the pulled pork sandwich with a side of garlic fries and a Lone Star; my boyfriend got the brisket with veggies (inexplicable choice at a BBQ joint, but I admire the health-consciousness of the decision). The pork was awesome: tender, juicy, and smothered in coleslaw; the fries were on the garlicky side, but crispy and munchable. Roadside gets points for being wallet-friendly and for carrying Lone Star :) Next time, I'll attempt to save room for the sweet potato pie...

how is this place only 3 stars?? the food is tasty, the service is great, and the place is clean (which is hard to come by at a bbq joint). we ordered a few pulled pork sliders ($6/two), which comes with some free slaw and all the pickles your little heart desires. the pulled pork was juicy and tender and you can add your own bbq sauce, and level of spicyness. they also serve shiner beer, which i rarely find anywhere except for in texas (the bock is excellent)! not as good as kc bbq, but the price is right when you are hungry and wandering the streets of inner richmond.

Pretty decent BBQ joint. I've had the pulled pork sandwich and the 1/4 rack of ribs (not all at once). First off, it's just good to have a place like this out in the Richmond, mix it up a little. Food-wise it's very good, meats are cooked "slow and low" and the sides were decent.

Had lunch there the other day by impulse and got very lucky in our pick. We ordered the "Q for Two"... 4 meats, 3 RoadSides, & 2 corn muffins for $25.95. We doubled up on the Baby Back Ribs, then got Beef Ribs and Memphis Pulled Pork for our remaining selections. For the sides we ordered the Mac-n-Cheese, Briket Baked Beans, and Garlic Fries. Baby Backs we both agreed were excellent. Best I've had in awhile. The beef ribs we differed on a bit. While the taste was there, they didn't seem very meaty to me. Seemed like they were all bone. I just have maybe gotten a dud. We both like the Memphis Pulled Pork. Cooked just right and while very moist, not drowning in some sauce like a soup as I have seen it done elsewhere. The sides ... that's easy. Get the Garlic Fries and the Beans. Order two beans and split the fries with your BBQ partner. It will be enough. ?I cannot vouch for the mac-n-cheese. We also liked the selection of BBQ sauces you can self self like a salsa bar. Some hot and spicy some sweet and tangy. There was a mustard based one I really enjoyed. ?The corn muffins that came with it were also very good but unfortunately the size of a quarter.

Decent- definitely an "I don't want to cook OR go anyplace far from home" place. We got beef brisket and it was good but had a very strong vinegar-ish thing going on. Maybe that was the BBQ sauce.

So, I continued onto the next option, the delicious Aidells sausage, the sausage said "You love me, with that nice hot mustard bbq don't you?" "You love it!" I said "Yes indeedy, I do!" Moving on the marcaroni was lovely not too dry just right. The potato salad, hmm could be better a bit too much celery and quite thin for my liking but baby, baby, baby! Listen again, nah! The cornbread was moist to my lips, drizzling some honey, The cornbread said "I am the best after taste you can ever have."

Shared a slab/sides and a couple of root-beers, which only set Swicey P back $24 (Her treat. Nice!) ?They threw in an extra corn thingie since we were sharing, and hotties obviously. We complained to ourselves a lot as we do, (hottest sauce only, coleslaw yes, mac&cheese no no,) but damn if we couldn't keep our hands off that last burnt nubbin of porky charcoal normal people leave behind. Lord knows a girl needs some pork.

Good, but not great. That about sums up Roadside BBQ. For all of you chain hating Yelpers, definitely avoid this place, as it has a bit of a chain like feel. That's not really why I give it a lukewarm rating though - the beef briskey was a bit dry for my Texas tastes, but the melange of BBQ sauces made up for it to a certain extent.

This place has gone downhill. The ribs are not that good anymore. They used to have that flavor that stayed in my mouth for days, but now it just goes away easily. The sides are really small and the corn muffins have gone down a size too! When I ordered to go the sides used to come in a separate container each! But now they just come in the same tin circular pan that the ribs come in..what a disappointment.

U.F.O. (Unidentifiable Foreign Object) in my pulled pork, may have been a piece of plastic the size of a guitar pick or some charred gristle, I don't know which, also a piece of it tasted like a piece of charcoal, so that doesn't bode well for them. Think about some quality control maybe? The sweet potato fries were soggy but still delicious dipped in the original BBQ sauce, and the mac-n-cheese ?was a lot better as a leftover. Still the mac-n-cheese from Memphis Minnie's rates better in my book. Innovative use of Asian ginger sauce as condiment, this is the Inner Richmond, after all. Not the best BBQ in the city, but not the worst either.

This is one of my favorite BBQ places. Not just because the food has always been excellent but the atmosphere is great. The place is brightly lit and have BBQ memorabilia all over the place. I always feel like I've stepped off the busy city street and into a restaurant in a small country town. The staff is very friendly and the guys I've had ring me up at the register are always so full of personality and fun. Ok, so on the food. Everything I've eaten has always been cooked to perfection...but I would recommend I the pulled pork or baby back ribs. The mac n cheese and corn bread biscuit are really yummy as well. Come try Roadside BBQ, I've never been disappointed and you probably won't be either.

I try to make it to this place at least once a week. I'm not sure why people rate it so low because they prefer Kansas/Texas BBQ cause the fact that this is Tennessee style is prominently advertised, and it seems to me like complaining that your dog doesn't meow. The entrees are amazing from top to bottom, the sides are diverse and delicious, the staff is friendly and the sauce, oh my, the sauce. Tons of variety to spruce up your meal of choice. I recommend it to anyone in the area.

mmm i saw them building this place a few months ago and finally got around to trying it. and i like it! good price. i had the memphis pulled rib meal. the meat wasnt quite as good as say, lily's bbq, but the sides really made it worth it. i havent seen sweet potatoe fries on a menu since i was in kentucky! they are yum-o as rachel ray would say. like 10 bucks for meat, two sides, and a corn bread muffin. woot!

Visited for the first time today, 6/1/07. Tried the two-way combo with ribs, brisket, slaw and beans and cornbread, sweet tea. The meat was tender and had a good smoke flavor, but I don't think it was hickory. The ribs could use a good rub and mop sauce. None of the sauces were very good - basically tomato ketchup with little seasoning. I could've fed the "hot" to a baby with a spoon. The slaw was cut nice, but dry. You either put some mayo in it or do it German-style with vinegar and a little celery seed. The baked beans tasted canned with little flavor. The cornbread muffin was decent, with bits of corn in it. I'd go back just to try the pulled pork sammy. For now, it still Everett and Jones in Jack London Square for me. BTW, I grew up Kansas City and I've eaten Q just about everywhere but the Carolinas.

Stopped in excited to see that "hey we have a BBQ joint in SF that's bright and inviting" ?I know a thing or 2 about REAL BBQ...from Memphis to Texas and Kansas City style...Ordered a Combo with of course ribs..tender , nice pink smoke ring and meaty...sauces need to kick it up and maybe can use more vinegar, the mac 'n cheese was bland and needs some seasoning because even the BBQ sauce didn't flavor it. ? The beans were tasty and had a rich tomato sauce , yet they could of used a bit more counts of whiskey...(cooked off for the kids of course!) Nice to go packaging and presentation, the brisket was tender but it did seem more like it was under a heat lamp or sitting in a steamer too long...the sauce had to be on it to make it ?taste good and though it could be pulled with a fork it was not due to the slow roast , but from the sitting for a long period possibly becoming braised. ?I have yet to try the pulled P... I hope they use a good RUB on the Pulled P and that it doesn't mirror the brisket experience. ?The Corn muffin was good and didn't look or taste like a yellow rock...I am just glad to find a fairly good BBQ joint not on the outskirts of the city and without having to travel to the East Bay...Hopefully Roadside will alter some of the recipes and cooking methods by trial and error...they will then have a VERY GOOD BBQ spot that even BBQ snobs such as myself will enjoy time and time again...I reckon' they will do well because of the lack of BBQ spots in the city that are family friendly,clean, serving ?good portions and convenient..but the fact is if they don't improve a bit, all it takes is a few others to jump on the bandwagon and knock them out because you can find better smoked meats in the Bay Area...the customer service was good and memorable which is a plus...the girl at the counter could be from here but I detected a bit of Southern Hospitality which made it an experience enough to return and make up for some of the poor food ratings in terms of seasoning and some of the cooking/holding methods for the meats, which I hope Pancho will make an effort to improve...they have location, location, location for sure! UPDATE: 12/05/06 ~ Tried the Pulled P and I have to say it was not bad...My sis' had the chicken and it was moist and juicy. ?I ordered some of the same sides and tried new one's...the cooks have improved on the seasonings...mac n' cheese was more tasty and the cornbread was even more moist and doesn't even need butter, portions are plentiful-still consistent and the service was still right on!

I went here tonight and left very full and very satisfied. After reading the reviews about how bad the sides were, I was fully expecting to eat only meat. The plate dishes come with 2 sides and a cornbread muffin though so I picked mac and cheese and beans. The macaroni was yummy, cheesy and baked just like it should be and the beans had just the right amount of sugar. The meat (I ordered baby backs) was so good. My boyfriend ordered brisket and that was okay though I definitely preferred the ribs. Oh and the cornbread was amazing and even better when enjoyed with honey. I would definitely come back again.

This was our first visit and it did not leave a good impression. ? It's very disappointing when your first bite of BBQ is a temperature best described as lukewarm. ?I believe there are food safety laws that food must be kept and served at a certain temperature for safe public consumption. They reheated it for us but the meats were still dry and lackluster. ?We ordered the 3-meat combo lunch of ribs, pulled pork and brisket w/ ?2 sides (mac n cheese and sweet potato fries). The sides were okay - average at best. But, this is a BBQ joint and the meats should stand out. They don't. When the smell of garlic fries is stronger than the aroma of the BBQ, it ain't workin'.

2.5 stars, but I'm feeling kind, and want this place to do better. ?Let me preface this by saying I've only been once so far for takeout (on a weekday), and I normally go to Big Nate's (which is also closer to me), ?but I'm willing to give this place one more try. The meat. ?I had brisket and pulled pork. ? ?Wow. ? Just wow. ?Not WoW, not OMFGWTFBBQ wow, but a bad wow. ? Both were fairly lukewarm by the time I got home. ?Halfway through eating them, they were room temperature. ?I'm pretty sure both were just reheated, and I'm almost tempted to say in a microwave (food heated in a microwave loses heat faster than if it was warmed up in an oven/stove). ?The pulled pork was nice and smokey, yet not particularly juicy. ?Ditto for the brisket, which was also a bit fatty, and for some reason reminded me of the texture of packaged corned beef. ?They don't serve sauce with these meats, just a very light drizzle of standard BBQ sauce over them, so make sure you get a container (or two or three) of sauce from the self service area. ? This is different from Nates, who bathes their meats in finger licking good sauce. ?I'm not deducting anything for that though, since I figure it's a stylistic thing. ?Maybe... Portion size was a bit smaller than other BBQ places I've been to, but it was really just right (other places' portions are usually too much for one meal for me) The sides were decent, being they have a fair selection of sides. ?The slaw though, I don't suggest. ?Maybe it's a "healthy" version, being lighter/tangier, but there's none of your usual mayo in there. ?Just veggies. ?The sweet potato fries were good, and a good sized portion too. ?These weren't your shotglass sized side dishes, but more or less a good pint. ?The cornbread was really good too - nice and crunchy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. Like I said, I normally go to Nates (been to a few other places not in SF), so I'm basing my comparison with them. ?I've had some hit or miss meals once or twice from Nates, but never this bad. ?But...since this place is new, I'll give them another try at some point, and hope that I just caught them on an off nite.

The food isn't terrible but i isn't great either. My pork was a little cold and dry on my pulled pork sandwich, and my dressing on the iceberg salad was bland and runny (not to mention... not enough). The loaded potato I got with the barbeque chicken was good - great baked potato, but overall the inconsistent preparation and lackluster quality of the barbeque left me underwhelmed. The presentation of the food is decent though, and it still has some appeal, and I'd definitely go back for the potatoes.

I am surprised this amazing BBQ joint doesn't have an overall higher rating... this place is DELICIOUS! All other BBQ places in San Francisco that I have tried just don't have that one of a kind BBQ taste you crave, but Roadside does. 1. chicken sausage... tasty 2. baked beans w. bacon... tasty 3. pulled pork sandwich... tasty 4. corn bread muffins... tasty 5. ribs look scrumptious, as does everything else that I haven't tried on the menu, even for someone who does not eat beef. 6. most importantly BBQ Sauce selection and taste... knock your socks off This place will satisfy your BBQ craving and then some and it is a plus that the Staff are super friendly. If you live in the heart of the city, it is worth the trek to Inner Richmond for BBQ- this place defines best BBQ in San Francisco.

This 4th of July was my first time at Roadside BBQ. The prices were high considering the small portions of food. We spent $50 for the Family 2 meal which consisted of 2 smoked meats, 4 sides, and 8 tiny cornbreads. We chose beef ribs and brisket which lacked any seasoning and little meat. For our side dishes, we had cole slaw, mash potatoes, beans, and corn. The corn wasn't cut,they ?gave us 2 whole cobs that was suppose to serve 4 to 6 people?! For the amount of money spent all that was given were 6 beef ribs, a small portion of brisket and sides. Definitely not worth it!

I'm not from Texas, but I've had my share of good bbq down south and I know what I like. ?With all the me-too foo-foo health-food in this city, its not surprising these places have trouble holding on. ?I can find grilled chicken a lot of places, and even Saks seems to have a "Memphis pulled pork". ?So I keep it simple and go for the smoked brisket every time. ?Its damn good and even in Texas I think this place would get 3 stars. ?In SF it gets 4, with one star just for showing up in this fish and tapas town. If some folks got soggy bread or dry chicken, well, I guess that sucks. ?But I would rest easy knowing you can still get a solid smoked brisket on the Left Coast. One other good thing about Roadside is that they're keeping the prices closer to Texas, rather than making you believe you should have to pay a California premium to find bbq. ?BBQ isn't ever going to be as cheap as McDonalds. ?But you should be able to get a full lunch for 10 bucks, and a meat combo dinner for 15. And its great you can get sweet or unsweet. ?No one in California has that. ?Sometimes I call 900 numbers just to have the girls say "sweet or unsweet" over and over so I can imagine I'm in Chattanooga or Houston again. I have to say I would have made the decor look a little less like a chain, with the perfectly printed menu signs and sleek logo. ?But then all that down-home looking stuff in Texas is just as much a facade and it shouldn't affect the food. ?It would just be nice if they took it down a notch. ?I guess if SF real estate was cheaper they could afford to keep a pile of hickory stacked up out front like Goode Company.

excellent brisket and ribs. seldom can i find ribs that are exactly the way i like them, but i can get them at roadside. i'm a little perturbed by the fact that they use bbq sauce on their mashed taters. why? everything else is gonna be smothered in the sweet, tangy stuff, so let's leave the taters alone and let them swim in savory gravy. the chicken sausage was just ai-ite. kind of a funky, offputting flavor. mac n cheese is good, but could be cheesier. i want to TASTE that cheddar, and not just cream. the sandwiches look AMAZING. next time i feel like splurging, i'm gonna get myself a pulled pork sandwich. for me, that's a strong barometer of a bbq restaurant. that, and the ribs. i also like roadside b/c it's practically right outside my door. AND they have sweet potato fries. yesssssss... oh, and one last thing? AWESOME french fries. perfect flavor. perfect crisp-soft ratio. and skin-on!

I have tried this place a few times and it just is not that good. I take my BBQ seriously and I still have yet to find any good BBQ joints in California. This place although is probably one of the better ones in the Bay Area. The service is bad. They always forget the order or screw it up somehow. The food is extremely bland and I tried doctoring it up with differant sauces but the sauces are just as bland so it doesn't do anything to help. I would probably choose this place over anything I have yet had in Cali but I don't like it.

When KFC pseudo mac n' cheese and hockey puck biscuits simply won't do I brave the chilly night and spidey leap over to Roadside BBQ for their mac n'cheesy goodness and cornbread. A tad oily cheese, but when I awaken at 2am with all my lights still on with my cheekbone in the empty container I realize that the smidgen of oiliness may have only complimented the flavors.

The sides were better than the meats: the mac and cheese was good. ?The grilled corn was good. ?The cole slaw was weird. ?The mashed potatoes were good, but the gravy was mediocre. ?

I decided to write a review because this place currently has 3 stars on Yelp and it really should have 4 (maybe 3.75). The food is good, the sides are good and the customer service is good. I just had a smoked chicken sandwich and it was delicious, perhaps a bit expensive at $8.95 but it comes with heaps of chicken and is topped with avocado. It also comes with a side, I had the mac and cheese which was delicious. Bottom line, if you want gourmet try somewhere else. If you're hungry and you want good BBQ, Roadside will leave you feeling content.

BBQ joints aren't always appealing to non-meat-eaters such as myself. I recently moved to SF from the south (where BBQ is king) and, when dragged to a BBQ joint by my meat-lovin' husband, I'd often be forced to order french fries, cole slaw and mac n' cheese. Roadside BBQ has all of those things, but they also have lovely sauteed vegetables and a giant baked potato topped with said vegetables. It's still not the healthiest place for me to eat, but it's a lot better than the alternative - and my friends really enjoyed the pulled pork, brisket and pulled chicken.

mmm i love pulled pork sandwiches.. i enjoyed Roadside BBQs twist with the thicker pieces of pork which were sweet but a little dryer then I like and the veggies included for the additional spice. I got the grilled corn as a side, i don't know what seasoning was on it but i was licking my lips mmm haha... i really enjoyed this warm meal on a foggy and windy inner Richmond night and would stop in again but don't know if its quite worthy of The Big Eats SF ;)

Wanted to check another one off the 7x7 Big Eats list. Got the pulled pork sandwich on the list, it was meh.... I prefer the one at Parkside in the park. The pulled pork is pretty flavorful but the slaw in the sandwich is kind of lackluster in taste. Also the roll they served it on was soggy and tasted stale. Also got the baked potato which was served only lukewarm with unmelted cheese on top. Sad!! The grilled corn was quite tasty though and the service is top notch, everyone is really nice. Maybe I just caught them on an off night.

HOnestly i was REALLY Looking forward to having some good ol fashion american style messy barbecue ribs that require all ten fingers and about 50 wet naps afterwards. ?I have to say i was pretty disappointed. ?The place wasn't crowded and is more of a fast food style restaurant where you order up front and they bring the food. ?The ribs were ehhhh, not very most and kinda rough on the teeth. ?I also found it weird that you had to get your own bbq sauce to put on yourself. ?I got mashed potatoes (decent but I could make that sheit from a box) and the coleslaw (TERRIBLE!!!). ?I left about half satisfied and wishing I had walked across the street to the cheap ass pizza joint for a 3 dollar slice. ?Agree on price, not too high but WAY too high for what it is.

Passed the place every morning on the way to work. Finally, we stopped and bought take out dinner. I guess depends on the cook, the food can be either good or bad. But, we had bbq chicken,.. it pretty good, ribs... pretty good, corn... check, mac and cheese.. pretty good! So, overall, I am quite satisfied!!

came here the day after we had "THE BEST' moist-est, tender-est, juici-est, melt in you mouth -est texas beef brisket from bones roadhouse in gualala................... so we didn't have the same experience as yesterday........... hub had beef brisket & pulled pork combo. ?i had the bbq smoked chicken sandwich the beef brisket wasn't as moist, juicy, tender & flavorful as the one from bones roadhouse. ?it was just awwright............... the pulled pork was more tender & flavorful than their brisket. the bbq smoked chicken sandwich (with guacomole, grilled onions, cilantro & tomato on a soft foccaccia like bun) was moist, tender & very tastee particularly the 1st half of the sandwich.........actually my hub experienced this too (tasted moist, tender & flavorful during the 1st half of his course). ? ?we both thought the 2nd half of our meal, the meat got dry & lost its flavor. liked the consistency & texture of their corn muffin compared to bones roadhouse, but wasn't as sweet as i would like it -- so need to add some honey to that........... overall, we'll be back for the convenience...........we need to go back to brother-in-laws' beef brisket (hadn't had that in years) but apparently it changed to lily's bbq. hmmm....we'll see............

This place was terrible! The one star is for the cleanliness of the restaurant because it is pretty darn clean for a BBQ place. ?When I got my ribs I was so disappointed.

Ok I have not been in SF for a few weeks let alone to the corner of 2nd and Geary st. A friend asked for burgers and this used to be a burger joint but now a BBQ house with "NO BURGERS" How convenient. So i get ready to order and choose, what else but, BEEF RIBS. not many places or BBQ houses make beef ribs, the usual pork spare/baby back ribs that I do not like very much, give me BEEF! When they call out my order it was a beef brisket?!!?!? So I told the register dude who took my order hey I ordered BEEF RIBS not BRISKET, then he said i ordered a brisket, #1 you do not tell me i ordered something I didn't and giving me that attitude, gained you a 1 star review, moron! You never tell the customer he ordered something he didn't and give an attitude! Then make up a story that he asked me small or large brisket.( I had to show him my bill) Spending $15+ you better get my damm order right. sides of fried sweet potato and cornbread, or more like a mini cornbread, what do look like a midget porn star who needs to lose weight? The corn bread is SUPER SMALL SIZED! making corn bread in mini cupcake pans is just, PANSY! I see one star in your future .So while waiting for them to get my order right, they pull out a rack of beef ribs which was covered in plastic wrap, I guess to keep it moist. ?It was sitting in a food warmer. The fried sweet potatoes were soggy and had no crunch. HORRIBLE! I don't expect it to be right off the grill but I am sure they were not from that day, too dry! While my buddies and I waited for our order, the server was putting plates on the other table and could not get anything right. I cannot even consider this place decent BBQ. It is pretty sad how all BBQ joints in SF suck. I observed my friends dishes and sides, nothing special they said and took 2 bites of his mac, threw that away and the coleslaw, OMG, SOUR! Pulled pork sandwich, nothing impressive and tasted the same. I guess it is hard when you cook better BBQ then 99% of the places out there. The only thing this place gets is they did not pull the bait and switch like Jones' in Richmond did. PARKING in Richmond Dist. SUCKS! SERVICE SUCKS FOOD EHHHHHHHH No Comment.(my standards for meat is higher then this) Please turn back time and become the burger joint! What kind of smoke house does not serve burgers? WHACK! Ending note their BBQ Rub is mild to flavorless on my taste bud level, and their BBQ sauces are WEAK! Comes out of a pump that just reminds me of Costco. All their sauces are not spicy at all and taste like it came out of a bottle, pre-made, I don't think they make their own sauces and serving packets of Heinz honey, BTW, their website is annoying, remove those sounds and you might not drive people away from your site!

Found a wonderful bbq joint!! Unfortunately, it's in SF. It's Roadside BBQ at 3751 Geary and 2nd just a few blocks from Golden Gate Park. The pulled pork is the best I've ever had, juicy and lots of flavor. They have several kinds of meats, moist and good, lots of sides, including spicy greens!, several sauces you can add, moist and wonderful corn muffins, coconut banana cream pie! If you can't make up your mind about which meat to have, they have a four meat platter with three sides and three muffins. Can't wait to go back!

Bleh is all I can say. ?The reason this place does so well is because of the lack of competition. ?I've eaten here several times and have been less than impressed. ? The meat is generally on the dry side. ?Cornbread is bland and also dry. ?I had the pulled pork sandwich. ?It comes with a side so I requested sweet potato fries. ?The fries were soggy, and were 50% sweet potato and 50% regular potato! ?I hate being duped. ?Tonight was definitely the last time I'm going there. ? I'd rather go all the way to LA for REAL bbq at Lucille's!

You order prior to self-seating yourself. I went with the beef ribs, mac & cheese, and a side salad. The beef ribs were a major let down and the mac & cheese were dry and crumbly!! How can one go wrong with the classic mac & cheese ?? Along with that, the chicken apple sausages were dry and lacking flavor. On a brighter note, the tiny bite-size corn bread is unbelieveably amazing! Moist and flavorful, almost close to perfection! Try your meat with the 3 mustard sauce!

The prices aren't awful for a bbq place. The sandwich was nice but I ordered it to go so I don't think I can be the most fair judge of it.

You want BBQ on Geary Blvd.? There's definitely Korean. Although if you're looking for American-style, there's only one spot- Roadside BBQ. It's a very clean joint with an attractive interior and menu selection. For my first try, I went with the Texas Beef Brisket platter with the corn muffin and 2 sides- Mac n Cheese and Potato Salad. Overall, the platter was "A-Ok." On my next trip, I'm going to try the ribs and sandwiches which look pretty good.

I was pretty excited at the thought of good BBQ, until my first bite. This place is really cute and the food *looks* really good, but everything I had was bland.

Had to have a bite of the pulled pork sandwich to cross it off my list. I'm not a pork lover so i wasn't as excited about visiting this place as my husband was. But he, a pork lover was even just meh on the food. He grabbed me some chicken fingers because he didn't think I'd like much of their other meaty options and when i saw it I was like, what the heck? Why do they even have these pathetic things on the menu? Just frozen and fried is all i can use to descibe them. Obviously not their specialty though so I'll move on. The pulled pork sandwich was ok, but I really think the best pulled pork sandwiches are ones slathered in smoky, tangy, spicy bbq sauce. This wasn't. and it's not the same putting the sauce on after. The best are when the meats cooked in the sauce to fully absorb the juicy bursting falvor. This one wasn't. I will say - their bbq sauce choices were really good so they helped liven up my lame chicken fingers & fries. Won't be coming back.

Tried this place out a couple of days ago and i was very surprised. At first when i walked in i thought it would be another commercialized BBQ place. I personally like the I just stepped into someone's grandma kitchen type of place. The portions were huge and the sides very tasteful. I was not a big fan of the BBQ sauce bar. I prefer my meat to be marinated and dipped in sauce before i get it. Pricing was very good compared to other BBQ places. I would diff. hit this place up again in the future.

4 for superb service. Everyone there was really nice. The guy got my side order wrong but apologized and gave me an extra large plate of the garlic fries. I had the ribs, which were on the dry side but really smoky and quite good. They provide you with a lot of different BBQ sauce so you can easily make it "wetter." For about 10 bucks, I got 2 sides and a 1/4th rack. The mac and cheese was all right, but I've had much better. I really really like their garlic fries because they are SUPER garlicy. Also, it's really clean and I like cleanliness.

2010 7x7 big eats recommended the pulled- port sandwich. so i thought why not give this a try. Came here with a bunch of friends for dinner. This place was small, cozy and clean. The pulled-pork sandwich was kind of dry, not like the reviews i read on yelp. I guess they had a bad day when we went?? luckily, we got extra bbq sauce and it made everything better.

After planning a day in San Francisco specifically to visit Roadside BBQ for their well known pulled pork sandwich, I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed. I really wanted to like this place being a big fan of BBQ. Don't get me wrong, the sweet soft pulled pork, topped with homemade slaw on a ciabatta bread had it's moments, but in my personal opinion not worthy of an out of town drive. The baby back ribs was slowly cooked, juicy and tender. The sides of mac-n-cheese and potato salad were nothing out of the ordinary. If you are in the area, it's worth giving a shot but certainly not a place where YOU HAVE TO GO.

I went to this place the other night and it was O.K. ?I had the pulled pork sandwich that was kinda of soggy on a hamburger bun. ?They could have used some sourdough or French Rolls which would have been much tastier. ?The sauces were decent. ?I didn't really like the Asian BBQ sauce. ?I also thought they needed another cash register to deal with the long line and it was pretty expensive for BBQ.

After two visits I have to say I like the place. Good ribs though not quite "falling off the bone" tender. Good "hot" BBQ sauce. Also the BBQ chicken was tasty and moist. Too bad no wings. The sides I like are the garlic fries (better than the ones at ATT Park), mac n cheese (not too cheesy and from a baked pan), the vegetables (not over-cooked). The coleslaw and potato salad are pretty good too.

OK so I'll qualify myself as somewhat of a BBQ snob. ?Or perhaps a snob in general, or a BBQ-ophile. ?I thought perhaps I'd found a place in the hood that would be worth a visit, but perhaps I'll keep looking. ?The pork rib meat was rather dry and stringy, the sausage flavor was overpowered by the spices, and the chicken was just plain bland. ?And yes, the sauces were lacklustre. ?When one goes looking for sauce to ?make up for bland and dry meat, this is only a further letdown. ?I will give them props for the corn muffin, but unfortunately that one item alone can't drag this rib shack out of the gutter.

Went here today for lunch. I've passed it many times driving on Geary and finally decided to stop by. I've been looking for a good bbq place for awhile and I figured I gotta try as many that I can find. The brisket sandwich was good and I got the sweet potato fries to go along with it. I never had sweet potato fries before so I decided to try them and they weren't too bad, a little over cooked though. The place is a good size and it wasn't too crowded when we showed up at 11:45am, but the lunch crowd did come in while we were there. ?The bbq sauces were ok but I felt they were a little stingy on the sandwich itself. I love bbq sauce so I got more at the condiment bar and loaded up the sandwich. Good overall with a good chance of me going back.

Don't do it. ?Just don't. ? If you're looking for some good BBQ, Roadside is not it. ?Man, I was so disappointed. ?The portions are so small, it just doesn't justify the price. ? But even worse, the bbq does not cut it. ?My ribs were tough, lacked flavor on it's own. ?Good bbq means the meat falls off the bones. ?The meat here was clinging onto the bones for dear life! Corn bread was more like a corn dot. ?The mac and cheese was mediocre. ?While the pulled pork was okay when slathered in sauce, but the beef brisket was dry and tough. I read all the poor reviews, but thought I would try anyway. ?Wish I had listened. ?Decent try, but Roadside just doesn't cut it.

I've been here several times, but I guess I never ordered the right thing. As an avid follower of 7X7's must eat, this time, I ordered the Pulled-Pork Sandwich, AKA: The Memphis Pulled Pork. Little did I know, a BBQ love story was brewing. There's something about pulled pork and coleslaw that made my mouth water to no end. It's like wanting to kiss someone for the very first time. You hesitate, you don't know what to expect, but you know it's going to be GOOD. The sandwich was so juicy, so tender, just right. The perfect first kiss. As in love, there are always obstacles to overcome...Enter: The Bread. Damn! I wish this bread didn't get in the way! I totally could've done without...the bread was almost like a third wheel...maybe in this case, a fourth wheel. There's only so much room in my tummy for the tender pulled pork love and coleslaw. So then, my Asian-ness started thinking...Hmm...this would be good with some rice! But without the bread, it wouldn't be a sandwich. Hmm..to change or not to change? Change. In the end, the sandwich did not defeat me. Yes. The Memphis Pulled Pork didn't know what hit him. I'm even embarrassed to mention that I finished the side of fries...the BBQ sauce trio introduced a spicy sweetness that was unbelievable! Take it for all it's got! Whew! There it went. The empty plate indicated that it was time to toss in the paper towel! Ahh love...You See, You Taste, You Conquer.

I often pass by Roadside BBQ, but never been until my aunt suggested going there for a Friday night dinner. I was the first to arrive at 6:30PM and the restaurant only had 3 customers eating. I have to admit, I have doubts about how good this place can be. Well, we were there, so we might as well give it a try. We ordered a 3-meat combo platter with ?rack of baby back ribs, a ?chicken, some briskets and 3 mini corn bread muffins. The platter also included 3 sides of our choice. We picked a baked beans, cold slaws and mashed potatoes. We also added an order of spicy smoked sausages. Before the food arrived, we pumped several plastic cups of their house made BBQ sauce including 3 mustard tangy sauce, a mild BBQ sauce and a spicy BBQ sauce. Finally the food arrived and by now the place is filled with people standing in line ordering their BBQ dinner. One look at the platter seemed promising so we dove in. Wow! To our surprise, the baby back ribs were smoked to meat tender and meat was falling out of the bones. The brisket was also very juicy and tender. The chicken looked dried, but didn't taste dry at all and had a great BBQ flavor to it. The spicy sausages were spicy and savory. The 3 sides were ok, nothing to brag about. Although the cold slaws were vinegar and not mayo base. The corn bread muffins were tiny, but very moist and have kennels of corns in them. Overall, it was very delicious and we wolfed that down in minutes. Towards the end of our order, we realized that wasn't enough food for 3 people. So we went back to the counter and ordered a second platter. This time, we picked the pull pork, another ?baby back ribs (4 pieces) and some briskets. Our 3 sides the second time around was BBQ corn on the cob, sweet potatoes fries, and we got more corn bread muffins. The pull pork was so juicy and smoky. It was too bad we didn't have some buns to make our own pull pork sandwiches. Of course, our second order was out of greed and now we had too much food so I get to take all those leftover home and eat it the next day. Roadside BBQ leftover was just as tasty the next day. I popped them into the microwave and they still came out juicy and so tasty. All of these food and we walked out of there for less than $20 a piece.

Continuing to crush the 7x7 top 100 list, we stopped into Roadside BBQ for some goodies BBQ. ?Highlights: super good beef ribs, spicy and unique chicken sausage, 5 different sauces, fantastic pecan pie and Shiner Bock beer. ?Lowlights: not huge portions for a $20 triple threat tasting meal (though we had an additional 2x'er to try 5 total meats) and generally maybe a little too well lit and clean. ?I prefer a little grittier BBQ experience but that's nit picking. ?Altogether a great spot that is very close by and will definitely be visiting again!

Really tasty, big delicious portions, mellow setting, friendly service. And big tables to spread out at! Perfect. Really perfect when you have kids and a big stroller. The booths are a great way to sequester my 4 yo so she doesn't go running around the entire restaurant.

Was craving some bbq so i persuaded the bf to check this place out with me. I got the chicken with the mac&cheese and he the brisket with sweet potatoe fries. Chicken wasn't very flavorful by itself, but the sauce helped. The fries were tasty, but the mac&cheese was terrible. Over all it was just ok.

Not the best ribs I've had in my life, but still really good. ?The sauces were above average. ?The place was surpising clean for a BBQ place. ?I'd definitely come back.

Best explained by fellow yelper: 'SOUL LESS'. Isn't that southern BBQ is all about. The warm feeling in your stomach when you can smell the pit and a whole slab of ribs sitting in front you? AT Roadside...ABSENT. The sauce isn't too bad( I doubt they make it., although that is one of the big pride items in any good southern BBQ joint). The sides seem to have a bit of fusion, with the Asian ginger sauce twist to the cole slaw, ?sweet potato fries are right on target. ?This is a no harm caused restaurant, but lacks the character(in the food) needed.

I think the BBQ here is quite good. Excellent smokey flavor, good texture. The chicken was a bit dry, but other than that the meat was on point. The only issues I had was with the sides which were lack luster and the atmosphere was not enticing at all. You best bet it is get take-out from this spot. I recommend it for that.

UGH!!!!!!!!!! Worst BBQ I have ever had in my life. I want my $15 back. ?My lord, it takes EFFORT to make food taste this bad. The brisquet tasted like deli sliced roast beef that had some smoke flavoring added, the chicken was bone dry, the red beans tasted like wall paper paste, the cold slaw was just BAD (it was more some sort of ?wierd cabbage salad, than slaw) The mac and cheese was so-so, and the pork ribs were just ok. And the BBQ SAUCE was AWFUL. It tasted exactly like someone took PIZZA sauce and added little tiny bit of smoke flavor. It tasted mostly of tomato and oregano. WTF? I was in awe of how bad this was. It was exactly like someone from some other country decided to open up an American BBQ but didn't even bother to try some authentic BBQ first. It sure looks like BBQ, but it is just stage food, literally. This was just awful. There's no excellent BBQ in the bay area (memphis minnies is about as good as you are going to get and it is just ok). But this is just bad bad bad. If you got to have BBQ, keep driving another couple miles to Memphis Minnies. Sorry that's the only choice you really have.

Had a quick bite to eat here today and I came in with no expectations. It wasnt too bad. the sauces were flavorful and well made and they used a nice bun for the sandwich. The meat wasnt the best but not bad for not expecting much. I would come back to eat again and try something different. I had the Brisket sandwich. It was messy as BBQ should be. I also had ?a side of sweet potato fries. I felt that they were too thin and kinda over cooked. it was OK.

I've only been here once so I don't feel I can give them over 3 stars just yet. ?I had the ribs and brisket both were delicious. ?One of my ribs was way overcooked (not the right kind of burnt end if you know what I mean) but they replaced it happily without question. ?What I liked best was that they had an array of "help-yourself" bbq sauces that were diverse in texture and flavor including a triple mustard concoction and an asian inspired one. ?The fries were cooked well and the corn muffin was just so-so, nothing to write home about. ?I'd go back and try the pulled pork next time, perhaps on a sandwich as the portion looked pretty hefty. ?The feel of the place was clean and simple, I appreciated most the friendly staff, sauce bar, adequate recyled paper towels tableside and wrapped wet naps to boot.

I tried this place because it was part of the 2010 7x7. Overall, I would say its decent BBQ. I ordered the pulled-pork sandwich and my friend got the Mr. Brisket. I think this place has the capacity to be awesome, but it was just decent when I went. I think mostly I wasn't that impressed because my sandwich didn't have that much meat. I feel like they skimped on pulled pork (and even more so on the brisket on the other sandwich). If they dumped in a little more meat, the sandwich would be great. I got a side of mashed potatoes, which were delicious. Much better with gravy! Also, they have 3 different types of bbq sauce. I liked the original the most, with the spicy bbq coming in second, and the asian ginger one rounding it out (i like straight bbq sauce....I think other people who are more adventurous would like the asian ginger one). Overall, it's not life-changing bbq. It's yummy but I've had better. Also major downer, no TVs. The giants game was on and I couldn't watch it :(

Keep in mind, I don't eat red meat, but the veggie baked potato I got was outta this world good (and they use a medley of vegetables, not just the standard broccoli). The sweet corn is amazing! I also took a bite of my husband's chicken sandwich and was highly impressed.

Finally! A BBQ joint OTHER than Memphis Minnie's to consider when wanting some smokey meat action. I'm not a fan of Memphis Minnie's whatsoever, so Roadside was heaven! The meat didn't taste cheap and stringy, but actually juicy and smokey and flavorful. The corn bread? MOIST! Such a rarity these days I'd say. My girlfriend and I went for the first time and ordered the 'Q for 2' where you can choose 4 meats and 3 sides for $22? $25? Either way it's a sweet deal, you basically create your own sampler platter and the best part is: there's enough food for left overs! Being full and still having enough for lunch the next day is my measure of a successful dine-out situation (especially during these economic times). All in all, Roadside isn't the best i've had in my life, but it is definitely worth it, ESPECIALLY since Memphis Minnie's somehow keeps being voted as 'Best of the Bay' (and I think all those die hards are out of their minds and probably live off of canned food) ? OOOO!! And shout outs to the manager Jason? from Texas who made sure we had an amazing experience. Yum!!!!!!!

I was really hoping for the best with this restaurant, as I live in the neighborhood and am a big fan of good BBQ. Unfortunately, this did not meet any standard I was shooting for. The ribs were a little dry, and the brisket was waaay too fatty. There were a few choices of bbq sauces, and those were not bad - but I think anything would have added flavor to the meat. The sweet potato fries and mac and cheese were ok, but who goes to a bbq place for the sides, right?

So here's the thing: the macaroni and cheese at Roadside is super good. And the sweet potato fries, delish! But the ribs, the barbequed ribs, the thing any self-respecting meat lover goes to a BBQ joint for--well, they kinda sucked. They were dry to the point of crunchy, a little like sawdust held together with elmer's glue. And you'd expect at least one of the many flavor's of sauce to set your tongue all watery and drippy. But no. All a little sour, none with the sweet tang we all love on our ribs. So there's that. The staff there was nice, and gave us extra food when they messed up our order. But the ribs--sigh--the ribs. Oh, and too be fair, I haven't tried the chicken, cuz it's pretty damn hard to mess up chicken, so I figured it wouldn't be an adequate indicator of the spot. But the ribs--oh the horror, the horror.

This is probably the closest thing you can get to authentic Southern BBQ in the city. The pulled pork with garlic fries has to be my favorite. Also the corn muffins are to die for! I admit some of the sides aren't very good such as the mac n' cheese and cole slaw so I would stay away from those.

I knew--KNEW!--before I even logged on here that Roadside BBQ would have a middlin' rating on Yelp. It's just too clean, unspectacularly tasty and reliable, and not "authentic" enough. Well, no, it's not "authentic"--if you live in a shotgun shack in Mississippi. Most SF Yelpers wouldn't deign to sniff the rural south or a Kansas City pit--hell, they don't even want to go to Bayview-Hunter's Point!--so any cries regarding lack of "authenticity" ring pretty false to me here. If you live in Texas, or the Southeast, or Missouri, or Chicago, you probably have many better options. On Geary, hell, in San Francisco, you're not gonna do much better (I like Memphis Minnie's about the same). As far as the food goes, I have never been disappointed. You'll notice most complaints about the meat are very dissimilar--too much sauce, not enough sauce, too much slaw, not enough, etc. It's personal preference, but I can say that my meals here have always been above just "solid," if not completely transcendent. (For the record, I wish they'd put no sauce on the brisket or pulled pork; the meat stands on its own--mine's never been dry, personally, and just the right amount of smoke--and they have a nice selection of sauce and vinegar along the back wall, including the very-SF Asian Ginger.) Some people have taken issue with the sides, but I'm a big fan of the snap-fresh and tangy cole slaw as well as the nicely smoked baked red beans. What I really like about the place (beyond the food and good selection of Shiner brews) is that I can come here, to a meat-centric place, with my vegetarian wife and she'll be not only tolerant but happy. They do a very good grilled veggie plate here (really fresh) and some nice potatoes. That's appreciated. By the way: really friendly service (usually), clean digs. Pretty affordable, too: I have no idea how two people can spend $48 here, like someone else mentioned. I always feel like I got my money's worth. I really like coming here. It stands on its own for what it is. ?Four stars.

My husband and I stopped here for lunch while visiting San Fran. YUMMM! We live in Charlotte NC, and know good BBQ...and this is it! We had the ribs and pulled pork. Great prices, accommodating employees, and delicious food. I wish they had a location where I live! :)

I had ?the pulled chicken which was GREAT! My boyfriend had the chicken sausage with the bellpeppers and melted chesse ...One word AWESOME! I also had the sweet potato fries, and he had the garlic. Let's just say, we will be making a trip down there everytime we come to the city. The cashier was very friendly and the cook was friendly as well. All I have to say is when you come to the city, make sure you stop by Roadside BBQ, and don't listen to those haters (:

Great customer service, which led me to write the review. Very clean restaurant for a BBQ joint. Amazing bathroom :) Got a great dinner deal for 2 for about $30 that included 3 meats and 4 sides of our choice. Food wise, i've had better, defiantly room for improvement. But the service was so good, i'd probably go back anyway.

I had been wanting to try this place since I never really had a bad experience at a bbq joint. I had the brisket and a little bit of the pull pork sandwich. Both items were dry. My beef brisket was barely luke warm. The mac and cheese was bad, bland and not cheesy. I spent the majority of my time there regretting my visit and thinking about what I'm going to eat after I leave the place. Needless to say, I did not finish my plate.

I came here with 2 others and split a combo plate and the guy brought over an extra corn muffin because he saw there was three of us and didn't want one of us to miss out.

The rib portions are ok. The sides are tastey, the staff is always friendly and the food doesn't take very long once you order. I love the sweet potatoe fries and the garlic fries very much. My boss usually goes for the pulled pork sandwich, my sister finds the 1/4 rack of ribs to be lacking as far as portions go so she get's the 1/2 rack instead but doesn't finish. I usually am good with the 1/4 rack but it will usually take me one more rib than it ?comes with in order for me to be fully satisfied. The place is clean and I like to sit there, eat, and enjoy my food when possible instead of getting it to go.

Went there with kid last night and ordered Chicken and Beef Ribs. Both were delicious, the tiny corn muffin was soft and moist and tasty although i've had better. The two beef ribs were perfect I agree with the reviewer below, I hate "fall of the bones" meat. ?this came off easily but you had to use your teeth ?perfect yum. ?Chicken was rather ordinary but good/ ?What else I like about this place is that you can order veggies which were delicious, nice mixture and grilled not boiled corn and of course their sauces.

Should I be concerned that my nearby BBQ joint has gotten to know me by name and order? Is that a sign that I need to lay off the Smoked Chicken Sandwiches and Sweet Potato Fries? I say NO! I say it's a sign that Roadside BBQ is delicious. And also a sign that their staff is friendly and competent. My sandwiches are always delicious. I always have a hard time deciding on which side to get...they're all so good! You can't go wrong with their sweet potato fries or corn muffins, though. When I'm feeling all healthy-like, I also like to order their side salads or steamed vegetables which are always fresh and tasty. Prices are a little high but I always leave full and satisfied.

If I could give this place zero stars I would. The pig on a skateboard wearing glasses should have tipped me off, but no--I was feeling hopeful. But I don't blame myself, no, I have ?others to blame. Fellow yelpers, when did it become okay to cook meat without seasonings? Hmmm? After reading a bunch of good/great reviews on this restaurant, I overlooked the roller pig and invited my friend from Alabama to partake in what was supposed to be good eatin'. Wrong move. We were excited until we got our food and discovered, "there's no barbecue sauce on the meat!" Okay, whatever, we'll pump room temperature barbecue sauce onto meat straight off the grill. Sure, why not? And if that weren't bad enough, there was something else missing...flavor. They straight up handed us meat--unseasoned meat. Who does that? Am I crazy? Is that how folks do it these days? Even the mac and cheese needed salt. I found myself back at the damn barbecue pump, wearing my arm out trying to add flavor to my grilled plate of meh. But the worst part was looking into the disappointed/disgusted eyes of my southern friend. He knew what good bbq was and he knew that this was far from it. And as I left, angry,disappointed, and quite frankly ashamed, I stared at the one brotha' back there in the kitchen. I wanted to pull him to the side and say, "now, you know you cook with seasonings at home. I know you know better." But instead, I signed up for yelp and let ya'll hear about it.

I like the chicken sandwiches. The mashed potatoes are nothing special but they are worth the price. A lot of sides like mac n cheese, regular fries, garlic fries, potato salad, cole slaw etc. I would not go out of the way to eat here but it is close and convenient. They can get very busy for lunch and dinner.... might want to phone in an order. Overall, nothing special but its not a bad place.

Overall 3.5... The key to judging good barbeque is to eat it without sauce, that way you're able to taste all of the natural juices and smoky flavors. Lucky for this place because their sauce sucks-all of them! The beef brisket is usually very good. Its tender, juicy and has that pink smoky ring around the edges that only comes with true smoking. The baby back ribs are good, but the portions are small for the price. Garlic fries...how can you go wrong with that one? The banana cream pie is screamin! ? If you like smoked chicken, get a half or a whole one; they do it right. Don't mess around wth that smoked boneless breast crap. The apple chicken links (or whatever they are) are okay, but if you want chicken links you just don't know barbeque. It's not the best place around, but the BBQ is really smoked, not parboiled like some of the others do. They know how to slice the beef right so that is is tender (unlike Big Nates). I've been many times and the service is alway very good.

"now THAT's some good barbecue," proclaims the princess as she licks her fingers, face smeared with sauce. she's hardly a connoisseur but she does have pretty good taste and i have to agree with her on this one! hubby discovered this joint during his clinical rotations at kaiser's french campus. ?after raving about it for so long, he finally picked up some grub to go so the whole family could enjoy. ?what a treat! ?for $42.95 (+tax), he grabbed the "family pack II" (serves 4-6), which consists of 2 full orders of meat, 4 pints of sides, & 4 corn muffins. ?our choices were: - brisket: so tender, no knife needed to cut it. i didn't find the pink smoke ring but it was still good. ?drizzled w/ the regular bbq sauce, it was even tastier dipped in the spicy sauce, with a tangy vinegary kick and a slow creeping burn. - baby back ribs: fall of the bone tender and moist, coated in just enough sauce that still let the sweet smoky meat flavor shine. - corn on the cob: i love grilled corn! - corn mini muffins - such a small portion, i wish they were bigger b/c they're super moist and tasty, not the usual dry crumbly version, and with real bits of corn! - mac & cheese - super cheesy and creamy rich, with a crisp topping (of crumbled corn muffins?) - sweet potato fries - more soggy than crispy but still nicely flavored, a balance of savory/sweet - mashed potatoes w/ gravy - nothing special here, almost like instant potato buds, and the gravy was strangely sweet...but i still had a second helping =P despite stuffing ourselves (and leaving behind only a couple slices of brisket, three ribs and scant spoonfuls of sides), we still saved room for dessert. ?as if my hubby needed any more convincing, this was probably what sold him - coconut banana cream pie in a chocolate coated crust. ?as if his two favorite pies had a love child! ?i'm not a big fan of coconut and it does seem to overpower the banana flavor a bit until you bite into a big chunk of fruit...the crust is perfectly flaky and just a tad salty, which cuts into the sweetness nicely. ?and the chocolate keeps the crust from getting soggy! ?even the princess managed to get a bit of whipped cream on her nose...(clearly, the messier meal the better!) even though it's out of the way for the hubby now, he'll still make the trek for some 'cue!

Weaving and meandering though San Fran was a daunting task on a ?Saturday evening. ?But after a long drive the last thing I wanted to do was wait in a long line for some grub. ?Thank god the Roadside BBQ wasn't that much of a wait. ?My first impression was, "oh god another BBQ joint." ?This wasn't the case though. ?Every BBQ place I've ever been to hasn't lived up to what it's portrayed. ?Since I had no preconceived notations the Roadside BBQ hit the spot. ?The menu is reasonably priced for a normal consumer. ?I was fairly surprised that even though it was heaving with people inside the staff was still able to keep up with clearing and cleaning the tables. ?The thing I really loved was the assortment of sauces and carrots/jalapenos this place was offering. ?After about a 4-5 minute wait our food was ready. ?I ate it all! ?The only thing they got wrong was that I ordered baked beans instead of macaroni and cheese. ?But hey, I was hitting the town soon after which would of been a disaster if i would of consumed those baked beans... if you know what I mean. ; )

I know BBQ, because I'm a pit master myself. I had the 4 meats ; Baby Backs, Beef Ribs, Brisket and Pull Pork. There was NOT ONE DROP OF TRUE SMOKE ANYWHERE IN ALL THE MEAT. Not one speck of brick redness to be found. 5 hours they said, more like not even one minute. My ribs were cooked in an oven, not a smoker. Meat in a true smoker will start turning brick red after 1 hour. White Baby Back meat is not smoked meat. So all in all STOP THE LYING. The coconut banana cream pie was okay which gives it the second star.

After a long day of work yesterday, my homie took me here for some grub. I hadn't eaten all day so when he mentioned BBQ I got happy. Honestly, I was thinkin' of doing the rib thang but my money was funny and payday ain't till next week so I settled for a cheaper, healthier alternative, which wasn't bad at all. My homie put it in my ear that all the sammiches are on hit! I looked at him and said, "For real?!" I ain't tryna get some ole halfway eats so I took that advice. I got me a Smoked Free-Range Chicken sammich with a side of mac n cheese and an extra side of garlic fries (I told you I didn't eat all day!). The little condiment bar got some sauces fo dat ass! Since it was a hotass day in SF, I wasn't tryna get all sweaty eatin' some goodass BBQ so I didn't even f*ck wit the hot BBQ sauce. I went with the regular stuff and poured some in my sammich. SOFA KING good! My homie ordered the Spicy Chicken Sausage platter and he broke me off half a link. That sh*t was hella good! I told him I need to order that next time we come back. The joint was nice, all wood interior looking straight-up like a BBQ joint. The clientele was good mix of folks young and old, I'm assuming mostly from the neighborhood. We sat next to the window and the eye-candy was poppin'! Clean bathrooms and good service! I'm definitely coming back.

Everytime I zoom down Geary Blvd. I see this place and say I gotta go soon. I've gone and now I'm hooked. They have a nice selection of meats and went with everyone's recommendation on the brisket with mac n chesse and sweet potato fries. The brisket was tender and very smoky. I like the fact they put just a touch of bbq sauce and the you get your own sauce to slatter to your liking. Their house sauce and mustard sauce is great but avoid the asian one. The hot Louisiana vinegar was great on the fries. Mac n chesse just okay but the sweet potato fries yummy! ?My husband got the 1/2 rib rack, beans, and cole slaw. He said thumbs up. The portions are great and leftovers to boot! I've been looking for a better rib joint since Memphis Minnie's portions are kinda small and kinda expensive for what it is. This place is clean with nice rib joint touches. Will be back for the snasages next time...

Good brisket if a tad tough, moist pulled pork. Very sloooooooow service to stand in line at the counter. Corn muffins where great; full corn meal, not too much wheat, not sweetened. Coleslaw is vinegar based, much tastier than mayo sludge, and plenty of color. Lot of sauces to choose from, all a tad sweet but the hot one is my fave. A lot of choices as to what you can order. Some BBQ places corner you, and that makes it hard to take non ?BBQ fans but there are plenty of options here. The line was very long when we walked in but getting a table didn't look like you had to fight too hard, though we got take out. Overall, not like the south but satisfying and not greasy like some "southern" approximations.

A straight up review. (I'm trying to keep my reviews short) Pro: Good portions Con: Not that great. ?First I would like to apologize to those who love this place. ?The food took a while to get to us. ?Not unexpected considering we ordered a dish that had four different meats. ?But I was surprised when the food came to us just slightly warmer than warm. ?I like my BBQ hot. ?Plus, since it was so cool, it cooled down quickly and we were left with room temperature meat. ? But before the meat got that cool, I was able to sample each of the meats. ?Even at its warmest, the meat was pretty dry. ?Even the brisket which has ?a huge vein of fat running alongside the actual meat! ? How do you have dry meat with that much fat? ?(I'm not knocking the fat). ?The quality of the food made me think our plate was pre-made and nuked in a microwave. The sides: ?You could tell they added flour to the macaroni and cheese. ?Especially at the cooler temperatures, this made it gristly. ?The sweet potato fries were good...because they covered them with sugar. ?Although some might like that, I consider it cheating. Maybe they were having an off day, but in my book, a restaurant that can deviate that far from what I read in others' reviews isn't considered good. ?Consistency people. ?Especially during a recession when customers are dipping into their dwindling funds to patronage your business. One last thing. ?The BBQ sauce was good, but stay away from the "Asian" sauce. ?What were they thinking?!

Over the weekend, my friends and I were toiling over what to eat. They suggested this place. I've never tried but have always wanted to. The decor was nice western/BBQ style. I ordered the Memphis Pulled Pork Platter which came with two sides. I chose garlic fries and sweet ?potato fries. It was a bit weird that we waited a bit for the food even though we and this other person were the only people in the restaurant. When the food came i was a little bit disappointed. One would think that for $12.95 that I would get more food, but the platter was of regular size and a little less than half was covered with the pull pork and the other was with the garlic fries and sweet potato fries. Hungry as I was I dug right in. The pulled pork had some BBQ sauce on it. I took a bite and was once again more disappointed. The pork was very dry even though there was much juice. The pork was very bland and the only flavor was from the sauce. I've had BBQ food before and this was the most disappointing. I would like to see that the pulled pork had more flavor and that the BBQ sauce the main source of flavor. The garlic fries was YUMMO but the sweet potato fries could be better. When talking to my buddy, he agreed that they have their hit or miss. This time it was a miss. On the upside we also had their smoke buffalo wings, which was actually pretty good. The smoke flavor was well cooked into the wings. Will i try this place again? Hard to say, but if they miss again, I'd surely not be returning. Give them a try and update me. I'm always down for a second try.

I hadn't eaten all day (bad, I know), so the "BBQ" sign at Roadside BBQ lured me in as we drove down Geary after running an errand. I generally LOVE BBQ and rarely find it in the Bay Area. I've found that it's not so much where you eat BBQ but rather WHO is cooking it and where they're from. Preferably, they should be from below the Mason Dixon line. I have no idea where the proprietors of Roadside are from, but I get the feeling they're trying to do some kind of cookie cutter chain approach to BBQ. Anyhow, when I get really hungry, I get totally irrational and lose all ability to decide what I want to eat. So, Roadside BBQ was a welcome find given my state of mind; and it did hit the spot. Overall, the place is average bbq fare. I'd like to give 3 1/2 stars, but bc the place was basically clean, the service good and I didn't get sick, I'll give them 4 stars. The ribs were pretty good and the variety of "get your own" sauces was a nice touch. The sides I picked (sweet potato fries and coleslaw) were nothing special. ?The cornbread was exceptionally good, which is really random. The price was about 13 bucks for half rack ribs, 2 sides and a cornbread. I can't think of anything else to say bc it was really just very average. Not bad average. Just average.

This place is pretty fucking good. ?I've only eaten there twice but I was more than satisfied both times. ?I've read some of the negetive reviews below and most of them are just wrong. ?The meat was moist, lean enough, flavorfull, and served in huge portions. ?The roadside veggies side is a great selections of vegetables seasoned just right, but was undercooked both times I ordered it. ?The sauces were excellent. ?The prices are a great value compared with the large amount of excellent slow cooked meat you receive. ?I will continue to eat here frequently.

All I can say is I had a big grin on my face during the 2 minutes I spent devouring my amazing meal. ?I like minnies too, but this place has far better meat, sauce, and cornbread.

We wound up at this place by accident and couldn't resist the look of the steet potatoe fires. ?The meat was delicious and tender and the sides were beyond belief (do not fail to order the mac and cheese or the sweet potatoe fries). ? ?What bumps this place up to 5 star status is the service. ?The waiter/cashier was freindly, let us sample sides before our choices were made and was patient through all of our indecisions.

Okay here I go again. ?I have had great barbecue. ?San Francisco back in the day had the best barbecue. ?Way back in the day there was Leonard's and Virginias Hickory Pit in the Fillmore. ?There was Vic and Betty's and even Do City Barbecue. ? But to get to the matter at hand what type of barbecue has no sauce. ?This place has sauce in little pump containers like the ones you get the pickles and mustard and stuff for a hot dog at Costco. ? That just aint right. ?Barbecue is a combination of great meat and sauce. ?If you don't have both it just won't work. ?I swear if someone, somebody could open a real pit in San Francisco they could rack up. ?The sides were okay but not great. ?The cornmeal muffin was awful. ?The muffin was heavy and tasted strange. ?These present barbecue fakeries are okay I guess if you have never had the real thing. ? I read about this place in a magazine at my doctor's office. ?They gave it a pretty good rating. ?There is absolutely no accounting for taste. ? I don't think most bay area folks have had real barbecue. ?In a real barbecue joint you get succulent meat with mouth watering sauce. You get a combination of side dishes, potato salad, baked beans, spaghetti, macaroni and cheese and sometimes greens. ?I will not go out of my way to go to this place again, even if I was in the neighborhood and passing by I would not stop even if there was parking right out front.

I was pleased, mostly, with our first experience with Roadside BBQ. ?My wife and shared "The Big Guy" plate which is an assortment of 3 meats, 2 sides, and a corn muffin. We got the ribs, the brisket, and the pulled pork. ?All of the meat was very tasty. ?Each had a nice smoky taste that didn't require sauce to make it delicious. ?The brisket did have a bit of fat on the top, but it was easily isolated and discarded. ?As a trade-off, the brisket is incredibly tender and (once trimmed) lean. ?All of the sauces were very good, though I felt their hot bbq sauce could have more flavor. ?We liked the mustard sauce. My one complaint was the portion size. ?In the end, I felt "The Big Guy" was a little short on quantity compared to the price. ?Especially when compared to the size of the individual platters I was seeing. ?This might have been a fluke given the extremely chaotic environment in there (it was Father's Day, after all). ?I'm more than willing to give them another try, and will update my review.

After having lived in NC for the past couple of years I was excited to try a BBQ place here in SF. ?I was grossly disappointed. ?The pulled pork wasn't well flavored or cooked, the chicken sausage was watery, the beef brisket was much too dry, and the ribs were nothing special. ?My initial reaction was one star but i thought the sweet potato fries were pretty good, about the only thing that was. ?Oh, the large water cups were nice too. ?I guess it's unfair to compare to the South but it would've been nice.

The pork ribs (true test of any BBQ place) were just passable. ?The pulled pork sandwich is good, though. ?Good enough for me to think about that distinctive sandwich on many random occasions. ?That vinegary cole slaw and pulled pork between a bun just tastes so good! ?But the ribs are "meh."

Ribs were dry and too smoky. Sides were good. Too pricey for my tastes

If you are looking for bone dry, small portions and very pricey BBQ, then Roadside BBQ is for you. ?It was shocking how small the portions were for the price and the fact that the food was not even worthy of mention, it staggers the imagination that this place is still in business. ?Finally, I have to mention that the person at the counter helping customers could not have been ruder and more unhelpful if he tried. ? ?STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PIT.

I tried finding a blog for their newest location in San Rafael's Northgate but couldnt - so I am writing on this. The Roadside BBQ places can't compare with some of the ones in the East Bay or other parts of the City like the bayview, filmore, or western addition. This Roadside recently opened a location in San Rafael (Marin County). I guess you figure because we live here in Marin, we'll pay high prices for low quality goods. READ ON...I have never mind paying for good food but this place is too expensive for what you get. I read one comment about the 1 bite size corn muffin and that's almost embarassing but true. They should just give you slice bread instead. There cooking style is pre-cooked BBQ, sure it might have been cooking for 8 to 12 hours like they say but, the problem is it's been pre-cooked a few hours before and has cooled down so when you order, they pull the rack slice off what you ordered and put it back on the grille,(to heat up) this makes the meat tough especially the Hot links (as a result over cooked), Nothing worst than over cooked sausage. Today, I bought the Two-Way Combo two over cooked hot links and a baby back (4) ribs dryed out. Also included cole slaw which was not the best and sweet-potato fries and of course that dinky corn muffin. All for $16.37 with tax. This is my second visit with same results. The first time I eat hear I thought "well the susage is over cooked" maybe just because I got here late. But, now after my second visit its clear that they have convince themselves that this is the way they are suppose to be cooked and eaten. Needless to say, I will not be going back. I hope that who ever is in charge of the place really takes time to read these comments and make real changes. It's a real shame because Marin could use a good BBQ joint- very disappointed that they still do not have one. If there are any serious down home country "Brothers or Sisters" out there that want to make some serious "doe rae me ale gatoes" which is $$$$ for those who don't know. Bring your BBQ cooking ass to Marin County cause we can sure use some good old soul food.
